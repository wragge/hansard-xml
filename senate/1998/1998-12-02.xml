This commitment was made in light of the extensive merits review rights in the migration legislation and concerns about the growing cost and incidence of migration litigation and the associated delays in removal of non-citizens with no right to remain in Australia.</para><para>On 3 September 1997, we introduced this billâthen called the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1997âinto the House of Representatives. It was passed by that House on 23 September 1997 and introduced into the Senate on 29 September 1997. The Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee conducted a detailed examination of the bill and in its report of 30 
 October 1997, the majority of the committee recommended that the bill be passed without amendment. The bill was awaiting debate by the Senate when Parliament was prorogued in August.</para><para>The bill introduces a new judicial review scheme to cover decisions under the Migration Act relating to the ability of non-citizens to enter and remain in Australia. The key mechanism in the new scheme is the privative clause provision at new section 474.</para><para>The privative clause, and the related provisions, will replace the existing judicial review scheme at Part 8 of the Migration Act. Unlike the existing scheme, the new judicial review scheme will also apply to the High Court and not just the Federal Court.</para><para>The privative clause does not mean that access to the courts is denied, nor that only the High Court can hear migration matters. Both the Federal Court and the High Court can hear migration matters, but the grounds of judicial review before either court have been limited.</para><para>One need only look at the history of the existing judicial review scheme and how it is operating today to see what would happen in the future if it were left untouched.</para><para>The current judicial review scheme for visa decisions was introduced by the last Labor government through the Migration Reform Act 1992 and commenced on 1 September 1994. It was part of a package of changes, building on an existing scheme where the attributes that a non-citizen needs to be granted a visa are set out in detail in the migration legislation. The changes included:</para><para>expanded access to merits review;</para><para>a requirement that any review rights must be exhausted prior to seeking judicial review;</para><para>statutory codes of procedure for visa decision-making; and</para><para>some restriction of the grounds of judicial review in light of the access to merits review and statutory codes for visa decision-making.</para><para>The Labor government intended those changes to reduce Federal Court litigation and to provide greater certainty as to what was required from both decision-makers, visa applicants and visa holders.</para><para>That scheme has not reduced the volume of cases before the courts: just the opposite. Recourse to the Federal Court and the High Court is trending upwards, with nearly 400 applications in 1994-95; nearly 600 in 1995-96; 740 in 1996-97; nearly 800 in 1997-98; and in 1998-99 as at the 25 November, 435 applications. In addition, the Federal Court has re-interpreted the existing scheme's modest restrictions on judicial review to bring back the grounds of review that the Parliament specifically excluded in passing the Migration Reform Act in 1992. The government has been forced to appeal one particu 
 lar case to the High Court to get that Court's ruling on the Federal Court's interpretation.</para><para>Based on current litigation trends it is anticipated that applications made to the courts could be more than 1000 for 1998-99. That is unacceptable given the extensive merits review rights in the migration legislation and the cost of that amount of litigation which is ultimately borne by the Australian taxpayer.</para><para>This trend is despite full and open access by applicants to heavily subsidised independent merits review by the Immigration Review Tribunal and the Refugee Review Tribunal.</para><para>From experience we know that a substantial proportion of these cases will be withdrawn by the applicants prior to hearing. The percentage of applicants who withdraw fluctuates between 33% to 50%. Of the cases that go on to substantive court hearings the merits based decision is currently upheld in around 86% of cases.</para><para>The government is concerned about the financial burden that such levels of litigation place on the public purse. In the 1997-98 financial year all litigation cost my Department nearly nine and a half million dollarsâand this figure does not include the cost of running the courts.</para><para>This high level of litigation, particularly by twice refused asylum claimants, cannot remain unchecked. Increased litigation leads to increased costs and delays, and, for those in detention, to a significantly longer period of detention.</para><para>It is hard not to conclude that there is a substantial number who are using the legal process primarily in order to extend their stay in Australia, especially given that one third to one half of all applicants withdraw from legal proceedings before hearing.</para><para>In the migration area litigation can be an end in itselfâit is probably the only area of administrative law where delaying the final determination is seen as beneficial by those pursuing the court action. Given the importance attached to permanent residence in Australia, there is a high incentive for refused applicants to delay removal from Australia for as long as possible. This may be done to give time for them to establish ties within the community which they may hope will yield entitlement to a visa through another pathway.</para><para>The incentive to delay removal from Australia is increased if the refused applicants are enjoying privileges such as work rights and access to Medicare. Before the last election, the government changed the Migration Regulations to generally deny work rights to unlawful non-citizens applying for protection visas after being in Australia for more than 45 days, and at the same time thereby preventing such persons from access to Medicare. However, while that is a worthwhile measure, it does not deal with the problem I have outlined. 
</para><para>Faced with the problem I have outlined, Minister Ruddock asked the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs in early 1996 to explore options for best achieving the government's policy objective of restricting access to judicial review. This was done in conjunction with the Attorney-General's Department, the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet and eminent legal counsel.</para><para>The advice received from legal counsel was that the only workable option was a privative clause.</para><para>As Senators are aware, section 75 of the Commonwealth Constitution gives the High Court original jurisdiction to consider challenges to the actions and decisions of Commonwealth officers. As a result access to the High Court cannot be legislatively restricted without a constitutional amendment.</para><para>However, access to the Federal Court, and the scope of judicial review it can exercise, can be changed by legislation. To simply restrict access to the Federal Court in migration legislation matters, would in practice deflect many cases to the High Court under section 75 of the Constitution. This has the potential to erode the proper role and purpose of the High Court.</para><para>Counsels' advice was that a privative clause would have the effect of narrowing the scope of judicial review by the High Court, and of course the Federal Court. That advice was largely based on the High Court's own interpretation of such clauses in cases such as Hickman's case, as long ago as 1945, and more recently in the Richard Walter case in 1995.</para><para>Some members of the High Court confirmed the interpretation of what is often called the Hickman principle in the Darling Casino case in April last year.</para><para>Senators may be aware that the effect of a privative clause such as that used in Hickman's case is to expand the legal validity of the acts done and the decisions made by decision-makers. The result is to give decision-makers wider lawful operation for their decisions and this means that the grounds on which those decisions can be challenged in the Federal and High Courts are narrower than currently.</para><para>In practice, the decision is lawful provided the decision-maker:</para><para>is acting in good faith;</para><para>had been given the authority to make the decision concerned (for example, had the authority delegated to him or her by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, or had been properly appointed as a tribunal member); and</para><para>did not exceed constitutional limits. 
</para><para>The options available to the government were very much shaped by the Constitution. While the government accepts that the precise limits of privative clauses may need examination by the High Court, there is no other practical option open to the government to achieve its policy objective.</para><para>It was suggested to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee that the introduction of a leave requirement would achieve the government's policy objective of restricting judicial review to `exceptional circumstances'. In the government's view, that is not a viable option. While it is possible to impose a leave requirement on the Federal Court, it is not constitutionally possible to do so with the High Court and would leave that Court exposed to applicants going straight to the High Court in order to avoid any leave requirement imposed on the Federal Court. In any event, the imposition of a leave requirement could increase the complexity of the litigation and cause consequential delay and cost, and may in practice even double the number of hearings before the Federal Court. That would exacerbate those problems which the government is aiming to rectify.</para><para>To complement the introduction of the privative clause, this bill introduces a number of important technical measures such as time limits in which to apply, and who can apply for review, as well as the type of decision affected by the new scheme. These measures are designed to ensure certainty and efficiency in resolving outstanding issues.</para><para>Although the measures in this bill will limit judicial review, many applicants who consider that they have received a decision from the Department which is wrong, will of course still have access to independent merits review by the Immigration Review Tribunal, its successor the Migration Review Tribunal, and the Refugee Review Tribunal. It is the government's intention that all bona fide applicants meeting the criteria for the grant of a particular visa be granted that visa. The independent merits review tribunals act as a safeguard in that respect.</para><para>As an additional safeguard, under the Migration Act the Minister has special public interest powers enabling the Minister to grant a visa even there the non-citizen does not meet the prescribed criteria for the grant of that visa set out in the Migration Regulations.</para><para>I commend the bill to the Senate.</para><para>Ordered that further consideration of the second reading of this bill be adjourned till fourteen days after today, in accordance with standing order 111.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>BUSINESS</title><type>Business</type><page.no>1027</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Days and Hours of Meeting</title><page.no>1027</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Patterson</inline>, at the request of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ian Campbell</inline>) agreed to:</para><para>That the Senate shall meet on Tuesday, 8 December 1998, from 2.30 p.m. till 8 p.m.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Consideration of Legislation</title><page.no>1027</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Patterson</inline>, at the request of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ian Campbell</inline>) agreed to:</para><para>That the provision of paragraphs (5) to (7) of standing order 111 not apply to the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Resolution of Complaints) Bill 1998 allowing it to be considered during this period of sittings.</para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION MEASURES (IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 1998</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>1027</page.no><id.no>s190</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>1027</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 25 November, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ian Campbell</inline>:</para><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>1027</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI start by saying that this bill is not an insignificant one. It is a bill which sets up a regulatory mechanism for Australia's biggest properly holder, developer and consumer, and that is, of course, the Commonwealth government and its agencies. Essentially, this bill is about how one handles the state regimes, rules, regulations and legislation in respect of the coverage of the Commonwealth and its operations. We are particularly talking about environment protection legislation.</para></talk.start><para>The objective that the government seeks to attain here is the objective that we sought to attain with this legislation when we were in government before 1996. That was to achieve national conformity and national uniformity in application of state rules and regulations. It is interesting to note at this particular juncture that what the Commonwealth seeks to do here for its agencies is something that it is not seeking to do with other environmental legislation which will soon be before this chamber. It is not demanding of that legislation with respect to the corporate sector the same degree of national uniformity. The environment protection impact legislation is 
 legislation that will be before us very soon and is legislation which in effect devolves national responsibility in many respects to the states.</para><para>It is okay for the Commonwealth as a major player to demand and to require national uniformity but, for some particular reason that is unknown, I think, to a major part of the corporate community, that degree of national uniformity is something that this government is not seeking in respect of other environmental legislation. So the question we have before us today essentially is not that we achieve uniformity but that we achieve adequacy of regulations and legislation in protection of the environment. There is a history to this legislation. The genesis of this legislation was, as I say, a process involving state and federal governments undertaken by the previous Labor government. As a consequence of that process, legislation was introduced into the parliament, but legislation which has been substantially changed by this particular government.</para><para>In approaching the legislation before us today, what the Labor opposition is attempting to do is to go back to that starting point of the pre-1996 legislation and to recognise that many of the processes that led to that were quite constructive but also to recognise the objectives of that legislation. In doing so, what we are about today is to try and beef up this particular legislation. We recognise that there are a number of major inadequacies in it. Also, in having that starting point, we recognise that some of the amendments to be moved by Senator Allison to the legislation are amendments which do not really conform to the structure and to the objectives of this legislation which the government set out to achieve in 1996 and as governments have set out to achieve now. So in a sense we will probably take a bit of a midway course, but it is a course that will ensure that this legislation is beefed up.</para><para>Let us turn to the bill. The bill provides for the application of certain state and territory environment protection laws to the Commonwealth and its agencies in an attempt to create and implement a scheme of uniform national standards. These standards in the legislation 
 are known as national environment protection measures. The bill is also the second chapter in a legislative approach characterised by cooperative Commonwealth-state standard setting, an approach which was commenced by the National Environment Protection Council Act 1994. Specifically, this bill provides five different methods for the implementation of NEPMs which are made under the National Environment Protection Council Act.</para><para>The bill provides several methods by which the Commonwealth can implement these measures in order that they will apply to the Commonwealth. These are: applying certain state laws to Commonwealth places, applying certain state and territory laws to Commonwealth activities, the making of regulations, environmental audits or environmental management plans and the use of existing Commonwealth laws. The council act of 1994 provides for the making of measures related to seven particular environmental issues: air quality, water quality, noise standards, site contamination, hazardous waste, recycling and motor vehicle emissions. It is a bill which is designed to apply these measures to the Commonwealth once they have been finalised.</para><para>As I said at the outset, governments have been trying to get the balance right in respect of Commonwealth and state responsibilities for quite some time. The constitution has provided some source of guidance. It also has to be said that the courts in this country have been critical in providing a capacity for governments to recognise and to exercise their responsibilities. According to the <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest</inline> produced by the Parliamentary Library, the difficulties in securing uniform environmental protection outcomes were alluded to in that report. The library is referring to the 1996 Commonwealth <inline font-style="italic">State of the environment</inline> report. In that particular report the independent advisory panel commented:</para><para>The national ability to manage the environment is continually hamstrung by structural problems between different areas of government. Standards vary from State to State, and State and Commonwealth governments frequently battle over environmental issues.</para><para>The recent historyâover the last 25 to 30 years or soâof protection of the environment 
 in this country is littered with those sorts of conflicts. There have been high profile issues, the protection of wilderness areas, and there has been a need for the federal government, over the last 25 to 30 years, to intervene to protect some areas of national importance.</para><para>Unfortunately, in recent days this federal government does not seem to have the same compulsion or the same degree of moral obligation to protect such internationally accepted areas. But not just the major issues have been of concern and have raised friction between the Commonwealth and states; minor ones, the local ones, have also been issues of concern. When it comes to this particular legislation, much of the impact of it is to confront the issues that are raised by measures of government affecting local communities. Achieving uniformity is one thing but recognising one's responsibility as a federal government is another. That is an objective that we will try to meet through amendments.</para><para>The bill before us presents itself as a decision to bind the Commonwealth to measures found in state laws. In addressing the question as to whether the bill meets that objective, the conclusion we come to is that it does not do so. The idea of the Commonwealth meeting environmental standards found in state laws for the measures scheme makes sense for two main reasons. First, there is a need for consistency amongst national pollution control and environment protection laws. This scheme of national uniformity would hardly be a truly national scheme unless the Commonwealth was bound to such a scheme.</para><para>The second reason, speaking frankly, is that the Commonwealth must address concerns about the environmental impacts of Commonwealth activities. It is a fact that the activities of the Commonwealth and its authorities can have a significant environmental impact. As I said earlier, they do not have to be national to have an impact. They can have an enormous, pervasive impact on quite a number of communities across this country. For instance, the Commonwealth is a major landowner and operates a wide range of facilities which involve a number of land uses with potential to contaminate land with toxic and hazardous waste.</para><para>For example, the <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest</inline> mentioned earlier refers to the National Transmission Authority which in 1996 was storing over 33 tonnes of highly toxic polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) material at its 500 sites throughout Australia, posing significant health and environmental risks. Can I say, as a former administrative services minister, that the effect and the spread of Commonwealth property and the contaminated nature of it is something which has to be of continuing concern to government.</para><para>Let us go to the issues. The essential question in respect of this bill is whether it adequately resolves the existing legal uncertainties surrounding the question of Commonwealth environmental responsibilities under state law. This issue has been raised for quite some time and, more recently, in a report in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> of 17 June last year. The report was entitled, `State pushes to end exemptions on prosecutions for polluting'. The report stated that New South Wales was seeking a test case to break the long-held perception of standing exemptions of Commonwealth agencies from state pollution control laws.</para><para>New South Wales was seeking that. According to the report, all `Commonwealth agencies in New South Wales were believed to be the subject of examination' by the New South Wales EPA. These included military bases, the Lucas Heights nuclear reactor site, Sydney airport and telecommunications facilities. Had the New South Wales EPA found a test case and run it, it could have opened very easily a new chapter in legal relations between the Commonwealth and the states.</para><para>But, whilst New South Wales was looking for that case, in 1997 the High Court in the Henderson case revisited this very difficult question of the application of state laws to the Commonwealth and its agencies. In that particular case the decision of the High Court in August 1997 has considerably reduced the extent to which the Commonwealth and its agents can claim a broad constitutional immunity from state laws. The court found that New South Wales residential tenancy law applied to the activities of the Defence Hous 
 ing Authority. It was a 6-1 decision of the court. It was a 6-1 majority which rejected the broad proposition that the Commonwealth cannot be bound by state legislation.</para><para>I mention this particularly because one of the amendments we will be seeking to make to this legislation will be to have an opting out arrangement rather than an opting in arrangement. We want a broader application of state legislation rather than having that legislation applied only by individual measures. In that respect, we also do not want to overturn the principles adopted by the High Court in 1997.</para><para>New South Wales is not the only state to be concerned. Victoria also has concerns with this particular legislation. In respect of clause 9, for instance, the Victorian government's EPA in its submission to the Senate environmental committee inquiry into the bill stated:</para><para>Clause 9 expressly excludes the application of State laws to Commonwealth places or activities, unless they are applied by the Environment Minister under the Bill.</para><para>This, says Victoria, in joining with the message from New South Wales, is a significant step backwards. It continued:</para><para>Passage of the Bill in its current form would leave States in the clearly unacceptable position where none of their environment laws apply to the Commonwealth, with no guarantee, or even presumption that those laws will be applied.</para><para>New South Wales is also concerned about this pick and choose approach which the Commonwealth is reflecting in this legislation. It ought to be made known at this point in the debate that this was an approach the previous legislation had rejected and the opposition's amendments with respect to clause 9 will be to try to restore the principles adopted in the previous legislation. It is important to note that the response of Environment Australia in respect of this point is as follows:</para><para>The inclusion of the present clause 9 does not purport to suspend all State environmental provisions, only those implementing a NEPM. Clause 9, for example, would not suspend a whole piece of legislation, only the provisions of it that implemented the NEPM in question.</para><para>Even though Environment Australia says that, we feel that objective is not adequately met 
 by this legislation. As I said, we will try to redress that. We do have concerns as to the application of the legislation and we have concerns with legislation which we think focuses more on exemptions of the Commonwealth from the application of state and territory laws than it does on compliance. We are concerned with legislation before us which provides the environment minister with virtually unfettered discretions as to the application of such exemptions on what may be perceived as spurious or indefensible grounds. We are concerned with this legislation because it contains inadequate accountability measures and public scrutiny measures.</para><para>The reporting mechanism reflected in this legislation is elaborate, overly bureaucratic and convoluted. We are concerned with the legislation because it expressly exempts the Commonwealth from prosecution for criminal offences and we are also concerned with this legislation because the heaviest penalties of the bill fall on those who are concerned to protect the environmentâwhistleblowersârather than polluters. Without prolonging the debate at this stage I indicate that the opposition is supporting the bill but, in supporting the bill, there are quite a number of amendments that we will be moving in the committee stage.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>1030</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe stated purpose of the <inline ref="s190">National Environment Protection Measures (Implementation) Bill 1998</inline>  is to apply the national environment protection measures to the Commonwealth and its authorities as part of a scheme of uniform national standards. According to the government, it aims to harmonise and standardise national environment protection standards. It also claims to give all Australians the benefit of equivalent environment protection and to ensure that investment decisions of business are not distorted by variations in environmental standards between Australian jurisdictions.</para></talk.start><para>The government says it is to stop forum shopping by industries looking to find the state or territory which has the lowest environmental protection standards. In fact, in the Democrats' view, quite the opposite outcome appears likely. This is just one of the ways in 
 which the stated aim of the bill is at odds with what the bill does. In the case of the NEPMs, if we can call them that, the difficulties in reaching consensus as to the content of the national environment standards means that the NEPC will be tempted to settle on lowest common denominator outcomes. Essentially this bill relies on state legislation which, firstly, mirrors the NEPC Act and, secondly, creates the National Environment Protection Council. The NEPC has the job of making national environment protection measures and these measures can consist of one or more of the following seven matters, but not more than those seven: ambient air quality; ambient marine, estuarine and fresh water quality; noise standards; site contamination assessment guidelines; hazardous waste impacts; reuse and recycling of used materials; and motor vehicle noise and emissions.</para><para>The Democrats believe that the definition of activity under the bill should be broadened to include the formulation of environmental policy, environmental decision making, cumulative effects and indirect effects. The bill provides several methods by which the Commonwealth can implement NEPMs in order that they will apply to the Commonwealth: applying certain state laws to Commonwealth places, applying certain state and territory laws to Commonwealth activities, making regulations, having environmental audits or environmental management plans and using existing Commonwealth laws.</para><para>The NEPC Act 1994 provides for the making of NEPMs related to air quality, water quality, noise standards, site contamination, hazardous waste, recycling and motor vehicle emissions. Its stated aim is to apply the NEPMs to the Commonwealth activities, once they have been finalised. However, the essence of this bill is to exempt Commonwealth activities from state laws, unless the federal minister takes active steps to apply them. Unlike activities carried out by other bodies, the Commonwealth is not routinely obliged to comply with state laws. It is not a matter for the minister to exempt the Commonwealth properties; he or she must take action to ensure compliance. Even many of the states do not regard this as being in keeping with 
 the spirit of their agreement with the Commonwealth. The ACT government said:</para><para>. . . the Bill seems more directed to ensuring the Commonwealth agencies are not bound by State and Territory laws to implement NEPMs than it is to giving effect to environment objectives.</para><para>Even the Victorian state government was critical of the fact that the grounds for exemption, such as administrative efficiency or national interest, were extremely broad. The national interest is defined as Australia's foreign relations; international obligations; national security and defence; a national emergency; telecommunications activities; the management of aviation, airspace or airports, including aircraft noise and emissions; and any other matter agreed between the Commonwealth and the states. In the Commonwealth's very wide range of facilities and properties, there are some actual and potentially highly contaminating land uses. Hazardous waste is stored, and air, noise and water pollution are not uncommon.</para><para>In March last year the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts reported on environmental management of Commonwealth land. In the opinion of this committee `compliance by the Commonwealth with State and local government environment protection laws and regulations' were `fundamental to the development of a coordinated approach to environmental management by Commonwealth agencies'. The committee called for a national policy, particularly for environmental management of Commonwealth land and particularly for contaminated sites and for prevention. It said:</para><para>The absence of a clear Commonwealth policy framework is a major constraint on departments and management entities seeking to establish priorities and actions in line with best current practice.</para><para>Time does not permit me to give a full account of the many problems identified by the audit but, for instance, as Senator Bolkus has already mentioned, in 1996 the National Transmission Authority was storing 33 tonnes of highly toxic polychlorinated biphenyl. There were 1,060 identified ordnance sites throughout Australia in 1996.</para><para>The Management Audit Branch of the Department of Defence found that the Air Force failed to follow procedures for the management of hazardous materials, toxic wastes were being stored and disposed of inappropriately and there was discharge of contaminants into stormwater and possibly the watertable. Poorly managed and uncontrolled disposal sites and, in some cases, inappropriate dumping of scheduled wastes posed a potential risk to personnel. There was leakage and spillage around hazardous waste storage and disposal sites and, finally, inadequate records for the storage of hazardous wastes. So, not only does the Commonwealth have many potential and existing environmental hot spots; its failure to adequately manage them is already known, or at least to the extent that audits have been done.</para><para>Furthermore, the bill has been widely criticised as being unnecessarily complex and convolutedâparticularly the enforcement mechanismâand that, far from creating harmonious uniformity, it has in fact blurred and confused the Commonwealth-state responsibilities. One state EPA offered the view:</para><para>The bill exacerbates the existing uncertainties about the application of State laws to Commonwealth agencies. No one knows if and when State laws will apply.</para><para>The bill does not in fact make any clear commitment to adopt state laws for Commonwealth places and activities, even though section 7 of the NEPC Act is for this to occur. The bill clearly has more to do with exemption for the Commonwealth from state laws than with compliance.</para><para>The NEPC legislation was largely agreed to in the Intergovernmental Agreement on the Environment back in 1992 in an attempt to reduce the conflict between the Commonwealth and the state governments on environment issues. The Commonwealth undertook to reach consensus agreement with the states on environmental matters and agreed to avoid taking action to override state government decisions.</para><para>It might be worth noting that, so far, draft NEPMs have only been prepared on the National Pollutant Inventory, air standards, hazardous wastes and contaminated sites. In 
 the case of the National Pollutant Inventory, we saw the government take a very conservative course by declaring only 36 substances to be required to be recorded when discharged to air or water, and this compares with over 200 in similar legislation in the United States.</para><para>One of the significant constraints of the NEPMs is the requirement to have regard to a range of social, economic and regional factors. As with the way this government has dealt with so many environment issues since coming to office, short-term economic gains are given a higher priority than long-term sustainability. Also typical for this government are the very wide discretionary powers given to the minister. The Environment Defenders Office said in their submission that this discretionary structure `raises serious problems of ministerial accountability, in addition to the risk of politically expedient, but environmentally unjustified decisions'.</para><para>The Australian Democrats' preferred approach to environmental protection would be one where the Commonwealth took a leadership role which resulted in unifying legislation requiring general duty of care for the environment in all jurisdictions. Until that happens, in our view the Commonwealth ought to show the way by at least being prepared to commit its activities to both state and Commonwealth legislation. There may well be an argument for exemption in some circumstances. However, we would argue that this should only be warranted if it is a matter of public health and safety or national security.</para><para>It is quite extraordinary to us that this bill gives the Commonwealth so many escape clauses. There is nothing in the legislation which makes the Commonwealth liable to be prosecuted for an offence, and in fact there is no adequate enforcement regime to give affected parties any rights.</para><para>The bill obliges the Commonwealth to report, but it is not obliged to monitor and report publicly on how well the goals of an environmental management plan are being achieved, so the public would have no way of knowing whether or not a report had been filed. This fails as any sort of accountability measure. We would like to see a Common 
 wealth enforcement system at least equivalent to that in the United States, perhaps overseen by a section of Environment Australia.</para><para>In contrast to the lack of enforcement for the Commonwealth is the provision for a conviction, punishable by imprisonment for up to two years, for an employee of a government who, in the course of implementing a NEPM on Commonwealth property, directly or indirectly discloses information obtained from a search of land occupied by the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth authority. In other words, this legislation is very tough on anyone who might blow the whistle on the government.</para><para>The bill also seeks to do away with the production of potential evidence in a court. While these clauses do provide exceptions, we believe these measures are not in the spirit of full and true disclosure in environmental performance matters.</para><para>The Democrats will, in dealing with this legislation, look to give effect to the government's stated aims and to honour its commitments made in intergovernmental agreements. We will make sure we give effect to the government's rhetoric about the importance of a level playing field. I think it is bad enough that the government has no real national policy on environment protection for its activities, but why should the Commonwealth be allowed to operate with absolutely no environmental constraints? It does not make any sense to allow the pollution of soil, air and water at a facility just because it is in Commonwealth hands, and of course that pollution will not just be confined to that site.</para><para>Our amendments seek to see that the rules on polluting the environment and on air and noise emissions are the same for the Commonwealth as they are for every other government, including local government, and for every other individual and company.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>1033</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âAt the outset, I think it is important to reiterate the comments I made on Monday about the total opposition of the Greens (WA) to debating the <inline ref="s190">National Environment Protection Measures (Implementation) Bill 1998</inline>  during the current session. With a very short spring sitting, we were 
 given little of the legislation to be debated. We were given no idea about the order in which the 18 packages of bills listed for debate in these sittings were to be debated. But we were given assurances that we only needed to prepare those 18 packages of bills. It obviously was not a core promise because we are here debating a major environmental bill with little notice. The government appears not to want any serious examination of this bill, and I am not surprised.</para></talk.start><para>You only have to look at the report of the Senate committee to see the government's lack of commitment to consultation on this bill. The committee advertised the inquiry in the <inline font-style="italic">Weekend Australian</inline> on 6 December 1997 with a closing date for submissions of 12 January 1998âso, smack in the middle of the Christmas period were the opening and closing dates for submissions. And, surprise, surprise, after that enormous period for preparation of submissions on the bill, the grand total of three submissions were received and the committee determined not to bother with any public hearings. With that exhaustive process out of the way, you would have thought that the government would proceed at full pace to debate this very high priority legislation. But, no, we did not see the bill listed for possible debate until the Spring sittingsâthat were never going to be in August this year because of the election.</para><para>The government needs to be aware that, while it may have ministerial and departmental staff who do little else but live and breathe these particular bills, for my staff bills are considered on a needs basis. If they are listed for debate in the near future, they are considered and prepared. If not, they go into the pending file. From our point of view, this is a necessity for getting bills properly considered. As I indicated earlier, because this bill was clearly not listed for debate in the spring sittings the NEPM bill was in my adviser's pending file until Monday.</para><para>Let us have a look at why the government is so keen to flick the bill through such scant attention. The reality is that, despite its laudable aims, the bill only adds to the confusion of environmental law in this countryâa situation which will be even more confused 
 after the passage of the  Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Bill 1998 (No. 2)  next year. Or will it be next week?  Will another bill suddenly appear on the list, which we will have to suddenly debate?</para><para>My concerns were well expressed by Senator Allison and Senator Schacht in their respective minority reports, and in the opposition comments in the committee report on this bill. They point to confusion, complexity and problems with the substantial ministerial discretion contained in this bill. There is no point in this government going to the international arena, with their steadily reduced credibility, and saying, `We have the world's best environment laws' when they are all discretionaryâor most are discretionary. The reality is they are not enforceable by the public, who know they are being broken.</para><para>As the name implies, this bill relates to national environmental protection measures, which are meant to be uniform standards agreed to by all governments in Australia. The fundamental problem, however, is that the nature of the process for uniform standards creates a race to the bottom in terms of environmental standards, so we are looking at the lowest common denominator. In the same way that we have a push for internationally competitive labour rates and corporate taxation, we see pressure for lower and lower environmental standards so that we can attract corporate investment to this country. In addition, there are concerns about the scope of NEPMs, which are currently limited to seven areas: ambient air quality; ambient marine, estuarine and fresh water quality; noise standards; site contamination assessment guidelines; hazardous waste impacts; reuse and recycling of used materials; and motor vehicle noise and emissions.</para><para>I have been involved in an issue in Western Australia in recent times which highlights one of the concerns about this approach to environmental issues. The issue was the proposal to dump toxic waste at a site near Toodyay, which is 100 kilometres north-east of Perth. Whilst there is an NEPM dealing with contaminated sites, it appears that lack of political will on the part of various governments has meant that there is no commitment to 
 proceed with an NEPM in relation to the disposal of the contaminated material from those sites. Thankfully, massive public pressure led to the abandonment of this particular proposal, but the issue highlighted a major shortfall in national guidelines for toxic waste disposal and storage.</para><para>This bill implements the Commonwealth's commitment, under the Intergovernmental Agreement on the Environment, to enact legislation to implement national environment protection measures in its jurisdiction. Any agreement that the Commonwealth makes in relation to toxic sites cannot in any way, shape or form be done simply by negotiating with state governments. The people who deal with toxic sites on a daily basis are largely local governments, so waste disposal and toxic sites must take in the good work that is done by many councils and the not so good work by other councilsâbut basically at the level of local governmentâotherwise you are not going to get a realistic or enforceable or practical outcome in relation to any agreement on waste disposal or toxic sites.</para><para>The essence of the Commonwealth legislation is that state or territory laws implementing the NEPM regime do not apply to Commonwealth activities except by declaration of the Commonwealth environment minister. As the <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest</inline> suggests, the whole question of Commonwealth-state responsibility for environment protection is very confused, and this bill does little to clarify the situation.</para><para>It is worth noting in passing that this lies at the heart of my concerns relating to constitutional reform in this country. Debate in this country on constitutional reform has been deliberately focused on the minimalist question of the head of state, but little debate has been on important issues such as the respective roles for the three levels of government in relation to environmental protection and community development. It is about time we had that debate rather than pursuing the coalition's devolution approach. Or should that be the Pontius Pilate approach? The Greens (WA) will not be supporting the second reading of this bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>1035</page.no><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator CARR</name><name.id>AW5</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI speak to this <inline ref="s190">National Environment Protection Measures (Implementation) Bill 1998</inline> , noting that it is a substantially different proposition from the version of the bill that was first proposed by the Labor government. It distorts the original intent of the provisions of that original proposition advanced by Labor when in government. This bill was first introduced in 1996 but lapsed due to the March 1996 election. The bill was extensively amended by the Howard government when it was presented to the Senate on 21 October 1997. The second reading debate had not concluded when the parliament was prorogued.</para></talk.start><para>On the recommendation of the Selection of Bills Committee, it was referred to the Senate Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts committee in November 1997, and this committee reported in March 1998. Given the importance of this legislation, I was somewhat surprised to read in the committee's report that the advertisements for the inquiry into this bill were placed on 6 December 1997 with a closing date for submissions of 12 January 1998, and that the committee had received only three submissions by the closing date. That is not surprising, if one thinks for a moment about what people are doing over the Christmas-New Year period. I think very little attention would be paid to writing submissions to the Senate Environment, Recreation, Communication and the Arts Legislation Committee.</para><para>When the committee finally did get around to considering these matters, it found it had before it 12 submissions in total. However, I also note in this report that the committee did not hold a public hearing into the bill and that officers of the relevant department did not have a forum in which to respond to the criticisms of the proposed legislation that were made in the various submissions to the committee.</para><para>What we found was that the inquiry which took place consisted of an exchange of documents between officers of the department and the various interest groups that expressed concern about the bill. It strikes me, given the importance of the issues canvassed in this bill, that a better process of consultation should 
 have been developed by the committee. While it is unfortunate that that did not occur, I note that the report does contain a considerable number of issues that warrant further public debate. I am sure that Senator Kay Patterson, who signed the committee report on behalf of the government, would have given very thorough consideration to the issues raised in the report. As I say, they are very substantial indeed.</para><para>Labor Party's concerns about this bill have been borne out in the evidence that was presented through the 12 submissions to the committee. The Labor Party highlighted in its minority report that the bill, firstly, focuses more on exemptions of the Commonwealth from the application of state and territory laws than it does on compliance; secondly, provides the environment minister with virtually unfettered discretions as to the application of such exemptions on what may be perceived as spurious or indefensible grounds; and, thirdly, contains inadequate accountability measures.</para><para>An elaborate, overly bureaucratic and convoluted reporting mechanism takes the place of any strong and public accessible reporting and enforcement mechanism and the bill fails the accountability transparency test that might be applied in just about any other area of the environmental legislation. Fourthly, the bill expressly exempts the Commonwealth from prosecution for an offence and, fifthly, the heaviest penalties fall upon the whistleblowers rather than polluters. These are matters of some concern and I trust that at the committee stage of the bill an opportunity will be given to allow further discussion of these matters.</para><para>I have said that there were no public hearings on the bill and there was little opportunity to judge the government's responses to the criticisms that had been made of the bill. Nonetheless, it is important to canvass some of the concerns that have been expressed. For instance, the Department of Defence highlights their concerns about the resource implications of implementing the NEPMs, given that it is a requirement of this bill that departments meet cost implications from their 
 own budgets. I trust that the minister will be able to address that issue in his reply.</para><para>The states and territories have raised concerns about the lack of consultation on the legislation. The legislation purports to involve state authorities at various levels and I would have thought that there would have been further discussions with the states and territories about the implications of that. It is an interesting and ironic point that both the conservation groups and the states are coming to this question and reaching the same conclusionâI suggest perhaps for entirely different reasons, but essentially the same point is being made, that these issues are far too important to be allowed to be swept under the carpet without public debate.</para><para>Concerns have been raised about the definitions contained in the bill that go to the issue of the so-called national interest. On my reading of the measures highlighted, the national interest is presumably defined as matters including foreign relations; international obligations; national security; national defence; a national emergency; telecommunications activity; management of aviation, airspace or airports; and other matters agreed between the Commonwealth, states and territories.</para><para>This is an extremely broad range of issues and, I might suggest, it is open to some considerable controversy. For instance, when the issue of communications is being discussed, particularly in a privatised telecommunications industry, one has, I think, legitimate concerns about the extent to which private companies seek to avoid their community responsibilities and environmental obligations by calling upon the provisions of this bill. It applies equally to privatised airports and the extent to which private firms are able to exempt themselves from the community obligations under the terms of this bill.</para><para>As to other matters in terms of the defence powers, I think there are always matters of some considerable debate about the appropriateness of the Commonwealth being able to call upon such a broad range of claims as to what is a national emergency or a matter of national security. We notice that there has 
 been a lack of consultation about these matters. I do not think the defences put in the government's response to this committee of inquiry are adequate. I trust that they too will be able to be responded to at the committee stage of the bill.</para><para>It appears that there are some inconsistencies in the way in which the Commonwealth has approached this matter through the COAG review of Commonwealth-state responsibilities and the environment which allows the Commonwealth, from my reading of this provision, to pick and choose which state laws and regulatory authorities it can comply with and those which it cannot.</para><para>That would not be such a major problem if there were some consistency in the Commonwealth's approach to these issues and we could, therefore, subject to ministerial discretions, have some form of public assessment. But it would appear under this bill that the ministerial accountability provisions are minimal. The ministerial discretions are extremely wide and, given the history of the implementation of environmental laws in this country, particularly in my state, where we see the EPA used essentially in a most arbitrary manner to defend projects for which state ministers seem to have a particular fondness, or where there appears to be some special relationship between private interests and state authority, it is a matter of deep concern that the ministerial discretion is so wide.</para><para>I acknowledge that relying upon state laws is not an adequate response to this concern, as we saw, for instance, with the building of the Citylink project in Melbourne, where the advice provided by the state department to the Commonwealth was totally inadequate and, I might say, quite misleading. It was claimed that environmental assessment measures had been taken which, of course, were not undertaken and which, at the very least, one could only describe as being totally inadequate. So we find that it is not entirely appropriate to rely solely on the provisions of state law; it is equally not appropriate, in my judgment, to give ministerial discretion such a broad writ as is proposed in this bill. The New South Wales government's submission to the Senate inquiry stated:</para><para>The National Interest criteria for excluding the operations of the bill is too broad . . . the lack of scope has the potential to cause considerable uncertainty.</para><para>My particular concern here is that ministerial actions are taken not for sound environmental reasons but because of political discrimination against one group or another or in favour of one group or another. As we have seen in the recent disputes concerning uranium mining, it is quite apparent that this government has a very limited view of its obligations to protect the community at large.</para><para>For instance, in Queensland, there is the matter of Hinchinbrook and other matters. Madam Acting Deputy President, I am sure you would be only too well aware of the way in which the Commonwealth has approached environmental issues in such a cavalier manner that suggests that the concerns being expressed by agencies such as the Environmental Defender's Office do have considerable merit. The Environmental Defender's Office highlights that this provision of ministerial accountability may in fact allow for governments to circumvent this bill by using regulations to avoid implementing NEPMs, despite what this government has said about its intent with regard to this legislation.</para><para>There is a lack of clarity about the way in which governments will act. There is a lack of accountability, to the point where governments are able to act on environmental matters out of political expediency rather than by following sound environmental practices. If one examines for just a short while the environmental record of this government on a range of issues, one has reason for concern.</para><para>Another issue raised in the report goes to the question of enforcement. It would appear that under this bill the enforcement provisions are effectively non-existent. Environmental impact statements, whilst not precluded, are not required as regards the application of a provision of state or territory law. Further, as Environment Australia points out, the use of environmental audits will be quite limited.</para><para>The Commonwealth and a significant number of authorities are protected from criminal liability under the provisions of this 
 bill, and the bill provides for criminal liability for state officials but not for its agents.	I acknowledge that governments have to be careful on this point. In particular, a distinction has to be drawn between imposing liabilities on the Crown as a body politic and imposing criminal liability specifically on servants of the Crown.</para><para>Considerable attention needs to be paid to ensure that public servants are not liable to prosecution for actions undertaken on behalf of government so long as the terms of the offence are undertaken as a direct result of government policy, in which case ministers should be held accountable rather than individuals. Nonetheless, there is concern being expressed in the community about the way in which there appears to be a double standard exercised here between Commonwealth public servants and state public servants. There are no realistic sanctions for Commonwealth authorities who do not adequately seek to implement environmental action plans.</para><para>Finally, there is concern being expressed about the lack of accountability mechanisms within this bill. There is no public scrutiny of Commonwealth actions regarding the implementation of NEPMs. There is a lack of monitoring or reporting arrangements on how well the goals of an environmental management plan are being achieved. A strong point is made in the Senate committee report, and I quote directly from it:</para><para>There was a strong feeling in submissions that the bill did call for strong accountability mechanisms to be put in place and certain groups argued for greater public scrutiny of Commonwealth actions in relation to the implementation of NEPMs. In particular, the Environmental Defender's Office deplored the lack of a clear obligation on the Commonwealth to monitor and report publicly on how well the goals of an environmental management plan are being achieved.</para><para>This report was signed off by Senator Kay Patterson. I trust that these are the views that she fully supported. I am sure she would not have signed off the report unless she did agree with the propositions put. I commend the reading of this report. I am sure Senator Hill will give us the benefit of his advice on these matters and the concerns raised by the committee in regard to this bill.</para><para>Clearly, this is a very important matter. It is a pity that there has not been greater public debate on these concerns. It is a shame that this matter is being dealt with in this way. Nonetheless, I trust that in the committee stage of the bill these issues will be attended to in far greater detail.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>1038</page.no><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name><name.id>SF4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI want to take up one aspect of this issue which, as Senator Carr has said, is a very important issue.

He said at that time that the Shield of the Crown was an issue that had not died and that was still in operation. In the context in which he prepared the report, the legislation at issue at that time was the Trade Practices Act and the corporations legislationâthe Australian Securities Commission being an example.</para><para>That problem of the relationships between the states and what the Commonwealth can and cannot do is, again, a question in this legislation. One way through these problems is to have an objective as to what we, as a nation, want to do about the environment. As I see things, too often we get caught up in the mechanics of the relationship between various governments and what ministers may or may 
 not do rather than define for ourselves a vision and objective of where we want to go on the issue of the environment. The issue has been raised already in debate about the power of the minister, in this context, to make operative particular legislation that might come from the states. I think that is too narrow a basis on which to have legislation like this decided.</para><para>We ought to remember the vision of what Australia, with its states, is all about. Sir Garfield Barwick, who was then Chief Justice of Australia, had this to say at the start of the seventies in the case of Victoria v. the Commonwealth:</para><para>I have observed elsewhere that the Constitution does not represent a treaty or union between sovereign and independent States. It was the result of the will and desire of the people of all the colonies expressed both through their representative institutions and directly through referenda to be united in one Commonwealth with an agreed distribution of governmental power.</para><para>Later, in his decision in that case, he had this to say:</para><para>The constitutional arrangements of the colonies were retained by, and subject to, the Constitution as the constitutional arrangements for the government of those portions of the Commonwealth to be known as States. These, though coterminous in geographical area with the former colonies, derived their existence as States from the Constitution itself: and being parts of the Commonwealth became constituent States.</para><para>The concept we have to get through to ourselvesâand to everybody else for that matterâis that we are a nation: not a collection of warring states, but a nation. No matter what part of Australia is affected, it is going to affect us all as Australians. The constitution underpins that concept, not only in terms of Australia as a whole but also in terms of the very states that arose out of the constitution, as Sir Garfield Barwick said.</para><para>One of the problems we faceâand I think it is faced in this legislationâis that we talk about the environment as if it is a battle between the states and the Commonwealth. If the states introduce a particular environmental law which may not be good for the environment, then the Commonwealth should be able to reject itânot only reject it legally, but somehow reject it conceptually. The problem 
 is that our view of the environment in this country is a divided view. It is a view that we take not as Australians but as Victorians, Tasmanians, South Australians, Western Australians, Queenslandersâa great state from which you come, Madam Acting Deputy Presidentâand so on.</para><para>A lot of the problems that come about in this area of environmental protectionâand, indeed, in other areasâarise from our concept of what sort of people we are. We are able to solve this problem with, for example, the Corporations Law. I think that has worked well. Until the Corporations Law was passed, the concept was that there were different states with different laws. Way back that was quite pronounced. It is time we recognised that it is profitable, right and proper for us all to see things as one countryânot only in terms of the economy but also in terms of the environment.</para><para>I hope that during the committee stage of this bill the minister will address the idea of going to a concept where we are Australians as a wholeâwhere we all have a purchase on every part of the place, and where we are not a group of separate colonies which, in some instances, deigns to unite for a particular purpose.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>1039</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Environment and Heritage</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI thank honourable senators for their contributions. It seems that, except for the Greens, all parties and individual senators will support the bill. They seem reluctant to support any environmental reform introduced by this government, and we just have to live with that fact.</para></talk.start><para>This is an important piece of legislation. If I might pick up the theme of Senator Cooney, it is an attempt to implement environmental laws on a national scale and to implement consistent environmental laws across the country. It supports a mechanism that was negotiated between the Commonwealth and states and came into effect in 1992, whereby these national standards for environmental protection would be determined through a cooperative state-Commonwealth structure. A number of them under our government have 
 already been determined, such as ambient air quality standards.</para><para>The issue then becomes how best to legislatively provide for those standards. Of course, as has been said, the Commonwealth traditionally has been somewhat reluctant to see itself bound by state laws as they apply to its operations. Nevertheless, the trend is towards an acceptance of that, with the remaining reservations being in particular in relation to areas where the Commonwealth would say that there is a particular national interest responsibility.</para><para>This obviously leads to debates on detail as to what is an appropriate national interest according to contemporary standards to justify that Commonwealth position. It also leads to a debate on the way in which state laws are to be implemented. Certainly the committee that examined this law did debate the issue as to whether the Commonwealth was given too great a discretion in the application of the state laws. That is something that no doubt we will have in the committee stage of this debate. There is always room to argue about whether this Commonwealth attempt to become part of the national scheme, this bill we are putting before the Senateâbearing in mind that all the states have already implemented their laws to bring into effect the national environment protection measures system across the countryâis the best tool to achieve that objective. The debate on some of the detail we are about to have in the committee stage.

 It is just as well my staff and I are, as always, prepared for battle.</para></talk.start><para>I wish today to speak on the  Aged Care Amendment (Accreditation Agency) Bill 1998 , and I indicate on behalf of the opposition that we are opposing the passage of this bill. We do so not because we are opposed to the accreditation system but because we have serious concerns about the method that the government has used in consulting with the industry about the implementation of these measures and about the lack of knowledge that still exists about how the accreditation system payments are to be calculated. So we are using our opposition to the bill as a means of raising those concerns, rather than attacking the issue of accreditation.</para><para>This bill would insert into the Aged or Disabled Persons Care Act a facility for the minister to set a schedule of fees that the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency would charge when processing applications from aged care facilities for their accreditation under the act. Accreditation under the act will be a prerequisite for receiving government subsidies from January 2001, so the actual accreditation is vital for all providers because without it they will not receive government funding. Therefore, the issues about whether facilities can cope with the accreditation system and afford the costs associated with it are vital to the future of aged care.</para><para>The Labor Party supports any initiative that seeks to improve the standard of aged care. It was for this reason that in 1987 we introduced the inspection system for nursing homes, and extended it to hostels in 1991. Between that period and 1993-94, both nursing homes and hostels showed an improvement against all quality standards. That of course is very pleasing and reassuring for the Australian community. However, that inspection system, which is still operating, is wholly funded by the Commonwealth. We as a parliament took the decision that we ought to fund the system that ensured that standards were met in aged care facilities in Australia. It is because of our concern for those standards that we oppose these proposed amendments.</para><para>Providers in the aged care industry have genuine concerns about the transfer of responsibility that the bill represents and the implications for standards of care. The providers are also concerned about the lack of information available on the government's proposals for the fees. We seem to be getting mixed messages from the government on just what the proposed fees will cover. The minister in the other House has indicated that fees proposed in the amendment would `reflect the cost of the accreditation service'. This leaves open full recovery of the costs of running the accreditation agencyâthat is, they are proposing the complete transfer of funding of this responsibility from Commonwealth consolidated revenue to the actual providers, the facilitators of aged care. They will have to meet the costs of providing community assurance of standards in their own facilities.</para><para>The reality is that, under the proposed amendment, all these costs will be transferred to those providers from as early as 1 January 1999. The budget funding of the accreditation agency is subject to review and may be withdrawn, leaving the agency dependent upon fees charged to providers. It is unclear to us what the cost of the accreditation service will eventually be. Industry providers estimate the costs of actually carrying out the accreditation in each facility to be of the order of $5,000 to $10,000. If full recovery of costs is the government's intention, an additional $5.5 million would be added to the overall amount charged to the aged care industry. The accreditation agency's budget is $5.5 million, as reported in the last annual report.</para><para>When the budget of the agency is added to the possible costs of the accreditation process, each facility may be liable for a fee of $7,000 to $12,000. With approximately 3,000 facilities, this adds up to a potential $36 million worth of fees across the industry. As the fees that providers can charge residents are fixed by the government, along with the number of beds that the facilities can provide, the only option that facilities have for raising the money for these additional fees will be to make cuts in their running costs and service standards. </para><para>By transferring the fees of the new accreditation agency and the costs associated with accreditation to the nursing homes, providers can only recover the costs by reducing the standards of care and by reducing the services they provide to residents. A large number of these facilities are not-for-profit providers. They are not people who have huge reserves or who have the potential to eat into profit margins. They are not-for-profit providers; they are community organisations, and the only way they can absorb these fees is by reducing the services.</para><para>There is real concern in some sections, and it is shared by the Labor Party, that this will have a very adverse effect on the small providers. There is no doubt that larger providers will be able to absorb these costs. They have the management systems and the computing systems in place that will ensure they are able to deal with the accreditation process. But 50 per cent of nursing homes have fewer than 41 beds. Many of these smaller facilities are located in rural and remote areasâa development we encouraged because we wanted older people to be able to move into facilities close to their families and close to where they have lived all their lives.</para><para>We have serious concerns that this sort of development, with the passing on of accreditation fees to small providers, might affect the viability of those services. So there is a real issue here, one that Ms Moylan, the former minister, highlighted in her speech in the House of Representatives. But it is an issue that the minister has failed to address other than by providing vague assurances that `it will all be alright, don't you worry about that'.</para><para>We can only estimate the potential scale of any fee. Providers have made repeated requests for some indication of the size of any fee that we impose on the sector as a result of the bill, yet the government have failed to provide any proper information. In fact the accreditation kit that they provided has a blank page with the heading, `Accreditation fees and charges'. But there is no information in it. They provide you with a kit with all the information about what you have to do, but 
 there is no indication of how much they are going to charge you.</para><para>The government has not been honest enough to state what accreditation fees would be introduced, and the providers have not been able to assess properly what impact the fees would have on their operations. It must also be remembered that the fee proposed by the amendment is not the only cost incurred by providers. Facilities may need to introduce new quality control and management systems, provide training to staff, and purchase new IT systems.</para><para>A recent survey of providers in my state indicates that the total cost of accreditation may be in the order of $50,000 per facility. This is a very real issue of viability for small providers. It would be tragic if the implementation of an accreditation system designed to ensure the maintenance of standards in the aged care industry was responsible for the erosion of those standards of care by forcing facilities to devote funds to the process of gaining accreditation under the government's new system.</para><para>The opposition is concerned that this measure represents another step in the government's attempt to cut funds to the residential aged care sector and pursue its policy of user pays in aged care. The government imposed fees on the residents in 1997, and it is now seeking to impose user-pays fees on the providers. It is shifting responsibility for the cost of aged care from the Commonwealth onto both the providers and the clients of aged care services in this country.</para><para>At the time the new charges were introduced in 1997, the government claimed that they were intended to cover capital improvements in the industry. The money raised by the infamous $12 a day accommodation charge will not raise the funds necessary for capital improvements in the aged care sector. Providers indicate that the amount raised by this charge is in the order of $240 million over five years, yet the minimum funds required for capital improvements are in the order of $400 million to $500 million. There is a shortfall of over $250 million in the funding that will be provided for the capital 
 improvements that everyone accepts are necessary in the industry.</para><para>This shortfall is exacerbated by the actions of the government which, in 1998-99, cut funding for capital assistance to residential aged care facilities by approximately $13 millionâa 29 per cent cut in funding for this item. The government has also failed to highlight that funding for services to rural, remote and other special groups was cut by $5.4 million in the 1998-99 budget, which represented a 27 per cent cut in funding for this item.</para><para>If the government members who spoke in support of this bill in the House are true to their commitment to a user-pays system in the aged care sector, they will clearly have to support moves to increase the $12 per day accommodation charge. One of the reasons why we are expressing concern today is that we fear that the government will again seek to make amendments to the accommodation charges for aged care in this country. They are faced with the realisation that the funding measures they have introduced will not meet the capital needs of the industry. They know that the political settlement they reached late last yearâin the final announcement prior to the electionâwill not meet the capital shortfall needs of the industry.</para><para>We are concerned that the government are actively reconsidering upping those charges. The whole logic of their approach of user pays, reflected in this bill, means that they will once again have to consider the issue of funding for nursing homes in this country and, if they are true to their user-pays approach, they will have to increase the charges for residents to meet those capital improvements. We are concerned that this is a continuation of the trend of shifting the costs onto the users of aged care services in Australia. However, it may also represent a reconsideration by the government of the charges that will need to be made, because they have pulled the accreditation issue out of the aged care reform package that we were promised in legislation, and have sought only to introduce this measure at this time.</para><para>We believe the charges will need to be increased if the government's intention of 
 using the accommodation charge to fully fund capital improvements is to be achieved. The shortfall is obvious, the problem is obvious, and the government's failure to provide any information on this issue in recent months is cause for great concern. We know that the providers are lobbying the government for an increase in the accommodation charge. The fact that the aged care amendment bill has not been introduced and that this bill has been introduced in a piecemeal way gives us real concern that the government is actively reconsidering increasing the charges.</para><para>Given all these concerns, I am not sure why the  Aged Care Amendment (Accreditation Agency) Bill 1998  has been rushed into this place in this way. There should have been more time for the government to make clear what fees were to be introduced. The accreditation charges to be levied could have been put out as a discussion document and there could have been proper consultation with the industry. We could then have had this debate today in the context of knowing exactly what charges were to be levied on the industry. That could have formed part of the debate.</para><para>We do not have that information, and yet we are looking at introducing enabling legislation that allows the government to charge fees to providers without any real idea of the level of fee to be charged, without any real idea of the impact on the industry, and without any real idea of the impact, therefore, on the services provided to clients. As I say, of particular concern to us is the impact on small providers as they try to deal with the accreditation system.</para><para>We think the government should continue to provide funding for the accreditation agency, at least for the first round of the accreditation process. This would allow many providers to go through that first round of accreditation, but would not require them to pay a potentially crippling fee on top of the many other expenses that will be incurred in trialling the new accreditation regime. It must be remembered that this is very much a trial of a new scheme. We support the move to accreditation, but we think we will have to monitor its effectiveness, and it is very much a question of seeing how it goes.</para><para>The issue of any fee that might be charged by the accreditation agency should be re-examined in the light of the first accreditation round and after the impact of the many other changes that this sector has recently faced have been taken into consideration. This sector has been badly knocked around and, in suffering reform fatigue, it is in need of some stability and surety. We think that this bill, by forcing them into unknown territory without proper consultation and without proper reassurance about the level of fees, is a very unwise move.</para><para>We support the maintenance of standards in aged care. We are opposing the bill on the basis that we think that the requirement that the industry pay perhaps over $30 million to administer the standards is not a reasonable impost, given the history of developments in this industry in recent times. We think that the transfer of responsibility for this process to the providers will lead to a reduction in the funds available to provide services to residents. It will particularly be a problem for small providers, and it may lead potentially to a reduction in the standard of care provided to residents.</para><para>Until our concerns about those matters can be addressed, we will be opposing the bill. We think it more appropriate that the government provide a draft schedule of fees, discuss the issue widely with the industry and then bring the bill before the parliament rather than seek to have the parliament give it a blank cheque to say, `Yes, you can set whatever fee level you think appropriate,' and hope that it all works out fineâhope that the agency does address the concerns of small providers and hope that the agency does provide a system which is not going to be a burden on industry. We think we would be abrogating our responsibilities if we took that approach. We think it far more appropriate that the government do the job first and then introduce the legislation in the parliament when it has a full knowledge of what the impact of the move will be.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>1044</page.no><name role="metadata">Woodley, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WOODLEY</name><name.id>HX5</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe bill we are debating today, the <inline ref="r610">Aged Care Amendment (Accreditation Agency) Bill 1998</inline> , is a bill that puts enables the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation 
 Agency to do a very necessary thing, and that is to charge aged care services fees for accreditation to enable it to partly fund its operation. The point is, of course, that from 2001 all aged care services must be accredited in order to receive Commonwealth subsidy for the provision of aged care. The government has established the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency to manage the accreditation of aged care services. We agree with the government and with the Labor Party that it is very necessary that these things should be properly accredited and properly accountable.</para></talk.start><para>I think all of us are concerned with this issue because all of us have relatives who are aged and therefore require this kind of assistance or assistance through other government measures, or we ourselves know that one day we will face the need for this kind of help. So there is no doubt about it that aged care is an issue that involves all of us, either by proxy or directly. This bill seeks to enable the agency to partly fund its operations through a fee.</para><para>I want to point out that the amendment does not set the level of fees for aged care services. That will be set through subordinate legislation, through regulations. We understand that those regulations will be subject to disallowance. We agree with the Labor Party that it really is a pig in a poke for the industry to be hearing that fees will be imposed but not to know what the level of the fees might be. But they are separate issues, and the Democrats do support the establishment of the agency and the ability of the agency to fund itself partly through this particular method. We will, however, be very careful to scrutinise the subordinate legislation, the regulations, which will set those fees. If necessary, we will certainly be involved in disallowing that schedule of fees if they are not realisticârealistic in terms of funding for the agency but, even more importantly, realistic in terms of the ability of the industry to cope with the level of fees charged. So the minister might address in his speech or in the committee stage the question of disallowance, that we have the assurance that we will have the ability to disallow the fee level if it is not in 
 line with what the Democrats believe is a fair thing.</para><para>The other issue which the Labor Party has raised is one which is also very important to me personally but also to the Democrats as well. That is the effect on small rural and remote communities and the ability of their services to pay fees when most of them are really struggling to maintain, in the government's words, their own aged folk within their own communities. The working title for some of these reforms that I think the Senate would remember was the title `Ageing in Place'. The Democrats very strongly endorse that concept, that not only should people be able to enter a facility and stay within that one place but also they should be able to enter aged care institutions within their geographic location, particularly for rural communities. People in rural areas who want to stay there ought to be able to do so and not have to be sent, or even have to make the choice to travel, hundreds of kilometres from where they have lived all their lives and where they have the support of friends and relatives, which are things that are very important to them.</para><para>The whole idea of ageing in place was one which we endorsed very strongly, and we want to make sure that for those small communities and those small services in those areas the fee structure will not inhibit their ability to operate when we know that many of them are really stretched in terms of their ability even at the present time. So another question to the minister to address is that we have had some assurance that there will be a differentiated fee for small rural and remote services, and we really do need on the record a very strong assurance that that will be so. Then, of course, once the regulations are put in place we will look at the schedule of fees to see if that is so.</para><para>We understand that the Labor Party will oppose the bill. As I have listened to the debate, I have had some sympathy for that position. But we believe that they are confusing two issues at this point. The two issues are whether or not the agency should be able to fund itself through a fee structure and the 
 level of fees themselves. We believe that we need to separate those two issues.</para><para>From our conversations, the feedback that we get from the industry is divided. But, on balance, the feedback is that the industry does believe that the agency should go ahead and that it should be able to charge fees but that, once the fees have been set, if they are too high we certainly need to have the ability to disallow them. So we would separate those two issuesâas they are separate in terms of the legislation and the regulationsâand we will support the legislation, although we will certainly listen to the debate. I know the Labor Party have amendments. I will be listening carefully to the justification for those amendments. At this stage I would not rule out supporting them, but we will need to hear the reasons for them. At this stage, however, the Democrats will support this legislation because we believe the principle is right.</para><para>Most of the groups to whom we spoke believe that giving the accreditation agency the ability to charge fees needs to be seen as a separate issue to the level of the fees themselves. Certainly that was the feedback we got from Aged Care Australia and Community Services Australia of the Uniting Church. They believe this legislation should be passed because, without the ability to charge for services, the accreditation process itself may fall over. As the Labor Party have said, nobody wants that to happen. We want the accreditation process to go ahead because that is absolutely critical.</para><para>Those are the issues on which we need to hear from the government. We understand the Labor Party's position in respect of their philosophy on aged care; that is, that the Commonwealth should be responsible for the total funding of aged care. We have had this debate on quite a number of occasions. The Democrats do not agree with that because we are simply aware of the reality of the tremendous cost which is involved. We have also said that we know there are people who are quite willing and able to make a contribution to their own care and their own accommodation in their old age. We would not want to inhibit those people from also contributing 
 and therefore, in a sense, cross-subsidising the people who are unable to pay.</para><para>The Senate would be aware of the work that the Democrats did with the major churches in establishing the subsidy for financially disadvantaged residents. I understand that that part of the reforms is the one part that is really working well. I understand that in most institutions there is no need for the mandatory level of financially disadvantaged residents and that most institutions are exceeding that because the $12 a day subsidy is actually working very well. We are pleased about that.</para><para>I need to put on the record that we do not altogether accept the Labor Party's position that the Commonwealth has to totally fund aged care. If, in an ideal world, that were possible, we would accept it. But I noted that even the Labor Party did not actually promise in their election policy on aged care to fund adequately the amount which would have been needed for the infrastructure upgrades. That really meant that the Labor Party were saying it was not really possible to do it totally through government funding.</para><para>That was one of the problems that we saw with the Labor Party's policy. In an ideal world we would endorse it, but in the real world there are those who are willing and able to pay for their accommodation in their old age. We believe there should be at least an ability for them to do so, while endorsing very strongly the subsidy which we helped to negotiate for financially disadvantaged residents.</para><para>The Democrats will be supporting this legislation. We will listen to the case for any reasonable amendments to it and at that time we will respond. But, in principle, the legislation has our support while we signal that, once the level of fees are established and providing that they are a disallowable instrument, we will certainly want to return to the debate about whether or not the fees which are set are fair. We certainly will want to have an assurance onâand will monitor very carefullyâthe effect of fees on rural, remote and small services.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>1046</page.no><name role="metadata">Gibbs, Sen Brenda</name><name role="display">Senator GIBBS</name><name.id>6L6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to speak on the <inline ref="r610">Aged Care Amendment (Accreditation Agency) Bill 1998</inline> which, to my mind, is just another aspect of this government's relentless attack on the elderly. On the surface, the bill seems reasonable enough. No-one would argue that there should not be an agency defending and ensuring a high standard of care within aged care facilities. However, it is the uncertainty surrounding the exact monetary implications of this measure that should be of particular concern. The Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency is currently funded by grants made under the Aged Care Act. The bill before us seeks to enable the agency to charge fees for its accreditations, allowing it to recover costs. The problem is that the government has refused to give any solid indication of what these fees might be.</para></talk.start><para>The fees must not be such as to amount to taxation but, beyond that rather vague assertion, we are completely in the dark as to what an accreditation might cost. Understandably enough, it has been fairly difficult for service providers to assess the impact the accreditation fee might have when they have no idea how much that fee might be. It has therefore been virtually impossible for anyone to gauge the impact of this bill.</para><para>If the fee is low the impact will be minimal. However, if the fee is implemented at a higher level, some small service providers could be forced out of business. The bill allows the agency to set fees at any level without parliamentary control. The government's failure to reveal the fee or even a possible range of prices has created an atmosphere of considerable uncertainty and apprehension among service providers. Hence, this bill has become just another example of this government's smoke and mirrors approach to reforming the aged care sector. They continue to speak in notional rather than specific terms and their policies fail to outline funding arrangements that will ultimately determine the survival or failure of small service providers in particular. It is the smaller service providers who will be hit hardest by this new measure, no matter what the fee ends up being.</para><para>At the moment, 50 per cent of nursing homes have fewer than 41 beds and many of these smaller facilities are in rural and remote 
 areas. Submissions to the current productivity inquiry into nursing home subsidies have indicated that nursing homes need at least 60 beds to operate efficiently under the government's regime. Given this fact, it does not take a rocket scientist to work out that there are quite a few service providers struggling to survive in this environment. How are these facilities expected to endure further decreases in Commonwealth funding? They will, under this measure, have another substantial cost to consider. The only trouble is they cannot even consider it at the moment because the government is refusing to tell them how much the fee will be.</para><para>I imagine that at the moment this bill represents a considerable nightmare for small service providers. They have not been able to lobby against it because, without knowing the cost, they cannot say how many facilities will be affected. At the same time, they are unable to reassure residents that everything will be all right because, quite frankly, they do not know. They do not know whether they will be there after this bill goes through. It is impossible to tell. Even if this government does not care about the service providers, what about the residents? How do you think those people feel, knowing that they may not have a home after this measure is implemented? They probably will have a home, they might have a home but, then again, they might not.</para><para>If 50 per cent of nursing homes have fewer than 41 beds, and 60 is the commercially viable number, then this measure will undoubtedly hit small providers very hard. Many of these facilities are in rural and remote areas and their closure would have a terrible impact on rural communities which are already losing government services right, left and centre. Older people in country centres have a lot to lose if their small service providers go under. Not only will they be faced with the difficult decision to leave the family home when they need more care but in many instances this may necessitate leaving town as well. Older people often put off leaving the family home, even when maintaining it becomes too much, because they do not want to leave behind the security and independence it represents.</para><para>Imagine what a daunting prospect such a move would become if they also had to consider leaving their immediate family and friends. The government simply has not considered some of the practical implications for country people of its bill. Many older couples are separated by illness for long periods of time. Often, if one becomes frail or needs to recover from some sort of treatment, they will enter a nursing home while their spouse stays in the family home. Obviously, it is very important that these people remain in close contact in order to make the whole experience less stressful. Imagine trying to recover from a major operation with your husband or wife  hundreds of kilometres away. Worse still, imagine trying to care for and maintain contact over such a distance with a spouse suffering from Alzheimer's.</para><para>Taking facilities from country areas will only exacerbate older people's phobia of nursing homes. No-one wants to leave their family home until they have to. If elderly country folk also have to abandon their families to get the professional care they need, I doubt many of them will ever want to receive it. This bill therefore represents just another aspect of this government's cruelty to elderly Australians. Once again, the Howard government has failed to disclose the full implications of its initiative, thereby veiling it in uncertainty. Elderly Australians deserve some certainty when it comes to aged care. It is highly irresponsible of this government to continue to shroud its policies in ambiguity when the specifics are what ultimately will determine the impact on smaller service providers, particularly in rural and remote areas.</para><para>The government has continued to confuse and upset older Australians who are already reeling from the implementation of accommodation charges that have threatened the security of their family home. They continue to refer to `options' and `choices' as though older people choose to enter nursing home care on a whim. Often older people are forced into such `choices' as a result of sudden serious illness. The last thing they need is to be forced away from their relatives and friends at such an unsettling time. Therefore, 
 the threat posed by the mystery accreditation fee is certainly real and quite substantial.</para><para>Adding to the uncertainty of service providers is the fact that this may not be the only new expense they incur. Accreditation under the act will be compulsory if they are to continue to receive government subsidies from January 2001. However, the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency is a relatively new body that many service providers have not dealt with before.</para><para>The new accreditation procedure could result in some facilities incurring substantial costs before they can become accredited. Facilities may need to introduce new quality control and management systems, update IT systems or implement any number of changes as a result of the new regime. Imagine the implications this might have on smaller service providers. Not only will they have to come up with the accreditation fee, but they might also have to undertake significant expenditure to ensure they comply with the new rules. Surely it would have been more sensible to maintain funding to the agency under the Aged Care Act until service providers had time to adjust to the changes.</para><para>Some service providers have indicated that the full cost of accreditation could end up being around $50,000. This would certainly be enough to undermine the financial viability of those smaller facilities already teetering on the brink. The irony of this situation is that the agency set up to ensure standards in aged care might actually end up effectively undermining them. Even if smaller facilities survive the changes, the threat to services is not eliminated. If small providers are forced to institute new administrative and management procedures under the new system, they may have to reallocate funds set aside for services or capital spending. Therefore, funds could end up being diverted away from services for residents. This would certainly undermine the objective of ensuring service standards in the aged care industry.</para><para>Without being able to put a price on the fee, it is certainly difficult to gauge the extent of its potential impact. But then why would the government seek to make anything clearer at this stage? They have consistently sought 
 to confuse the issue of aged care, refusing to be tied down on any details or specifics. This government have continued to keep Australians in the dark on aged care. Indeed, they seem reluctant to divulge even the most basic and necessary of information for the elderly. Even publications designed to make the changes clear are an exercise in ambiguity and deception.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Home &amp; Residence Choices for Older People</inline> is a Department of Social Security publication designed to give the elderly practical information about their aged care options. This book was supposed to make the government's aged care changes clear so that older people could make informed decisions about their future. However, the 1997 edition of <inline font-style="italic">Home &amp; Residence Choices for Older People</inline> was outdated within about four months. So rapid and confusing were the government's changes to aged care that even the department could not keep up with them. We are yet to see the 1998 edition of <inline font-style="italic">Home &amp; Residence Choices for Older People</inline>. Obviously, the relevant departments are still endeavouring to fathom the changes. The point is that this publication was supposed to be an effort on behalf of this government to make the changes to aged care clear. It was supposed to clarify things, and yet it has succeeded in confusing the issue even further. The 1997 edition is worthless now and the department has failed to produce a new one.</para><para>DSS spent $24,000 on market testing alone for the 1997 edition. They must have thought it was an important publication then, so where is it now? And, if <inline font-style="italic">Home &amp; Residence Choices for Older People</inline> is not available, where are older people supposed to get this information from? No wonder they are feeling worried and confused.</para><para>Perhaps the government should stop trying to rush through massive changes to the aged care sector and start to think about the impact they are actually having on the elderly within our community. Older people are more apprehensive than ever about entering aged care facilities of any kind. I find it particularly disturbing that this government seems reluctant to offer them even basic information that could reassure them.</para><para>The  Aged Care Amendment (Accreditation Agency) Bill 1998  will serve to further undermine older people's confidence in the aged care sector as a whole. The government's blatant refusal to reveal the cost of the accreditation fee has left many smaller service providers in a position where they are unable to reassure residents. Surely this is unnecessarily cruel and unfair to both parties.</para><para>All of this is taking place within a framework that is completely untested. The accreditation process is being worked through for the first time and the effectiveness of the agency itself is yet to be assessed. Service providers are bound to incur all sorts of expenses associated with the implementation of the new accreditation scheme. It is highly inappropriate that the government is trying to force them to pay to participate in what is actually a trial of its own new system.</para><para>This government has done nothing but create confusion and disarray with its so-called reforms to the aged care sector. It has created and maintained an environment of uncertainty and apprehension and older people no longer know where to turn for help. They have been denied vital information about their aged care options and this measure will only serve to confuse the issue further.</para><para>Smaller country facilities will almost certainly be threatened by the implementation of the accreditation fee, yet this government will not even give them an indication of cost so that they might be able to assess and prepare for the implications. The government has not provided enough information about this measure to the people concerned; they are hoping to rush it through as an idea and determine the specifics later. This is simply not acceptable considering the potential implications, particularly for country areas.</para><para>The Howard government needs to stop approaching aged care issues in such an underhanded way if they are ever to restore any confidence in the sector. If older Australians need to access aged care facilities in times of illness or frailty, they should be able to do so with confidence and without trepidation. I will never support a measure that seeks to deny them that security.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Sherry)</name></talker><para>âSenator West.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>1049</page.no><name role="metadata">West, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator WEST</name><name.id>1X4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMr Acting Deputy President, this is the first time I have been on my feet when you have been in the chair, so congratulations on the extension of your role.</para></talk.start><para>In joining in this debate, I do so with a fair degree of sadness. I am very pleased to see that this government is concerned about accreditation standards, but this  Aged Care Amendment (Accreditation Agency) Bill 1998  follows the traditional path of alterations and changes regarding aged care that this government has followed for the last 2Â½ years. The history of these legislative changes is littered with uncertainty and a lack of consultation.</para><para>This has been the situation since the very first days when the government laid the first aged care bill on the table for the community and the industry to comment on it. For how long did the bill lie on the table for comment? Ten days. And then, when we actually read the bill, we found that a whole lot of key parts of the legislation were missing. This was legislation by drip-feed with short periods in which to respond. The key partsâthe key determinants which the industry needed to know so they could make their decisions and make comments on things such as what was going to be included in the classification scales of patientsâwere continuing to be left out.</para><para>We had the debacle of the entry fees. There was only going to be a small amount to be paid, but the government would not put a top figure on it. We had the debacle where for five days people who were to be admitted into nursing homes  had to pay an up-front bond, but that was then changed to a fee.</para><para>The government has not managed to get right the whole reform process that they have undertaken. They have always left consultation with the industry until too late. The consultations with the industry have been totally inadequate, and the industry has not been given adequate time. The government has not taken into consideration what the industry has been saying. Therefore, they have had to come back and say, `Oops, we have made a mistake; we will have to amend 
 it.' Wouldn't it have been better for this government to have got its act together on aged care reforms and for it to have talked with all sectors of the industry? When I talk about the industry, I do not mean just nursing home proprietors, of which there is a wide range of categoriesâthe for profit sector, the not for profit sector, the charitable sector and some state government run homesâbut I also mean those people who provide the care, the nursing care and the ancillary and support care, and those people who are the recipients of that care. That is what the industry comprises.</para><para>But this government has not seen fit to go and talk with the whole industry. One wonders if they only talk with the one part of the industry which happens to be a big donor to the Liberal Party. Now I might be wrong there; it might be mischievous of me to contemplate that. But the lack of consultation that has taken place regarding this particular bill is nothing new. If the advisers in the box opposite care to think back, they could tell the minister, when he speaks, about the short periods of time that have been allowed, throughout all this aged care reform process undertaken by the government, for the industry to comment on the various changes and different aspects. It will be very clearly borne out that this government is not about consultation. They do not care.</para><para>Another aspect of this particular bill relates to the fee. What is it going to be? This issue arose with accommodation bonds. Nobody could tell us what the fee was going to be. It was buying a pig in a poke then, and again this is buying a pig in a poke. The industry does not know. A lot of Commonwealth money has been cut out of the industry. It has been forced to become a lot more self-sufficient; it has had to meet many more costs.</para><para>When you talk to the industry you find that viability is becoming more and more stretched and more and more uncertain. This is happening more and more with the smaller institutions, and particularly with those in regional areas. It would not take very much consultation with the industry to enable those problems to be reported back to the government. I suggest that it would do this government the 
 world of good if they could actually go out and talk to institutions in those areas because they would learn very quickly about their problems. Financially, these institutions cannot afford to be forced into situations where they do not know what their costs will be. This does not make good business sense. Whether they be for profit or not for profit, these people still have to run to budgets; they still have to negotiate with the lenders or financial institutions that they work with.</para><para>How can any organisation that does not know what the financial cost to them is going to be make proper and correct assessments and do their budgets? They cannot do it. Yet this government expects this whole industry to do that, to go and buy a pig in a poke. They are being forced to sign up for somethingâI accept that accreditation is essentialâwhen they do not know what the costs will be.</para><para>As Senator Evans said earlier, the income of these organisations is fixed. This government is making sure that their outgoings are not fixed. Their outgoings are increasing all the time. How do you make A equal B, which it has to do in this situation, or those organisations will become non-viable and be forced to close? You reduce the outgoings, which means that in nursing homes you do not employ registered nurses. You put enrolled nurses in. You bodgie up the paperwork so that it looks like you have adequate enrolled nurses, or you put personal care assistants in. You employ people at cheaper rates. You employ people with lesser skills.</para><para>The booklet to which Senator Gibbs referred states only that nursing procedures `may' be carried out by registered nurses. This government is not prepared to give any guarantee that registered nurses will carry out those duties which registered nurses should be performing. This government does not care about that. So there will be a reduction in standards. Either that or you have an increase in the income to nursing homes. This government sure as hell is not going to put any more into them because all it can do is cut funding. Therefore, the daily fee will rise. It has to be one of the two. You cannot have it both ways. The nursing homes will either have to cut 
 their service level, which will impact upon accreditation, or they will have to force a rise in the fee. Those are pretty basic elementary management and accountability figures.</para><para>The industry has concerns about the costs of accreditation. We have heard figures of $5,000-$10,000 mentioned. When you throw another couple of thousand dollars onto the cost of paying for the accreditation agency, you are talking about $7,000-$12,000. That sort of money is way beyond the means of many small institutions. This government does not look at those situations. It is not looking at the impact on smaller institutions, particularly when in some of these facilities there is multiskilling and a dual role for individuals. In a small hostel or nursing home, the registered nurse will be undertaking administrative work as well as caring for patients. All of this will increase the administrative work. When does he or she get to spend an adequate amount of time with the patients? That question has not been answered.</para><para>Many of these small institutions will have problems with training. They have only one entity, as a cleaner maybe or as a cook. Maybe the cook shares the job with somebody else. There will be only one person doing laundry and that person may be doing another job as well. When these people are sent on training, there is no way that, in a town of 300 or 400 people with a 16-bed facility, they can invite the trainers to go to their institution. How could they afford to do that?</para><para>These people have to be sent away if, regionally, there is a training day on. That is fine for a large institution which has a number of people; it can afford to send somebody. But if a small institution has to send people 20 or 30 miles down the track to the centre where the training day is being conductedâbecause more institutions are involved, it will be more centralised and there will be less cost to get the trainer thereâhow does it send off for one day or part of a day its one and only cook? How does it send off for the day its one and only laundry person or its one and only cleaner? How does it send off one part of two personal care assistants? If an RN is doing administration as well as patient care, 
 how does an institution send off the administrative part of its RN to another town, which may be only 20 or 30 miles away, and leave the care part behind?</para><para>All of this will add to the complexity and the cost of running these institutions. While people are away from these institutions, there have to be replacements. That means the institutions will have to find another lot of wages. This government does not seem to comprehend the cost impact of this measure upon many of these institutions. It is totally callous, uncaring and cruel of this government to plough on with bits and pieces of this legislation without consultation and without telling the industry what the fee level will be.</para><para>I have a letter that was written to the editor of Gunnedah's <inline font-style="italic">Namoi Valley Independent</inline> of 1 October. The letter is from Susan Lyle of the Gunnedah Nursing Home, Sister Judith Carney of McAuley Hostel, and Dawn Beard of Alkira Hostel. They express concern, seek the support of the community and call for a fair share for aged care. The letter goes on to state:</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Care for the aged, in the community for as long as possible, and, when required, in quality residential care staffed by a full complement of trained and caring staff, is a right for all older Australians. It is a responsibility for the whole community, whether they live in urban, regional or Rural Australia.</inline></para><para><inline font-style="italic">These rights maybe at risk, together with the jobs of those providing care for the aged, unless more funds are provided to upgrade or replace facilities to meet newly imposed building standards, and to meet new accreditation policies. Failure to respond will also detrimentally affect the economy of Gunnedah.</inline></para><para>This sort of material could be written about many small to medium size communities around New South Wales. I cannot talk about other states because I do not move around those states. This is the sort of plea that I keep hearing throughout New South Wales as I move around and talk to those in aged care institutions and facilities. I make a point of visiting them while I am in those communities; I have a great deal of interest in this matter because I think the government has made an unholy mess of it.</para><para>Accreditation is vitally important, but there is this absolute obsession with user pays. We know that less than 10 per cent of the population will use any of the aged care facilities. They are going to force that 10 per cent to foot the bill rather than consider the fact that the whole of the community has a responsibility for the provision of aged care in their community and in this country. This blind adherence to user pays is being illustrated very classically here, with the sort of burden that it places upon a group of people who are really not in a position to be able to afford it.</para><para>The cost of accreditation, as I keep saying, needs to be borne in mind. Many of the facilities need to upgrade their information technology because this government wants a bit of a paper chase. If they can provide the pieces of paper, then they are fine. They are not looking at what is being given.</para><para>With regard to the daily fees, I have had complaints from a number of facilities about the amount of additional administrative work that has been placed on them with the Australian dollar flip flopping around, particularly in regard to clients who are in receipt of British pensions. They are receiving letters almost weekly or fortnightly from the department altering the fee schedule that the client is having to pay. This involves extra administrative work for the institution. When you have someone who has got dementia, how do you explain to them that this week the payment is going to be such and such and next week or last week it was different? The government has not thought about these matters. It has not comprehended that over 50 per cent of people in nursing homes have some form of dementia. Every imposition they place upon the industry means that more time is taken away from the actual delivery of care, from the provision of care, support and loving nurturing, and is put behind a desk. It is not a very bright move on the part of this government.</para><para>We also know that the Productivity Commission has still to bring down its final report about fees, charges and other issues in relation to aged care. So why the hurry for this? Why not wait until you have got everything organised and have consulted the industry 
 before you bring in something different, a change, particularly when the government cannot or will not tell us what the fee is?</para><para>I am aware of rural communities where nursing homes or hostels have elected to come under the same umbrella, to be almost taken over by another non-profit group, so that they can have economies of scale, so that there is only one administrative section for those particular institutions. Is this what the government is aiming for? They actually want amalgamations to take place so that you have large organisations, large facilities, which get more impersonal. That is possible; you can do that in communities of a significant size. But I go back to communities like Carcoar, Condobolin, Trundle, Tullamore, Tottenham, Trangie and Warren. What is this going to do for them? It is certainly not going to help their administration.</para><para>They agree with accreditation. Everybody agrees with accreditation. Where we have differences of opinion is with the consultation which this government has not undertaken and the fact that it is expecting the industry to buy a pig in a poke, to sign up for something when they cannot be given any indication of what the fee is going to be. If $36 million is needed, how do you get that? It is going to take quite a deal of money from the individuals. It is of concern to many people. It is of concern to me that we run the risk, if they are not going to be allowed an income increase, if their outgoings are going to increase, of seeing a decrease in standards of care given to our elderly people. The elderly of Australia deserve more than this.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>1052</page.no><name role="metadata">Denman, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator DENMAN</name><name.id>FY5</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âNo-one would object to measures aimed at increasing the level of care given to the elderly. They, more than most, deserve our support and care in their later years. After all, they fought and died for us and gave this country a foundation to build upon. The <inline ref="r610">Aged Care Amendment (Accreditation Agency) Bill 1998</inline>  merely creates an illusion of increasing that standard level of care. In its current form, that is all that it isâan illusion.</para></talk.start><para>Accreditation can be a useful tool to achieve minimum standards of care, but this 
 can only be achieved if the measure is clear and implementation well considered. As the bill stands, none of these basic requirements are present. A major deficit in the legislation, causing insecurity within the sector, is that there is no indication of the costs of the implementation of this accreditation to the various providers.</para><para>Stability, both emotional and financial, is vital in a sector, and this is particularly true of community services. If the community service providers of that care are insecure, it will inevitably flow on from even the most professional of providers of care to the clients. This ill-conceived amendment is creating this insecurity because the costs of its implementation are not known. What is known is that there are hidden costs associated with the implementation of the standardised service delivery standards. These costs include employing within their budget the additional administration time, and the time to observe and report, that all accreditation systems require, particularly at their instigation. Secondly, accreditation often incurs additional staff training costs both for learning how to implement the new system and for the additional training which may be required for staff to lift their skills to meet the required standard.</para><para>These are just a few of the hidden costs associated with the amendments proposed by the government. This bill is an example of how ill-conceived plans may actually contribute to a reduction in the standards that the amendment is seeking to redress. My home state of Tasmania has a large population of people requiring aged care. Thus the provision of aged care is an industry in our state that supplies employment for many people. While our regional and rural economy has many disadvantages, it can provide a special environment for caring for the aged. A moderate climate and a gentle pace of life contribute to idyllic circumstances to care for the elderly. However, this bill in its current form does not allow for the needs of the rural and regional sector, where economies of scale may cause prohibitive costsâfor example, resident classification procedures that are too rigid to work practically in smaller residential hostels.</para><para>There are many other factors that can create additional costs to supplying care in regional Australia. Given this government's history of ill-conceived regional policy, combined with their apparent inadequacy when factoring in the needs of rural Australia, I can understand why many providers are extremely apprehensive about this bill.</para><para>The extent of the negative impact of this bill will differ from state to state. Each state has its own awards and regulations and the costs of implementing any of the changes could vary considerably. There appears to be no recognition of this at all in the amendment. I have had numerous communications expressing the insecurity of the sector not only on behalf of the organisations and their employees involved in the sector but also from the children of the elderly, who are also expressing their concerns. These concerns relate not only to the cost of providing the care but also to the need for reassurance that the costs associated with this bill will not mean the closure of some of these facilities, thereby endangering the health of the elderly.</para><para>In some cases this could result in the elderly moving from the district where they have spent most of their lives. This could have a serious detrimental effect if the elderly face a reduction in choice and are further isolated by the possible closure of the smaller rural hostels. This bill arrives just after another superficially conceived resident classification scale that resulted in immediate calls for review from the government's own partnersâthe former National Party government in Queenslandâbecause it represented a substantial reduction in revenue from the Commonwealth that will have to be picked up either by the state government or by the elderly.</para><para>Largely as a result of this government, Tasmania cannot afford the transfer of the revenue base the reclassification represented. But when you see this amendment in its true light, you see that it also represents a transfer of cost away from the Commonwealth, which is currently responsible for the cost of monitoring standards via the Department of Health and Aged Care to the industry. Thus, the elderly and their families will inevitably pay 
 the cost of accreditation, as the state cannot afford the additional burden and the industry can in no way soak up this cost that could amount to $10,000, just for the accreditation fee. This does not include the costs that may be incurred by satisfying the demands of accreditation, which may be as much as $50,000 for standards to be met. Is it any wonder there are many smaller facilities in Tasmania that are seriously contemplating closure, when presented with the never-ending cost liabilities this government has been imposing on the elderly?</para><para>The inability of the industry to absorb this cost becomes clear when we acknowledge that the industry has been savaged to the tune of $500 million in lost revenue since this government came into office. This does not include the additional losses the elderly have incurred in terms of service provision by losing dental care, choice in medication and numerous other erosions of benefits this government is responsible for.</para><para>Thus, aged care is in crisis, as are many other institutions since this government came to power. However, the elderly are particularly vulnerable and, as illustrated by my colleagues' illuminating communications over the past days, the elderly who live in regional and rural states such as my own are even more so. They are disadvantaged by ill-considered, superficial policies. Due to economies of scale, reductions in funding, transfer of cost away from the Commonwealth onto the elderly and a looming cloud of the GST, they will not have their day in the sun. Instead, due to this government, they are in real danger of being dislocated, penniless and cold.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>1054</page.no><name role="metadata">Tambling, Sen Grant</name><name role="display">Senator TAMBLING</name><name.id>6E4</name.id><electorate>NT</electorate><party>CLP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe Howard government is working hard to ensure that care provided to individual older Australians and the life they experience will be of the highest possible quality. I refer anyone to our election commitments of this year. To do this, we are developing an aged care system that will be sustainable into the next century and is based on a creative partnership between the aged care sector and the government. It is 
 certainly forward looking and looking not only at the needs of the elderly but also at the impact on government for many years to come.</para></talk.start><para>The Aged Care Act of 1997 sets the broad framework for this. That act ensured that older Australians have equitable access to aged care services that provide high-quality standards of care and accommodation. Under the act, the agency will ensure that residential aged care facilities achieve and maintain high standards of care and accommodation. The agency is working with service providers to improve the quality of care outcomes for older Australians and encourage individual service providersâno matter where they are locatedâto improve standards by a process of continuous improvement. It will also take action against services which do not meet care standards.</para><para>The agency represents the fulfilment of a 1996 election commitment when the coalition promised that a new partnership would be developed between the industry and government in improving care standards. Consistent with this theme of partnership and as an expression of this theme the intention is that the agencies should charge fees for accreditation. This is also consistent with other accreditation models.</para><para>I would compare the process that we have undertakenâboth in developing the 1997 act and in making subsequent improvements, including this legislationâwith the consultation that was undertaken by the ALP when it undertook reforms in this area in 1987 with little or no consultation. I am sure many of the providers and many of the aged residents would be very mindful that the consultation process has been inclusive and far-reaching, compared with those of 1987 when Labor certainly did not undertake that process.</para><para>I draw attention to the second reading speech:</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The government consulted widely during development of the Aged Care Act 1997 and associated principles and has listened to the concerns of service providers since the implementation of the government's age care reforms. The establishment and operation of the agency were an outcome of this process. 
</inline></para><para>The explanatory memorandum talks about monitoring and review of the reforms as follows:</para><para><inline font-style="italic">In June 1997 the government made a commitment to undertake ongoing review of the aged care reform policy and its implementation. This review will be undertaken by an independent expert advised by a working group representing stakeholders. It will cover a two-year period from the commencement of the act in October 1997.</inline></para><para>This bill will enable the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency to partially recover its costs by charging a fee to residential care providers who seek accreditation.</para><para>As part of the government's targeting the needs of people in regional Australia, the particular needs of small facilities generally, and particularly those in rural and remote areas, will be taken into account in setting the fees. The minister, Mrs Bishop, has instructed the agency to ensure special treatment of rural and remote homes and small homes generally. Senator Woodley very genuinely raised concerns about fees for rural and remote homes and small homes. We certainly take note of those concerns. Minister Bishop is also very concerned to ensure the viability of these facilities to support their important caring work in regional communities.</para><para>In relation to the accreditation fees, the minister has given instructions to the agency to ensure that rural and remote and small homes are given special treatment. The bill enables the fees to be dealt with in subordinate legislationâthe accreditation grant principles. This was one of the issues referred to by Senator Woodley. The fee structure will be put in place through those principles, which are disallowable instruments. The principles are disallowable instruments by provision of section 96-1(2) of the Aged Care Act 1997 in that regard. This bill provides an opportunity for the fee structure or framework to certainly be scrutinised by senators in the future.</para><para>The impact of aged care services paying a fee will not be a burden. Indeed, there are distinct financial advantages in marketing that accrue to residential care facilities that receive accreditation. The fees will be comparatively modest. I take issue with the point raised by Senator Denman with regard to the new 
 resident funding system. It certainly did not reduce funding. A quite separate study by the Centre for Independent Economics found an increase of over $160 million a year.</para><para>The passing of this bill by parliament will enable the agency to fulfil its charter of providing a residential aged care accreditation system that ensures that frail older Australians enjoy a quality of care and a quality of life they deserve. It is important to always recognise that we are in a period of change and this does impact on the elderly in the community. But, importantly, change in technology or efficiency that brings improvement of standards and a quality of care for seniors is certainly something that is a high priority of the Howard government. This forms an important part of the government's policy in putting into place the framework for ensuring that older Australians have quality of life throughout their life. I certainly look forward to the support of the Senate with regard to this legislation.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para><para>Bill read a second time.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>In Committee</title><page.no>1055</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The bill.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>1055</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator CHRIS EVANS</name><name.id>AX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI want to indicate that, contrary to some fears that may have been generated by Senator Woodley's saying that I was about to move a set of amendments, the Labor Party will not be moving any amendments to the <inline ref="r610">Aged Care Amendment (Accreditation Agency) Bill 1998</inline> .

Those two questions were raised by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee with the government. I am not aware that the government has formally responded.

Perhaps interest in the ALP position among Democrat senators might result in even more of them joining our ranks in years to come; but I am not sure that is the actual purpose of today's debate.</para></talk.start><para>This debate is centred on a very small amendment to do with the accreditation agency. In the second reading debate, I raised the broader issues of user-pays and our concern about what is happening in the industry. I think I made it clear in my speech during the second reading stage and, again, in my first contribution to the committee stage, that our opposition to the bill is largely based on concerns about how this is going to operate in practice, rather than the principle of accreditation or, for that matter, Senator Woodley, the principle of some payment from the facilities.</para><para>The key questions are the level of the fees to be paid, how that is to be structured and what impact it will have on the industry. The whole purpose of my contribution was to raise those questions and, quite frankly, I think the parliamentary secretary has failed to respond to those issues adequately.</para><para>I accept your point, Senator Woodley, which I think was well made in the second reading debate, that, in fact, this is a disallowable instrument and so, in some senses, the debate will be held at a later stage about some of those issues. I think that is a fair point to make and one which I totally accept. I suspect the government is now on notice that senators are interested about those issues. When they come to frame the regulation they will no doubt be aware that Senator Woodley and I, as well as Senator Gibbs, Senator West and others, will be taking a close look at it. I accept your point also that, in a sense, this is a debate for another day. But this is our first opportunity to raise those issues, and it is important and proper that we do so.</para><para>I think the parliamentary secretary's response to my question about the Scrutiny of Bills Committee report and the issues raised was totally unsatisfactory. To say that the government does not share the concerns, that it rejects the concerns raised by government senators on the Scrutiny of Bills Committeeâto say, `We don't share that concern, so that is all right'âis totally inadequate. It is not a proper response to the report of a committee of the Senate.</para><para>It goes also to another question I have raised which I now want to pursueâthat is, the question of who is setting the fees. The parliamentary secretary says to us, `The minister has given assurances about the impact on rural and remote facilities.' What does that mean? It implies the minister is not setting the fees but that, in fact, the agency is setting the fees and she has asked them to consider it. Who is setting the fees? The minister; the agency? And who is determining whether those issues are taken into account or whether they are merely vague expressions of view by the government?</para><para>The Scrutiny of Bills Committee question goes to the very heart of our concerns about the whole mechanism to be applied in setting the level of fees and what it means for service and, in particular, small providers. With all due respect to the parliamentary secretary, I do not think that saying you do not share those concerns is enough.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>1057</page.no><name role="metadata">Tambling, Sen Grant</name><name role="display">Senator TAMBLING</name><name.id>6E4</name.id><electorate>NT</electorate><party>CLP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âTwo issues arise from the comments of Senator Evans in this regard. In my previous answer, I referred to the Scrutiny of Bills Committee consideration of this matter and the fact that the department had received a legal advice on that report. Let me read from that advice about the specification of the upper limit on the level of fees:</para></talk.start><para><inline font-style="italic">The committee appears to be concerned that in the absence of any monetary upper limit on the level of fees payable the proposed fees would be characterised as taxes. The effect of item 2 of schedule 1 of the bill, however, is that the proposed fees cannot be set at a rate that would result in the fee being characterised as a tax, nor can the minister determine a method of calculating the rate of fee that would result in the fee being characterised as a tax. Item 2 therefore effectively protects the bill from being characterised as a bill dealing with the imposition of taxation for the purposes of s.55 of the constitution.</inline></para><para><inline font-style="italic">The committee draws attention to a number of bills, now acts, which adopt the approach of providing for a basic level to be set by regulation subject to a statutory minimum rate. The bills mentioned by the committee, however, are all taxation bills. None of those bills dealt with the provisions authorising the imposition of a fee for service. There are numerous examples on the statute books of acts delegating a power to the Governor-General or to another person to determine the level of fee payable for a service in circumstances where there is no statutory maximum rate. See for exampleâ</inline></para><para>a number of quoted cases. The legal evidence to us clearly determined the statement we have made: that this will be a modest cost recovery basis only, not a tax. We have certainly given an undertaking to Senator Woodley with regard to the special considerations that would be made in respect of rural, remote or small homes.</para><para>The second point you raised was who would make the determination. It would obviously be made by the minister on the advice on the agency but, at the end of the day, it is a disallowable instrument in this place.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>1057</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator CHRIS EVANS</name><name.id>AX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI appreciate that advice from the parliamentary secretary. It takes us a bit further than the initial response. It opens 
 up the question of whether we are looking at partial or full cost recovery. The ministerâor at least some of the government speakersâtalked at one stage about full cost recovery. If the agency is required to get full cost recovery that will clearly have a determining effect on the level of fees. But, at the same time, you indicated that concessions will be made for small providers, which indicates that full cost recovery might not be met from them.</para></talk.start><para>Are we saying that there is full cost recovery, are we saying that there is partial cost recovery, or are we saying that you will require larger providers to subsidise the costs associated with accreditation for small providers in order for the agency to meet its global full cost recovery objectives? I am not sure what the government is saying about this matter. Is it clearly the case that you will be providing no budget expenditure for the agency? Will it have full cost recovery?

As I understand it, facilities that fail the certification process will not be able to be accredited. What will occur with facilities that fail the certification process and therefore decide not to seek accreditation? Will those facilities continue to operate until the year 2001, and will they continue to receive funding even if they are not making any effort to be accredited because of their difficulties with certification problems of their facilities? I am trying to get a feel for whether or not we will have a large number of facilities in this situation. As I understand it, 200 or so are having difficulties with reaching certification standards. What is going to occur to them if they decide not to seek accreditation? Will they continue to receive funding for the next couple of years while making no effort, or potentially making no effortâI do not want to cast aspersionsâto meet the accreditation standards that we all accept are desirable?</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>1060</page.no><name role="metadata">Tambling, Sen Grant</name><name role="display">Senator TAMBLING</name><name.id>6E4</name.id><electorate>NT</electorate><party>CLP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI appreciate the issues that are raised and I can understand that they naturally would be areas that people in the community would be concerned about.

Certainly the intent is to have a managed transition which will contemplate and cover the very issues that you are raising.

Perhaps I can pursue the point by asking a simpler question. What recourses are open to the government to ensure maintenance of standards in facilities which do not seek accreditation? After being faced with the documentation, the certification process and the fee for service in terms of accreditation, facilities might decide that they do not want to seek accreditation.

The Senate will recall, as I have reported on it on a number of occasions, the assistance given by the federal government to Newcastle and the Hunter Valley with the shutdown of BHP's 
 steel-making operations. The Senate will recall that the federal government contributed $10 million to a special fund to create projects that were to lead to further employment.</para></talk.start><para>There has been a very thorough investigation of quite a number of projects. Most of these are infrastructure based projects that will actually go on to generate far more jobs than the initial infrastructure. There was some unwarranted criticism from Mr Horne, the member for Paterson, of the $7.1 million that has already been allocated. What Mr Horne has to realise is that we have a situation in Newcastle where not one job has been lost at this point from the downsizing of BHP. The work force has gone down from 2,700 to 2,300 because of people leaving for other employment.</para><para>I would like to put on the record in the Senate that BHP is actually producing more steel with 2,300 workers than they did with 2,800, and they are producing more steel than they did 15 years ago with 11,000 workers. So it is very highly productive at this point in time. But the real crunch for the work effects of the downsizing of BHP will not be felt until September next year, almost a full year away. Therefore, the federal government is taking great care in the projects that it selects to make sure that they are absolutely viable projects, that they will generate initial employment through construction and then much larger multiples of employment through the private infrastructure and the private firms that are set up as a result of the allocation of this $7.1 million.</para><para>It gave me great pleasure two weeks ago, together with the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government, Senator Ian Macdonald, to launch one of these projects in the $10 million fund. This was the Maitland transport hub. It involved an investment of $1.5 million which the government plans to commit. To show you the job generating effect of that, the prospects are in store, once that transport hub is operational, for $30 million to be spent by the private sector and 600 to be jobs created. This is from an initial investment of $1.5 million.</para><para>It is in an area where there is a junction of major roads: the F3 Freeway coming from 
 Sydney, the Pacific Highway going to Brisbane, the New England Highway going north up the valley and the main road into Newcastle. This transport hub is in the centre of all that. It is also on a major section of the northern branch rail line, and these projects will create a hub of rail and road transport businesses in that area and the nearby Holmewood Business Park.</para><para>Blue Ribbon and Mercedes-Benz Freightliner have already signed up for this project as part of that $600 million worth of investment. It is terrific to have Mercedes-Benz Freightliner on board. This is an international company that is now relocating into the Hunter Valley because of the Hunter Advantage Fund money allocated by this federal governmentâand there are many others about to come on board. It does show the commitment of this government to employment within the Hunter Valley region.</para><para>The minister who came to launch the project also moved out to the F3 Freeway to launch that section of road. This was done at the same time and I would like the Senate to record that, over the last few years, this government has allocated the money to finish the road at a much faster pace. It is great for those of us that use that road that this section is now open and the eight kilometres of nightmarish upgraded local road that the previous government left us with for the last seven years, on which there were many deaths and many accidents, is now a thing of the past as part of the national highway system. We now have a proper six-lane freeway on that last eight kilometre section that links the former end of the F3 through to the New England Highway. The Christmas road accident rate will drop because of that terrific improvement in the road.</para><para>The other major development in that regionâand again, this is an area near the end of the F3, and the upgrade of the F3 will actually extend the businesses in the areaâis the Holmewood Business Park development. Right near that hub of transport that I mentioned before at the end of the F3 there is a whole range of new businesses going in. It is interesting to note that a lot of these businesses are actually manufacturing businesses and 
 in the Maitland region we have a situation where manufacturing is actually going up as a percentage of the work force, quite counter to the trend nation wide.</para><para>I had the opportunity recently to go with the Newcastle Business Chamber to Holmewood Business Park, where Newcastle Newspapers, a branch of the Fairfax group, has set up a major production plant for high speed printing of newspapers, not only the <inline font-style="italic">Newcastle Herald</inline> but a range of other newspapers as well. This high tech facility has been located right near this transport hub. So what we have developing at the end of the F3, near Maitland and between Newcastle and Maitland, is a major new region for the development of small businesses. With the downsizing of BHP, small businesses are going to be the saviour of the future.</para><para>I would like in this place to compliment BHP on the way they have handled the proposed downsizing, the fact that they put in place personal case management plans for the futures of the 2,700 employees. They have tracked those people, they have counselled them, they have provided assistance, they have provided training and funded training at the university and the local TAFE so these people can move on to further employment. Those are the people who have not already been re-deployed within other parts of BHP's operations.</para><para>So it is a model to the rest of the business community on how downsizing can be handled. This federal Liberal governmentâtotally outside the $10 million Hunter Advantage Fundâhas allocated other moneys to assist in that process. Projects include the business incubators that are being set up in Maitland, the Lake Macquarie area and Newcastle to help these people take the skills they developed at BHP through into other business ventures.</para><para>We have allocated funding such as $500,000, for example, to the Lake Macquarie Business Park. Two weeks ago I was out in Lake Macquarie launching that business park. An enormous number of business leaders from the community came along to have a look at that program. It is estimated that, with the business incubator in Lake Macquarie, 
 over the next five years 500 jobs will be generated. Again, that is from an initial investment by this government of $500,000.</para><para>I would like to compliment BHP on its role in that, too, because they put in $200,000 as well. They have shown themselves to be very responsible corporate citizens. The government is strategically locating these business incubators in those areas of the Hunter region which are going to be mainly affected by the downsizing of BHP. People tend to think it is a Newcastle problem, but about a third of the BHP work force live in the City of Newcastle, about another third live in the City of Lake Macquarie and another third live in the City of Maitland.</para><para>With about 800 people affected in each of those areas, it is very important for us to set up these sorts of programs. The federal government has been right behind this. The former Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone, took part in the launch of a number of these projects in Newcastle when she was the minister. That process is continuing. So for Bob Horne, the member for Paterson, to claim that this government is doing little about the downsizing of BHP is an absolute nonsense.</para><para>What I have put on the record in the Senate today about these matters shows that this federal government has taken a very responsible attitude to the downsizing of BHP. The Prime Minister came into the region, he talked to the people, he set up consultative committees and he committed funds. That funding is now going to support job improvements in other areas that are not in the area of steel making.</para><para>The Hunter region has a marvellous future. It is an area with tremendous resources. At this time of industrial shift it needs special assistance from the government. We have provided that assistance. The future for the Hunter, as these new jobs are generated in the region, looks rosy.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Textor, Mr Mark</title><title>Push Polling</title><page.no>1062</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>1062</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âLast week I made a speech in 
 this chamber in relation to party political researchâopinion polling and the likeâand I mentioned an individual by the name of Mr Mark Textor. I was, of course, criticised by the coalition government for raising this issue. The opposition was attacked for not concentrating on policy issues or developing alternatives to this government's program.</para></talk.start><para>The truth is that Labor did have a comprehensive plan during the election campaign with an emphasis on job creation and tax reform that delivers fairness through tax credits and targeted tax cuts for lower and middle income earners. It was a plan that formed the basis of the best election result for an opposition party after one term since Federation; a bigger swing than the coalition was able to secure after 13 years in opposition. But, as we remain in opposition, Labor will continue to do its job. We will continue to scrutinise the government and the government's behaviour at every turn. We will not allow the government to rort its way back into office a second time.</para><para>In last Thursday's question time in the House of Representatives, Mr Howard responded to a question in relation to Mr Textor, and he said:</para><para>I certainly do know Mr Textor, and I think you know him as well. Mr Textor has been a very competent and a very effective pollster for the Liberal Party of Australia. He is also, like any other person in that area, entitled to do other work.</para><para>I ask: does the Prime Minister's approval of `other work' extend to a contract with the Northern Territory government to unethically conduct research for the CLP while employed at the Liberal Party of Australia National Secretariat? Does the Prime Minister approve of the actions of the Country-Liberal Party, who used Mark Textor as their exclusive pollster for the 1994 election, funded his research from taxpayers' money and then claimed in their return to the AEC that they spent nothing on polling?</para><para>Does the Prime Minister have no concerns that Mark Textor conducted his activities from his desk at Menzies House under the nose of Andrew Robb? Does the Prime Minister have no qualms at all about his private pollster receiving $740 a day from the 
 Northern Territory government for the exclusive use of the CLP in an election campaign? Isn't it of any concern that Mr Textor, throughout his research, was obsessive about using the race card for maximum effect, including the unprecedented use of push polling to inflame racial tension in the Territory? Is it `effective' and `competent' to use polling techniques imported from Republican Party race based campaigns? Does the Prime Minister also contend that Mark Textor was entitled to do other work when that involved, on two separate occasions, employment on the shadow ministerial staff of Dr Michael Wooldridge during the time he was contracted by the Northern Territory government?</para><para>Records showed that Mark Textor was employed by Dr Wooldridge from 26 July 1993 to 27 August 1993, and again from 14 March 1994 to 8 May 1994 at private secretary grade 1 level. On both occasions this coincided with his employment by the Northern Territory government. Senator Ray has lodged a number of questions on notice to ascertain whether this practice of subsidising Mark Textor through his employment by shadow ministers is limited to Dr Wooldridge. This is probably just brazen triple-dipping. He was being paid by the Commonwealth taxpayer, through Dr Wooldridge, and by the Northern Territory taxpayer, through the 1993 Northern Territory government contract. We assume he was also on the Liberal Party payroll.</para><para>If Mark Textor is as competent as the Prime Minister says he is, then his polling for the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> tells a remarkable story. According to his research, Labor's primary vote surged seven points over the campaign period, while the coalition's declined by four points. If Mark Textor is as accurate as the Liberals claim, then it is a testament to a remarkably effective ALP campaign. Equally, it points to a humiliating performance by the Liberalsâa campaign for which Mark Textor himself provided the research. Equally curious is the decision of the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> to employ him just for the election period. Did the financial subsidy ensure discount rates for research for the Liberal Party of Australia? If it did, will this subsidy or donation from Australian 
 Consolidated Press be fully disclosed to the AEC? We await that with interest and in anticipation.</para><para>The Prime Minister went on to say this of the government's pre-election market research program:</para><para>Having sort of prepared the ground, I say to those who sit opposite that I am advised that total propriety has been observed by government in relation to those matters.</para><para>The Prime Minister has got to know something that the community does not. Many government departments have not provided the market research information requested of them by the Senate. How can we be assured of `total propriety in relation to those matters' in the absence of total disclosure? Who actually in fact advised the Prime Minister of this so-called total propriety?</para><para>When the documents in relation to the Northern Territory rorts were tabled last Thursday, Shane Stone resorted to malicious attacks on one of the participants. Let me assure the Senate that all of our accusations of corruption are based entirely on primary documents, not on the interpretation of any individual. No interpretation is needed because the documents are clear and point specifically to unethical and corrupt practices by the CLP, practices devised and implemented by Mark Textor, Shane Stone, Ron Klein and Andrew Coward.</para><para>Senator Crossin last week pointed to aspects of political research carried out by the CLP, by Mr Klein and Mr Textor, and how racial tensions in the Northern Territory were exploited by the CLP. She revealed how the Aboriginal population that makes up close to a third of the territory's population was excluded from CLP focus groups, and she quoted from the Klein research findings that:</para><para>Handled correctly, we feel the Aboriginal issue could ensure the re-election of the CLP.</para><para>She reminded this chamber of the notorious push polling technique masterminded by Mr Textor where participants were asked if they would vote for Labor if they knew they were planning to establish two sets of laws, one for blacks and one for whites. In a letter quoted by Senator Crossin, Mark Textor used the two sets of laws concept as an example of the 
 usefulness of focus group research in adding flavour to campaignsâthe bitter flavour of racism.</para><para>Of course, Mark Textor has some form in relation to low grade, wedge politics. All senators will be aware of the public outcry at the Liberal Party's polling techniques used in the March 1995 by-election for the federal seat of Canberra. In that campaign the Liberal Party's pollsters used push polling techniques developed by right wing Republicans in the United States to test voter perceptions about the Labor Party candidate. In particular, electors were asked whether their voting intention would change if they were told, for instance, that Ms Robinson had supported abortion at up to nine months of pregnancy and that she had defended violent demonstrations against defence industries. These allegations were absolutely false and were known by the pollsters and by the Liberal Party to be complete fabrications.</para><para>Push polling as defined by the American Association for Public Opinion Research is, and I quote:</para><para>. . . a tele-marketing technique in which telephone calls are used to canvass potential voters, feeding them false and misleading information about a candidate under the pretence of taking a poll to see how this "information" affects voter preferences.</para><para>At the time the then federal director of the Liberal Party, Mr Andrew Robb, denied that push polling had been used or that there was `any intention of smearing or defaming', to use his words.</para><para>I have now been informed by the national secretariat of the Australian Labor Party that Ms Robinson's defamation action against the Liberal Party and their pollsters has been settled very recently. I have been provided with a copy of the full terms of the settlement by the Labor Party, and I will deal with that at the conclusion of my speech because then I might seek leave to table those documents.</para><para>I want to stress that these documents have not been provided to me in breach of the confidentiality clause in that agreement. There are some very interesting admissions contained in those documents. In short, let me say that the Liberal Party, and Mark Textor himself, have unequivocally apologised to Ms 
 Robinson for the push polling techniques that were used during the by-election, and admitted that:</para><para>Some of the questions were published without due regard to either the accuracy of the underlying material on which they were based, or the consequences of their publication.</para><para>So, in addition to the apologies, there is a significant damages payment involved.</para><para>In these documents we have clear-cut admissions from the Liberal Party and Mark Textor that they have used derogatory and what I would describe as despicable push polling techniques, and that those techniques have a disastrous effect, a disastrous personal effect, on the people against whom it is used.</para><para>This is the Liberal Party that the Prime Minister is proud to lead and this is the Prime Minister's personal pollster who the Prime Minister was prepared to vouch for in the House of Representatives last week. Remember that the Prime Minister stated that total propriety had been observed by the government in relation to these matters. That statement from the Prime Minister now is shown to be demonstrably false.	Today we have proof positive that Mr Textor and the Liberal Party really go to the most grubby depths imaginable. They are prepared to stoop to any depths at all to try and steal a by-election from the Labor Party.</para><para>So you have to ask yourself, Mr Acting Deputy President, where did Mark  Textor learn these sorts of push polling techniques? His current company, Australian Research Strategies, is the Australian arm of Wirthlin Worldwide, an international political research operation that is based just outside Washington DC. Its website boasts of its strategic partnership with Burson Marstellar, another corporate mate of the Liberal Party, notorious for its role in the guns buy-back campaign. Wirthlin Worldwide's president, Richard Wirthlin, is a director of Mark Textor's company, as is the president, James Granger. Wirthlin Worldwide provides research to a spectrum of extremist right wing organisations in America. Particularly notable is the research they provide for the Council for the National Interest, which of course is a Washington-based anti-Israel lobby group 
 which promotes conspiracy theories regarding the level of Jewish influence in the United States.</para><para>We say that the only way that the Prime Minister of Australia can show good faith in this matter is for him to act to ensure that Mark Textor is never again used by the Liberal Party as its pollster. You have got to cut Mark Textor loose. You have got to condemn his push polling techniques.

It was an international conference based in Adelaide which gathered professionals together from around the world to discuss genetic technologies. Today I was hoping to use my time to discuss some of the crucial issues raised at that conference, including debate about my private member's bill on genetics which seeks to ensure that people's genetic information is private and that people cannot be discriminated against on the basis of their genetic information. Unfortunately, due to what I consider an unfair and malicious attack on me and the Democrats yesterday by a member of the government in question time, I have to address another issue.</para></talk.start><para>While it was a great honour to address such a distinguished grouping in Adelaide on Sunday, I had a similar honour the week before, on Sunday 22 November, in Melbourne, when I gave the keynote opening address to the first International Conference on Drugs and Young People. Although this event was almost two weeks ago, it seems the justice minister only caught up with this particular issue and speech yesterday.</para><para>Yesterday I witnessed one of the tackiest displays of political point scoring I have ever seen in this place. Minister Vanstone took one sentence from my half-hour address to this international and, may I say, quite prestigious conference in an attempt to score a cheap political point. Some in the chamber who spoke to me afterwards thought it was more like slander than political rhetoric and, while I think that her comments should not necessarily be dignified by a response, I note that it is not in the interests of the broader debate about the impact of drugs on our community that her comments should go unchallenged.</para><para>I thought that we had reached a point in the debate about the dangers of drug use and the impact of drug related harm and drug related deaths in our community where we encouraged people to speak openly and honestly about their views on this issue, and that we 
 were prepared to not always agree with but at least recognise that there are different perspectives on this issue, not only in the parliament but also in the community, and that we are able to accept those perspectivesâor at least debate and listen to themâwithout sensationalising them and without misrepresentation. I think Hazel Hawke's words are particularly pertinent when she states, `We all need to be a little more honest about drug use.'</para><para>This is a serious issue. It is an issue of life and death for some, and certainly some of the participants involved in the conference had lost loved ones from drug abuse and addiction. Others involved in this conferenceâfrom around the world, I might addâwere health workers, health professionals, doctors, social workers, youth workers, indeed young people, and police and legislators. I note that the minister for the ACT on health matters, Michael Moore, was present at that function.</para><para>It was the first conference of its kind, the first international conference on young people and drugs, despite the extent of this problem, and it was brought together by groups of professionals and groups of people who are all committed to reducing the impact of drug-related harm in our community. Their work is hard, it is emotional, and it should never be trivialised, and yesterday in this place their work was trivialised with a dorothy dixer.</para><para>At the conference, I challenged the mainstream media to report my words without sensation. They did. Despite the obvious temptation to get the words `drugs', `senator' and `young people' in a headline, in the main, the media reported the tone and the content of my speech correctly. It was the minister for justiceânot at the conference and relying, as her media release admits, on snippets of the speech in a newspaper reportâwho sensationalised and sought to misrepresent the speech, and shame on her for doing so.</para><para>Had the minister been present, she would have heard my comments about her efforts in the campaign, during which I was anything but critical of her personally. The fact that I made those comments makes her outburst in yesterday's question time even more ungracious. Had she been present, the minister 
 would have heard my detailed discussion of the government's Tough on Drugs strategy. She would have heard me commend the government on aspects of their education strategy, including the work of the health department. I have just been at a women's luncheon upstairs, where I spoke to parliamentary secretary and member of parliament Trish Worth, who has a keen interest in these matters. We were talking about how positive some of the work is that is coming out of the health department in relation to the government strategy.</para><para>I acknowledged aspects of the government strategy that were working. I also commended the Prime Minister on his commitment to reducing drug harm out in the community, although I acknowledged, as most people in this place would do, that we have very different positions. We advocate different positions as to how we can solve the problem of the so-called war on drugs.</para><para>For the record, I did not endorse drug use. I did not call for the legalisation of illegal drugs. I did call for the decriminalisation of marijuana and I did say that the approach currently favoured by government is weighted more in favour of law enforcement than social and medical practices. I am entitled to this opinion. I called for increased penalties in the areas of drink-driving, drink related crimes and drug related crimes. I put that in as an answer to the minister's query about what penalties the Democrats or I endorse. Yes, I did say:</para><para>It is a fact that some young people enjoy using drugs.</para><para>I went on to say:</para><para>It is one of the reasons young people take drugs and why drugs are often celebrated in youth culture.</para><para>I am wondering if anyone dares to doubt that statement. It was a statement of fact. It was a statement according to research. It was in answer to the question I posed in the speech: why take drugs?</para><para>I outlined some of the other reasons why young people take drugs, including risk taking, including experimentation and including depression, just to name a few. Surely we must examine all the reasons why young 
 people may consider taking illegal and illicit drugs. No matter how distasteful these reasons may be to some of us, we must examine and acknowledge them if we are to find out why young people take drugs.</para><para>How dare the minister take this statement of fact, a statement of research and an acknowledgment of one reason why young people may take drugs, and then infer from thatâand this was the intent of her comments yesterday and her statementâthat I endorse illegal drug taking by young people. The minister made this personal. Just because I acknowledged what the research tells usâthat is, that some young people have had recreational experiences on drugs that they may have enjoyedâdoes not mean that I endorse drug use. It does not mean that I use illegal drugs.</para><para>I find it extraordinary too, although perhaps not surprising, that the response to the minister's press release yesterday was journalists ringing me to ask me what drugs I take, what drugs I condone and what drugs I push. I challenge them to ask any member of this place those same intrusive questions. I will also be curious to see, if they do, whether they get the same degree of honesty in response.</para><para>I pointed out at the conference that the research shows that young people are not always comfortable with the notion of discussing drugs with authority figures, be they doctors, parents, teachers or legislators. We do not often hear the views of young people on illegal and illicit drugs. The justice minister I think made it clear yesterday why we do not. I said at the conference that if politicians, bureaucrats, health workers, teachers, parents and the media head off towards the moral high groundâif they blindfold themselves with zero tolerance and ignore the realityâthen we do not have the real picture and we are not in a position to be believed by young people when we talk to them about drugs. This lack of trust makes it clear why it is sometimes difficult to collect information as to drug use by young people and why they take drugs.</para><para>I congratulate the minister on what I assume was the desired effectâjournalists 
 ringing me up to find out what drugs I might take. I do not do illegal drugs, Minister. Just because I do not, that does not mean that it is any less of a problem or that we can afford to ignore, marginalise, trivialise or indeed in some cases criminalise other people's habits in the hope that they will go away. Drugs are not going away. In answer to the minister's comments in question time yesterday: yes, we do need to reduce supply, but we also have to reduce demand. My comments were part of what was designed to be a constructive debate engineered by the Australian Drug Foundation to understand why there is this demand and how we can reduce it.</para><para>I also pointed out at that conference that the two single biggest drug problems facing young Australians are alcohol and tobacco. It is a perverse society when young people with drug problems are shunned or marginalised orâas they were yesterdayâmade a political football out of, yet a justice minister can go on <inline font-style="italic">Burke's Backyard</inline> and parade her cellar full of alcohol and that is considered okay and good publicity. I can see the irony and I hope the minister can. Workers in the field of drug addiction can.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>N26</name.id><name role="metadata">ABETZ</name><name role="display">Senator Abetz</name></talker><para>âAnd that's not personal?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3I6</name.id><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name></talker><para>âYou bet it is. In response to Senator Abetz's interjection, I rarely have personal debates in this place, as most people would acknowledge. But this is personal. This is about my character and my reputation. It is an inference about me and taking drugs, and I will respond personally if I want to.</para></talk.start></continue><para>According to the research, by 12 years of age almost 15 per cent of schoolchildren have tried alcohol; 70 per cent of females aged 14 to 24 and 50 per cent of males consume alcohol in quantities which are hazardous or harmful. More than one in 10 younger Australians has a drinking problem. Alcohol abuse is a serious problem in our community, estimated to cost Australians $5 billion per annum. The Democrats do not want to criminalise alcohol addiction. We believe that is better addressed through community services and health services. However, particular crimes like drink-driving and violent crimes must be given serious penalties.</para><para>Each year more than 70,000 teenagers begin smoking and more than 250,000 secondary students smoke cigarettes at least once a week. By 12 years of age, about eight per cent of schoolchildren have tried tobacco. In Australia, we raise around $4.6 billion per annum in revenue through tobacco taxes, but we spend less than one-third of one per cent on smoking prevention programs.</para><para>The problems with legal drugs affecting young peopleâlegal drugs as in drugs being used by those over 18, when it comes to tobacco and alcoholâare bad enough, let alone the problems of illegal drugs that affect young people. Heroin is a prime example. This is an issue where people's lives are on the line. The responsibility of us in this place, and indeed of the minister for justice, is to uphold the law. But that must beâand it can beâbalanced with rational debate about where laws may need changing.</para><para>The Democrats have long supported a harm minimisation approach. We do not support criminalising young people simply because we do not like what these people do. But there is room for broad debate on this issue. There is room for a number of different perspectives and I welcome that rational and calm debate.</para><para>Ironically, the real battle in this minister's portfolio is the war on drugs. Chasing Skase is important to the Commonwealth, and the Democrats have certainly given every form of assistance possible to Senator Vanstone in that particular pursuit. But I think the hardest area of her portfolio and the more fragile one is the so-called war on drugs, because lives are at stake. That is why conferences like the international conference, the first of its kind on drugs and young people, are essential. They are essential not just for members of the community to debate these issues but to feed into law-makers who have direct responsibility for reducing the impact of drug related harm in our society.</para><para>I would have thought the minister's first approach would have been to look at the papers, read the recommendations and consult with all of these professionals, not seek to make a political point out of one sentence of a 30-minute address by a so-called political 
 opponent. These conferences are essential for ministers so that they can indeed fix the problem. That is why the actions of that particular minister in this place yesterday stand condemned.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Telstra: Casualties of Telecom</title><page.no>1069</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>1069</page.no><name role="metadata">Boswell, Sen Ronald</name><name role="display">Senator BOSWELL</name><name.id>YE4</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI wish to speak today on the treatment of a group of customers of Telstraâthe CoT cases. In 17 years I have only used parliamentary privilege on one occasion, but I believe we are here as a parliament to get justice for the people we represent when it cannot be achieved through other avenues.</para></talk.start><para>Over the past 10 years, CoT members have been put through a lengthy and expensive ordeal by Telstra. An Austel inquiry, a Coopers and Lybrand and Bell Canada investigation, arbitration, numerous Senate committee hearings and a court appeal. In November 1993, Coopers and Lybrand, when investigating COT complaints, concluded about Telstra:</para><para>Communication featured inappropriate conclusions, inaccurate statements and evasive responses causing customers and external parties to be misled.</para><para>In May 1996, after two years of investigation, the Commonwealth Ombudsman said:</para><para>In my opinion, the effect of applying the restrictive interceptions interpretations was to withhold information from Mrs Garms.</para><para>A crucial element for CoT members to prove was whether there were any technical reasons for the poor standard of telephone services delivered to their businesses.</para><para>One CoT member, Ann Garms of the Tivoli in Brisbane, a successful restaurateur, opened a new theatre restaurant in August 1989. Calls were not getting through. Telstra was told many times. Eventually Austel directed Telstra to install testing equipment on her lines. Telstra did not follow Austel's timetable, delaying the installation until Friday, 10 September 1993. I will explain later how, on 12 September, Telstra performed major works on the network.</para><para>Immediately, on Monday 13 September 1993, the Tivoli call rate increased by 212 per cent, from 69 calls a day to an average of 
 215. This was after Senator Alston had supported the CoTs in establishing the settlement process. It was to be overseen by the TIO, who promised in writing that it could be settled by April 1994. This settlement process involved obtaining documents under FOI from Telstraâa request lodged personally by the then Chairman of Austel, Robin Davey. Essential network documents were not forthcoming from Telstra. Ann Garms was forced to lodge a formal complaint with the Commonwealth Ombudsman that Telstra were not providing general exchange and network documents under FOI.</para><para>In April 1994, the fast-track settlement was changed to a fast-track arbitration process, which the CoT members had to accept under duress on the basis of firm assurances of it being fast-tracked, non-legalistic and with access to documents. In April 1994, Austel also brought down their CoT case report, saying:</para><para>The following matters had the potential to affect the services of particular cases.âLocal access network problems in the Fortitude Valley area.</para><para>Telstra stated to the arbitrator only one per cent traffic congestion, which he accepted. Later documents record valley congestion rates of 24 per cent. I table document (A).</para><para> While essential documents were still being denied by Telstra, complaints were being made to the arbitrator in May, July and August. Mrs Garms had to submit her claim to the arbitrator within one month. Her technical consultant, George Close, provided a report concluding that the 212 per cent increased call rate overnight could only be attributed to a major works of the exchange and network. Continually, Telstra denied this. Arbitration was concluded. The relevant important technical network documents had still not been provided.</para><para>Mrs Garms then appealed to the Supreme Court. At this point it is worth noting that the costs involved for both sides in this long and protracted matter were, in evidence given to the Senate yesterday of Telstra's costs, $14.285 million to 1997, with a further cost for the arbitrators of $4.446 million, with higher costs to come from the Supreme Court action. How outrageous is this conservative 
 $20 million of taxpayers' money for a publicly funded giant to beat a few small businesspeople?</para><para>The whole process has cost Mrs Garms to date $1.1 million plus Telstra's court costsâall to access documents Telstra denied existed. Ann Garms did not have the necessary network documents from Telstra for her caseâinformation which could only be obtained from Telstra. This was despite promises that the fast-track settlement or arbitration process would deliver the necessary documents. These essential documents were not forthcoming from Telstra when it mattered. It was only when the Senate working party committee in 1998 demanded that Telstra deliver network documents to the five COT members that some of these arrivedâonly weeks ago.</para><para>Importantly, for the first time, the documents, whose existence were always denied by Telstra, appeared. The documents date back to 1993 and state categorically that major works were made to the network and that this happened overnight on 12 September 1993. Telstra has always denied any evidence of major work and this has influenced the crucial decisions of the court and arbitrator. Now documents have come to light, only as a result of the recent Senate working party, stating there were major works in rerouting the network and upgrading from the old analog to digital at the crucial moment of 12 September, when suddenly service improved overnight after four years of poor performance.</para><para>There are many Telstra statements denying upgrades in September 1993. All the arbitration was done by written documents. Telstra in their principal defence document said:</para><para>There was no major exchange work carried out at the Fortitude Valley exchange as is asserted by the claimants. The network servicing the Tivoli immediately prior to the commencement of 13 September 1993 was precisely the same as the network that was servicing the Tivoli during the period between 13 September and 9 October 1993.</para><para>I table that document. Under statutory declaration, Steve Black, Group General Manager Customer Affairs, Telstra, in their technical BOOI report, submitted:</para><para>There was no major exchange work carried out in the valley exchange. There was no complete refurbishment of the customer specific exchange equipment and lines as alleged by George Close.</para><para>The increase in incoming answered calls was not due to any replacement, maintenance or upgrading of any equipment servicing the Tivoli's monitored lines. There was no major upgrade document.</para><para>I table that document. Mr Peter Gamble, Manager Engineering and Technical Consultancy, Customer Affairs Group, Telstra, also gave a statutory declaration to the arbitrator where he said:</para><para>The allegations made in the Close report cannot be supported by reference to a more detailed examination of the material available. Further, the claimed `major upgrade' did not take place.</para><para>That is document D. And yet Peter Gamble had been provided with a document which stated in relation to 12 October 1993:</para><para>Tivoli restaurantâmajor work occurring in the exchange. A document withheld from Ann Garms.</para><para>That is document H. Mr Peter Croft, partner of Deloittes, chartered accountants for Telstra, in his statutory declaration, said:</para><para>Close compares periods before and after September 1993 because it is alleged by Close that a major upgrade of the telecommunication service to the Tivoli occurred at that time. Officers of Telecom inform me that the major upgrade referred to by Close simply did not occur and that there was no major or unusual work undertaken at that time which would have affected the Tivoli's phone service.</para><para>The arbitrator's resource unit concluded in their report on 16 June 1995 to the arbitrator and the TIO:</para><para>While it might substantially affect the determination if further documentation existed which established faults or a major corrective upgrade or which elaborated in more detail on the testing, we accept Telstra's position that such documentation does not exist, and therefore, many incidents remained unexplained. We feel that our aim of accuracy has been achieved for the events covered in the report.</para><para>That is document F. Importantly, with this weight of evidence from Telstra, the arbitrator accepted the resource unit report based on Telstra's statutory declarations. The resource unit said, `We accept Telecom's position that such documentation does not exist.' On 8 August 1996 the arbitrator said in his decision: </para><para>Telstra denies a major upgrade of the Fortitude Valley exchange occurred in September 1993 and therefore the claim is fundamentally flawed to the extent it seeks to derive support from this event.</para><para>The arbitrator concluded:</para><para>I have reviewed all the material submitted by both parties, together with the results of the independent analysis of that material by their resource unit's technical personnel. I accept in essence the conclusions reached by the resource unit.</para><para>That is document G. Also Telstra had allowed Ann Garms and George Close, her technical adviser, to view Telstra documents in their viewing room in Melbourne. In January 1996, documents were tagged for photocopying. Some originals and photocopies were never returned to the viewing room. John Armstrong, Telstra's consumer affairs counsel, admitted a few days ago that indeed some files were not returned to the viewing room. That is document I. Telstra is still refusing to discover project documents despite the terms of reference from the Senate working party. In his statutory declaration, George Close recalled the missing documents as:</para><para>The reparenting and major equipment changeâmodernisation in the Fortitude  Valley exchange and tandem in the months prior to the Austel directed testing and monitoring. This document also dealt with network trunking changes, Edison related.</para><para>That is document J. Strangely enough, on the day the arbitrator handed down his decisionâ8 August, 1996âan FOI document was sent to Mrs Garms containing proposed restructure and modernisation of the network serving for Fortitude Valley. Then as a result of the Senate inquiry this year, the confirmation finally arrived setting out major works of the network. I now table document K confirming:</para><para>The reparenting of at least 16 exchanges to the valleyâthe CBD EdisonâCharlotte exchanges were upgraded and rerouted implementing the change from analogue to digital for the entire area network.</para><para>Yet an affidavit from Telstra's Group Director, Customer Affairs, Ted Benjamin, to the appeal court says:</para><para>I deny that Telstra failed to produce any documentation which the arbitrator had directed Telstra to produce.</para><para>That is document L. It is only now after the decisions from the arbitrator and the appeal 
 court that a couple of these documents have appeared because of the Senate working party involvement. Telstra's conduct of denial, both of the existence of these documents and the false statutory declarations, has been exposed. This is an important comment on Telstra' s conduct, which must now be addressed. These documents, delivered a few weeks ago through the Senate process, state undeniably that major works and upgrades occurred prior to and at the crucial date of 13 September 1998, which they denied in statutory declarations to the court and to the arbitrator. On network problems, also, not one Ericsson document has been delivered to Ann Garms, yet Ericsson advise on around 80 per cent of Telstra's repair and maintenance work. In a letter of 17 July 1998âdocument MâTelstra told me no Ericsson documents had been foundâthey were searching and would get back to me shortly. They have not.</para><para>Finding Telstra documents has been like finding a needle in a haystack. Of at least 60,000 documents delivered before the arbitration and court case approximately 75 are only relevant network documents. In response to the Senate working party request, a further 25,000 documents were deliveredâmostly irrelevant documents.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Sherry)</name></talker><para>âOrder!

 which have received some comment in the press recently, and which seem to be an exponentially increasing issue in terms of community concern. Local government associations in New South Wales, South Australia and Victoria have announced over the last few days that they will seriously consider entering the banking sector in order to ensure that their local communities have access to basic business and personal banking services. These announcements are a sad indictment of the federal government's failure to heed the increasingly desperate calls of regional Australia, local government and numerous community, welfare and business groups for urgent action to ensure that all Australians have decent access to bank services.</para></talk.start><para>Instead of taking action, the federal government has stood back and watched as numerous regional and rural communities suffer the economic and social consequences of the last bank leaving town. Those consequences can be very serious and potentially terminal. When a town has no bank, local businesses are forced to travel to the nearest town with a bank to carry out business banking. Existing business often begins to wind down and new businesses do not start up. Towns are pushed further down the spiral of unemployment and depopulation.</para><para>The Tasmanian Local Government Association painted a very clear picture of exactly how communities are affected by bank closures when they appeared before the House of Representatives banking inquiry earlier this year. It is an example I have used before, but all those submissions very clearly illustrate the impact of the closure of the last bank in town and the fact that it is often the last nail in the coffin for small communities. The Tasmanian Local Government Association said:</para><para>Importantly, when people travel to larger centres to utilise their banking services, they also conduct other business there. There is a drop, therefore, in consumer spending with local businesses in rural municipalities resulting in a loss of jobs and out-migration of households and businesses. This would be likely to result in a reversal of any previous intentions to take out loans for investment in local business and thereby impeding development of small enterprises. Therefore, a loss or reduction in the full range of banking services could impede the 
 viability of rural communities and place them in jeopardy.</para><para>Secondly, electronic banking cannot provide the full banking services which are essential to the sustainability of rural municipalities. Financial institutions have not developed electronic systems to the extent that they offer a real alternative to traditional banking. EFTPOS terminals cannot accept cash, and businesses, which use these terminals, cannot facilitate the deposit of money to a customer's account. They cannot provide account balances.</para><para>A study by the University of Queensland found that when the last bank in a town goes, some 90 per cent of respondents are more pessimistic about their community's future, and 39 per cent say they would like to leave the town as well. Clearly, we have here an extremely serious situation.</para><para>How many regional communities have been affected by bank closures while the government stands around and does nothing? Over 100 Australian towns have not one bank branch and over 200 communities have only one bank left and are tottering on the brink of having no bank whatsoever. While banks are closing down their least profitable branchesâthose branches in regional Australiaâthey are whacking up their fees for basic over-the-counter and electronic services. This is not because the banks are struggling to make a profit, as has been amply pointed out in this place. Collectively this year the big four banks have announced a profit of $5.6 billion. These banks have seen a profit growth of almost 440 per cent over the 1990sâa growth 3Â½ times faster than the economy as a whole.</para><para>Where do these profits come from? Twenty per cent of the profits are from their retail sector, and that is not just from the explosion of home loans; it is from a massive increase in fees, continued cost cutting and bank closures. So the profit is coming from average Australians. These fee increases and bank closures are being conducted by all the major banks. And what has the government done about this? Nothing.</para><para>On 20 June 1996, Treasurer Peter Costello told the House of Representative that red-hot competition was the way to keep bank charges down. He did recognise that the government had the option of referring the 
 matter to the ACCC and he said that they would take that action if necessary.</para><para>Last week, in response to calls for the government to take action on ever increasing bank fees, Senator Kemp said:</para><para>Bank customers can maximise the benefits of competition by actively shopping around for the best products, services and prices to satisfy their needs.</para><para>That is pretty hard if you have no banks in your town. This government clearly has no real understanding of the terrible impact bank closures have on regional Australian communities. Many people in regional Australia now have no choice at all when it comes to banking, so shopping around is not an option.</para><para>There must be formal monitoring of bank fees and charges instituted by the government through the ACCC and, if necessary, full price surveillance. This is what the Labor Party promised at the last election. We understand what public interest is and the role of government interest is in protecting public interest. It is a great tragedy for regional Australia that the coalition just simply does not understand this.</para><para>The government stands by doing nothing and mouthing platitudes that competition, which is clearly not working, will solve everything. Bank customers in regional Australia are being charged more and more for bank services, but there is no guarantee they will have access to a branch and full banking services. Where is the social responsibility in that? Where is the community service obligation in that?</para><para>Local government knows what bank closures mean for local communities. That is why local government, as a last-ditch effort, is looking at entering the potentially risky world of banking. Local government has consistently called for the federal government to take action on banking services to make sure local communities are not left in the lurch.</para><para>At the recent General Assembly of Local Government, representatives of the 700 local councils in Australia stated: </para><para>That the Australian Local Government Association calls upon the Federal Government to negotiate an agreement with the Australian Bankers Association to develop protocols concerning the closure of any 
 bank branch, and in particular those branches located in rural and regional Australia. Such protocols take account of the social and economic impacts on communities, including: . . . </para><para>. Alternative Service Provision;</para><para>. Training in other banking techniques (telebanking, giro payments, ATM network development, links to Credit Union Partnership arrangements and such like);</para><para>. Consideration of Agency/Joint Venture Service provision.</para><para>But the coalition either does not know or does not care about what is happening to these communities. The Treasurer welcomes local government banking moves as being good for competition. But he misses the point that it is not about competition. It is about communities, regional services and the opportunity to grow, and an absolute last-ditch, desperate attempt for regional and local communities to have access to banking services.</para><para>While the Treasurer fails to grasp the need for the federal government to take action to save many regional communities, the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government trots out another Telstra sale as a sop, as a solution. The only answer the government can come up with is a vague rural transactions centres program that it will only fund from the further 16 per cent sell down of Telstra. This government does not have the creativity or political nous to come up with an initiative that does not rely on flogging off a major public asset. It is interesting to note that the rural transaction centres proposal will only offer personal banking and limited business banking. That is not what regional communities need. They need full business banking services to enable communities to attract economic development into their regions. This is absolutely axiomatic to a real priority for regional development.</para><para>The minister should also understand that local government is opposed to the full sale of Telstra. A motion put to the 1998 General Assembly of Local Government by the Local Government Association of Queensland made that very clear. There is a solution to this problem. It does not involve the further sell down of Telstra, risking an even greater long-term list of services to regional Australia. 
 Labor addressed this adequately at the last election.</para><para>What does it require? On 30 June next year, the current system of non-callable deposits will be abolished as a result of the Wallis recommendations. Under this system, banks have been required to deposit an amount equivalent to one per cent of their liabilities with the Reserve Bank and to accept an interest rate upon them of five per cent less than the prevailing market rate. Some $4.6 billion worth of deposits are currently costing the banks $226 million annually in forgone interest. On 30 June 1999, as a result of the legislative termination of the system of non-callable deposits, the banks will gain that $226 millionâan absolute windfall that was not anticipated or needed, given the profit margin the banks are currently experiencing.</para><para>Before the election, Labor argued that a regional banking policy was absolutely necessary and required. This was a three-step process. The first step was to develop a charter of regional banking responsibility. The second step was that, where the last bank branch had left or was about to leave the town, Labor would encourage voluntary arrangements to fill the gap. But the crucial point was the third step. We argued that a one-off levy on the banks at the abolition of the non-callable deposit system should have been made to establish a regional banking services fund. The regional banking services fund could be used to ensure services are maintained and restored where justifiable.</para><para>Labor's proposal would only require a small, one-off levy on the major banks to raise an estimated $20 million for the fund. The fund would have been devoted to encouraging major banks to meet a reasonable community service obligation to maintain branches in regional Australia and assist in the establishment of banks that have a social justice charter. This would have been a first and significant step, a step in the right direction, and one this government could and should take up. Instead, the government takes no action, promising only to do anything if we sell off another 16 per cent of Telstraâmore blackmail for regional Australia.</para><para>This government cannot just stand around, twiddling its thumbs, and watch as regional communities suffer the adverse economic and social effects of bank closures. It simply cannot continue to rave on about competition, which is clearly not appropriate in this case. The only way that the major banks will retain or reinstate banking operations of marginal profitability in regional Australia is if the federal government establishes a strong mechanism to encourage them.</para><para>Local government should not have to step in to save banking services for their local communities. The federal government should be taking action to ensure that local government does not have to do this. I am sure, given the option, they would not, but they are doing it as a last resort.</para><para>Labor will not tolerate the current situation. We believe it is grossly unfair and outrageous, and we will fight the government's complacency on bank fees and ever-diminishing bank services in regional Australia every step of the way.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Millennium Bug: Infrastructure Protection</title><page.no>1075</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>1075</page.no><name role="metadata">Lundy, Sen Kate</name><name role="display">Senator LUNDY</name><name.id>7G6</name.id><electorate>ACT</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise today to alert the Senate to issues of vital national interest that this government has been exceptionally tardy in addressing.</para></talk.start><para>Right now, we have a unique window of opportunity to shape our future and to make the technologies of the future work for us, rather than becoming enslaved to them. As citizens and law-makers, we cannot allow this historic chance to slip from our grasp. And yet that is what Senator Alston and Prime Minister Howard would have us do, because they lack the imagination and the vision to grasp the great opportunities and challenges that the information age presents to our country.</para><para>There is a vitally important role for government to play across the spectrum of the truly fascinating cultural, economic and industrial issues that the information society presents to Australia. I will limit my comments today to just three, albeit interrelated, issues that, if left unaddressed, will seriously weaken the ability 
 of Australians to communicate, to engage in commerce and to defend against threats to our national security.</para><para>Those three issues concern the protection of Australia's critical infrastructures, the amelioration of the Y2K problem, and the lock, stock and barrel outsourcing of government information technology. Research conducted just recently has shown in much more specific detail than anything the government has produced exactly how vulnerable Australia's critical infrastructures are to both the Y2K problem and more malicious threats.</para><para>Critical infrastructures are systems whose incapacity or destruction would have a debilitating impact on the defence or economic security of the nation. They include telecommunications, electrical power systems, gas and oil, banking and finance, transportation, water supply systems, government services and emergency services. Each of these infrastructures is operated, monitored and controlled by networked computers. Consequently, our critical infrastructures are vulnerable to a Y2K or millennium bug crash, valuable data can be manipulated or stolen and these vitally important systems can be disabled or just destroyed by hackers for money, in the aid of terrorism or just for kicks.</para><para>Vulnerabilities exist for two key reasons. First, critical choke points exist in each infrastructure and at the interconnection between infrastructures. Second, the various infrastructure systems and their computer networks are interdependent upon one another. If just one computer in a network has not been Y2K protected, it could be a weak link that drives the entire system to collapse. Because of the interdependence between systems, there is a serious possibility that crashes could cascade from system to system.</para><para>Mr Acting Deputy President, we have already witnessed critical failures in our electricity, oil and gas, and water infrastructures that demonstrate just how vulnerable these systems are. It is now estimated that the explosion in the Esso refinery, killing two people and cutting gas supplies to the state of Victoria, will cost Australia up to one per cent of GDP. Sydney's water crisis and the failure of the electricity network in Queens 
 land also point to serious weaknesses in Australia's critical infrastructures.</para><para>What these incidents prove is that Australia's critical infrastructures are more vulnerable than previous assessments have admitted. This is a significant problem in terms of accidents and natural disasters, but should serve as a pointer to the government's current attitude and approach in terms of protecting Australia from the Y2K or millennium problem or even worse scenarios, such as terrorism.</para><para>With respect to Australia's financial networks, they are similarly exposed to problems associated with networked computers. The Reserve Bank is the cornerstone of our financial system and yet it too has potential problems with over-centralisation and key choke points between it and the external systems upon which it depends both here and abroad.</para><para>Other examples are satellites. Some corporate literature that I read recently stated:</para><para>Satellites are a surprisingly common part of the day-to-day lives of Australians and Australian businesses.</para><para>In the same publication, the company states that satellites carry a whole range of information, including telephone systems, management of data for banks, remote oil and gas pipeline monitoring, ground-to-air communications, mobile satellite communications, secure defence signals, the Internet, and radio and TV services. And yet the control of Australia's domestic satellites is centralised at one location with well-known vulnerabilities.</para><para>The Howard government has known about these problems for years now and has done nothing about them. Interdepartmental and consultative committees abound on both the Y2K issue and on the hacker threat to our vital national infrastructures, but no substantive action has been taken. The joint communique between the US and Australia, announced yesterday by the Prime Minister, adds nothing, absolutely zero, to developing serious and relevant strategies for protecting our infrastructures from catastrophic failures as a consequence of either the Y2K problem or malicious attack. Yet it is with some irony that we note that the US has in fact taken action in this regard, implementing legislation 
 to identify critical infrastructures and the need for redundancy and contingency plans to be in place, mandated by the US Congress.</para><para>Australia, therefore, stands relatively weak and exposed before the very technologies that should enable this small but imaginative society to be strong and resilient. In short, this is a national disgrace and a failure of leadership of the first order. Just as Australians in the 1980s asked themselves why the Menzies government failed to transition the economy to a serious manufacturing base in the 1960s, so will the Australians of 2020 look back to the Howard government's paralysed inaction concerning the information age as yet another lost opportunity of historic proportions and consequences.</para><para>The third issue I would like to draw to the attention of the Senate is the government's recent activity in selling off the family's IT silver. In the 1997 federal budget, the government announced plans to outsource information technology infrastructure and services in up to 66 government agencies. This initiative was taken to save $200 million. The finance minister claimed in parliament that this `is one of the more significant outsourcing initiatives ever undertaken on a national government basis'.</para><para>The selling of assets of this type will undoubtedly generate a one-off burst of savings, but there is no doubt that losing control of the information technology infrastructure and the data managed within those systems will seriously undermine the ability of this or any forthcoming government to be effective agents of change both in policy terms and in guiding the outcomes of how we lever information technology and the information society for the future of this country.</para><para>Current Australian experience suggests that the benefits of outsourcing are questionable. As it was reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline>, the outsourcing of 72 IT agencies by the South Australian government has led to considerable criticism. A recent South Australian government review of the progress of the decision has found that costs have fallen so far by only one per cent.</para><para>These issues and more highlight very clearly the lack of action of the Prime 
 Minister and his government with respect to the information age and where our future lies.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>âOrder!

It is on this side that we have a lot to laugh about. Anyway, it is amazing that Senator Cook has got the nerve to ask an economic question, because all of us will remember him indicating to the 
 Australian people just before the 1996 election that the books were in surplus, that the Australian people could rely on the books being in surplus, when in fact they were over $10 billion in deficit. From that position of a total lack of credibility, Senator Cook nevertheless brings forward this question.</para></talk.start></continue><para>On this side of the chamber, on par for the coalition, yes, we do think there is a need for a new taxation system in Australia. We think it is long overdue. Why is it necessary? Because the current system is basically unfair. Marginal tax rates are too high. It penalises and discourages investment. It provides an inadequate payment for basic services such as schools, hospitals and police. It is too complexâtaxation legislation is now over 7,000 pages. We on this side of the chamber say that you reform the system in part, Senator Cookâthe GSTâto take taxation off production and, yes, to put it in part onto consumption. You will give greater encouragement to business, particularly small business, to grow the economy and to employ more Australians. That is a fairer system. It is a system that encourages economic growth and jobs. It is a system that will provide a revenue base to meet all the major social commitments for the future of health, education and the like. It will also deliver a fairer system in that more incentives will be able to be demonstrated through reduced income tax rates.</para><para>In all, therefore, the need for a new taxation system has been well made. This government took it to the Australian people, put it on the table and was prepared to do that in a circumstance where we were told it was a great political risk. We took that political risk because we believed that, unless we got the endorsement of the Australian people, it would be hard to pass through this chamber. We have done that. We have had the endorsement. We are re-elected. We bring forward this program proudly to the parliament. We trust, despite the obstructive tendencies of the Labor Party, that they will see that the people are entitled to the system that they voted for and that they are entitled to it because of all the benefits that it will bring, which I have just listed.</para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>1078</page.no><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name><name.id>RF4</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI ask a supplementary question, Madam President.

We know the shortcomings in that system; they were part of Labor's legacy to the coalition. But, in addition, they will also have to face up to the GST, as will all Australians.

They again show that Australia is unquestionably the strongman of the region. In the September quarter growth increased by a very strong one per cent, but for the year ended in the September quarter it grew by a staggering five 
 per cent. That is only good news for Australians. The major contributor to growth in the September quarter was business investment, with investment in machinery and equipment growing by 14.8 per cent.</para></talk.start><para>As well as that, private consumption also contributed strongly to growth with household consumption growing 1.1 per cent in the quarter. Australia's growth performance compares exceptionally well with others in the region and is indeed stronger than in countries like the US and major European countries. I might add that the average in Europe is some 2.5 per centâcompared with our five per cent, which is double that. It is no wonder the Australian people are overwhelmingly embracing the coalition's policies and it is no wonder that they believe the coalition outperforms the Labor opposition.</para><para>The national accounts yesterday were supported by yet another strong retail trade outcome. Seasonally adjusted, retail sales rose 0.8 per cent in October, which was at the high end of market expectations. The October outcome follows an equivalent 0.8 per cent rise in the month of September. Positive growth was recorded for hospitality and services, other retailing, clothing, soft goods, food and recreational goods.</para><para>But along with that we also have reduced interest rates. Today Australian home owners and small businesses received some more excellent news with the RBA announcing another cut in interest rates, with the cash rate being reduced by 25 basis points to 4.75 per cent. Aussie Home Loans has already announced that it will be cutting its home mortgage rate to 6.24 per cent. This is to be contrasted with Labor's 17 per cent home loan ratesânearly three times the amount that home owners in Australia currently enjoy. I am pleased to say that the National Australia Bank has also just announced a quarter per cent cut in its rate as well.</para><para>What about inflation? We now have low inflation, low interest rates, a budget surplus and solid growth. The CPI rose by only 0.2 per cent in the September quarter and 1.3 per cent throughout the year. The government expects this good low inflation performance to continue.</para><para>But what about employment? There is more good news. Madam President, employment has been growing strongly. A total of 170,000 jobs have been created to date in 1998, reflecting solid growth in both full and part-time employment. The unemployment rate fell sharply in October, to reach 7.7 per centâdown from 8.1 per cent in September. That is to be contrasted to that high peak of 11.2 per cent reached under Labor when it was in government.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>656</name.id><name role="metadata">FORSHAW</name><name role="display">Senator Forshaw</name></talker><para>âAre you looking for divine guidance?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>9X5</name.id><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name></talker><para>âMadam President, through you to Senator Forshawâhe might be interested in thisâthis is the lowest unemployment rate since September 1990.

It means that small business will enjoy lower interest rates.

I would like to begin answering it by referring the Senate to something that the then alternative Treasurer, Mr Gareth Evans, said three months ago today, on 2 September. He said:</para></talk.start><para>All the evidence is that the Australian economy is on a precipice, hanging on by its fingertips.</para><para>We now know that Mr Gareth Evans was actually talking about himself. We now know that it was actually Gareth Evans who was hanging on by his fingertips, not the Australian economy. It is no wonder that the Hon. Gareth Evans QC MP is now languishing on the back bench in the House of Representatives, because we know today, as my colleague Senator Ellison has said, that the Australian economy has grown by five percentage points in the year to Septemberâsomething which you lot thought was impossible but which we have achieved.</para><para>Against the backdrop of the Asian economic problems, this is indeed a remarkable growth rate. As my colleague Senator Ellison 
 has said, it compares remarkably favourably with rates in the rest of the world. The USA, which we are told has the fastest growth rate in the world, has a rate of 3Â½ per cent. Britain and Germany, run by their socialist colleagues, have rates of around 2Â½ per cent, which is half Australia's rate of five per cent. We have not achieved this incredible growth rate by pump priming, like those opposite, by shovelling in the moneyâ$70 billion dollars of extra government debt in their last five yearsâbut we have done it with surpluses. We have achieved surpluses, yet we have also got a growth rate of five per cent.</para><para>Business, industry and therefore ordinary Australians are the great beneficiaries of these policies. Business investment is up 11Â½ per cent over the last 12 months. Retail industry investment is up 5.2 per cent over the last 12 months. Senator Ferguson would be very keen to know that the car industry in our home state of South Australia, where it is so important, has achieved record sales this year. The Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries has forecast record sales this year of 790,000 vehicles, the highest figure achieved in the history of this country. It is even higher than last year's figure. Last year's figure was a record under our government, but it is even higher than last year'sâ70,000 more than last year. So the car industry is doing tremendously well and that is great not only for states like Victoria and South Australia but for the whole country.</para><para>Mineral exports are up by 4.6 per cent over the last 12 months. At the same time, we have created 400,000 jobs while we have been in office. Our policies have been great for business, great for industry and great for ordinary Australians.

Will the minister acknowledge that moving the review process to this time of year and the complexity of the form have evidently presented major difficulties for youth allowance recipients to complete and return their forms on time?

I do not think Senator Mackay understands. A prime mover for the trucks that carry goods out to the country costs about $275,000. That includes the 22 per cent wholesale sales tax. The trailer behind the prime mover costs around $225,000. That includes the wholesale sales tax of 22 per cent. So the whole rig is around $500,000. You only have to work out what the wholesale sales tax impact on that is. The tyres on those trucks are $900 each. If you blow one, you are up for $900, and that includes the 22 per cent sales tax. Under the coalition's tax reform package, all of that sales tax goes and the GST comes on but goes straight off, so it is obvious to anyoneâeven to you, Senator Mackayâthat the costs of living will fall. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></talk.start></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Jabiluka Uranium Mine</title><page.no>1083</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>1083</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy question is to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage.

Quite clearly, there is a long way to go before we can be satisfied that there will not be significant leakages and costs to revenue as a result. Certainly the capacity of businesses to order and download electronically, and thereby evade sales taxes, is clearly a matter of ongoing concern. That is why the Australian Taxation Office has been examining the issue of tax and the impact of electronic commerce for several years. In 1997, it published a pioneering discussion report entitled <inline font-style="italic">Tax and the Internet</inline> , which analysed both the opportunities and challenges posed by the new technology and made 29 draft recommendations.

 since the Howard government introduced free and open competition into Australian telecommunications. Will the minister outline to the Senate the benefits of such competition and provide the Senate with examples where the introduction of competition has delivered lower prices and a wider range of suppliers for Australian business users of telecommunications? I think it will be good news.</para></talk.start></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>1089</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI think the good news is that Senator Watson has been prepared to give a glowing endorsement of the Taxation Office. He is well aware of what it has been doing in relation to electronic commerce and tax on the Net. Perhaps he might be prepared to conduct a few seminars for those opposite, who clearly had no idea that any such work had been undertaken.</para></talk.start><para>The world has changed dramatically since 1 July when we introduced competition into telecommunications. There are something like 22 new carriers that have been granted full licences. Most importantly, what is really good news is that consumers are benefiting by dramatic cost reductions, better quality of service and a greater range of products. That has come about not only for residential consumers but particularly for the business community. The findings of the Deloittes telecommunications survey released yesterday, which surveyed 100 of Australia's top companies, demonstrated very significant benefits. In fact, all companies responding to the survey indicated that they had made savings, by changing suppliers or simply by renegotiating contracts with current suppliers within the new competitive environment. Sixty-six per cent of respondents have reviewed their telecom supply contracts since deregulation, 47 per cent have changed suppliers and 13 per cent are considering doing so.</para><para>Price is the key factor: 71 per cent of responding companies made savings of 10 per cent or more and nearly 10 per cent made savings of 30 per cent or more. For the majority of those companies, almost two-thirds, their telecommunications bills are over $2 million. At the lower end of the range, therefore, savings of at least $200,000 a year are being made. These cost savings impact on the wider economy and bring greater benefits to 
 consumers because those savings are passed on in a competitive environment. Deloittes concludes that competition is already delivering real benefits for the majority of players and will continue to drive prices down despite industry debate about the pace of reform.</para><para>This survey is telling proof of the substantial economic and social benefits which have arisen as a result of the government's firm commitment to free and open competition in the telecommunications sector. It has been despite the opposition. They have not for a moment given any encouragement to those who might be out there wanting to reap the benefits of these new services that are becoming available for consumers. For example, the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts has found that Telstra's rate to the US at peak times was $1.28 per minute in 1996, and by June of this year some competitors were charging as little as 37c per minute.</para><para>So, in response to Senator Watson's question, the answer is that it has been very good news indeed. The process will continue. Competition will no doubt mean that Australia will continue to be a centre of attention for the rest of world, a place for regional hubs to be established and a place for consumers to really reap the benefit of the return of the coalition government.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>BH4</name.id><name role="metadata">HILL</name><name role="display">Senator Hill</name></talker><para>âOn that good news note, Madam President, I ask that further questions be placed on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline> .</para></talk.start></interjection></answer></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title><type>Miscellaneous</type><page.no>1090</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Telstra Sale: Stockbroking Costs</title><page.no>1090</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>1090</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âYesterday Senator Murphy asked me a question in relation to the sale of Telstra and the dealing of stockbrokers in relation to that.

</para><para>I did have a few notes prepared but, before I go into those, I would like to say that I think we have uncovered a secret obsession here. Senator Ian Macdonald has been asked so far, on my reckoning, four questions since becoming a new minister, and in each and every answer he has just gone on and on about trucksâbig trucks, little trucks and middle sized trucks. I have to say that I fear he is going to be a great disappointment to the rail lobby when they get to hear about this complete obsession with trucks. I am not sure what happened to Senator Ian Macdonald when he was young playing in the sandpit, but I think we are talking serious truck deprivation here. In the four questions that he has been asked, the response has been to talk about big trucks, wheels and so on.</para><para>The question we in fact asked was a question posed not by this side of politics but by Mr Katter, who made the assertion, absolutely correctly, that the cost of living in regional and rural Australia is substantially higher and therefore he says, correctlyâthis is not us saying thisâthat the GST that country Australians, people living in regional and rural Australia, will pay will be higher as well. I asked that question initially of Senator Ian Macdonald, and I will repeat what Mr Katter said, because it is worth repeating:</para><para>The cost of living in country areas is much higher than in the capital cities, so if the cost of living is higher therefore the GST that we are going to be paying will be higher as well.</para><para>Senator Ian Macdonald responded, `I think what Mr Katter is saying is that the cost of living is in fact lower in regional Australia and therefore prices are going to be lower.' So that was missed.</para><para>The second point of the question we asked was to substantiate something that every single person in this chamber knows, whether they are prepared to say it or notâthat is, that prices in regional and rural Australia are substantially higher than those in the capital cities. As I said, you on the other side of the chamber do not necessarily have to believe us, but I think an impeccable source in relation to this information is <inline font-style="italic">Choice</inline> magazine. Incidentally, <inline font-style="italic">Choice</inline> magazine factors in the cost of transport. I think that is something we 
 might explore, given Senator Ian Macdonald's obsession with trucks. We might have a few more questions in relation to this.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Choice</inline> said in July 1998 that a set basket of goods, which everybody is aware of, in Castle Hill in Sydney cost $66.24. <inline font-style="italic">Choice</inline>, not us, then went on to make some comparisons in terms of rural and regional Australia. I could go on, because there is a long list here, but I will not; I will just point out some `choice' examplesâif I can use that dreadful pun. In Westcourt in Cairns, for example, the same basket of goods cost $78.06; in Newnham in Launceston, $86.68; in Casuarina in Darwin, $81.87; in Geelong East, $87.60. That is empirical evidence that the cost of living is substantially higher in regional Australia in relation to food.

Senator Ian Macdonald in question time today very eloquently and accurately portrayed the effect of the existing tax system on regional and remote Australia. Those effects are felt no harder anywhere in Australia than in my home state of Western Australia, where virtually everything that is consumed has to travel over enormous distances. Much of the food and other items consumed in the capital city of Perth have to come across the Nullarbor, either on big trucks or on big trains. All of those big trucks and all of those big trains consume big amounts of diesel and other fuel.</para><para>Many of the people who live in the north-west of Western Australia rely on a transport system that, when it gets all the way from the eastern states to Perth, still has to make another journey of more than 1,000 miles to get up to the townships of Karratha and Kununurra and to the Pilbara and the Kimberley. So the cost of transport is an enormous part of the tyranny of distance in Australia.</para><para>Senator Sue Mackay related some figures from <inline font-style="italic">Choice</inline> magazine which clearly indicated the tyranny of distance and the cost differential suffered by people who live far away from the production centres of Australia. She really nailed home the point that the cost of a basket of groceries is a lot higher. What is the major cause of that differential? It is the distance that those goods have to travel. The old Labor wholesale sales tax system was designed in the 1930s for a 1930s worldâa 
 world without computers or modern communications systems; a world that was a very different place to that in which we live now. What do we seek to achieve by abolishing that outdated system? It is a system that the Australian Labor Party support. They offer no alternative to it.</para><para>In question time today we had a question from Senator Lundy in relation to the Internet.

It was in respect of a comment that had been made by Mr Katter. It is worth while going back to have a look at what Mr Katter has said about this issue. Mr Katter, in the Australian Associated Press release of 30 October 1998, said:</para></talk.start><para>Clearly a GST where the cost of living in the Gulf of Carpentaria is 40 per cent higher than in Brisbane, their GST will be higher.</para><para>He goes on to say in the same release:</para><para>Now there'll be offsets to that as far as freight costs go but there won't be enough to achieve the fairness that should be delivered by this approach.</para><para>Clearly, something needs to be done to achieve fairness.</para><para>So what Mr Katter was arguing forâand that was the point of the questionâwas fairness and offset. This question has not been addressed by the government. It is insufficient to point the finger solely and simply at the issue of road costs because even Mr Katter concedes, and I know and you know, that the price differential out in the rural and remote areas throughout Australia, in the decentralised parts of Australia, is significantly higher and not solelyâbut significantlyâattributable to the road costs.</para><para>The government states at 61.01 in their tax package that the road transport costs, the costs to the road transport companies, will go down by 6.7 per cent. When one looks at the price effects on the consumers, as listed at page 172 of the same document, it says the transport costs will go up by 2.6 per cent. They are not my figures, they are the figures in the government's document. So, quite clearly, what Mr Katter is on about is compensation to those people who live in rural and remote areasânot only of Queensland but of Western Australia and other decentralised parts of 
 Australiaâfor the increased tax that they will have to pay because they are paying a higher price.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">CAMPBELL</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Campbell</name></talker><para>âWhat did you compensate them for in 1993, you hypocrite?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>7L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Hogg, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HOGG</name></talker><para>âWait a minute. What we are saying, Senator Campbell, is that those people in the rural and regional areas will be paying a significantly higher amount of tax. The 10 per cent might be the same but the tax that those people are paying will be higher. On the issue of compensation and how it was addressed by the Deputy Leader of the National Party, one goes to the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline>  of 24 September this year. I cite the article of 24 September from the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> . It states:</para></talk.start></continue><para>The Nationals' deputy leader, Mr John Anderson, ruled out further compensation measures to protect rural residents. "I believe that we have ensured that no one will be worse off," he said.</para><para>That is simply not the case because people in rural parts of Queensland, for example, where their prices are significantly higher, will pay a significantly higher proportion of that money through the GST. So Mr Katter expresses a view which the coalition have failed to address in their policy. Let us look further at comments made by Mr Katter. A release from the <inline font-style="italic">Herald and Weekly Times </inline> of 16 September this year stated:</para><para>Mr Katter and Dawson MP De-Anne Kelly have promised to cross the floor to protest against the GST, unless compensation is offered, claiming fuel prices will rise under the government's packages.</para><para>Wherever you look you will see that Mr Katter at least is consistent in his approach in defending his constituency out there. Mr Katter sums it up by saying in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline>  of 1 December that he was concerned that the GST would make goods and services in remote areas even more costly. So the issue is compensation, the issue is the fact that the 10 per cent will be applied differently because prices are higher in rural and regional areas. The rural constituents and regional constituents will pay more.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>1094</page.no><name role="metadata">Watson, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WATSON</name><name.id>VJ4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe thrust of Senator Mackay's question was an attempt to distinguish between the indirect cost effect of the Labor Party's proposalsâthe troglodyte theories 
 they have at the momentâas opposed to the new taxation system that the Liberal-National coalition proposes. In line with Senator Mackay's evaluation, which was not all that accurate, I propose to use the microcosm that she used, and that is my state of Tasmania, because this new tax system will have a very positive impact on the state and also on the finances of the state. Our state, Tasmania, will benefit in many ways from this new taxation system, which is more than just a GST.</para></talk.start><para>The Tasmanian economy will benefit because the cost of transporting goods and passengers across Bass Strait will be reduced due to the effective elimination of the tax on marine fuelâa very important cost of getting across Bass Strait. The net excise payable on diesel fuelâalso used in the heavy transport and rail industriesâalso will fall sharply.</para><para>The Labor Party seems to think we have an obsession with rail and heavy trucksâtrue. The transport industries will be big beneficiaries because these are the industries that will lose the heavy wholesale sales tax on all their inputsâtheir tyres, their tarpaulins, their spares, their jinkers, and so on.

Think of that competition that we now suffer from New Zealand, quite unfairly, because of the cascading impact of all those sales taxes and other taxes. Whereas, under a GST, our farmers and our horticultural producers on the north-west coastâaround Launceston, if you are not even aware of itâwill benefit because, other things being equal, they will be able to compete on a much more level playing field. We know they are competitive now, so how much better off will they be? How many more jobs will be found?</para></talk.start></continue><para>It will also affect tourism. What happened to tourism last year as a result of that great deal between the Rundle government and the federal coalition? We saw the introduction of the Incat services which brought in $16 million of extra revenue to Tasmania and 
 extended the tourism season well into the wintertime. The tourism industry will be a big beneficiary from the lower transport costs. Tourism promoters in the remote areas will also benefit from their relief from excise for off-road use of dieselâremote area power generation, and so on. We are looking at a combination of all those tax measures which are there to benefit Tasmania. So far as the government of Tasmania is concerned, it will have sustainable revenue to spend on important community services. This measure will also permit the abolition of some of the worst taxes, like the bank transactions tax and certain other taxes.</para><para>Let us summarise the benefits to rural and regional Australia, because that is what the question is all about. The coalition can deliver real benefits to real Australia where the real incomes are earnedâout in the regions. That is indeed good. We have always acknowledged the problem in Australia of the wholesale sales tax and the problem it creates for transport in getting goods to remote areas. The cost of transport to rural and regional Australia will effectively be reduced. Let us look at the figures: the cost for off-road users will reduce from 43 cents per litre to zero cents per litre and, for the larger transport users, including rail, it will reduce from 43 cents per litre to 18 cents per litre. These cost savings will be passed on. They will benefit the consumers. They will benefit the people who need this.

But, since we have been in, the economy has been brought back under control. Today's economic figures are a vindication of the government's good economic management. Why? Because the government has been living within its means like every other household in Australia, including those in regional Australia.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Everyone in regional Australia knows that the fundamental thing you have to do is actually live within your income. You have never learnt that, and you are still preaching spending up and spending big. That is what you did in the last four years of your reign and people in regional Australia were badly hurt as a consequence.</para><para>Now we have got interest rates down to the lowest level for several decades. They are at record low levels. We have strong economic growth. We have low inflation. They are the key things that really matter to people in regional Australia. Why are they living in regional Australia? They are running businesses in regional Australia. That is what it is all about.</para><para>The next thing, which we put on the agenda over a year ago, is tax reform. Why do we want tax reform? Because everyone in Australia knows the current tax system is an absolute mess. The Labor Party is committed to keeping the wholesale sales tax. You put it up substantially in 1993 and hurt people, with no compensationâno compensation to regional Australia, no compensation to pensioners, no compensation to anybody. You put up taxes very substantially in 1993 without warning anyone about it.</para><para>We have gone out and said, `We want to change the tax system to make it fairer. We want to restore incentives for people to work, save, invest and prosper.' That is what we are on about. In regional Australia our new tax system will provide just that. It will provide big incentives for people to actually stay in the regions and make businesses work. Why? Because we are going to deliver, on average, 3.2 per cent lower costs for business in Australia.</para><para>The regions of Australia are the major exporters. From this new tax system the cost of exports are going to be down by 3Â½ per cent, equivalent to $4Â½ billion per annum. What is going to come out of this? Lower costs for business, lower costs for exports, stronger economic growth and more jobs.</para><para>The firm, Econtech, which is here in Canberra, did a job for KPMG a couple of months ago. Their estimate was that the Australian economy would grow by 1.8 per cent extra as a result of this tax reform and would provide many thousands of jobs as a consequence. Other estimates have been done, not by the government but by others, running the extra economic growth up to as far as 3Â½ per cent higher. So the regions will, in fact, be better off. They will have lower income taxes, more money to spend in their pocket 
 and their businesses will prosper so they will have more jobs, higher incomes and be better off. My colleagues have been through the matter of lower transport costs which are really the dominating costs in regional Australia. We are lowering those costs substantially, by 6.7 per cent, particularly with regard to trucks.

Of course, this matter should be debated and of course it should be voted on. I would like to have heard from Senator Colston, as Senator Bartlett did, as to why he does not think that is the case. He has effectively blocked a vote on this motion. I think therefore he owes it to the Senate to get up and say why he has taken that action. It is not good enough to just sit in his chair and not respond to Senator Bartlett's request for a log of reasons. We have not seen this happen in the Senate for many months now. It is getting near to the end of the year, and Senator Colston will be as aware as any other senator that matters that do not get voted on now are likely not to get treatment for many months.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Bartlett gave notice of this motion a few weeks agoâa motion concerning discrimination against gay people. The motion is consequent upon the murder of a young gay man, Matthew Shepherd, in the United States in October. This murder raised international furore. In fact, it was featured on the front of <inline font-style="italic">Time</inline> magazine around the world. Subsequent to that, incidents, including at 
 least one in Western Australia in relation to vilification of people because of their sexuality,  came to the fore. It is some small respite from that trajectory of events that we read in today's <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline> that there has been a court case in favour of people who have been mistreated because of their sexuality in that state.</para><para>But we all knowâand particularly people who are in the gay community knowâthat discrimination is rampant, that people who are ostensibly gay or who make that component of themselves clear face vilification, and that it is a very injurious thing for those people to have to endure that, particularly young people.</para><para>This is a serious matter. It deserves debate in the Senate. It is an urgent matter for those people living with discrimination. It occurs to them out of the blue when they are least expecting it. They deserve to have the knowledge at least that the parliament is on their side and that there are actions being taken toâas Senator Bartlett's motion saysâ`condemn discrimination, vilification and violence against all persons'. Surely, Senator Colston cannot disagree with that sentiment. That is the active component of this motion: that the Senate should condemn `discrimination, vilification, and violence against all persons'. Is that too hard to make up one's mind on?

I have indicated previously that, given the significance of this motion, it is important to briefly explain to the Senate the rationale behind it.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The opposition has been utterly consistent in two aspects of its approach on the GST. The first is that we do not believe that a GST can be made fair for all Australians. The second is that we believe the parliament and the people of Australia, the Australian public, deserve to have all the information before them before a final decision is made in relation to the package of legislation that has now been introduced into the parliament. That is exactly why we have supported and sought a full Senate inquiry process. This is something to which the government has now been dragged kicking and screamingâeventually and reluctantlyâto accept.</para><para>The government's reluctance to have comprehensive and thorough scrutiny of this legislation is very evident for all to see. It has held up the introduction of this legislation into the parliament until this week. We have had a situation where the Treasurer has been deriding the inquiry process. I would be interested to understand whether coalition senators in this chamber agree with the Treasurer in relation to his derision, given that they in fact voted for the Senate inquiry that has now been established.</para><para>Over past weeks we have had unfounded allegations from the government that the 
 opposition has been attempting to filibuster on this matter, but we are determined, as we have very clearly said, to do our best to meet the current timetable. The government needs to take up its responsibilities so the proper conduct of the Senate inquiries can be assisted. That is the point of this motion.</para><para>It is important that the committees that are responsible for scrutinising the GST proposals are given full, unhindered access to relevant documents and officers. It is also important that access is given to all the relevant documents and material at the commencement of the process, given that the legislation is now before the parliament and given that the work of the Senate committees is now commencing. It is important that the material is made available for the benefit of the Senate and the Australian public.</para><para>We are providing, through this particular motion, an opportunity for the government to set in train the process before this year's parliamentary sittings conclude. I think we have been reasonable in setting out our requirements. We extended the deadline of this particular motion, in the first instance, to the last sitting week of this year, but the debate has been held up because Senator Kemp has been indisposed and because a very large number of documents are encompassed by the motion before the chair.</para><para>We are well aware of the power of Senate committees to compel the production of documents, but the committees may not be able to make the necessary moves until next year. We are keen for the committees to commence work as soon as possible. The government's modelling data and other material will allow an early and, I hope, a constructive start to that process. Sooner or later, I believe the parliament will get these documents. I think it is in the interests of the government, the parliament and the public that it be sooner rather than later.</para><para>The test with this motion for the government today is to provide these documents to the Senate. The documents go to the fairness of the proposals, the effect of inflation, the impact on jobs, and the related economic and other effects of the new tax proposals. This particular motion commends itself to the 
 Senate. I thank the Senate for the opportunity to outline briefly the importance and significance of the motion.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:25:00</time.stamp><page.no>1108</page.no><name role="metadata">Minchin, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator MINCHIN</name><name.id>JX4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Industry, Science and Resources</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âby leaveâThe government opposes this motion. We do so for some very simple reasons. The opposition, which is moving this motion, is completely opposed to a GST. The opposition has already made up its mind on this issue. It is not fair dinkum about an inquiry to examine whether a GST would be good or bad. It has already made up its mind. It is fatuous in the extreme to be demanding documents relating to the question of whether a GST is good or bad when the opposition has already made up its mind.</para></talk.start><para>The government has already agreed to a full inquiry into the matter by four Senate committees. That is unprecedented. They will be taking five months to inquire into all aspects of the tax reform package. This particular motion does not add anything to what is about to occurâa five-month process of inquiry. I also point out that a number of the documents which the opposition seeks have already been made public.</para><para>The household expenditure survey, which is the very first document sought by the opposition, has already been tabled. To the embarrassment of the opposition, it shows that, on the basis on which price changes are measured, the estimated price change is actually lower than the price change which the government, through the Treasury, has assumed will occur. The Treasury assumption is based on its analysis of a 1.9 per cent price change, while the HES estimate is 1.8 per cent. That documentation has already been released.</para><para>This motion refers to the Gibson report. That has already been made public and is available to members of the opposition if they want to examine it. Finally, the government has released the Vos committee report, which goes into considerable detail on a whole range of issues. That document is also in this motion. On that basis, and given the fact that the opposition is totally opposed to a GST anyway and is not fair dinkum about this, we oppose the motion.</para><para>	 Motion (<inline font-weight="bold">Senator Faulkner's</inline> ) put.</para></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>16:32:00</time.stamp><para>The Senate divided.	</para></division.header><para>(The PresidentâSenator the Hon.

It is the kind of motion that, when you put it into the computer, comes up in green because it is a long sentence, but all the 
 elements of the sentence are very important, and during our contributions today you will see why.</para><para>There are several aspects to this motion. The first is that the signing of the Western Australia Regional Forest Agreement should be deferred. Why? Because the process to date has been an unmitigated disaster and has failed to acknowledge the interests of all stakeholders. Conservation groups agreed to be part of the RFA process until they, along with the tourism industry and local government, were blocked from participating in the steering committee. The steering committee determined much of the research to be undertaken and the direction in which the Regional Forest Agreement would go and was dominated by those committed to maintaining logging in high conservation value forests. So it was set up to come to a certain conclusion, and it is no wonder that it lost credibility at an early stage.</para><para>There needs to be a moratorium on the logging of high conservation value old growth forests until the Regional Forest Agreement, or the alternative accord or agreement process that has been proposed, is finalised. Why is that necessary? Because the Department of Conservation and Land Management is currently undertaking a massive logging program in the hope that any area of disputed conservation value will not be there by the time the deal is finalised. Conservation and Land Management's arrogant disregard for the process is outrageous. A recent trip I took to the area near Northcliffe confirmed this frenetic activity. Walking along a road going into the area, not a forest road, was actually the cause of police officers and CALM officers following individuals, including me and a staff member.</para><para>An alternative accord process involving all stakeholders should be established so that we can reach consensus on this crucial issue rather than perpetuate the conflict that has existed for so many years. The Western Australian Environment Protection Authority should formally assess any draft RFA that arises from that alternative process. I remember an answer that Senator Hill gave meâif I recall correctlyâthat he believed that would 
 happen. This is consistent with the commitments already contained in the scoping agreement for the Western Australian Regional Forest Agreement. The draft RFA should be released for public comment.</para><para>At the outset, I need to stress that the Greens agree that the best method of resolving a long running dispute about the management of forests is to bring all stakeholders together so that we can move towards a consensus solution. The crash through approach which has been characteristic of the RFA process to date is as unsustainable as the forest management regime promoted by CALM. There are genuine win-win solutions in relation to forest management. The Western Australian Forest Alliance produced a very professionally researched proposal for a comprehensive, adequate and represented forest conservation reserve system and sustainable timber production in Western Australia. While that proposal points out in its introduction that only 15 per cent of Western Australia's original old growth forest remains, they have proposed that 60 per cent of existing state native forests would remain available for sustainable log production. Those issues and proposals deserve serious consideration. So far, they have not been properly taken into consideration.</para><para>The Western Australian Forest Alliance also proposes pulp and paper mills for downstream processing, an increased plantation and agroforestry industry, valued added enterprises in furniture and fine wood craft and the use of structural adjustment funding to assist in the development of a truly sustainable timber industry in Western Australia. Industries such as tourism should not be forgotten. We are looking at 10,000 people employed in the south west of Western Australia, compared with ABS statistics in 1997 which show a total of 2,290 people directly employed in the native forest timber industry.</para><para>The role of CALM is also crucial in any debate around the Western Australian RFA. The unanimous all party report of the Western Australian ecologically sustainable development committee processed by the legislative council standing committee stated in its recommendations that the Department of 
 Premier and Cabinet be given the lead agency status for the remaining stages of the RFA process. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>1111</page.no><name role="metadata">Knowles, Sen Susan</name><name role="display">Senator KNOWLES</name><name.id>TH4</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âToday we are debating the urgency motion by Senator Margetts basically calling for a moratorium on the logging of high conservation value forests. I make the point early in this debate that Senator Margetts seems to have overlooked or forgotten that a deferred forest agreement is in place. The deferred agreement does not allow logging in forests that might be necessary for a comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system and is, in all but name, a moratorium on those areas of high conservation value that might be required for conservation reasons. It is also important to state that the RFA process is in its final stage of negotiations and follows a very comprehensive scientific and consultative process over the past two years. So this is not something that has just come up now and is being rushed through.</para></talk.start><para>To do what Senator Margetts is suggesting today would certainly lead to a greater degree of uncertainty and would disadvantage those communities that are looking for the long-term security that the RFA will deliver. I do not think that the concern of people about old growth forests should be underestimated. This is not something that is being taken lightly.</para><para>The background to the RFA process is worth noting. The hallmark of the RFA process in all states, including Western Australia, is the rigorous scientific assessment of the full range of forest valuesâenvironmental, natural and cultural heritage, economic and social valuesâgiving rise to the title `Comprehensive regional assessment'. The development of the RFAs is based therefore on this particular assessment.</para><para>While the RFA is being developed, and during the conduct of these assessments, areas that may be required for the reserve system are protected through the deferred forest agreement and, effectively, a moratorium on logging of areas of potentially high conservation values. That is once again a reason why there is some degree of misunderstandingâI would put it that wayâin what Senator 
 Margetts is saying. There is virtually a moratorium in place at the moment. At the commencement of the RFA process in Western Australia, a series of public meetings were conducted in regional centres through to Perth to inform people of the proposed approach to the process and to seek their views on how it should be conducted.</para><para>My other Western Australian colleagues in the coalition speaking today will of course expand on the fact that in Western Australia the environmental heritage assessments were progressed in a very comprehensive fashion. They will also talk about the specific examples of how the environmental heritage assessments were conducted. One of the things that I would like to mention is the work that was done by Dr Libby Mattiske in her undertaking of vegetation mapping within the region. That particular work by Dr Mattiske as an independent consultant actually won a national mapping award. So I do not think, as just one part of that assessment that has been made, that it could ever be said to be inadequate in any sense.</para><para>More than 30 assessment reports on the values of the forest have been made available to the public, including the scientific community, along with an overview reportâthe comprehensive regional assessment reportâwhich was released in January of this year. Based on the outcomes of these reports, both governments have been involved in integrating all of the assessmentsâenvironmental, heritage, economic and socialâto develop the draft RFA.</para><para>An important stage of this part of the process has been the release of the consultation document titled <inline font-style="italic">Towards a regional forest agreement for the south-west forest region of Western Australia</inline>. That was released in May this year and it details the current situation, the objectives of the RFA and some possible approaches that could lead to a balanced RFA outcome. A critical element of the RFA process has been the consultation and participation in the process by the stakeholders, the scientific experts and the communities likely to be affected by the outcomes of the eventual Western Australian RFA.  </para><para>Once again, I say that I do not think it is fair or reasonable to suggest that there has not been considerable consultation with all those interested stakeholders. The formal process for hearing the view of stakeholders has been through the stakeholder reference group: the Noongar action group and the State Agreement Acts committee. All stakeholders were invited to participate in the reference group which was established to facilitate direct stakeholder input to the RFA steering committee, allowing more than 60 stakeholder groups long-term input into the RFA process. The stakeholder reference group comprises a broad range of stakeholders, including representatives from the tourism, mining and timber industries, local conservation groups, shire councils, Western Australian government agencies, indigenous groups and forest product industries such as seed collecting, bee keeping and wildflower picking.</para><para>All RFA material has been made available to the public at 20 display centres scattered throughout the region. Major reports have also been made available on the Internet. The CRA report and public consultation paper, along with key assessment reports such as the national estate report, were mailed out to a broad range of stakeholders, academics and individuals. All reports are available on request.</para><para>There was also a two-month public consultation period from the end of May to the end of July on the contents of the public consultation paper, supported by a series of open days, an RFA info-line and a network of information centres throughout the south-west. Some 30,000 submissions were received during the consultation period and each submission has been carefully analysed and taken into account during the finalisation of the RFA.</para><para>During the entire RFA process, there has been a series of newsletters produced which provided information on the process and opportunities for public input. It is also relevant to note that Commonwealth and state officials are available to discuss issues pertaining to the RFA with stakeholder groups and individuals as required. I also think it is fair to say that the government is somewhat 
 disappointed that the peak conservation groups, the Western Australian Conservation Council and the Wilderness Society, have chosen not to participate in the process and the government continues to encourage their involvement. It is a shame because I think if there is a sense of goodwill this can be resolved in an amicable climate. But if you do not have parties prepared to come to the table for consultation and briefing, then that makes that process all that much more difficult.</para><para>I simply say to the Senate that there are many things that have been done, and continue to be done, which time does not allow me to coverâbut I know my colleagues will. The role of the Western Australian EPA and the Commonwealth statutory responsibilities have been equally important. The report by the Western Australian Legislative Council standing committee is most significant, and there are a number of other issues. I think it is important that it is recognised by all the stakeholders on both sides of the fence that this is not something that has just been dreamt up overnight. It is not something that is taken lightly; it is something where the consultation process has been completely and utterly open to all participants, but also open to scrutiny.</para><para>I think that is a most significant thing as well because too often people might claim, in one form or another, that the thing has not been open to scrutiny by all the stakeholders and that much of the information has not been shared. It is for that reason that it does disturb the government that there has been a lack of willingness by the WA Conservation Council and the Wilderness Society to participate in the process because we certainly do want to have their input. They have had the opportunity to do so and I certainly hope that they acknowledge their input is required and come to the table sooner rather than later.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>1112</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe ALP will support the urgency motion, with the change of one word. We do not want to embrace the concept of a new accord process, a formal sort of process. If Senator Margetts is prepared to change the word `accord' to `consultation', I do not think it will change the resolution all that much in 
 its meaning and effect, but it will be more attractive to us. We would support it with that amendment.</para></talk.start><para>There is a number of reasons the opposition is concerned about what is happening in Western Australia. Senator Knowles presents a glowing picture of the scenery over there as she sees it, but the fact of the situation in WA is that there is enormous concern, widespread concern, from the general public as to what is happening to Western Australian forests. Public opinion polls taken in that state indicate that over 80 per cent of the electorate of Western Australia do not want old-growth forests to be logged for woodchipping. Over 70 per cent want a fair and sustainable balance to be struck with logging over there, and they do not believe they are getting it at the moment under the process that is being pursued by the WA government and CALM.</para><para>I believe we in the Senate need to be concerned for two reasons. Firstly, we need to be concerned about the actual process and outcomes in Western Australia. But, secondly, we also need to be concerned about the attitude of the federal government in this place. We have two responsible ministers in this area. We have Minister Tuckey, whose attitudes have become increasingly more well known and, as they become increasingly well known, people are more and more concerned about them. This is the minister who, in the <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline> just two weeks ago, was quoted as saying that, as far as he was concerned, he will allow planned logging of all the old-growth forests over timeâapart from pristine ones. When asked, in respect of `pristine ones', what he was talking about, his bottom line basically was that he did not think there were all that many pristine ones around anyway. The minister in charge of this area does not believe in sustainable development and preservation in this area.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>UW4</name.id><name role="metadata">CRANE</name><name role="display">Senator Crane</name></talker><para>âWhere did you get that from?</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>TH4</name.id><name role="metadata">KNOWLES</name><name role="display">Senator Knowles</name></talker><para>âThat is just rubbish.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>XE4</name.id><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name></talker><para>âHe has had a chat to the public.

I refer you to the <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline>  newspaper where he boasted very strongly about that being his position.</para></talk.start></continue><para>But the other concern I have is that we have an environment minister in this place who does not, in any sense at all, show he has the backbone to stand up to the likes of Wilson Tuckey. Senator Hill has a responsibility which is different to Mr Tuckey's. He has got a responsibility as environment minister to ensure those principles of sustainability, those principles of ensuring old-growth forests are protected, are factored into the process. What is Senator Hill's response? Senator Hill's response is basically to say, `Look, I congratulate Wilson Tuckey because he brings knowledge and exposure of the issues to the task.' At a time when he should be standing up against Wilson Tuckey, he greets him into the fold and says, `This bloke knows what he is doing.' It is no wonder that the concern in Western Australia is widespread and growing.</para><para>The Labor Party is committed to the RFA process, but we believe that, in this particular case, the process has gone wrong and has not been based on scientific assessment. We are concerned, as are the public of Western Australia, as to the process. I mentioned the <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline>, but a recent editorial in the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Times</inline> is also worth placing on the record in this place. It argued:</para><para>The state government must put more emphasis on the establishment and cutting of plantation timber, not devastating old forests. The state and federal government should accept that most reasonable Western Australians don't want any more old-growth forests cut down. Clear-felling of these magnificent treesâa wonderful tourist attraction in their own rightâhas been a disaster. If it continues, the only old-growth forests eventually will be in national parks.</para><para>This is from the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Times</inline> , and it reflects the mood of Western Australia; a mood that was reflected by the WA Legislative Council Standing Committee on Ecologically Sustainable Development in a unanimous report condemning the process.</para><para>If that is not enough, let us also put on the record the view of the National Party in WA. It is important to put this view on the record now, before we get to a vote, because I think it is incumbent on the Nationals on this place to listen to their state colleagues. The Nationals in this place always claim to be the defenders of state rights. They always claim to be listening closely to the grassroots of their organisation. The grassroots of the National Party organisation in Western Australia could not be any more clear. They have issued a press release and they have issued a document. I will seek leave later on to incorporate the document in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>.</para><para>It is a document that condemns, in a whole range of ways, the WA RFA process. For instance, it says that the release of a draft RFA for public comment and assessment by the Environment Protection Authority is necessary. It says that what is also required as an outcome is a reduction in the first and second grade jarrah sawlog cut to no more than 2,080 cubic metres per year. It demands the protection of local areas of high conservation value. It demands assistance to the timber industry to encourage greater value adding and the maintenance of employment levels. It demands a review of CALM's funding sources and requirements. It is interesting to go through that document.</para><para>The National Party in Western Australia is of a view that it remains concerned that, as the RFA process draws to a conclusion, a number of significant issues are still to be openly and publicly addressed. They are concerned about the forest estate viability and the timber industry's economic growth. But they say the public deserves comprehensive explanations, before the RFA is concluded, of the way in which the RFA and the state government will ensure responsible management.</para><para>They are concerned about the logging of standard first grade jarrah. They are concerned that such logging could lead the public to conclude that the jarrah forest is being over cut over a shorter rotation period to ensure timber royalty income is maintained at optimum levels at the expense of sawn-off quality.  </para><para>They are particularly concerned about the role of CALM. They say of CALM that it appears that large sections of the community believe, rightly or wrongly, that CALM's financial interests in forest management place public interests at a disadvantage.</para><para>The National's concern is that the agency's business structure, from which it derives royalties from timber companies on behalf of the state and which is used to fund its forest management conservation operations, leaves it open to the question of the possibility that timber companies may be contracted by CALM to purchase quantities of logs greater than the level of market demand. That is a consistent concern that you hear across Western Australia. It is a concern that did not just come from the WA Nationals; it was also reflected in the Western Australian <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Times</inline> newspaper.</para><para>Senator Knowles says, `Well, it's not going on. The process is continuing, but do not think that the logging is continuing.' It is continuing. There is some concern at officer level in the federal government, but it is not concern that has been reflected by the minister. Apparently in WA there is concern being expressed by Commonwealth officialsâas I said, ignored by their ministerâthat the Western Australian minister for the environment be notified. In fact the Commonwealth officials have informed the WA minister for the environment of their concerns about the current logging of the interim-listed Wattle Block near Northcliffe on Western Australia's south coast. They are concerned about that. They are concerned about current logging and their concerns have been raised with the WA minister. They are concerned that this particular forest block is on the Interim Register of the National Estate. It has high conservation values. Despite that, the RFA process is allowing that particular area to continue to be logged.</para><para>The opposition are concerned about a process in WA that we feel is not sufficiently scientifically based. We are concerned about a process that does not provide for the respect and recognition of the principles of sustainability. It is a process that does not provide sufficient protection.

The RFA is an agreement between the Commonwealth and state governments which is designed to define `the range of economic and environmental obligations which each government has regarding the long-term management and protection of forest values in specific regions'.</para><para>The RFA process in WA's south west forest region should:</para><para>identify areas within the region that both governments believe are required for the establishment of a comprehensive, adequate and representative forest reserve system, and provide for the conservation of these areas;</para><para>provide for the ecologically-sustainable management and use of forested areas in the region; and</para><para>provide for the long-term stability of the forest and forest-based industries.</para><para>The Nationals recognise that the overriding intention of the proposed RFA in WA is to deliver general community agreement on the utilisation of WA's public native forests for the next 20 years. The party concurs with the objective inherent in this process and in a public statement in September announced its support for the principle of the RFA process.</para><para>However, finding the `common ground' in the complex forest debate is an extremely difficult task, which the Nationals recognise. The community places a diverse range of values on native forest and consequently there are a number of conflicts 
 dividing interest groups on forest management principles and practices.</para><para>This is aggravated by the differing community values placed particularly on old-growth native forest ranging across economic, cultural, social, environmental or ecological and aesthetic values.</para><para>As a result, and despite the genuine commitment of many people and organisations to the RFA process since July 1996, the nationals remain concerned, as the process draws to a conclusion, that a number of significant issues are still to be openly and publicly addressed.</para><para>Jarrah: the forest's ability to sustain yields for sawn timber production</para><para>The Nationals' primary concern centres on the complex question of the jarrah forest's continuing ability to yield sawn timber of sufficient quality and volume to meet the demands of the timber industry in perpetuity.</para><para>Despite ministerial directions by the environment minister in 1993 expressly designed to encourage greater utilisation of lower grade timber, and claims to the contrary, sawlogs of varying grades remain the principle quality product for which the jarrah forest is logged.</para><para>The outcomes of a range of possible changes to the current forest reserve system that could follow the conclusion of the RFA, which are set out in a `paper to assist public consultation' published in July 1998, detail a range of effects on future sawlog volume that would be available to the timber industry.</para><para>For example, `Approach A', which would reserve the greatest area of forest for conservation under any of the three approaches, is forecast to reduce the current volume of first and second grade jarrah sawlogs that would be available for timber harvesting by up to 36,500 cubic metres per year.</para><para>The current allowable cut of first and second grade jarrah sawlogs is 490,000 cu/m per year. This was authorised by environment minister Kevin Minson in 1993 following the report of Meagher Committee. This committee noted that a long-term sustainable yield for first grade and second grade jarrah sawlogs was 300,000 cu/m per year. An allowable cut of 490,000 cu/m per year was set for a 10-year period to enable the industry to restructure its activities to account for a reduction in allowable cut to 300,000 cu/m from the year 2003.</para><para>The graph which follows depicts the difference between the Meagher committee's recommended long-term sustainable yield of first and second grade jarrah sawlogs, the allowable cut, the actual cut (1996-97) and the levels of cut under the three approaches outlined in the RFA public consultation paper.   
</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Due to the quality of documentation supplied, the graph cannot be reproduced in the Hansard.</inline></para><para>The Conservation &amp; Land Management Department's recent annual report shows a total of 374,600 cu/m of jarrah sawlogs was harvested in 1997-98. Of this, about 302,000 cu/m were classified as first-grade sawlogs. Given this, the actual cut appears to have fallen considerably (but we are not able to graph the cut of second-grade sawlogs because the volume has not been defined in the report).</para><para>In this context, and in view of the RFA public consultation paper's various conclusions about the implications of the future size of the conservation estate on sawlog production, the Nationals are concerned about CALM's recent claim, in a separate paper, that the sawlog specification `has become irrelevant'.</para><para>. . . for the future. . . the current sawlog specification has become irrelevant with the smaller dimension sawn timber now being produced to meet the demand of the future and architectural feature markets. Also, given the higher value of the output, it is now possible to make greater economic use of the tree bole.</para><para>The `tree bole' describes the quantity of timber available in a single tree from the base of the trunk to the crown. The RFA public consultation paper acknowledges that the future adoption of `whole bole' logging methods, generally in place of the current sawlog specification, will enable the timber industry to extract greater yields of timber from a tree bole than is now possible using the sawlog specification. With an uptake in lower grade logs it is anticipated that the sustainable supply of sawlogs for jarrah may vary between 410,000 and 480,000 cu/m per year'1.</para><para>To the Nationals' knowledge, no detailed information about the whole bole-logging and sawing trials conducted in 1997 has been made available to the public, although a total of 6000 tonnes of logs were supplied to 14 sawmillers for the trials. In response to a recent question about this issue, CALM said five trials of whole bole-logging in the jarrah forest had been conducted and that `initial results from the logging perspective are promising'. However, anecdotal evidence from at least one major miller who participated in a trial suggests there was a range of difficulties in handling and processing whole bole-logs at the mill.</para><para>Evidence to the Legislative Council of Western Australia's Standing Committee on Ecological Sustainable Development given by the Forest Industries Federation of WA also raised concerns about whole bole logging:</para><para>The concept of whole bole logging is that the tree is cut at the base and the crown, and what is left is the whole bole. If technically feasible 
 it is transported to a mill, otherwise it must be cut into shorter lengths. If it is not straight enough it may need to be cut. That is a different log production system from the current system which involves grading of logs in the forest. The industry and CALM are doing some trials on the concept of whole bole logging, and the main objective is to increase the overall utilisation of the timber resource. However, early indications from the trials are that we are just transferring a waste product from the forest to the mill at a fairly great expense2.</para><para>From the Nationals' research, the issue is whether it is fair to suggest and then to expect that the timber industry and the public should accept the argument that the sawlog specification will become `irrelevant' because of the future adoption of whole bole-logging and a further refinement of sawing technologies, as proposed in the RFA public consultation paper, when:</para><para>1.	 the jarrah forest is still being logged for the production of first and second grade sawlogs as the principal `quality' products</para><para>2.	 the RFA public consultation paper `approaches' detail the implications for the sawlog industry of committing additional forest to the conservation estate</para><para>3.	 and, there is a dearth of information available to the public about the viability of bole-logging and processing</para><para>The Legislative Council's standing committee recently examined sawlog yields in relation to achieving ecologically-sustainable forest management. A senior RFA official admitted in evidence to the committee that jarrah sawlog yields were irrelevant to biological sustainability.</para><para>1	<inline font-style="italic">Comprehensive Regional Assessment, 1998 p.42</inline></para><para>2<inline font-style="italic">	 Report of the Standing Committee on Ecologically Sustainable DevelopmentâThe Regional Forest Agreement Process, August 1998.</inline></para><para>The committee responded with the following statement:</para><para>The Committee does not accept that it is self-evident that the first and second grade jarrah sawlog harvest levels are irrelevant to achieving ecologically-sustainable forest management. The currently applicable parameters for timber harvest levels in the state, determined by the Minister for the Environment and applied by CALM through the Forest Management Plan are given in terms of first and second grade sawlog harvest levels. If (as the witness suggests) the RFA process has abandoned this key indicator without discussion or justification, this appears to be a serious flaw in the RFA process1. 
</para><para>The Nationals believe the matter of maintaining sustainable yield in perpetuity is central to the future of the forest estate's viability and the timber industry's economic growth. The public deserves comprehensive explanations before the RFA is concluded of the ways in which the RFA and the state government will ensure responsible management of this important community resource.</para><para>Expressing jarrah harvest levels in terms of gross bole volume (gbv) felled rather than sawlog volume removed.</para><para>Former environment minister Kevin Minson said in his 1993 statement of forest management:</para><para>I recognise that the regulation of the allowable harvest by sawlog volume is really only an indicator of gross bole volume felledâfundamental measure of forest production and sustainability. Fixing set sawlog levels has inherent disincentives to making the fullest possible use of timber felled. I therefore believe it is desirable to develop a system of yield regulation based on gross bole volume felled rather than sawlog volume removed. Once such a system is developed, harvest levels should be expressed in terms of gross bole volume felled at the maximum level equal to the gross bole incrementâthus ensuring both forest sustainability and optimum log utilisation2.</para><para>The RFA Comprehensive Regional Assessment report also claimed:</para><para>Because definitions of what constitutes a sawlog will change over time as milling technology and other factors change, the gross bole volume (gbv) is used to provide an estimate of the maximum resource available over time.</para><para>The Nationals believe CALM must explain to the public how it intends to regulate and account for the quality of the resource, in the context of its forest structural goals, when `gbv felled' descriptions and whole-bole logging methods are implemented, assuming whole-bole logging proves a viable and more efficient harvesting specification than the sawlog specification.</para><para>This would help to alleviate some of the community's concerns that a switch to `gbv felled' may create a more juvenile forest, making it difficult for industry maintenance and development to be based on solid sawn timber production.</para><para>CALM and industry need to justify to the wider community that a switch to `gbv-felled' to express jarrah harvest levels and the adoption of whole bole-logging methods are in the best interests of the timber industry and the forest sustainability.</para><para>The need for industry to plan its restructuring</para><para>As already reported, the Meagher committee determined the volume of the long-term, non- 
 declining yield of first and second grade jarrah sawlogs to be 300,000 cu/m per year.</para><para>The RFA public consultation paper suggests that this decline may be partially offset by:</para><para>an increase in the uptake of lower grade jarrah logs</para><para>the future adoption of whole tree-bole logging methods</para><para>the further refinement of sawing technologies to enable lower grade logs to be sawn</para><para>However, details of whole tree-bole logging trials have not been disclosed and there has been little uptake of lower grade material since Minson's 1993 statement.</para><para>This would suggest that the timber industry is still focused on sawlogs as the primary quality source of timber.</para><para>If Approaches A and B outlined in the RFA public consultation paper can be described as having a negative impact on employment in the timber industry and employees' quality of life, access to social and physical infrastructure and community viability, then a reduction in allowable cut to 300,000 cu/m for first and second grade jarrah sawlogs per year from 2003 will be of significant concern to the timber industry.</para><para>As the Legislative Council standing committee's recent report on the RFA process notes:</para><para>It is disappointing that the `approaches' do not propose levels for jarrah first and second grade sawlog harvest which are in the vicinity of CALM's estimated level of 300,000 cu/m per year. . . This will significantly affect timber businesses and workers currently reliant on the jarrah resource. . . Given the intention of the RFA process to cater for employment and community needs, it is somewhat surprising that options such as these are not canvassed in the public consultation paper.</para><para>The Nationals have similar concerns. Until there is any evidence to support whole-bole logging methods and a significant uptake in lower grade logs, it would seem the industry is relying heavily on sawlogs for sawn timber production. Therefore, plans for industry restructuring are vital given a forecast drop in supply in the year 2003.</para><para>Forest management and silvicultural treatment for timber production in the jarrah forest</para><para>The Nationals are concerned about a lack of information generally available to the public, and hence a lack of public debate, about the implications of forest management in relation to silvicultural practice.</para><para>In 1991-92 the area of jarrah forest `treated' by CALM to meet contemporary log supply contracts and to ensure future supply availability totalled 
 10,550 hectares. This area has steadily increased since 1991-92 to a total of 20,190 ha in 1996-97.</para><para>What is of concern is that CALM told the Environmental Protection Authority in 1993 that silvicultural practice would generally be limited to certain silvicultural treatments, each expressed as a percentage of the total area to be `treated'.</para><para>However, there have been some significant differences in the actual use of these various treatments, with a marked increase in the area treated as:</para><para>1.	 `shelterwood', in which a forest stand is cut, but not cleared, to encourage seedfall and the production of jarrah lignotubers, and</para><para>2.	 `selective', in which stands of marginal forest are cut</para><para>In a written response to a series of questions about these silvicultural treatments, CALM told the Nationals the increased area cut to shelterwood in recent years `is an indication that a more precautionary approach is being taken to ensure that sufficient growing stock is available for release. Shelterwood cutting has only been introduced since the late 1980s and forest officers and silviculturists have been learning how best to apply this treatment to various forest types'.</para><para>It is also of concern to the timber industry that the size and quality of a standard first-grade jarrah sawlog, for example, has changed significantly over time. This could lead the public to conclude that the jarrah forest is being over-cut, over a shorter rotation length to ensure government timber royalty income is maintained at optimum levels at the expense of sawlog quality.</para><para>None of these issues has been canvassed in the current public debate, nor in the RFA public consultation paper. The Nationals believe it is appropriate, given the high level of public interest in forest management issues, that comprehensive explanations of the reasons for the apparent changes in silvicultural treatments and reported changes in sawlog quality should be placed on the public record.</para><para>Silvicultural treatments in the karri forest</para><para>The government's current forest management plan required 2000 ha per year of regrowth karri to be thinned to ensure that its viability as a future source of sawn timber is maintained at an optimum level.</para><para>However, in the four years to 1996-97, a total of just 140 ha of regrowth karri was thinned despite a requirement that this treatment should have taken place in about 8000 ha of forest. CALM claims that in the past four to five years it has been required to reschedule logging into areas of karri forest previously cut under a selection-logging prescription in the 1950s and 1960s `because of Commonwealth government processes and litigation which 
 have deferred logging in other old-growth karri areas'.</para><para>In response to a question about this marked reduction in thinning treatment, CALM told the Nationals that `short-term delays in thinning schedules will not significantly affect future sawlog availability'. CALM continued: `Also, karri is a self-thinning species. The future sawlog crop trees will continue to grow and develop without intervention by thinning.'</para><para>Again, the Nationals believe it is appropriate that a comprehensive explanation of the reason for this change in silvicultural practice should be placed on the public record.</para><para>The role and responsibilities of the public forest management agency</para><para>The Conservation and Land Management Department (CALM) is the principal agency responsible for public native forest management in Western Australia.</para><para>For a number of years some sections of the community have perceived an inherent conflict of interest in CALM's administrative charter, centred on the agency's responsibility to ensure the proper management of the public native forest estate but which requires both the conservation and exploitation of the forest resource.</para><para>The Nationals expect the government to conduct a comprehensive, independent study of CALM's administrative responsibilities beyond the issues raised by the report of the independent expert advisory group on the assessment of ecologically-sustainable forest management which was conducted as part of the RFA process.</para><para>The public has a right to expect that government agencies responsible for the management of any public property, and especially `property' as sensitive as a limited native forest resource of which a significant part has been acknowledged as `not (being) in a steady state', will discharge its responsibilities entirely in the public interest. However, it appears that large sections of the community believe, rightly or wrongly, that CALM's financial interest in forest management places the public interest at a disadvantage.</para><para>The Nationals are also concerned that the agency's business structure, by which it derives royalties from timber companies on behalf of the state and which are used to fund its forest management and conservation operations, leaves open to question the possibility that timber companies may be contracted by CALM to purchase quantities of logs greater than the level of market demand.</para><para>The Nationals believe the significant public interest in these matters should be addressed.</para><para>Report of the Legislative Council of Western Australia's Standing Committee on Ecologically 
 Sustainable Development (ESD)âThe Regional Forest Agreement Process</para><para>The Western Australian Legislative Council's all-party select committee inquiring into ecologically sustainable development in Western Australia has delivered an unanimous interim report on the RFA process.</para><para>The committee has recommended that the Department of Premier and Cabinet assume responsibility from CALM as the lead agency for the rest of the RFA process and that an accord process be developed between industry, conservation, government and other interests in an effort to reduce the level of conflict surrounding forest management.</para><para>Recommendations include:</para><para>development of an accord process to determine an acceptable definition of old growth forests</para><para>flexible application of JANIS criteria to ensure protection of local conservation needs</para><para>recognition be given to community support for more reservation of the main belt karri forest</para><para>consideration by the proposed accord process about how the implementation of the long-term sustainable jarrah sawlog harvest is to be achieved</para><para>The committee has also reinforced a view that the RFA does not have to be finalised until the year 2000 and that the intent of the scoping agreement for the RFA process be honoured by the State Government by releasing a draft RFA for public comment and assessment by the WA Environmental Protection Authority.</para><para>Environmental Protection Authority's Report on CALM's 1997 progress and compliance on the implementation of the 1994-2003 Forest Management Plan (subject to ministerial conditions)</para><para>An advisory committee to the Western Australian Environmental Protection Authority, which has been examining CALM's progress and compliance report with its implementation of the current forest management plan, subject to certain ministerial conditions, is expected to present its report to the EPA in the near future.</para><para>CALM is of the view that the RFA and the EPA advisory committee review are two separate processes, which is obvious. In a written response to a question about the EPA review, CALM told the Nationals it did not believe the review could have a bearing on any aspect of the RFA's outcome.</para><para>Given the scope and timeliness of these two separate and independent inquiries, the Nationals believe it is imperative that the ESD Committee's and EPA committee's findings are considered before any determination is made to conclude the RFA.  
</para><para>RFA Scoping Agreement</para><para>A scoping agreement signed by the Commonwealth and state governments in July 1996 confirmed the government's intentions to proceed with the negotiation of a Regional Forest Agreement for the south-west forest region of Western Australia.</para><para>While the Nationals recognise that this agreement has no legal capacity, it has had the effect of creating a public expectation that any draft RFA should be the subject of an environmental impact assessment by the Western Australian EPA before the RFA is concluded.</para><para>There is a significant public interest in this matter, with some sections of the community now of the view that such an assessment would be likely to provide further protection of the public's interest in comprehensive forest management.</para><para>The Nationals believe the government, as a `decision-making authority' under the terms of the EPA Act, is at best required to refer any draft RFA to the EPA for assessment. It at least has a moral obligation to do so. This has been reiterated in the ESD Committee's report.</para><para>Local conservation needs</para><para>Forest areas of `high conservation value' have been identified by local communities. These include, for example, Jane, Giblett, Hawke, Sharpe and Hilliger, all of which are now well known in the public arena.</para><para>As the ESD standing committee's recent report highlighted:</para><para>The difficulty the RFA process poses for people interested in reservations in a particular location is that JANIS criteria percentage targets for reservation could be met without the claims for reservation of a particular location having even been considered.</para><para>The committee also recommended:</para><para>. . . the flexibility provisions in the JANIS criteria be used to promote local conservation and recreation needs and to improve the distribution of reserved areas, particularly in areas where little old growth is identified by the Comprehensive Regional Assessment.</para><para>A concern of the Nationals is that nearly  all areas of high conservation value, according to maps of the forest estate published during the RFA process, correspond with the areas of highest significance for sustained timber yield for the next 40 years.</para><para>It is apparent that there is a conflict as to how these areas should be managed and this may require an independent assessment to examine the values of these areas, including tourism's economic potential.

These people are no doubt far more representative of mainstream Australia than are the timber company executives who are magnificently remunerated in their work of trashing our national heritage.</para><para>Even the National Party, as Senator Bolkus has said, has come out against the decimation of jarrah forests. When the National Party comes out against logging, surely the right thing for the Court government to do is to shut up and listen just for a change. If Premier Court were here today, I would ask him to remember his father's words. Sir Charles Court promised exactly 20 years ago that half of the West's sawlog material would come from plantation timber by the year 2000. By the year 2010, it would be two-thirds. Of course, 1998 has almost come and gone and only 31 per cent is derived from plantation sources.</para><para>It makes no environmental sense and no economic sense to turn these precious natural assets into woodchips. Most of us, I think, reject the idea that magnificent stands of jarrah and karri should be wasted on tooth 
 picks and railway sleepers or, worse, paper. Isn't it strange that economic rationalist politicians work themselves into something of a lather over things like graffiti, which the artistic drives of some young people are channelled into, yet they actively encourage the greater vandalism of woodchipping old-growth forests. The environmental vandalism engaged in by the Court government deserves a three strikes and you are out approach in our viewâsummary justice of the sort that they are so fond of meting out.</para><para>In this chamber this week a motion co-sponsored by the Democrats, the Greens and the ALP was defeated. It would have adopted the recommendations of the WA Legislative Council Standing Committee on Ecologically Sustainable Development. The motion called for the replacement of CALM as the lead agency for the RFA. It also called for the release of the draft RFA for public comment, its submission to the EPA for assessment and its finalisation through an accord process. The refusal of the Howard government and the Court government to countenance any of these measures is in direct contravention of the RFA scoping agreement. Logging continues in such sensitive areas as Wattle Block and Dombakup 24, contravening the 1992 National Forest Policy. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>1122</page.no><name role="metadata">Crane, Sen Winston</name><name role="display">Senator CRANE</name><name.id>UW4</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI hope that in the time I have to speak on this urgency motion I can dispel some of the misinformation and nonsense that has been peddled in this place. Senator Margetts, Senator Allison and Senator Bolkus have all come in here regurgitating their speeches that we heard when the Tasmanian RFA and the Victorian RFA were dealt with. No doubt when we get to the next one we will hear speeches containing the same words with a few small changes. They refuse to acknowledge that this process is a scientific one. It is not and never has beenâand nor should it beâa PR process. It is a public consultation process.</para></talk.start><para>The first thing that I will say about the consultation that has occurred in this process is that not only have the Green groups, represented on a de facto basis in Western Australia by Senator Margetts, steadfastly 
 refused to participate in the RFA consultation process but also they have chosen instead to block the lawful activities of the timber industry. They have denied the industry their rights, through protest actions which endanger themselves and the forest workersânot only their jobs but also their lives. You should think about that. These protests have been exacerbated by the conflicts in south-west communities and remove any potential for a future accord.</para><para>The Conservation Council of WA and the WA Forest Alliance never took the opportunity to involve themselves in the process. They refused to join in. They now seek to have an accord put in place. They could join in today if they wanted to do so. Yet they never took the opportunity to be included from day one. They never exercised their democratic rights: they ignored the process. I find it very hypocritical that we now have a representative from WA coming in here and saying, `We want to get involved now.' Let us think about that. They had the opportunity but they denied themselves that opportunity. That is their problem.</para><para>It is essential to deal with some of the events that have taken place. I refer to the moratorium on the logging of high conservation value forest. The deferred forest agreement, signed by the Prime Minister and the Western Australian Premier, dealt with this issue. Areas of forest that may be required for a future conservation reserve system were deferred from timber harvesting until the RFA was completed. That is fact.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Senator Brown interjecting</inline>â</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>UW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Crane, Sen Winston</name><name role="display">Senator CRANE</name></talker><para>âSenator Brown from Tasmania can jump up and down all he likes.

How wrong you can be. How little you know. Regarding the accord process, consultation processes for the RFA have includedâand listen to this very carefully, Madam Acting Deputy President, because it is absolutely crucial to getting the truth on the tableâtwo series of public meetings in towns throughout the region; a stakeholder reference group, which has held nine meetings in both city and country locations; a Noongar action group, which has held at least five meetings; a state agreements act committee, which has held five meetings; a series of 10 community heritage workshops; a series of seven Aboriginal community workshops; surveys and interviews to develop a regional social profile; surveys and interviews to gather information on the full range of forest based industries, including timber, mining, tourism, apiary, craft, specialty timber, firewood, wildflower picking and seed collection; surveys and interviews of sawmill industry employees; more than 120 meetings with individuals or groups of stakeholders; eight local discussion group workshops to assist with social impact assessment; reports made available for public comment and feedback; specific public comment and feedback requested for two major reports on assessment of ecologically sustainable forest management in the south-west forest region of Western Australia and the public consultation paper <inline font-style="italic">Towards a regional forest agreement for the south west forest region of Western Australia.</inline></para></talk.start></continue><para>That is a very comprehensive list of the consultation that has occurred. There is still an opportunity for these groups to join in, if they so choose. The time I have to speak is unfortunately short. There is a lot of information that can be put on the table and it needs to be recognised in its proper context.</para><para>I have heard some criticism of CALM. No department or environmental institution has done more to control feral animals in a state, region or forest than CALM.

 occasionally. I emphasise that very strongly. For political purposes some people have now changed their position, but I think it was in about 1992 that CALM's plan in Western Australia for management of its forests was heralded as world's best practice but, in fact, it became the springboard for even more demands to close down forest areas. But remember who supported that at that time. Remember a West Australian Labor premier called Carmen Lawrence? Remember a leader of the Democrats called John Coulter? They both supported it, as did a number of other prominent people throughout Australia. It is very important that we deal with this aspect on its merit.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In the time remaining to me, I would like to say a little about the change of wording suggested by Senator Bolkus. He suggested that `accord' should be changed to `consultation'. He is trying to play a clever trick. There is a great difference between `consultation' and `accord'. He is trying to put in place what could occur now if these people were to wake up, join the process and make a contribution. They are welcome to make a contribution. In fact, we on our side of politics want them to make a contribution. They make a contribution in many areas, not least in the Landcare program, which I have discussed with them often and consistently. There is still time for them to get involved in the RFA process.</para><para>Lastly, I want to say something about forest plantations. Senator Allison made some comment about this. Regardless of the current process, the plantation development, of which I am very proud, having been involved in getting it off the ground, is far ahead of that in any other state in Australia. It is increasing at an enormous rate. I do not have time today to go into the details, but I will avail myself of another opportunity to put on the public record the position with regard to the enormous amount of plantation development on both public and private land in Western Australia and the contribution that is being made by a variety of sectors. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>1124</page.no><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name><name.id>656</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to support the proposal with the alteration to the wording suggested 
 by Senator Bolkus. Indeed, having listened to the last speaker, Senator Crane, I am sure people would be wondering whether he even listened to any of the contributions made by earlier speakers.</para></talk.start><para>I understand that Senator Crane has his hands full at the moment. After all, he has the job of trying to repair the damage that is being inflicted upon rural and regional Australia by his ministerial colleagues in the other place, whether it be in the wool industry or in other areas of agriculture or forestry. Having listened to Senator Crane a moment ago, you could be forgiven for wondering whether he has even canvassed the intent of this proposal.</para><para>The proposal calls for a deferral of the process of signing the RFA pending certain things happening. In particular, we would suggest there is a need to improve the consultation process. That is something that is not just being called for by green groups or conservation groups, as you might refer to them, Senator Crane; you have ignored the fact that this is a call that is coming from right across the spectrum. For instance, as Senator Bolkus pointed outâand I will come back to this point in a momentâthere are very strong calls from your coalition colleagues, the Nationals, to halt this process and try to get it back on track.</para><para>I use those words `back on track' because, in answer to a question from Senator Margetts on the 25th of this month on this very issue, what did we get from the Minister for the Environment and Heritage in this place, Senator Hill? There was fulsome praise for Mr TuckeyâChainsaw Tuckeyâand there was an attack upon the New South Wales government. We then had this throwaway line:</para><para>Having said that, the progress on an RFA for Western Australia, whilst it is a little slower than I would have liked, remains on track.</para><para>The concession is there.

 Tuckey, the minister in the other place, tried to turn the attack back upon the New South Wales government with respect to the recent RFA situation in that state, their own coalition colleagues in the upper house in New South Wales endorsed the very agreements negotiated by the Carr government, because they adopted the process of consultation. Whilst we recognise that in this debate it will never be the case that all sides will be completely satisfied, we had a satisfactory outcome.</para></talk.start></continue><para>But we do not have that situation in Western Australia; far from it. Senator Knowles said, `Well, we must have had consultation because 30,000 people lodged submissions.' I would have thought that the fact that 30,000 submissions came in was indicative of the fact that there were real issues to be dealt with here and that maybe some of the major players in the process should be given a little more recognition than has been given to them by the Western Australian government.</para><para>I refer, for instance, to the Western Australian Municipal Associationâthe association that represents local government in Western Australia. They have been very critical of this process. They have pointed out that the RFA steering committee does not represent all of the stakeholders.

There is the Western Australian Forest Alliance; no doubt their views have been put adequately by the Greens here. As Senator Bolkus said, there are also the Western Australian Nationals. If you are not prepared to listen to us or to conservation groups, why don't you at least listen to those people who are closest to you in ideologyâyour own coalition colleagues? On 18 November, they issued a media statement. I will quote from this media statement and, at the end of my speech, I will also seek leave to have it incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> . I will provide a copy to the government. I point 
 out that this media statement is a document that goes with the issues statement that was incorporated earlier. This is what the Nationals put in their media statement:</para></talk.start></continue><para>The National Party today asked the state government to give the community a comprehensive response to concerns about significant forest management issues raised as a result of party policy research during the past 12 months.</para><para>Nationals' director Jamie Kronborg said an `issues statement' on forest management and conservation prepared by the party highlighted a number of potential conflicts between government commitments to forest management and current or possible practice in the future.</para><para>Mr Kronborg said the party's primary concern centred on the complex question of the jarrah forest's continuing ability to yield sawn timber of sufficient quality and volume to meet the demands of the timber industry in perpetuity and, at the same time, to provide forest reserves for local conservation, tourism or community needs.</para><para>Later on in the media statement Mr Kronborg highlights a range of issues. The media statement finishes with:</para><para>"There is a high level of public interest in future management of WA's public native forests and, for this reason alone, the government must ensure that the quality of the resource is maintained in perpetuity for the benefit of many industry and community interests, including the tourism industry," Mr Kronborg said.</para><para>"Everyone in the community needs to ensure that the state takes a responsible approach to forest management, given that the RFA will determine the size of the conservation estate for the next 20 years . . .</para><para>Attached to that media statement was the issues statement that Senator Bolkus referred to. I would like to quote extensive sections of that document but it has already been incorporated in the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> . The National Party says in it, for instance, that:</para><para>. . . finding the `common ground' in the complex forest debate is an extremely difficult task, which the Nationals recognise. The community places a diverse range of values on native forest and consequently there are a number of conflicts dividing interest groups on forest management principles and practices.</para><para>This is aggravated by the differing community values placed particularly on old-growth native forest ranging across economic, cultural, social, environmental or ecological and aesthetic values. As a result, and despite the genuine commitment 
 of many people and organisations to the RFA process since July 1996, the Nationals remain concerned, as the process draws to a conclusion, that a number of significant issues are still to be openly and publicly addressed.</para><para>They go on to identify the issues in that issues statement. For instance, they refer, as Senator Bolkus pointed out, to the report of the Legislative Council standing committee which looked at the issue of sawlog yields. They particularly point out the problem of conflict of interest that exists within CALM, the Conservation and Land Management Department, and how that issue needs to be addressed. They refer to proposed changes in respect of measuring gross bole volume felled, rather than sawlog volume removed. The statement states:</para><para>CALM and industry need to justify to the wider community that a switch to `gbv felled' to express jarrah harvest levels and the adoption of whole bole-logging methods are in the best interests of the timber industry and the forest sustainability.</para><para>This is not a conservation group; this is the Western Australian National Party saying to the Western Australian government and all those involved in the process that they have got to put up the scientific and other justification required for that process. I would ask honourable senators and the ministers in this government this: if you cannot listen to anyone else because of your ideological blinkers, why don't you at least listen to those people who sit next to you on your own side, who are saying to you and who are saying publicly in this very extensive issues statementâ</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Reynolds)</name></talker><para>âOrder!

There are two parts to it and I will give 
 the reasons why I reject it. As for the first part, I find the deceit of the motion quite disturbing. Senator Margetts's motion spoke, inter alia, of the need `for an immediate moratorium on the logging of high conservation value forests.' It just happens to beâand I do not know whether Senator Margetts knew this or not when she put this motion upâthat the moratorium on the logging of high conservation value forests actually exists. She seems to have forgotten that.</para></talk.start><para>She has forgotten that there was a deferred forest agreementâand that is the one that is still in placeâwhich does not allow logging in forests that might be necessary for a comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system. That agreement is in all but name a moratorium on those areas of high conservation value that might be required for conservation reasons. That superimposes on what Senator Margetts said, so that part of it is already in place.	In the second part she concludes:</para><para>. . . until the WA Environment Protection Authority has had the opportunity to assess the draft RFA that arises from that accord process.</para><para>Again, there must apparently be some deceit, or perhaps Senator Margetts might want to clear that up when she gets up to rebut what I have said. But the last part of the motion is also rebutted by the RFA being subject to the legislative obligations of both the Western Australian and the Commonwealth governments. This means that changes to the reserve system as a result of the RFA, under current WA legislation, would require assessment by the EPA as part of the development of the new forest management plan.

 You never offer anything for that. You destroy but don't offer some solution to it. That means that 40,000 jobs are at risk if you destroy that area. Not only is there $2.68 billion coming out of that area; there is a further $3.3 billion for Western Australia, and it is equivalent to $4.68 million nationally. That does not include payroll tax, royalties, regional revenues and local purchases that mining companies and others, such as the timber industry, put into the district.

Again and again the Department of Conservation and Land Management have refused to have their scientific papers peer reviewed. Why? It is because they are afraid of what real scientific analysis will do to their sham scientific assessments. They will not get them peer reviewed and they cannot be classified as scientific assessments unless they undergo proper peer review.</para><para>Senator Knowles mentions vegetation mapping. She clearly forgot to mention the satellite pictures from the Landsat images by the CSIRO. They are shocking pictures which show the reality of what is happening to Western Australian forests. A lot of people were set back on their heels to see those images of what was really happeningâthe real picture in Western Australia.</para><para>Since this sham RFA started in 1996, 50,000 hectares of high conservation forests have been cut. What kind of protection or moratorium is that? Senator Knowles said that if you do not have parties prepared to come to the table for consultation the process becomes so much more difficult. Yes. The strong work, the enormous work, that Dr Christine Sharpe has done on the ecologically sustainable committee has for the first time got all parties together and made sure that they make progressâtalking to workers, industry, conservationists and government bodies and getting them together to work their way through issues of structural adjustment, employment and how the industry can be sustainable in the future.</para><para>Is it sustainable? There have been various comments made about what Western Australia does. In the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> magazine of 21-22 November on page 21 the indications are that other states are doing much better. Western Australia is still 68 per cent dependent on hardwood whereas New South Wales is 36 per cent dependent, Victoria 38 per cent and Queensland has got to 21 per cent because 
 they are using more plantations. We are not being smart with our forest management; we are not being smart with employment.</para><para>Let us talk about public meetings. I went to the one in Mundaring. It was a sham until the people who wanted to protect the forest actually hijacked the meeting in a very creative way and got people talking to each other and checking the information. Instead of having a one-to-one discussion where people can be fed nonsense, they opened up the meeting. The majority of those at the meeting said that it was a great idea. Something useful was actually done. The rest of it was a sham. The consultation processes were not public meetings, they were shams.</para><para>The misinformation and nonsense is often coming from the people who should be taking responsible decisions. Green groups have chosen to take a responsible view because they found that the steering committeesâthe people who were forming the processâcut out all of those people, including the people in the tourism industry, who had the majority of jobs at risk as a result of the processes taking place.</para><para>We know the figures given by Senator Lightfoot are incorrect in terms of direct employment. In my first contribution to this debate I gave the real figures for direct employmentâcomparing the forest industry and the tourism industryâlet alone the indirect employment in the other small industries that rely on the forest remaining as old growth forest and resources for the future. It is no good CALM simply breeding animals if their habitat is being destroyed. I seek leave to amend the motion by replacing the word `accord', wherever occurring, with the word `consultation'.</para><para>Leave granted.</para></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>17:45:00</time.stamp><para>The Senate divided.	</para></division.header><para>(The PresidentâSenator the Hon.

Let me make a couple of points in relation to this particular motion that I think it is important for the Senate to acknowledge. The general principle in relation to divisions where there has been either a mistake in pairingâwhether it be a mistake that the whips of either the government or the opposition take responsibility for, or in the circumstances where a senator misses a divisionâthe view of the opposition consistently has been that we would want to see the will of the electorate reflected in votes on the floor of the Senate.</para></talk.start></continue><para>That is a very important principle which, as you would know, Madam President, I have espoused on a number of occasions when we have had similar instances previously.

Because of the change in approach of the Prime Minister in relation to accepting the tainted vote of Senator Colston in all divisions, a whole series of divisions which would otherwise have been lost by the governmentâand this is oneâwill now be won.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>VJ4</name.id><name role="metadata">WATSON</name><name role="display">Senator Watson</name></talker><para>âBe charitableâit's getting close to Christmas.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name></talker><para>âWell, you leave then, Senator Watson.

This particular vote occurred in relation to a very important issueâan order for the production of documents in relation to the goods and services tax. I believe it is worth making it very clear that, on the day the government introduces its legislation into this parliament and there is now a capacity for both parliamentary and public scrutiny of the legislation, the government asks for the recommittal of a vote to ensure that material that is important in terms of parliamentary and public scrutiny is not made available for the benefit of each and every senator and the Australian public.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">CAMPBELL</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Campbell</name></talker><para>âThe minister is on his sick bed.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>âIgnore the interjection, Senator.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name></talker><para>âThat is what we are being asked to recommit. The principle that the Labor Party has consistently taken in relation to these matters is that the will of the Senate be reflected in voting before the Senate chamber. The government whip has indicated to the chamber that there was a mistake of some description, perhaps in communication between the whip's clerk and the whip. It has not been detailed any more for the benefit of senators. I accept the explanation of the government whip, as has been our practice to accept not only whips' explanations in this place but also explan 
 ations made by individual senators when we have a circumstance of the will of the Senate not being reflected in a vote that is taken on the floor of the Senate. That is the fundamental principle.

It outlined new priorities for the aid program and set the framework for their implementation.</para><para>Since that time, the regional economic crisis has placed urgent demands on Australia's assistance. Our capacity to respond to these events has been due, in no small measure, to the changes put in place in <inline font-style="italic">Better Aid for a Better Future. </inline> Today I will outline: 
</para><para>.	 how we have responded to the crisis in our region, including increased support for governance and resumed growth;</para><para>.	 the role of human rights in the aid program;</para><para>.	 our progress in implementing the policy directions I announced a year ago; and</para><para>.	 the emphasis placed on involving the Australian community in our aid efforts</para><para>REGIONAL ECONOMIC CRISIS</para><para>The regional economic crisis has been compounded by a series of natural disasters including droughts across South East Asia and the Pacific. These events have thrown millions of people back into poverty and threatened thirty years of development progress. In Indonesia, for example, widespread and increasing unemployment and poverty, food shortages, and children leaving school mean not only that people are suffering now, but that impacts will be felt across generations. And, as the social and economic impacts intensify, the capacity of regional governments to respond is diminishing.</para><para>Australia is playing an active and leading role in helping these countries deal with the impacts of the crisis. Our response, through the aid program, has been targeted at a number of levels.</para><para>First, we have been using our influence in international forums to ensure active participation by other donors, including the international agencies, in responding to the crisis. In March I travelled to Washington to meet the President of the World Bank and to urge the bank to take a lead role in coordinating assistance. I also met the Managing Director of the IMF and stressed the importance of ensuring that the social costs of the crisis were not overlooked in pursuing economic reforms. The Prime Minister, the Treasurer, the Minister for Trade and I have engaged in extensive consultations with affected governmentsâencouraging them to adopt appropriate policies and offering practical assistance.</para><para>It is critical that we maintain the momentum of an effective international response. For this reason, early next year I plan to convene a meeting of Ministers from major donor and recipient countries in the region</para><para>The meeting will focus on the long-term development challenges facing the region and what needs to be done to restore growth. I expect it will result in greater international coordination and a high level political commitment to address the economic and social impacts of the crisis.</para><para>Through the aid program, Australia has provided additional resources to the worst affected countries including Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines and Vietnam. In Indonesia alone we have increased total aid flows by 25% compared to last year. Much of this has focussed on helping people cope 
 with the crisis by providing food aid and essential medicines.</para><para>The social and economic impacts of the crisis are not going to be short-lived. Our aid response must therefore also focus on helping regional countries return to sustained growth and limit the potential for recurrence of the crisis. Crucial to this is an increased emphasis on governance, which was identified as a key sectoral priority in <inline font-style="italic">Better Aid for a Better Future. </inline> To this end, Australia is supporting partner countries to</para><para>.	 deal with systemic problems in the banking/finance sectors;</para><para>.	 strengthen corporate, legal, judicial and institutional frameworks; and</para><para>.	 improve public administration.</para><para>At the recent APEC Leaders Meeting in Kuala Lumpur, the Prime Minister announced a major package of economic and financial management assistance for APEC developing economies affected by the crisis. The package, which exceeds $50 million over three years, targets priority areas identified in the Australian-commissioned APEC Economic Governance Capacity Building Survey.</para><para>HUMAN RIGHTS</para><para>The increased emphasis on governance is not limited to economic and financial management issues. It also includes a strong emphasis on human rights. Regional governments increasingly accept that getting their economic fundamentals correct is only part of the task. Australia's aid program is seeking to build on this recognition that sustainable development is strengthened where human rights are genuinely protected and exercised.</para><para>Sustainable development and human rights are inter-related in a myriad of ways. The whole aid program in one form or another contributes to human rights by addressing the needs of the world's disadvantaged.</para><para>I am aware that many of my fellow Parliamentarians share my interest in promoting and protecting human rights through Australia's aid program. Last June the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade delivered its report <inline font-style="italic">Australia's regional dialogue on human rights</inline> . Having considered the Committee's views, today I would like to outline a clear framework for supporting human rights through the aid program. It will form part of the Government's full response to the Committee's report, which will be provided in due course.</para><para>The framework consists of six key principles.</para><para>.	 Human rights are a high priority for the Government. Civil and political rights are ranked equally with economic, social and cultural rights 
</para><para>.	 The aid program will continue to undertake activities that directly address specific economic, social, cultural, civil and political rights. A particular emphasis will be on the creation of durable institutional capacity to promote and protect human rights.</para><para>.	 The emphasis is on the practical and the attainable. AusAID, as the Government's aid agency, will pursue practical aid activities in support of human rights. These activities complement and build on high-level dialogue on human rights. Dialogue on human rights and representations about individual human rights cases will normally be carried out through diplomatic channels.</para><para>.	 The aid program will develop activities primarily as a result of consultations and cooperation with partner countries on human rights initiatives. Regional and multilateral activities will also be undertaken.</para><para>.	 Considerable care will continue to be applied to the use of aid sanctions associated with human rights concerns. The Government will consider such sanctions on a case-by-case basis. Aid conditionality based on human rights concerns would only be used in extreme circumstances since it can jeopardise the welfare of the poorest and it may be counterproductive.</para><para>.	 AusAID will continue to link closely with other arms of the Australian Government on governance and human rights issues. AusAID will also liaise with NGOs and human rights organisations in Australia.</para><para>Practical action based on these principles means that the aid program will continue to focus on its objective of assisting developing countries to reduce poverty and achieve sustainable development. These principles will underpin our strong support for civil and political rights throughout our aid work. The aid program will seek to maximise the benefits for human rights in all development assistance activities. To support implementation of these principles, AusAID will develop practical guidance for program managers, contractors and recipient government counterparts.</para><para>The new framework I have outlined today is an elaboration of the basic principles set out last year in <inline font-style="italic">Better Aid for a Better Future. </inline> It will take the aid program another step forward as a practical, vigorous and evolving expression of Australians' concerns that people everywhere get a fair go.</para><para>IMPLEMENTING BETTER AID FOR A BETTER FUTURE</para><para>I would also like to take this opportunity to report to the Parliament on other key achievements in implementing <inline font-style="italic">Better Aid for a Better Future. </inline><inline font-style="italic">Better Aid for a Better Future </inline> outlined the importance of focusing our assistance in regions and countries to better achieve lasting improvements in people's 
 lives. It called for the development of comprehensive strategies, developed in partnership with developing countries. It also required the aid program to be able to provide rapid relief in cases of emergencies and respond to changing pressures. This approach is no more apparent than in our program of assistance in Papua New Guinea. During the past twelve months we have responded very effectively to changing pressures: rehabilitation of agriculture after the 1997 drought, responding to the tsunami tragedy, and contributing to peace and reconstruction in Bougainville. In April this year I was privileged to be a witness to the peace signing ceremony in Bougainville, which was yet another step in the path to ending the 9-year civil war which has ravaged that Province</para><para>Reviewing the Treaty on Development Cooperation with Papua New Guinea has been a key issue over the past year. The review will set in place arrangements to ensure that Australian aid to PNG reaches those most in need and makes a real difference to living standards. It is expected that the review will be completed in the first half of 1999.</para><para>Another key achievement during 1998 has been the development, for the first time, of a Pacific wide comprehensive strategy with clear objectives and outcomes and incorporating country specific strategy statements. I will be launching this strategy later this month during my visit to the Pacific. Australia's assistance to the Pacific during 1998 has placed a strong emphasis on improving policy and management reform and on assisting countries deal with the impacts of the regional economic crisis.</para><para>Of course, adopting a more targeted approach to aid delivery is not limited to the funding provided in partnership with countries. Considerable work has been put into developing a new framework to ensure our aid dollars are only directed to those multilateral organisations which are effective and efficient in pursuing our priorities.</para><para>In <inline font-style="italic">Better Aid  for A Better Future</inline> , I announced that AusAID would develop a formal statement of principles outlining the role of Non Government Organisations (NGOs) in the aid program. This policy statement is currently being developed in consultation with the NGO community and I look forward to announcing it early next year. 1998 also marked a year where NGOs made a special contribution in areas such as civil society, humanitarian relief and small-scale development at the local level. Our partnership with them is based on solid foundationsâthe depth of community support for their work and the quality of the assistance they provide.</para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">Better Aid  for a Better Future </inline> outlined five key sectors of health, agriculture and rural development, education, governance and infrastructure. These sectors are taken into account in the development of country strategies. 
</para><para>Specific policies for each sector have also either been or are being prepared:</para><para>.	 Australia's Gender and Development policy has been operational since March 1997,</para><para>.	 the Education and Training Policy has been in place since August 1996;</para><para>.	 a new Health policy has been approved and will be released shortly;</para><para>.	 a policy for Agricultural and Rural Development will follow a major review due to be completed by the end of November 1998 ; and</para><para>.	 work is well underway on a comprehensive Private Sector Development Strategy, which will include the plans for increasing support for small enterprises.</para><para>COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT</para><para>Another major initiative during 1998 has been the significant focus on involving the Australian community in Australia's aid program.</para><para>In <inline font-style="italic">Better Aid  for a Better Future </inline> we outlined our intention to research public attitudes towards overseas aid. In July I published the results of that research. A comprehensive survey demonstrated that the vast majorityâ84 per centâof Australians support overseas aid and that they are motivated by humanitarian concerns. This support was vividly demonstrated in the Australian community's overwhelming response to the tragic tsunami disaster in Papua New Guinea and more recently, the devastation caused by Hurricane Mitch.</para><para>In the past year we have placed a high priority on informing Australians about the aid program and involving them both in its delivery and developmentâto demonstrate that Australian taxpayer's dollars are spent effectively and to improve the quality of our aid efforts.</para><para>We have commenced a program of community outreach activities to inform Australians better about how their overseas aid program works. This has included a range of seminars hosted by my Parliamentary Secretary, Kathy Sullivan; displays at agricultural shows; enhancing AusAID's internet site and our publications.</para><para>In August, I introduced the Certificates of Appreciation Program to recognise the efforts of Australian overseas volunteers. I would like to take this opportunity to thank my Parliamentary colleagues from both sides of the House for their participation. Australians from all walks of life have been working as volunteers to help people in other countries for many years. In addition to acknowledging the valuable contribution volunteers have made, the Certificates of Appreciation Program increases community knowledge of the role of volunteers in Australia's aid program. For me, meeting some of these Australians has been one of the highlights of the year. 
</para><para>During the past year I have also launched the Australian Youth Ambassadors for Development Program. The Program will place five hundred young Australians on development projects in the region over the next two years. I am pleased to say that the response to the program's first round of placements has been overwhelming, with around 700 young, highly skilled Australians applying. I look forward to farewelling many of these talented young Australians in February. The work done by these young people will be very valuable. I believe a great benefit will also come through the forging of lasting relationships with the region, thus helping to strengthen mutual understanding between Australia and our neighbours.</para><para>In May I appointed eleven distinguished Australians to the Aid Advisory Council. I have greatly appreciated the Council's contributions to the planning and delivery of Australia's aid program. The Council helps ensure the aid program reflects the values of the wider Australian community and plays an important role in opening the aid program up to new ideas and approaches to development.</para><para>There can be no doubt that 1998 was a challenging year full of many achievements. Ensuring our aid efforts remain as responsive and relevant as possible, making a difference to the lives of the poor, is a continuing demand. We must also build on Australian community support for our aid efforts. I firmly believe that even as a relatively small nation, we can continue to make an important contribution to our region and to development cooperation worldwide.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>1137</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Membership</title><page.no>1137</page.no></subdebateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Bartlett)</name></talker><para>âThe President has received letters from party leaders seeking variations to the membership of committees.</para></talk.start><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ian Macdonald</inline>)âby leaveâagreed to:</para><para>That senators be discharged from and appointed to committees as follows:</para><para>Community Affairs Legislation Committeeâ</para><para>	 Participating members: Senators Forshaw and Schacht</para><para>	 Substitute member: Senator Lees to replace Senator Bartlett for the consideration of the provisions of the Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 1998 and two related bills.</para><para>Economics Legislation Committeeâ</para><para>	 Participating member: Senator Schacht.</para><para>Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education Legislation Committeeâ

The bill will also simplify the date of effect of determinations made under the act.</para><para>Currently, social security payments are payday-based, period-based or lump sum amounts. The Bill will change all payday-based social security payments, that is, social security pensions and payments made under the family allowance system (for example, family allowance and child disability allowance) into period-based payments similar to the current payment system for social security benefits. Payments of lump sum amounts, such as for maternity allowance and maternity immunisation allowance, will not be affected by this initiative.</para><para>The changed payment arrangements will provide that an instalment of a social security payment will be payable in arrears for a period and at the times specified by the Secretary. In general terms an instalment period will be a period of 14 days, however, the legislation will be flexible in that shorter or longer periods will able to be determined. For example, all Australian pensioners who reside overseas will continue to receive their portable pensions every 28 days and in respect of a period of 28 days.</para><para>Madam President, all social security payments that are period-based will also have specific legislative provisions enabling a daily rate of payment to be calculated. This will ensure that a person's exact entitlement is able to be determined in respect of a period. This will simplify the understanding of the social security system not only for customers, but for interest groups, courts, tribunals and staff of Centrelink and the Department of Family and Community Services, by matching the payments received with the periods for which the payments are made.</para><para>The initiative will substantially reduce overlapping entitlements and non-recoverable excess payments because of efficiencies gained by reducing processing times. For those customers who find themselves in financial hardship, legislative provisions that allow an advance payment to be made (generally of an amount equivalent to one weeks entitlement), will be available to ease this hardship.</para><para>Madam President, this bill will also make significant amendments to the date of effect provisions in the Social Security Act 1991. These new provisions will ensure greater efficiency, equity and accuracy in the reassessment of social security payments. The commencement provisions will not be affected by this initiative. 
</para><para>The date of effect provisions in the Social Security Act 1991 currently vary from payment to payment. This initiative will simplify these provisions by providing consistent treatment across payment types. The social security system will be enhanced and improved by becoming more responsive because inconsistencies will be removed. More determinations will be automated so errors will be lessened. Further, simpler transfer provisions will also result in more streamlined administration.</para><para>Madam President, the general rule in respect of the date of effect of a determination will simply be that an event or a change in circumstances that necessitates a reassessment of a customer's entitlement will be from the date of the event or the change in circumstances. General reporting requirements will be a consistent 7 days (the <inline font-weight="bold">notification period</inline> ). However, a longer period of up to 28 days will be given to those customers who, in special circumstances, either because of the type of event or change in circumstances or because of the individual circumstances of the person concerned, require a longer period in which to report to Centrelink. Customers who reside overseas, in remote localities or experience a bereavement, for example, can all be provided, as a principle of Government policy, with an extended notification period.</para><para>This bill will make similar changes to income support payments made under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986.</para><para>Madam President, I commend the bill to the Senate.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carr</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>NOTICES

It seems to me the minister very often is missing when it gets to important environmental questions, missing not only in time but in content. I will have to accept the fact that he is late yet again. The question I did ask, for the benefit of the committee and the minister, was: is the intention to sign this legislation into law one which is tied to the much more comprehensive change of laws which the minister has mooted, by which he is devolving his responsibilities for the environment back to the states, going back to the pre-1972 situation effectively, or does he anticipate that if this legislation passes the Senate it will be brought into law before that much more comprehensive and damaging set of environmental laws that he intends to bring before the Senate when we resume sittings in February?</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>1139</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Environment and Heritage</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI cannot think of any immediate 
 connection. This is a process that started, as I said earlier when those who were interested in the subject were in the chamber, Senator Brown, as an agreement that was reached in 1992 between the Commonwealth and the states and that required legislative implementation by each. Each of the states has passed law to do so and the Commonwealth is now seeking to meet its share of that responsibility.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>1140</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âAs the minister was not answering the question, let me give the connection. This legislation is of the lowest common denominator. It means that we bring into national application the standards on which all states and territories agree. So it is lowest common denominator legislation. That is the connection with the legislation that the minister has foreshadowed for next year on a much wider plane, where he wants to devolve responsibilities for the environmentâresponsibilities which have been built up by serial governments, particularly since the Whitlam government and the disastrous Lake Pedder affair in 1972âso that governments would have national responsibility for nationally important items of the environment. Here we have a minister who wants to shed those responsibilities back to governments, including maverick state governments which do not care a hoot about the environment, and to introduce not the precautionary principle to environmental prudence on behalf of this great nation of ours but the lowest common denominator principle. As such, the minister is continuing on his way of abandoning proper environmental responsibility and principle. But that is a matter for the public to judge. The simple question I ask is whether the minister is going to bring this into law if it passes the Senate before the much wider suite of laws which he wants the Senate to deal with in February are dealt with?</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>1140</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Environment and Heritage</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThere is obviously a misunderstanding by Senator Brown. This is designed to produce consistent national standards that obviously have great benefit and, within our federation, the best way to do that is through 
 a cooperative scheme. This is a cooperative arrangementâthere is no doubt about thatâbut it does not necessarily lead to lowest common denominator outcomes; it leads to outcomes that are agreed between the Commonwealth and the states. If we look at those that we have debated at length and implemented, such as ambient air quality, I am quite confident I can say that it is not a lowest common denominator outcome. In relation to bringing it into law, we would want to do that as soon as possible.

But we realised when we looked at this bill very closely that it is in fact about exemptions for implementation. So that makes the necessity for the objects of the act to be expanded to go into things like `protecting, restoring and enhancing the quality of the environment in Australia,' having regard to the need to maintain ecologically sustainable development to ensure the community has access to relevant and meaningful information about pollution. These seem to me to be very important matters to have in the objects clause, given that this is not just about implementation.

I question whether these aims, which include giving the act the object of protecting, restoring and enhancing the quality of environment in Australia, will extend to forests, for example.

What we are talking about here is National Estate forests. We are talking about regions that the Commonwealth has agreed should have their high conservation values protected. But the state government has twice been caught out, not just by citizens but by the courts of law, for illegally breaching its obligation to protect the environmental values.</para><para>Is that what the minister is aiming to achieve: to give governments like the Kennett government in Victoriaâwhich has now been found repeatedly to be an illegal logger of forests of high environmental valueâthe responsibility that the minister has not got himself? Of course, in Western Australia and Tasmania illegal logging of National Estate or high conservation value forests has been found to occur as well. I do not know about New South Wales, but I have no doubtâas this is broadcast dayâthat people will call me up to say the same about that state.</para><para>The question for the minister is: are the objects that we are now dealing withâthat, because of Senator Allison's move, the Senate may be writing in here to `protect, restore and enhance the quality of environment in Australia'âreally going to be a sham because of this government's derelict attitude to its obligations to the forests and, in particular, this minister's behaviour?</para><para>On the recordânot just of those people who might have an opinion but of the courts of lawâtwice in a matter of months at least one state government has allowed illegal logging of the people's high conservation

But this is particularly pronounced in Australia where studies by CSIRO and others have indicated that a quarter or more of the greenhouse gas production in this country is coming out of removal of native vegetation and forests.

Maybe the minister could indicate 
 to the committee what his schedule is for bringing in mandatory restrictions on the production of global warming gases, how they are going to be implemented and what sort of penalties he is looking at for infractors.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>1145</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Environment and Heritage</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIt is quite imaginative to say that it is relevant to this bill, because it is not included in this bill. Having said that, the statement by the Prime Minister in November last year was a public statement. It reviewed a whole range of industry sectors and it indicated where we would require mandatory outcomes if they could not be achieved on a voluntary basis. Just to recall a few of those, one was in relation to building codes, where I think it is well accepted that Australia's energy standards could be significantly improved. Another one was in relation to the compulsory purchase of renewable energy, and there were a number of others. As I said, our preference in achieving the goal of Kyoto is through a cooperative scheme because we do not believe in lowest common denominators, and we think that through cooperation you can do better than a regulatory outcome.

Page 1 of the report says that there have been 24,408 new bankruptcies in 1997-98, which represents an increase of 11.8 per cent over the figure for the previous year. The figure for the previous year, 1996-97, was 26 per cent higher than the figure for 1995-96.</para><para>The report also says that the highest increase was in Victoria, with 19 per cent. The most significant aspect of the Inspector- 
 General's report to the parliament is this comment:</para><para>The significant rise in new bankruptcies over the past five years has therefore been in the non-business, or consumer, bankruptcy category.</para><para>If you go to page 11 of the report, you will see it has defined the categories of bankruptcies as:</para><para>(a) <inline font-style="italic">business related</inline>  bankruptciesâwhere an individual's bankruptcy is directly related to his or her proprietary interest in a business or company; and</para><para>(b) <inline font-style="italic">non-business related</inline>  bankruptcyâwhere the bankrupt's occupation and cause of bankruptcy is not related to any proprietary interest in a business or company.</para><para>The definitions of the circumstances that have caused a number of men and women in this country to go into bankruptcy in that non-business related area are listed as eight points. Significant ones are unemployment; excessive use of credit facilities, including pressure selling; losses on repossessions and high interest payments; domestic discord; absence of health insurance or extensive ill health; adverse litigation; liabilities incurred on guarantees; gambling; speculation; extravagance in living and `other causes'.</para><para>Tonight I want to briefly touch on how sad it is that over the last five years, as commented on by the Inspector-General, a number of families in this country have gone to the wall because of unemployment, because they have not been able to manage their incomes, or because of domestic discord. I know this from personal experience. I have seen some pretty unscrupulous people in the finance industry who have got people to commit themselves to levels of debt which they know full well the people are not capable of repaying. The people get themselves into a state where they see millions of dollars, stars and all the rest of it. But a lot of people know that in the end sometimes people are not in a position to be able to repay those debts and they go into bankruptcy.</para><para>If you look, further in the report, at the table of categories of people that go into bankruptcy, there are two large groups that stand out. The first is, unfortunately, `labourers'. They comprise a significant number of the people in this country that have 
 gone into insolvency as a result of overcommitments, domestic discord or, unfortunately, unemployment. The other group consists of people who work in the road transport industry, who comprise a significant group of men and women who have gone into bankruptcy. All I wish to say, in commenting on this report, is that I think it is sad that this has occurred in this area over the last five years, and obviously the biggest sector is unemployment.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>1146</page.no><name role="metadata">Hogg, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HOGG</name><name.id>7L6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para></talk.start><para>Leave granted; debate adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Consideration</title><page.no>1146</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following government documents were considered and not debated:</para><para>Dried Fruits Research and Development CouncilâReport for 1997-98.

Last week ANZ shares jumped on the expectation that the government would allow mergers between the big four banks. Where this forlorn hope began can only be known to the brokers who recommended buying shares. However, by the close of trade on Monday, ANZ shares had slipped back to their original 
 pre-surge price, no doubt inflicting losses on investors who believed the rumour.</para></talk.start><para>Neither the government nor the parliament can be blamed for the actions of this overanxious market. Since the election, the matter of bank mergers has not been an issue on this government's agenda. To make it clear, the Treasurer said on Sunday, 29 November, that the Federal Government would rule out big bank mergers until it was convinced that competition had improved in that particular area, and we remain wholly unconvinced. The matter was further put to rest when the Prime Minister stated on Monday that the ban would stay because parts of the banking industry were still not as competitive as they could be. He said, `They'âthe banksâ`are a long way short of providing the sort of competition the Australian public requires.' That is where the matter stands for the coalition government. If mergers of the big four are allowed, the big four will soon become the big two, for it is conceded that if the mooted merger of the National and ANZ banks takes place then just as quickly Westpac and the Commonwealth will merge so as to remain competitive.</para><para>That would mean that the four banks presently controlling 66 per cent of the market would become two banks controlling 66 per cent of the market, and on the rise. The market domination by the two banks would inevitably lead to a reduction in competition, having an adverse effect on customers. Professor Alan Fels from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission stated:</para><para>. . . the more competition is reduced, the less incentive there is for the merged companies to pass on the benefits.</para><para>The case for mergers is not strong. That case is as follows. The big banks are relatively small by world standards. Australia's largest bank, the NAB, is ranked 38th. To enable a successful venture into the international arena, a merger between the NAB and, say, the ANZ would create a bank controlling one-third of the Australian market. A bank of this proportion would certainly have sufficient critical mass to rival the big banks of the United Kingdom and the United States. Don Argus, 
 the NAB managing director, said in the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline>  on 13 September 1996:</para><para>Australian companies had to acquire critical mass in domestic markets if they were to become big enough to compete internationally.</para><para>However, banks like the NAB are already operating successfully in the international market, without the so-called `domestic critical mass'. For example, the NAB has successful operations in America and Ireland.</para><para>The second reason major banks seek mergers is to achieve economies of scale, which would be a natural consequence of merging two like operations into one. What the banks consider as economy of scale others would consider market domination. That is not to say that, over the past decade, bank mergers have not been successful and necessary to stimulate competition within the marketplace. For example, in 1991 the Commonwealth Bank took over an ailing State Bank of Victoria. In 1995, the Challenge Bank was taken over by Westpac, and the Advance Bank acquired the Bank of South Australia, followed by a merger between St George Bank and the Advance Bank. The most recent merger has been between Westpac and the Bank of Melbourne. But each merger was scrutinised on its merits and marked against a set of rules and conditions, ensuring no loss of competition.</para><para>The ACCC takes the view that for a major bank and a regional bank to merge there must be an alternative strong regional bank operating within the state. It is true to say that in the past three years there has been an encouraging increase in competition between the big four banks. The home loan market is more competitive than ever before, with institutions such as Registered Australian Mortgage SecuritiesâRAMSâand Aussie Home Loans undercutting home loan contracts of the big four banks and offering reduced fees and other incentives to customers to change their allegiances.</para><para>However, as the Treasurer pointed out, more can be done, particularly in the area of business loans. The big four still have a vice grip on business lending. New entrants into the market like AMP, who recently took out a banking licence, Citibankâa notable busi 
 ness lenderâor credit unions, who have recently been given the power to issue cheques and take up banking like activities, will all have a big effect on the market share of business lending.</para><para>There is an argument that time needs to be given for these new entrants to establish themselves, and there must be more entrants before the market is fully competitive and ready for a merger of the big four. But I would like to take it a step further. While this is fair argument, it is not going to happenâat least not in the very foreseeable future. The Australian market is too small to attract or sustain entrants that will match the size of the big four.</para><para>I believe the issue of big four mergers should be off government and bank agendas. The reasons as stated are: that the big four will become the big two, therefore reducing competition in the market; new entrants and smaller banks will be knocked out by the new merged entities; small business and farm loans will become increasingly difficult to access; and further branch closures in rural and regional areas will occur.</para><para>There is also the question of the perception of the worst of bank culture being enhanced if the big four merge into two. We are only too aware of the adverse effects the past bank culture has had on the rural and regional areas of Australia. It has brought about a fear of what a superbank would do to rural communities. I therefore cannot conceive of any reason in the foreseeable future to support the merging of any of the big four banks.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Journalistic Standards</title><title>Junior Wage Rates</title><page.no>1148</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>1148</page.no><name role="metadata">Hogg, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HOGG</name><name.id>7L6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to speak on two matters this evening.

Having had those interjections I now turn to the main issue I wanted to address this evening, and that revolves around an interview given this morning by the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, Mr Reith, on the issue of a union 
 splitting ranks with the ACTU over junior rates of pay. It just so happens that that is a union with which I am very closely associated, both as a delegate to its national council as the president of the Queensland branch and as a life member of that organisation, which is the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The allegation made by Minister Reith was, of course, completely wrong. To correct the record I am going to read into the transcript a press release from the National Secretary of the SDA, Joe de Bruyn. The press release starts:</para><para>Union Denies Split on Junior Rates</para><para>The Shop Distributive &amp; Allied Employees' Association (SDA) today strongly denied there was any split between its views and that of the ACTU on the issue of the future of junior rates of pay.</para><para>This follows the claim this morning from the Minister for Industrial relations, Mr Peter Reith, that the SDA had a different view on the abolition of junior wages to that of the ACTU.</para><para>The SDA covers over half of the nation's junior workforce who are employed in the retail and fastfood industries.</para><para>The National Secretary of the 230,000 members of SDA, Mr. Joe de Bruyn said that the Union's submission to the inquiry on junior rates of pay being conducted by the Industrial Relations Commission had been cleared by the ACTU before it was submitted.</para><para>So there is no doubt: it was cleared by, and with the knowledge of, the ACTU. The press release continues:</para><para>"Our submission was strongly supported by the ACTU and reflects the ACTU's own support for the removal of junior rates", Mr. J. de Bruyn said.</para><para>"Our submission states that junior rates are discriminatory in that it pays employees in accordance with their age, rather than in accordance with the value of the work performed.</para><para>"It also says that junior rates are illogical in a society where the emphasis is on equity rather than discrimination.</para><para>"Just as women workers achieved equal pay for work of equal value more than two decades ago, so young workers today should be paid in accordance with the value of their work.</para><para>"Our submission states that junior rates are a form of exploitation of young workers and they perpetuate the financial difficulty facing youth workers as their income is set at a fraction of the adult rate, 
 while their living expenses are not discounted in a similar way."</para><para>The press release continues:</para><para>A Rate for the Job</para><para>"Our submission argues that society recognises an 18 year old person as an adult for all purposes and accordingly, junior rates for workers aged 18 and above should be eliminated without further argument", Mr. de Bruyn said.</para><para>"Our submission also states that workers aged below 18 should be paid a rate for the job based on the value of the work they perform.</para><para>"We recognise that this principled position is substantially different than the present regime of junior rates and accordingly we argue that we should move from the present system to the new system in a phased way over a period of time, thereby removing any adverse economic impact.</para><para>"Our submission recognises that a worker aged under 18 years may lack experience in the job or knowledge of the work or may not achieve the work performance of a person aged 18 and above.</para><para>"If this is the case, such a young worker should be paid a training wage set at an appropriate level while he/she receives structured training. When the junior worker achieves full competency the adult rate should be paid without further delay.</para><para>The press release goes on:</para><para>Mischievous Intent</para><para>The Union said that the comments made by the Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr. Peter Reith claiming a split between the Union and the ACTU on junior rates were mischievous in intent and designed to divert attention from the merits of the Union's submission.</para><para>"While Mr Reith may attract a blaze of publicity over alleged differences, at the end of the day, the necessity of removing discrimination against young workers will emerge as the real issue for the Industrial Relations Commission and for the Parliament", Mr. de Bruyn said.</para><para>So quite clearly it rebuts any notion that was put forward by the minister for industrial relations, Mr Reith, or informationâ</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>GB6</name.id><name role="metadata">COLLINS</name><name role="display">Senator Jacinta Collins</name></talker><para>âMisinformation.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>7L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Hogg, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HOGG</name></talker><para>âMisinformationâthank you, Senator Collinsâon this issue earlier today.

That speech was given on the 20th anniversary of Clark v. University of Melbourne &amp; Othersâa landmark case, which ruled that the University of Melbourne did not have the legal power to levy compulsory union fees on students. A year later, and we have just passed the 21st anniversary of that watershed decision. In 21 years we have had over 7Â½ years of a coalition government federally and yet we, as liberals, have still not legislated to allow students that most basic human right of freedom of association. We still support a regime which forces students to pay for services not intrinsically associated with the attainment of academic qualifications. It is an indictment of all liberals that we have allowed this situation to continue.</para></talk.start><para>There are, however, encouraging signs. On a positive note, my colleague the member for Sturt, Chris Pyne, in a speech predominantly on voluntary student unionism, spoke of `how the doctrine of compulsory unionism strikes at the heart of every liberal', and recently the ACT division of the Liberal Party unanimously called on the federal government to legislate for voluntary student unionism in the territory universities under its jurisdiction.</para><para>On a more disturbing note, Senator Stott Despoja last week reaffirmed the Australian Democrats' opposition to students having a choice as to who they associate with and how they spend their money. Senator Stott Despoja stated that the Democrats believe in `universal membership of student organisations'. Do the Democrats use this euphemism because they are too ashamed to call it for what it isâcompulsory student unionism.</para><para>In 1996, this government, with the support of the Australian Democrats, legislated to outlaw compulsory unionism in the workplace. We gave that legislation real teeth and 
 it has bitten hard in forcing unions to become accountable to their members. The workplace relations reforms were a central plank of our policy, and we had a clear mandate to introduce them. We also had an even clearer mandate to introduce voluntary student unionism back in 1996 but we did not do so. </para><para>The Australian Democrats indicated they were happy to give workers freedom of choice, but that same right would stop with students, who would be denied the right of freedom of association. Senator Stott Despoja, and her colleagues, would argue that the person working in the cafeteria at a university has the right not to belong to the catering union to get a job, but the poor student eating the food is forced to belong to a student union to get an education.</para><para>The Democrats spokesperson on education suggested that a recent NUS report on ancillary fees was recommended reading for `anyone who cares about real access to higher education'. Well I care about access to higher education and students rights, and so I read the report and was surprised to see that the main point seemed to have been missed. For example, NUS notes that 83 per cent of campuses charge a `compulsory non-academic service fee', and that on any financial measure they use, the compulsory non-academic services fee charged was by far the highest. In factâand I use the NUS survey results once moreâthe median compulsory fee charged was $260 per student per year. This peaked at $392 per student per year.</para><para>Finally, the only campuses in the country where this is not charged are those in Western Australia. Senator Stott Despoja says:</para><para>As the frequency of ancillary or illegal fees increases, more students are finding it increasingly difficult to meet these additional costs.</para><para>She concludes:</para><para>. . . up-front fees are a psychological and financial disincentive to enter into and pursue higher education.</para><para>Well said, Senator!	 A voluntary student unionism model would remove these fees, so I can only assume that the Democrats, in continuing to oppose VSU, support the imposition of psychological and financial disincentives to pursue higher education.</para><para>In fact, student unions throughout Australia  collectively acquire, through compulsory means, over $100 million every academic year from students. These are for non-educational purposes. Western Australia is the only state to have legislated to protect students' freedom of association and their ability to spend their own money as they see fit. The Western Australian legislation asserts that membership of, and payments to, student associations are voluntary. Three cheers for Western Australia.</para><para>In Victoria we are still a long way from true VSU. For example, at Melbourne University students are forced to pay $325 a year, up-front, at a time when they can least afford it. Unlike HECS charges, the fees cannot be deferred. At best, they often pay fees for services they never utilise. At worst, they pay fees for activities that they may be morally, ethically or politically opposed to.</para><para>Under the Victorian legislation, section 12F(3) attempts to define the areas that students' compulsorily acquired fees can be used. However, a document prepared for the Melbourne University Student Union executive in 1996, entitled <inline font-style="italic">A&amp;S fee and the VSU legislationâpushing the boundaries as far as they will go</inline>, demonstrates the attempts by student organisations to define their political functions as services, and, hence, supposedly `allowable' and worthy of compulsory funding under the Victorian act.</para><para>Examples are numerous and include: </para><para>.	 "child care, housing, employment, support for overseas studentsâarguments for full funding from A&amp;S fee of Welfare Officers and Committees? </para><para>.	 food and beverages, meeting rooms . . .</para><para>.	 libraries and reading rooms, academic support . . . Education Officers and Committee, and Project Officers of course".</para><para>The discussion paper continues in the same vein, drawing the conclusion that compulsory fees can provide `full funding of everything except elections'.</para><para>The ambiguity is such that even now the National Union of Students is considering legal action. In her report, this year's NUS Victorian branch president, Laura Smyth, 
 wants to `challenge the VSU legislation regarding the capacity of student organisations to pay NUS affiliation fees'. When NUS, a highly political organisation, believes that they can be funded, then one must question the effectiveness of the legislation in protecting the ability of students to freely associate with organisations of their choice.</para><para>This government has a clear mandate to introduce voluntary student unionism and to abolish the closed shops on campuses. We must legislate to ensure that this fundamental democratic right of voluntary membership and payment of fees to student unions becomes a reality.</para><para>Nearly two millenniums ago, a famous Roman senator, Cato the Elder, was so convinced that an invigorated Carthage posed such a risk to the stability of the Roman empire that he finished every speech and letter with the words `Delenda Est Carthago'âCarthage must be destroyed. These words have become synonymous with a war fought to the end, and with a resoluteness to see the ultimate battle waged. Cato lived to see the Romans invade Carthage in 149 BC. His constant warnings were vindicated.</para><para>To supporters of voluntary student unionism everywhere, we must take up the battle cry: `Compulsory student unionism must be destroyed.' For liberals it is a pillar of faith that the freedom of the individual must be protected. </para><para>Yes, VSU is on the agenda. Yes, people are talking about it. But it has been on the agenda for 21 years and talk is not enough.

I was interested in the debate about the Western Australia RFA proposals. It reminded me, to some degree, of what is happening in my state, but on a different front. There has been some debateâand there continues to be debate in Western Australiaâon the preservation and protection of forests and forest species. My state is probably one of the richest states in terms of forest resource. We have the opportunity to create 
 thousands of good jobs in my state in downstream processing industries.</para></talk.start><para>In early November, the Forestry Corporation released its new growth plan for the future. Last week, I was talking about that growth plan and somebody who came to Tasmania in 1992 with a view to creating jobs in forestry in my state. The growth plan says, among other things, that there will be better log segregation to achieve the most valuable product. I find that very interesting. It also says that expressions of interest will be called forâand they have been called forâto develop what they now call `laminated veneer lumber plants and merchandiser chipper flitch mill operations'âone in the Huon, one in the Derwent and one in the north-west or north-east.</para><para>In the late 1980s and early 1990s, I was part of a process which culminated in state legislation in 1991. The Commonwealth paid to the tune of $11 million for a forest and forest industry council to be set up. We developed a forest and forest industry strategy called `Secure futures for forests and people'. I have sent all senators a letter containing a few photographs which will give a limited idea of what the problems are in terms of Tasmania's forests at the moment. I will deal with what happened in 1991 and what was said about how crown pulpwood would be derived and arrived at. In recommendation No. 1, it says:</para><para>Determine pulpwood supply levels based on the following priorities:</para><para>(a)	 pulpwood produced from approved sawlog operations, selection harvesting, clear-felling;</para><para>(b)	 silviculture operations, thinning overwood removal to enhance sawlog production;</para><para>(c)	 sawmill residues;</para><para>(d)	 regeneration of understocked stand for future sawlog production;</para><para>(e)	 salvage, e.g. fire, pest, disease and construction activities; and</para><para>(f)	 plantation establishment for (1) sawlog trials and (2) pulpwood.</para><para>That is not a bad position to have, but the reality is that exactly the opposite has happened and is happening. As I said last week, I challenge all senators to view videos I have taken over the course of the last three months. 
 As someone who has been involved in the timber industry since the late 1970s, I know a reasonable amount about it. The National Forest Policy Statement, which came about as a result of trying to settle the dispute between conservation and commercial timber use of our forests, had a number of objectives. One of the principal objectives was the commercial use of forests and value adding or downstream processing in this country.</para><para>We have heard about the billions of dollars worth of development that was supposed to occur and the thousands, if not tens of thousands, of jobs that were to be created as a result of the development of the National Forest Policy Statement into a regional forest agreement. The Prime Minister and the then Premier announced at the signing of the Regional Forest Agreement for Tasmania that, at a minimum, 1,000 new jobs would be created. However, not one new job, in net effect, has been created. Indeed, the number of jobs in Tasmania's forest industry continues to decline at an alarming rate.</para><para>I noted with interest today's <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> front-page headline which said, `First prize in the loggers' lottery: you're sacked.' After 60 years in the industry, these people had their names drawn out of a hat and lost their jobs, along with 11 others. The reason that is happening in New South Wales is that they have a shortage of sawlogs because they are required to preserve and conserve certain areas of forest to maintain a proper ecosystem balance. There is nothing wrong with that; I support it. But what is wrong is that in my state we are chipping millions of tonnes of sawlog, and yet in New South Wales and Victoria, people are losing their jobs. People are also losing their jobs in my state.</para><para>This is a totally unacceptable set of circumstances. It should not be allowed to continue. No government, state or federal, and no opposition, state or federal, should allow this to continue to occur. You cannot deny the facts. You cannot deny the photographs. You cannot deny the videos. They speak the truth. You cannot fudge them. You cannot make them up. I want to read a letter from the Forest Practices Board on claims I made 
 about the woodchipping of sawlogs in Tasmania. It says:</para><para>The allegations that you make in your letter which relate to the Forest Practices Act or Forest Practices Code are very general and appear to have no basis. Windrow burning of stumps and slash is standard plantation establishment practice.</para><para>It was not the stumps I was talking about; it was the thousands of tonnes of logs.</para><para>I raise the question with regard to the saw logs being chipped. It says in another paragraph:</para><para>Forestry Tasmania carries out independent mill gate audit of truck loads entering pulp mills in the state. These audits have found, and recovered, less than one per cent of expected deliveries to be saw logs at any pulp mill. At Hampshire mill, Forestry Tasmania's independent inspections found no saw logs delivered last year.</para><para>The date of this letter is 3 June 1998. It goes on:</para><para>For the first time, two saw logs were found in one truck load earlier this year, 1998. These logs were redirected to a sawmill and a five times royalty penalty imposed.</para><para>All I can say to that is what a load of rubbish it is. It is not true, because I have the photographic evidenceâphotographic evidence that is supported by foresters who are qualified internationally and by sawmillers who come from within my own state.</para><para>In 1992, when I was the secretary of the Timber Workers Union, I participated in industrial action against the company known as APPM, which was actually owned by North Broken Hill-Peko. Many of the people who now come to me were contractors and loyal supporters of that company. They stood side by side with the company during the 1992 APPM dispute and strike, which was one of the most significant strikes in the country. They now find themselves, like these people mentioned in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline>, with no job. Ten more contractors on the north-west coast of Tasmania lost their jobs in the last two weeksâloyal supporters of the company and loyal supporters of an industry. It is not acceptable. We cannot allow this sort of thing to continue in this country if we are about bringing to this country import replacement programs, job generating programs, in particular with an 
 industry where we have a great capacity to do that. Governments have before them many reports that would indicate, in relation to hardwood in particular, that there is a shortage in supply over demand in our region of the world and indeed globally.</para><para>We cannot accept this. We cannot allow it to continue to happen. This federal government has but one opportunity. During the course of the debate on the Regional Forest Agreement legislation, I hope that senators will take the opportunity to have the legislation referred to a Senate committee and have something done about it. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Forestry: Tasmania</title><title>Trust Bank of Tasmania</title><page.no>1153</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>1153</page.no><name role="metadata">Watson, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WATSON</name><name.id>VJ4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âAs one who has had an interest in selling logs of milling and woodchip quality and all the other areas that Senator Murphy mentioned, I cannot let the opportunity pass to say that I find it just unbelievable that any contractor would allow that situation with logs like those photographed by Senator Murphy. It is just unbelievable that these organisations, which include fine furnishings timber mills, would put so much expense into getting logs to that state and then burn them.</para></talk.start><para>Tonight I would like to talk about another issue. Tasmanians are very fond of their local bank, the Trust Bank of Tasmania. As all Australians are aware, Tasmanians are very loyal people. We can remember, of course, predecessors such as the Launceston Bank for Savings, the Hobart Savings Bank, the permanent building societies and the Launceston Permanent Investment and Building Society. The bank has a very long history, but many of its customers have been dismayed by some recent comments by the managing director, Mr Paul Kemp, who said that within two years customers may have to pay $5 for every over-the-counter transaction. According to Mr Kemp, some customers, particularly those of mature age, are reluctant to use automatic teller machines and EFTPOS. He believes these people are causing the current long queues. Unfortunately, more than 60 per cent of Trust Bank customers are of mature age, so 
 the bank should recognise a very real reason for keeping these people happy.</para><para>The Trust Bank has recently installed a brand-new computer system costing $23 million which is having a greater than expected number of teething problems. According to the Trust Bank, the computer system places it in a position to address year 2000 problems, but other banks have installed major computers and do not have this sort of problem. Because of the down time and the slow responses, customers are having to wait 30 minutes and longer in queues. In some cases the queues have stretched to the front doors of the banks and into the street. No-one wants to queue in the street but it is being forced upon them. Mr Kemp says that one of the main reasons why the queues are so long is that people with simple transactions really could have them handled very efficiently by alternative means. This is the attribution theory: blaming the mature age customer for the long queues and not the bank's computer problems. I ask what has happened to good old-fashioned service.</para><para>The bank says in its annual report that the Trust Bank's gold star banking promise to do everything in its power to help its customers achieve their personal and business goals has underpinned the bank's strategies, products, services and success. Perhaps the Trust Bank could assist its mature age customers by inviting them to free sessions on how to use the ATMs and EFTPOS instead of threatening them with a $5 fee for every transaction if they do not fall into line. Perhaps some of their mobile sales staff, those in telephone banking and those in technology, who have been taken out of branches, can be returned to the branches to teach the mature age people how to use this new technology. But who can blame customers if they leave the Trust Bank in droves to move their custom to the more amenable building societies and credit unions?</para><para>These comments from Mr Kemp are indeed unfortunate. The banks are part of a service industry, and service companies define their reason for being through their service strategy, as in the Trust Bank's gold star banking promise. The service strategy guides and 
 energises firms in creating value for customers. Quality service should underpin value creation. The Trust Bank exists to service customers, not the reverse. As we know, the Trust Bank may move to a public float.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><adjournment><adjournmentinfo><time.stamp>19:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>1154</page.no></adjournmentinfo><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senate adjourned at 7.37 p.m.</inline></para></adjournment><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>1154</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tabling</title><page.no>1154</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following government documents were tabled:</para><para>Australia-China CouncilâReport for 1997-98, incorporating reports for the period 1 July 1994 to 30 June 1997.</para><para>Bankruptcy ActâInspector-General in BankruptcyâReport for 1997-98 on the operation of the Act.</para><para>Commonwealth Authorities and Companies ActâReports for 1997-98â</para><para>	 Anindilyakwa Land Council.</para><para>	 Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation.</para><para>Development Allowance Authority ActâDevelopment Allowance AuthorityâReport for 1997-98.</para><para>Family Law ActâFamily Court of AustraliaâReport for 1997-98âErratum.</para><para>Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development ActâDried Fruits Research and Development CouncilâReport for 1997-98.</para><para>Public Service ActâPublic Service RegulationsâPublic Service and Merit Protection CommissionâState of the serviceâReport for 1997-98.</para><para>Public Service and Merit Protection CommissionâWorkplace diversityâReport for 1997-98.</para><para>Telecommunications Act 1997âFunding of consumer representation, and of research, in relation to telecommunicationsâReport for 1997-98.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tabling</title><page.no>1154</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following documents were tabled by the Clerk:</para><para>Civil Aviation ActâCivil Aviation RegulationsâCivil Aviation OrdersâAmendment of section 40, dated 30 November 1998.</para><para>Customs ActâInstruments of Approval Nos 40-43 of 1998</para><para>Fisheries Management ActâTemporary Order No. 2âBan on fishing for pilchards.
