These bills represent the first stage of implementation of a new regulatory regime and will, among other things, establish the 2 new financial system regulators, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC). APRA and ASIC are expected to commence operation on 1 July 1998. The amendments included in the bill introduced today simply ensure that other Commonwealth legislation is made consistent with the new regulatory arrangements.</para><para>A number of the amendments in this bill are consequential to the amendments to the Banking Act 1959 contained in the Financial Sector Reform (Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill. Generally, these consequential amendments change references to the words "bank", "banker" and "banking" in other Commonwealth legislation to equivalent references to Authorised Deposit-taking Institutions (ADI). Similarly, this bill also includes amendments as a consequence of the repeal of the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner Act 1987. References to the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner in Commonwealth legislation are to be amended to refer to either APRA or ASIC, or both, depending upon which organisation will adopt regulatory responsibility.</para><para>Finally, a number of the consequential amendments give effect to the proposed renaming of some of the financial sector levy acts (in particular, those applying to excluded superannuation funds) as amended by the financial sector reform package. 
</para><para>I also foreshadow that I will shortly circulate draft provisions which would make further consequential amendments implementing the Government's financial sector reforms.</para><para>This course of action is necessary because the Commonwealth is required under the terms of the Corporations Agreement to consult on these amendments, which relate to the national scheme laws for corporations, with the Ministerial Council for Corporations (MINCO). The support of two States is required before amendments of this kind may be introduced into the Commonwealth Parliament.</para><para>Following these MINCO consultations, I propose to move government amendments to this bill in a form similar to the draft provisions I will circulate.</para><para>The additional amendments will do two things.</para><para>First, they will amend references to the word "bank" and like expressions, and to the "Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner" in the Corporations Law and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 1989.</para><para>Secondly, they will confer on ASIC sole responsibility for consumer protection in relation to financial services. These proposed amendments are part of the on-going implementation of the Financial System Inquiry recommendations. In particular, recommendation 3 was to the effect that ASIC should have sole responsibility for administering consumer protection regulation within its jurisdiction over the financial sector. For this purpose, consumer protection provisions comparable to those in the Trade Practices Act 1974 were recommended to be included in ASIC's legislation.</para><para>The amendments included in the first package of bills introduced on 26 March 1998 (including the Financial Sector Reform (Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 1998) will confer on ASIC specific market integrity and consumer protection functions under the various pieces of legislation listed in proposed section 12A of the ASIC act. To the extent that those acts deal with consumer protection matters, ASIC will already be taking on consumer protection responsibilities. For example, ASIC will have responsibility for the administration of section 72 of the Retirement Savings Accounts Act 1997, which prohibits a person from engaging in misleading conduct in publishing an advertisement in relation to a retirement savings account.</para><para>The Financial Sector Reform (Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill does not, however, confer general consumer protection functions and powers on ASIC. Currently, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (the ACCC) exercises this general function in the financial system through the provisions in Parts IVA and V of the Trade Practices Act. 
</para><para>The amendments will explicitly transfer responsibility for consumer protection in the financial system from the ACCC to ASIC. This will implement the Financial System Inquiry recommendation by making ASIC the sole regulator of consumer protection in the financial system.</para><para>I commend the bill to the Senate and present the explanatory memorandum.</para><para>Ordered that further consideration of the second reading speech of this bill be adjourned until the first day of the spring sittings, in accordance with standing order 111.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>2797</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Legal and Constitutional References Committee</title><page.no>2797</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Reference</title><page.no>2797</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolkus</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stot Despoja</inline>)—as amended—agreed to:</para><para>That the following matters be referred to the Legal and Constitutional References Committee for inquiry and report by 12 August 1998:</para><para>(1)	 The need for Commonwealth privacy legislation to be extended to the private sector, with particular reference to:</para><para>	 (a)	 relevant international standards and obligations;</para><para>	 (b)	 international comparisons;</para><para>	 (c)	 current legislative and other frameworks for privacy regulation in the Commonwealth, States and Territories;</para><para>	 (d)	 the role, responsibilities and practices of Commonwealth, State and Territory governments;</para><para>	 (e)	 the needs and responsibilities of the private sector; and</para><para>	 (f)	 the rights of consumers.</para><para>(2)	 The effectiveness of any privacy scheme that does not have legislatively-backed complaints, investigation and enforcement mechanisms.</para><para>(3)	 The appropriateness of using the National Principles for the Fair Handling of Personal Information, as produced by the Privacy Commissioner, as a basis for a co-regulatory regime for the private sector and the best means of implementing such a scheme.</para><para>(4)	 The appropriateness of the provisions of the Privacy Amendment Bill 1998.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>XE4</name.id><name role="metadata">BOLKUS</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name></talker><para>—I ask the Senate to note that this notice of motion is co-sponsored by me and Senator Stott Despoja.</para></talk.start></interjection></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>EMPLOYEE PROTECTION (WAGE GUARANTEE) BILL 1998 [No. 2]</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>2797</page.no><id.no>s163</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>2797</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Forshaw</inline>) agreed to:</para><para>That the following bill be introduced: a bill for an act to provide for the establishment and administration of a scheme to guarantee the payment of wages and certain other liabilities owed to employees in the event of employer insolvency, and for related purposes.</para><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Forshaw</inline>) agreed to:</para><para>That this bill may proceed without formalities and be now read a first time.</para><para>Bill read a first time.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>2797</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>2797</page.no><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name><name.id>656</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para><para>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline></para><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The speech read as follows</inline>—</para><para>Guaranteeing workers' entitlements in the event of company insolvency is one of the most important reforms yet to be undertaken by an Australian government. Australia has a fine record when it comes to the introduction of social legislation. We were one of the first countries in the world to introduce worker's compensation, and we were the first to grant child endowment payments to mothers and introduce long service leave to workers. And yet, when it comes to guaranteeing workers' entitlements against an employer's insolvency or providing them with the utmost priority against all other creditors, Australia has neither. The rest of the world has passed us by. In this respect, our proud tradition of social reforms stands diminished.</para><para>Guaranteeing workers' entitlements is a social reform for our time. The recent tragic stories of the miners at Cobar and at Woodlawn mine near Goulburn and of the meatworkers at Grafton remind us of that. More recently, the events on the waterfront where companies were stripped of their assets and workers sacked in the middle of the night demonstrate that Australians have never before felt less secure in their jobs. As Asia's economic woes begin to have their effect on our shores, business insolvencies are destined to increase dramatically.</para><para>This bill is in similar terms to a bill introduced recently into the House of Representatives by my colleague, the Member for Prospect, Mrs Crosio. I congratulate Mrs Crosio on her leadership and 
 initiative in this matter. The bill seeks to reform an aspect of Australian industrial relations that can no longer be set aside. We can no longer enjoy the luxury of sitting in this Senate and expressing our sympathy to workers left without their entitlements and saying: "Oh yes, something needs to be done to stop this happening in the future", and then wait for somebody else to do it. With this bill, I am doing something about it. With this bill I am giving the government and other senators the opportunity to do something about it as well.</para><para>As it stands at the moment, at least 3,000 Australian workers are owed roughly $20 million in their legal entitlements due to company insolvency. This is a disgraceful figure, but it should not be a surprising one. It is estimated that 13,000 businesses and companies become insolvent each year in this country, leaving at least 20,000 workers out of a job. Of course not all of these ex-employees are left without their accrued entitlements but a good many are.</para><para>In 1993 the Labor government, supported by the Coalition and by both unions and employer groups, relegated the Commissioner of Taxation to the category of "unsecured creditor", thereby improving the position of unpaid employees for priority of payment in the event of an employer's insolvency. This was an important and commendable reform. However, in hindsight, it has not proved as successful as was first hoped. Employees have continued to miss out on their entitlements for the simple reason that, if a bankrupt enterprise no longer has any assets, the workers, whatever their position in an order of priority, do not benefit.</para><para>The Employee Protection (Wage Guarantee) Bill 1998 aims to rectify this situation by establishing a scheme to guarantee the payment of wages and other liabilities in the event of insolvency. Under the scheme, no Australian worker need ever again be left without entitlements should his or her employer collapse into insolvency. Unless exempt under the legislation, all employers must take out and maintain a policy of wage protection insurance for their work force with an approved insurer. The Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner will administer the scheme. In the event of an employer's insolvency, workers will be insured for unpaid wages, annual leave or long service leave, liabilities resulting from the termination of employment without notice or with insufficient notice and liabilities for repayment of any amounts paid by the employee to the employer for training in a particular trade or profession. One of the most important aspects of the scheme is that it will include a bad risk cross-subsidisation system to help offset the concerns of employers and the insurance industry.</para><para>I am well aware that there will always be some employers who are perceived by the insurance industry as potential bad risks. If this concern were 
 allowed to manifest itself without regulation, some employers would find it very difficult to obtain insurance cover or, if they did obtain it, it would be prohibitively expensive. As a way around this problem, the bbill requires approved insurers participating in the scheme, along with the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner, to participate in a bad risk cross-subsidisation system.</para><para>Under such a program, an insurer would be required to accept an insurance proposal—even from an employer considered a bad risk—at a rate of premium not exceeding a maximum fixed by the commissioner. In order to mitigate the harshness of this from the insurer's point of view, the bad risk cross-subsidisation scheme would allow for the transfer of the burden of bad risks away from the individual insurer to the total body of insurers.</para><para>Critics of this bbill have argued that it would place an unfair extra financial burden on all employers to make up for the unscrupulous actions of a few. My response to that is twofold. Firstly, I do not consider the estimated extra 0.1 to 0.3 per cent of an employer's total wages bbill that they would be required to contribute to participate in the scheme to be an unfair burden. It would certainly not be a burden of the stature that has been discussed: impeding a business' growth, the hiring of their staff or indeed hastening their own insolvency. Secondly, all employers are members of a corporate community. As a community they have a number of social responsibilities and one of those is seeing that all of their workers, in return for their labour, receive the entitlements that they are owed. Obviously we have seen that, at the present time, there are occasions when that responsibility is not being met. Employers have to work as one to address this issue, to live up to their responsibilities. Participation in this scheme should be seen in that respect.</para><para>However, if the government is uneasy about socialising the burdens of insolvency by passing the responsibility of risk on to all members of the corporate community, it has a number of options open to it. One would be to amend my bbill to require participation in the scheme only by those employers who did not enter formal arrangements to place their employee's entitlements in trust. Another would be to amend this bbill to require lending institutions to pay for maintaining their privileged position at the top of the creditor preference queue. If the government were to underpin my scheme by firstly taking contributions from the banks, payments required from employers would be substantially reduced.</para><para>After the Member for Prospect introduced a similar bbill into the House of Representatives in March this year, she received an extremely positive response, including many expressions of support from members, not only from our own side but also from the government's side, as well as from the 
 community at large. Australians, not just those workers who have lost their entitlements but I think the great majority of the people we represent, want to put an end to this sort of unfairness taking place. I think most of us recognise that fact. By supporting this bbill, senators can put this vexing problem behind this country once and for all. As long as this reform remains undone, thousands of ordinary Australian workers and their families will continue to be failed by a system they look to for justice, fairness and equity.</para><para>The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said last month, in relation to legislative reform:</para><para>There'll be people running around saying, "Oh, don't do it—it's too hard". I mean, you can't go on forever saying that. We know everything's a bit difficult if it's a big reform, but the Australian people in the long run will respect you and support you if you have a go.</para><para>I invite the Prime Minister and the members of his government to heed his advice and act on this matter with the utmost urgency. The Opposition, I know, stands ready to give him that  support.</para><para>I commend  this  bill  to  the Senate.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ian Campbell</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1998</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>2799</page.no><id.no>s162</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>2799</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ian Campbell</inline>) agreed to:</para><para>That the following bill be introduced: a bill for an act to amend the law relating to elections and referendums.</para><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ian Campbell</inline>) agreed to:</para><para>That this bill may proceed without formalities and be now read a first time.</para><para>Bill read a first time.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>2799</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>2799</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I table the explanatory memorandum and move:</para></talk.start><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para><para>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline></para><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The speech read as follows</inline>—</para><para>This bill contains a number of electoral reforms to the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 and the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984.</para><para>These reforms arise out of the recommendations contained in the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters' report on the conduct of the 1996 federal election, which was tabled on 16 June 1997.</para><para>Many of the Committee's recommendations were dealt with in the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill 1997, debated in the House of Representatives a few weeks ago. The items of that bill are largely technical in nature and considered non-contentious.</para><para>The amendments in the bill which I introduce today relate to the more substantive reform issues considered by the Electoral Matters Committee, including the matter of electoral fraud.</para><para>There is increasing disquiet in sections of the community about the potential for electoral fraud and continuing scepticism regarding the integrity of the Electoral Roll as the current enrolment process is open to abuse.</para><para>The Government agrees with the Committee when it states</para><para>that it is unacceptable that the most fundamental transaction between a citizen and the government—[that is] the act of choosing the government at a democratic election—is subject to a far lower level of security than such lesser transactions as opening a bank account, applying for a passport, applying for a driver's license or registering for social security benefits, to name but a few.</para><para>Under the Act in its present form, it is remarkably easy to place on the Roll a dead persons name, a false name, a non-citizen, or a person who is not yet 18. In addition the enrolment could have a fake or false address.</para><para>Maintaining the confidence of all Australians in the integrity of our electoral system is essential.</para><para>Accordingly, this bill introduces some of the recommendations of the Electoral Matters Committee report with respect to addressing the potential for electoral fraud. The amendments relating to enrolment issues will provide:</para><para>.	 for an upgraded witnessing requirement, whereby the witness must be an elector and be in a prescribed class of persons. Regulations will be made to provide for an extensive list of categories or people who will be able to witness a claim for enrolment, and will specify provisions for those electors who are unable to find a witness in the prescribed list;</para><para>.	 that a person who is enrolling for the first time must have their identity verified before they are enrolled, and that a person who claims in their enrolment application to be an Australian citizen 
 because of a grant of Australian citizenship under the Australian Citizenship Act 1948, must have their citizenship verified before they may be enrolled. The methods of verification are to be prescribed by regulation; and</para><para>.	 that an elector must notify a change of address within one month of taking up residence at their new address.</para><para>The regulations specifying the method of verification of identity of first time enrollees will require the applicant to produce, at the time of application, at least one original form of proof of identity documentation. The form of documentation will depend on the circumstances of the applicant, but may include an Australian birth certificate, passport or photographic driver's license. It is possible that some applicants will not be in a position to produce an original form of identity document, and in such cases the regulations will provide for, say, a written reference to be produced.</para><para>Original documentation will be able to be posted to a Divisional Returning Officer (DRO) or to an Australian Electoral Officer (AEO) with the enrolment application. The documents will be checked and then returned by mail to the applicant. Alternatively, the applicant may present the original documents at an office of a DRO or AEO with the application. The documents will then be checked at that time and handed back to the applicant.</para><para>To provide, however, a wider facility for lodgement of original documents and enrolment applications by hand (so that many applicants need not part with original documents, especially those presenting a driver's license), a new provision will allow prescribed persons to receive enrolment applications, and where necessary, sight and verify the lodgement of original identity documents, enabling the documents to be handed back to the applicant.</para><para>The lodgement of enrolment applications with a prescribed person will only be by hand; the applications will not be able to be posted to a prescribed person. Prescribed persons will be selected on the basis of their accessibility to the public, and, subject to negotiation, may include government or semi-government organisations, such as post offices. Prescribed persons will not verify or determine entitlement to enrolment, however, they would be required to note on applications the time of their receipt and forward them to the Australian Electoral Commission as directed. In the case of first time enrolment applicants, the prescribed person would also be required to verify the lodgement of an original form of identity document, and note on the application that the document was lodged, and then hand back the original to the applicant.</para><para>In addition to the increased requirements with regard to the enrolment processes, the Government 
 proposes, in line with the JSCEM recommendation, to close the Electoral Roll on the day that the writ is issued for new electors, while still allowing three working days following the issue of the writ for existing electors to change their enrolment details.</para><para>As the JSCEM reported, "at the 1996 election some 428,000 transactions (new and updated enrolments) were processed from the day the writs were issued. The AEC freely admits that detailed checking, before the election, of these late enrolments—particularly the new enrolments—is virtually impossible. Consequently the seven-day period is often called into question by those concerned about the integrity of the rolls.</para><para>New enrolments should cease on the day the writ is issued, while electors already on the roll should be given three days in which to notify changes of address. Suggestions that such measures would lead to less accurate rolls are unfounded—the AEC should extensively advertise the new requirements, and should move as quickly as possible to a continuous roll review based on effective data-matching and flexible habitation reviews".</para><para>New provisions will also ensure that an enrolment application lodged with a prescribed person, before the close of the Rolls for an election, will satisfy the requirement for the receipt of the application by a DRO or AEO before the close of the Rolls. That is, the application can be processed and, if accepted by the AEC, the applicant can be added to the Roll for the election.</para><para>Regulations for verification of citizenship will take the form of the enrolment applicant being required to provide either their citizenship number or date of conferral of citizenship on the application, and for the Australian Electoral Commission to verify with the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs that the applicant is in fact an Australian citizen. It is possible that some applicants in this category will not be able to produce either a citizenship number or date of conferral, in which case the AEC will be required to make whatever inquiries of the applicant and the Department as are necessary to verify citizenship.</para><para>Amendments to improve the integrity of the election process include allowing only the presiding officer of a polling place to mark, fold and deposit the ballot paper of those voters who require assistance with voting. Scrutineers will also be permitted to witness the assistance being provided, and the voter may also nominate a person to witness the process.</para><para>Other important amendments will:</para><para>.	 repeal the entitlement of prisoners to be enrolled or to vote. The Government agrees with the Electoral Matters Committee that those who disregard the laws to a degree sufficient to 
 warrant imprisonment should not expect to retain the franchise;</para><para>.	 allow for the provision of date of birth and salutation details of electors to Members, Senators and registered political parties. Also, elector details will be able to be used by these people and organisations for electoral research purposes. The AEC will commence collecting salutation details on enrolment forms when the amendments are enacted;</para><para>.	 increase the penalty on the disclosure of elector data, or for its commercial use, to 100 penalty units (that is, $10,000);</para><para>.	 allow for the preliminary scrutiny of declaration votes to commence on the Monday before polling day. However, no declaration envelopes will be opened before the close of polling, and any envelopes rejected at the preliminary scrutiny will not be rechecked until after the close of the poll;</para><para>.	 require donors to political parties to provide a return to the AEC if the sum of the donations to a party in a financial year, by the donor is $10,000 or more. This is an increase from $1,500;</para><para>.	 require political parties to furnish a return identifying donors to the party where the sum of the donations from the donor, in a financial year, is $5,000 or more. This is an increase from $1,500;</para><para>.	 require only those donations which are $1,500 or more to be counted in the sum of donations from a donor to a political party. This is an increase from $500.</para><para>The Government is concerned to ensure that all Australians have the utmost confidence in the integrity and accuracy of the electoral rolls. The measures proposed in this bill will improve enrolment procedures without unduly inhibiting the opportunity for all adult Australian citizens to participate in the electoral process.</para><para>I commend the bill to the Senate.</para><para>Ordered that further consideration of the second reading speech of this bill be adjourned until the first day of the spring sittings, in accordance with standing order 111. </para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>2801</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts References Committee</title><page.no>2801</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Reference</title><page.no>2801</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Woodley</inline>) agreed to:</para><para>That the following matters be referred to the Environment, Recreation and the Arts References Committee for inquiry and report by 30 June 1998:</para><para>(1)	 The relationships between Federal, State and local governments and developers in the Hinchinbrook Channel.</para><para>(2)	 The effect of developments on the environment of the Hinchinbrook Channel and surrounding environs.</para><para>(3)	 Whether governments have met their obligations under the various Acts and agreements that deal with the Hinchinbrook area.</para><para>(4)	 Alternatives to the existing regime.</para><para>(5)	 What lessons have been learned and what can be done to prevent problems like this occurring in the future.</para></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ORDER OF BUSINESS</title><type>Business</type><page.no>2801</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Human Rights</title><page.no>2801</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Allison</inline>) agreed to:</para><para>That general business notice of motion No. 1110 standing in the name of Senator Allison for today, relating to the National Human Rights Register, be postponed till the next day of sitting.</para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>GENETIC ENGINEERING</title><type>Miscellaneous</type><page.no>2801</page.no></debateinfo><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stott Despoja</inline>) agreed to:</para><para>That the Senate—</para><para>(a)	 notes the advertisement on page 24 of the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline>  of 23 March 1998 regarding funding for human cloning research;</para><para>(b)	 reaffirms the resolution adopted by the Senate on 6 March 1997 about genetic engineering;</para><para>(c)	 expresses concern that the Government is not taking a leading role in assisting the Australian community to understand and deal with this new technology;

On 4 November 1996, the matter was referred to the Finance and Public Administration References Committee for inquiry and report. The reference was extended on 27 May 1997 to include, specifically, all aspects of the outsourcing of the information technology requirements of Commonwealth departments and agencies. This was the subject of the committee's first report in November of last year.</para><para>In this, its second report on the broad issues surrounding the contracting out of government services, the committee has looked specifically at four aspects: the tendering process; contract management; accountability; and the problems posed by commercial confidentiality. It has not attempted to reproduce the Industry Commissions's comprehensive overview of the subject or to write the definitive best practice guide to outsourcing. Nor has it canvassed the issue of whether outsourcing per se is desirable policy. It has looked at examples of outsourcing—both good and bad—and attempted to draw lessons from them.</para><para>In the committee's view, the efficiency of a competitive tendering process is crucial in achieving the desired outcomes of outsourcing. The committee noted many examples of flawed tendering, resulting in considerable cost to the taxpayer through legal challenges and in disillusionment on the part of unsuccessful tenderers. As Commonwealth agencies develop more expertise in tendering, the potential tendering pitfalls may be avoided. The committee will keep a watching brief on 
 Commonwealth agency tendering and may report again on this highly sensitive aspect of outsourcing, should its findings warrant it.</para><para>Contract management is another area of concern to the committee and, the committee noted, to the Auditor-General. It appears that despite the many worthy volumes of advice available to them, Commonwealth agencies have a mixed record as contract managers. Whether the public service will be able to retain, train or acquire the appropriate expertise in contract monitoring is of particular interest to the committee and is another area which the committee believes requires ongoing monitoring. The Auditor-General's role in this process is vital. While the mechanics of achieving access by the Auditor-General to relevant third-party information and records can be complex, such access is vital to ensuring that the efficiency and integrity of any outsourcing is maintained.</para><para>The committee is concerned to ensure that the values of fairness, openness, honesty and efficiency in Commonwealth agency dealings with the general public that were intended to be achieved by the provisions of the administrative law reforms in recent decades be maintained, whether a service is provided by government or by the private sector under contract. Members of the public who might be adversely affected by the manner in which a service is delivered must have a right to redress and that redress mechanism must be simple, accessible and monitored by the contracting agency. Common sense dictates that in the first instance, complaints need to be handled by the agency providing the service, with a service charter spelling out the mechanics of the complaints-handling procedures.</para><para>Further review, where required, should be possible. In the committee's view, the Commonwealth Ombudsman has a proven track record in complaints-handling. That office is already under pressure, however, in workload terms. Rather than exacerbate its problems by recommending an across-the-board extension of the Ombudsman's jurisdiction to cover contracted out services, the committee has decided to adopt the approach of recommending a gradual extension on a case-by-case basis for large or particularly sensitive areas of service delivery, as has been done for employment service providers. In collaboration with the Ombudsman's office, the committee will monitor usage and will revisit at a later stage the question of a legislative extension of the Ombudsman's jurisdiction to cover all contracted out government services.</para><para>The contribution of the Freedom of Information (FOI) Act in enhancing scrutiny of government activities is such that, in the committee's view, it should not be weakened in an outsourced environment. The Administrative Review Council (ARC) is currently considering options for extending the 
 remit of the act. This committee supports the ARC proposal to amend the FOI Act by deeming documents in the possession of contractors which relate directly to the performance of a contractor's contractual obligations to be in the possession of the government agency, and hence FOIable.</para><para>The contracting out of government services poses considerable accountability challenges. The committee believes it is important to establish and entrench amongst contractors the same culture of accountability as exists in the Commonwealth public sector. Equally, it is important to reinforce in the public sector that outsourcing should not involve any lowering of the existing levels of public scrutiny and parliamentary accountability of publicly funded enterprises.</para><para>The committee is concerned that the mantra of `commercial confidentiality' will increasingly be used to deny Parliament access to the detail of contracting arrangements. The committee accepts that there are limited aspects of contracts which may be legitimately commercially confidential. However, whenever information is denied Parliament, there will be a suspicion that it is to hide sloppy administration, extravagance, incompetence—or worse—in the expenditure of public money. While recognising that parliamentary committees have extensive powers to compel the production of information, the committee regretfully also recognises that those powers are sometimes used capriciously. It strongly supports the use of the Auditor-General as an independent arbiter in determining the confidentiality status of commercial information sought by Parliament.</para><para>The security of information relating to the affairs of individuals when in the hands of a contractor rather than a government agency is an issue the committee considered closely. The committee is aware that amendments to the <inline font-style="italic">Privacy Act </inline> 1988 to ensure coverage of contractors supplying services to government in relation to personal information held by them on behalf of government is currently before the Parliament. It is vital, in the committee's view, that the Privacy Commissioner be adequately resourced to handle her educative role for contracted service providers.</para><para>I commend the report to the Senate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>2803</page.no><name role="metadata">West, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator WEST</name><name.id>1X4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para></talk.start><para>Leave granted; debate adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Selection of Bills Committee</title><page.no>2803</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report</title><page.no>2803</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 13 May.</para><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ian Campbell</inline>)—by leave—proposed:  </para><para>That the report of the committee be adopted.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>2803</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Could I contribute to the debate by speaking to Senator Ian Campbell's motion, which is just flatly reporting the fact, and move an amendment to the motion.

 ber that the magnitude of the investment required by the broadcasters to convert to digital is well in excess of $½ billion. It requires the certainty of legislation as a precondition for starting out on that expenditure process.</para><para>The legislation is a broad framework for the digital conversion scheme for Australia. Much of the detail will be determined through extensive reviews and consultation with interested groups. There is a requirement for no less than five statutory reviews to be completed by the start-up date of 1 January 2001. These will be to consider definitions of enhanced programming and datacasting; to deal with the issues of convergence; to determine policy relating to retransmission of pay TV; to develop amendments to ensure that under-serviced regional licence areas are provided with the same services as metropolitan areas; to determine a method of charging for datacasting; to commence technical planning of spectrum and technical standards relating to equipment; to establish arrangements relating to digital transmission of community television; and to determine the ability of the ABC and SBS to provide limited multichannelling—all of those matters will be dealt with under a series of reviews, but those reviews cannot get under way until the legislation is in place.</para><para>If the view of the Senate turns out to be that this matter should be put off for another six months or so, you are effectively saying that you really want it after the election.

Whether it is digital telephones or digital television sets, what we are talking about is whether or not corporations can go to governments and argue that for their bottom line, for their profitability, they can force the community to make certain consumer choices.

Senator Schacht, I am making you a generous offer which I am sure you will accept. As of today, I will include you on the mailing list for matters relating to the management of government business and opposition business in the Senate. If you would like, I will invite you to the leaders and whips meetings and you can come along and be part of it. Then Senator Schacht would not mislead the Senate in relation to the government's intentions. </para><para>We do intend dealing with a large schedule of legislation in these sittings.

Senator Carr has seen the list. He has alerted Senator Schacht to the fact that the government did alert all senators through their leaders and whips of the legislation proposed to be debated in the 1998 winter sittings. I will table this document, because at least if it is tabled—Senator Schacht may not be able to find it on the World Wide Web or on the Senate's homepage; he may not be able to get it through Senator Carr's office, because he is obviously going to fight to retain his job—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>4J4</name.id><name role="metadata">SCHACHT</name><name role="display">Senator Schacht</name></talker><para>—But you didn't even give it a priority, Ian, on your own list.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name></talker><para>—I will get to that, Senator Schacht.

Senator Carr, as you know, Madam President, is in the far Left faction from Victoria and Senator Schacht is in the sort of Centre Left faction from South Australia, which I think he is the only member of, but they can talk to each other.

Those principles essentially propose that the government should own only property where the long-term yield rate exceeded the social opportunity cost of capital or where it is otherwise in the public interest to do so.</para><para> In view of the apparent interest in the topic, the committee adopted the reference with alacrity, advertised nationally for submissions and wrote personally to many individuals and organisations expected to have an interest in the matter. In the event, however, the response was extremely disappointing. By the closing date for submissions, the committee had only received five modest contributions, along with many indications from others that the issue under investigation was not of particular concern to the writers. The committee has therefore reluctantly decided that to continue a public inquiry into this matter would be a waste of time and public money and thanks those individuals and organisations which made submissions. A compilation of those submissions has been tabled with this report for the assistance of those who may be interested in the subject.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>BUDGET 1996-97 AND 1997-98 </title><type>Miscellaneous</type><page.no>2809</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Consideration by Legislation Committees</title><page.no>2809</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Additional Information</title><page.no>2809</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>2809</page.no><name role="metadata">Tierney, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator TIERNEY</name><name.id>O15</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I present additional information received by the Employment, Education and Training Legislation Committee, together with certain transcripts of evidence, relating to the additional estimates supplementary hearings for 1996-97, budget

It extends the sunset of the NRTC until 2004 and makes it, and the inter-governmental processes through which reform is pursued, more effective.</para><para>The National Road Transport Commission Act 1991 (the NRTC Act) was reviewed in late 1996, by a joint government/industry steering committee. The review drew on the lessons of the first six years of the NRTC and examined ways to improve the road transport reform process. The review recognised the significant economic benefits that will flow from the road transport reform program—the Industry Commission has estimated that GDP benefits could total $800 million per year—as well as making the roads safer.</para><para>The passage of the National Road Transport Commission Amendment Act 1997 through this Parliament extended the life of the NRTC Act for twelve months from January 1998, ensuring that the reform process could continue while this bill was finalised in consultation with States and Territories.</para><para>The Government is committed to delivering road transport reform to benefit not only the road transport industry, but all the community, rural, 
 regional and urban. Since the NRTC was created in 1991, reforms developed and agreed through the NRTC process include nationally consistent heavy vehicle charges, consistent heavy vehicle registration requirements, National Mass and Dimension and Vehicle Standards, a new Dangerous Goods regime, and national driving hours for long distance coaches and trucks. Many further reforms are on the agenda.</para><para>These reforms will provide a nationally uniform or consistent operating environment for road transport operators and drivers, no matter where they are based or travel. An important ongoing role for the NRTC and all jurisdictions will be to ensure that the gains delivered by reform are maintained and built upon.</para><para>Effective observance of road transport reform is also one of the key components of the national competition policy, and thus one of the criteria for determining the national competition payments to the States and Territories.</para><para>The bill will give stronger objectives and focus for the NRTC, set by Heads of Government.</para><para>It will strengthen the NRTC's accountability to the Australian Transport Council—the council of Transport Ministers—including through new strategic planning requirements and the appointment of the Commission's Chief Executive by the Council. The Council will also review the NRTC Act at least every six years.</para><para>The bill is to be supported by amending Heads of Government Agreements, which will give jurisdictions greater flexibility in their implementation of legislative reforms, so reforms can be implemented more quickly. Heads of Government will sign these Agreements shortly.</para><para>The bill provides recognition for the unique transport operational requirements of the Defence Forces, to make it easier for them to operate, particularly in potential security and emergency situations, but with due regard to road safety. These provisions were developed in a strong cooperative spirit by the Department of Defence, the States and Territories and the Department of Transport and Regional Development.</para><para>The bill also gives legislative backing to the National Environment Protection Council's involvement in the joint development of motor vehicle noise and emission standards, and allows for New Zealand's involvement in developing trans-Tasman vehicle standards.</para><para>In short, the National Road Transport Commission Amendment Bill 1998 will provide a better road transport reform process that, through cooperation between Governments, the NRTC and the road transport industry, will deliver big benefits to the whole Australian community. 
</para><para>AUSTRALIAN SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND ENGINEERING COUNCIL REPEAL BILL 1998</para><para>The Australian Science, Technology and Engineering Council Repeal Bill 1998, in part, implements the changes announced by the Prime Minister on December 18 last year to his high-level science, technology and engineering advisory arrangements.</para><para>Upon coming to office, the Government identified, as a priority, the need to examine how Australia's science and technology system might be improved. The then Minister for Science and Technology commissioned the Chief Scientist, Professor John Stocker, to investigate and report on certain aspects of Australia's science and technology arrangements.</para><para>In his report to the then Minister, Professor Stocker identified several strengths and a number of structural weaknesses in the current science and technology advisory arrangements. Professor Stocker spoke very highly indeed of the role played by the Prime Minister's Science and Engineering Council (or PMSEC). He observed that PMSEC provides a unique forum for the Prime Minister, and other senior Ministers, to be informed of recent developments in science and technology and their application to the national needs and opportunities. Professor Stocker noted also, the difficulties which the Australian Science, Technology and Engineering Council (or ASTEC) faces in respect of undertaking the complex tasks of consultation, analysis of issues and in the synthesis of its findings. Professor Stocker suggested there would be an advantage in drawing ASTEC closer to PMSEC, but at the same time, allowing ASTEC to keep its independent perspective on the issues which it examined.</para><para>The Government has acted on Professor Stocker's recommendations in regard to the Prime Minister's high-level science, technology and engineering advisory arrangements. In so doing, the Government has sought to capitalise on the strengths, and to address the weaknesses of the former arrangements.</para><para>A new advisory body known as the Prime Minister's Science, Engineering and Innovation Council has already been established. It will supersede the former PMSEC. The new Council reinforces the vital role which the Government sees for science, technology and engineering in the creation of Australia's future. The name of the new Council also emphasises the importance which the Government places on innovation as a primary driver of industrial competitiveness.</para><para>This new arrangement has created a science, technology and engineering advisory body that is able to conduct studies as ASTEC has done in the past. But, in addition, the new advisory body has the benefit of being able to draw upon the best 
 expertise and experience available in this country, while at the same time having a mechanism that can deliver the outcomes of these studies direct to the Ministry. This is a considerable enhancement over the previous arrangements in that it does maintains the conduit for independent advice, while adding a delivery mechanism that ASTEC has never had.</para><para>The new Council will meet in full session, generally twice in a year, to discuss major issues in science, technology and engineering and their contribution to the economic and social development of Australia. It will be chaired by the Prime Minister and will include ministerial and non-ministerial members. Ministerial members will comprise Ministers for whom science, technology and engineering are particularly relevant to their portfolio responsibilities. Non-ministerial members will be drawn from key representatives of the business and scientific communities.</para><para>The non-ministerial members of the new Council will constitute a standing committee. This standing committee will oversee and contribute to studies and research to improve the understanding of Australia's science, technology and engineering capabilities and the effectiveness of their organisation and utilisation. As such, the standing committee will have similar functions and responsibilities to ASTEC. It will also have a similar capacity to ASTEC to undertake work on its own initiative, as well as work identified for it by the Government.</para><para>With this new and significantly enhanced advisory Council established, the Government is acting now to remove the largely redundant ASTEC from the statutes. In repealing the Australian Science, Technology and Engineering Council Act 1978 (the ASTEC Act), the new Council will become the Government's main independent source of advice on science, technology and engineering. The Government is therefore concerned to see that the new Council is provided with adequate resources to underpin its important advisory role. The resources which are currently allocated to ASTEC will be transferred to the new Council and its Secretariat once the ASTEC Act has been repealed.</para><para>The Government values ASTEC's current work and wishes to see it completed before the ASTEC Act is repealed. I believe that adequate provision has been made in the bill to ensure that this may be the case.</para><para>The Government also wishes to see that provisions in the ASTEC Act to protect Council members and others associated with the Council, both past and present, against actions, suits or other proceedings, are maintained.

We were going to further refine those amendments and come back with a package of amendments which would be acceptable to the government.</para></talk.start><para>In essence, the issue we were covering was that of the use of gender specific language in legislation. The committee was of a will to ensure a provision that protected against the use of gender specific language in legislation. By way of definition, we are talking about language that expresses bias in favour of one sex.</para><para>In terms of the amendments that were before the committee at the time, the opposition had amendments, as circulated, Nos 1, 3, 20, 22 and 29. I withdrew amendment No. 20 in preference for Australian Democrats amendment No. 4, so we were proceeding with amendments 1, 3, 22 and 29. The Australian Democrats were proposing amendments Nos 4 and 5, but the government had proposed a rider to those amendments which would have ensured that the provisions would not have struck out any legislative instrument proposal if there had been an inadvertent use of gender specific language. Democrat amend 
 ment No. 2 also ensured a reporting system to the parliament in cases where the principle had been transgressed.</para><para>Senator Vanstone is not present at the moment. We are waiting for her before we continue with the substantive part of the debate. I think that is a summary of where we were  yesterday afternoon. I am also informed that the Australian Democrats wish to pursue their amendment No. 3 which, from recollection, was very close to opposition amendment No. 22. I do not know whether the Australian Democrats still want to pursue that; from what I could see, there was not really much difference. There was a bit of a difference in language use but in terms of technical effect there was no difference between Democrat amendment No. 3 and opposition No. 22.</para><para>That is basically where we were yesterday afternoon when the bill was adjourned.

The parliament has grappled with a number of different mechanisms for reviewing an Attorney-General's power to issue a certificate to the 
 effect that an instrument is not legislative in character.</para><para>In the Legislative Instruments Bill 1994, the previous Labor government provided for parliamentary review and disallowance of such certificates. However, the 1994 bill did exclude judicial review, including review under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act of 1977. The  Legislative Instruments Bill 1996 [No. 2]  removes the ability of parliament to review this decision but takes a different course of action in that it provides for decisions to be reviewable under the AD(JR) Act.</para><para>The 1994 bill was actually assessed by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. That committee, the membership of which included the Attorney-General, unanimously recommended that parliamentary review should be maintained. That view was not held just by the previous government and the current Attorney-General but even most recently it was supported by some government backbenchers, including Senator O'Chee, who did so in his capacity as chair of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances.</para><para>It has to be said that the Attorney-General has never tried to justify the government's rejection of the 1994 proposal. In terms of any justification at all, he has now come up with the argument that the government rejects his and the opposition's previous position because he now regards the function as essentially judicial in nature. So we have an admin officer, the Attorney-General, claiming that a function that he is performing is essentially judicial in nature.</para><para>It has to be placed on the record that this view was rejected unanimously by the House of Representatives committee of which he was a member. It needs to be put on the record what the committee, including the Attorney, thought about this matter. In its report, the committee said in paragraph 3.13.4:</para><para>The Committee is inclined to the view that the power of the Attorney-General is administrative in character and not judicial. The Attorney-General is certifying whether an instrument is legislative, that is whether the provisions of the Act apply or not. 
 The Attorney-General is not determining an issue of law between litigants.</para><para>The committee went on, at paragraphs 3.13.5 to 3.13.8:</para><para>The Committee notes that the proposed government amendments will provide for the decisions of the Attorney-General to be made subject to disallowance by Parliament. The Committee is concerned whether this is the best form of scrutiny of these decisions. It notes that the Bill excludes review under the AD(JR) Act.</para><para>Mr Morgan told the Committee that the Attorney-General's Department expects clause 7 to be used only in a `very few cases'.</para><para>Professor Pearce—</para><para>well known to the committee process—</para><para>told the Committee that the approach proposed by the Government (to rely on Parliamentary scrutiny) is a pragmatic effort to keep the courts out of the legislative arena and has some attraction as an alternative measure to judicial intervention. Mr Morgan indicated that it was simply a means whereby the Parliament could scrutinise whether the power it gave to the Executive (the Attorney-General) was being exercised correctly. Professor Pearce agreed with this assessment.</para><para>Ms Davies told the Committee that judicial scrutiny was costly to the individual and likely to occasion considerable delay compared to the parliamentary scrutiny.</para><para>Can I emphasise that this is the argument that appeals to me most. The committee therefore agreed that the decisions of the Attorney-General under clause 7 should be subject to parliamentary scrutiny. As I say, the committee also went on to unanimously recommend that a decision by the Attorney to grant a certificate should also be reviewable under the AD(JR) Act.</para><para>So a House of Representatives committee, consisting of a number of members of all parties, including the current Attorney-General, recommended both courses of action—both parliamentary scrutiny and reviewability under the AD(JR) Act. The committee made this point by rightly pointing out the fact that the proposal to exclude judicial review under the AD(JR) Act did not exclude judicial review pursuant to the original jurisdiction of the High Court, or section 39B of the Judiciary Act.</para><para>In terms of our current position, it is this obvious anomaly as well as the working of 
 the committee that has led the Labor Party now to accept the committee's recommendations.</para><para>We have been persuaded by the committee. The government, in opposition, were persuaded by the position that we are now putting. Senator O'Chee, even recently, has still been persuaded by the position that the opposition, the Greens (WA) and Senator Colston are now putting.</para><para>It is not good enough for the Attorney-General to argue that black is white or white is black, as he seems to have done in this particular instance. We are talking here of a decision making process which has been characterised by both the current Attorney and a parliamentary committee—I think correctly—as being executive in nature. For the Attorney now to say that we are talking about a judicial function rather than an executive one, without really explaining how he has come to that conclusion and without any substantive evidence to support it, is, I think, totally unacceptable.</para><para>So the opposition is pursuing this particular amendment. We think it is a reasonable one that the government could quite reasonably accept. We hope that through the process we are involved in this morning in the Senate the government may, in fact, be persuaded by both the current and previous arguments put to this parliament.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>2817</page.no><name role="metadata">Vanstone, Sen Amanda</name><name role="display">Senator VANSTONE</name><name.id>7E4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Justice</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is a pleasure to see you in the chair, Madam Temporary Chairman.

Opposition 21 goes to clause 22 on page 53 and omits the words `or 66'.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>—Excuse me, for clarification, can you advise which amendment you are now moving?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>XE4</name.id><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name></talker><para>—I am not. I am still on the one that you called, clause 21. I think what we are concerned about here is whether a legislative instrument proposal should take into account and recognise environmental matters. In respect of this amendment, I point out that the 1966 bill does generally widen the information that must be included in a legislative instrument proposal. The legislative instrument proposal will now cover a more complete analysis of the options available to achieve the purpose underlying a legislative instrument, and it will also canvass the relative merits of alternative approaches. A LIP is required to take into account the indirect social and economic costs and benefits of a particular proposal.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The only problem with the government's proposal here is that in detailing its inclusive list of matters to be taken into account the government has deliberately excluded environmental matters. Environmental matters were in fact listed in the 1994 bill. I note that, as the government has agreed, this change does not prevent environmental concerns being considered. So we have a government which has deliberately dropped environmental matters from consideration in a legislative instrument proposal, though it has not precluded them from being taken into account.</para><para>There is no real reason given for the government's rejection of the previous government's position. As I say, the previous list included environmental matters as a matter of relevant consideration. The Attorney has now stated that under Commonwealth environmental legislation there is a detailed consultation process on proposals affecting environmental issues where costs and benefits are relevant factors. It is the view of the government that it is not necessary to duplicate those requirements. However, as the Attorney well knows—or should know—the requirements for environmental impact assessment under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act do not apply to the vast majority of legislative instruments that will come within the terms of this legislation.</para><para>So once again the Attorney is trying to gloss over the truth, trying to conceal the fact that this legislation has a broader range of 
 impact than the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act. As a consequence of the government's measure here, as a consequence of the government's omission, environmental matters will not be taken into consideration in a wide body of legislative instruments proposed by government.</para><para>So we believe it is important that these matters continue to be considered and consequently we are pursuing this amendment. It has to be put on the record that it is extremely important that the environmental effect of these instruments be considered and that they should be considered in a process which is not as rigorous as the one provided under the environment protection act, as I mentioned earlier. Clearly, if the provisions of the environment protection act are complied with, the terms of the bill will be met, but where they are not complied with this amendment by the opposition and the Greens (WA) will ensure that these considerations are taken into account.</para><para>The government has been at odds with itself in terms of trying to work out why it is opposing this provision. In the debate last time Senator Vanstone indicated, on the Attorney's behalf, that the removal of the word `environmental' would not prevent environmental considerations being taken into account but, as I said earlier, that is really not good enough.</para><para>They are some of the reasons the opposition is pursuing this amendment. It will be interesting to see why the government opposes it.

We are talking here about exemption from consultation and the extent of exemption from consultation. Amendments 15, 16 and 17 deal 
 with this principle. As I say, in moving the alternative, we are trying to meet some of the government's concerns.

At the top of page 2 we have opposition amendment No. 17, and the second item on page 3 is opposition amendment No. 16. There is a batch of other consequential amendments as well. So it does appear twice on the running sheet, and that is why I am suggesting we handle it here now.</para></talk.start></continue><para>As I was about to say, there are a number of changes between the 1994 bill and the 1996 bill on the range of matters for which consultation may be granted. The 1996 bill does not provide exemptions where, firstly, the legislative instrument is required urgently—for example, for reasons related to the prudential supervision of insurance, banking and superannuation or the regulation of financial markets; or, secondly, where there is significant or comparable public consultation on the legislation already taking place; or, thirdly, notice of the legislative instrument would give an unfair advantage to particular individuals; or, fourthly, the Attorney certifies that public consultation would not be in the public interest.</para><para>Instead, the 1996 bill does provide exemptions where, firstly, the instrument is required in the interests of national security but no process for certification by the Attorney-General is required; secondly, the instrument is an airworthiness directive; thirdly, the instrument is a commencement proclamation; fourthly, the decision maker proposes to make a 12-month temporary legislative instrument; or, finally, the regulatory review body certifies that the legislative instrument proposal is 
 adequate and otherwise waives part 3, consultation requirements, where no such consultation is required by the enabling legislation, the agreement is comparable or the costs of complying with part 3 outweigh the benefits to be obtained by the instrument.</para><para>As I said in the earlier debate, we believe that the 1996 bill is too restrictive and, in a sense, we are trying to help the government here to ensure that its objectives are met. So our amendments here modify the government's regime by accepting some of the government's changes and rejecting others.</para><para>Let me place on the record that we believe that an exemption should be available where the instrument is urgently required or where notice would give an unfair advantage to individuals. However, we believe that in those circumstances the instrument should have only a 12-month temporary operation and should be certified by the regulatory review body as being so necessary. We think that is a fair balance.</para><para>Secondly, we believe that the exemptions for significant or comparable public consultation should be retained, but that there should be a requirement that the regulatory review body certify that such consultation has indeed taken place. This provides an independent checking mechanism that will prevent over-enthusiastic departments from using this provision to get around the consultation requirement set out in the bill.</para><para>Thirdly, we believe that the public interest test should be retained, thus eliminating the need for some of the more specific exemptions. However, in our amendments we retain a number of specific exemptions such as national security and airworthiness directives. We believe that these particular areas fall within the broader public interest test, and we have specifically mentioned these to avoid any doubt in relation to these matters. We believe that the failure to state a broader public interest test could in fact prejudice matters which should be excluded from the operation of the consultation requirements but which have not been specifically listed in the bill.  </para><para>I think the Senate will be able to note that we have actually changed the form of some 
 of our amendments from that originally proposed. We still seek the same objectives, but, in doing so, I think we also take into account some of the government's wording in their proposals. Can I also say that we support the exemption of commencement proclamations.</para><para>Fifthly, given the exemptions already granted, we do not support the exemption of all 12-month temporary instruments from the operation of the consultation requirement. I must say that this may in fact be the substantive issue in dispute between us and the government. We do not believe that there should be exemption of all 12-month temporary instruments from the operation of the consultation requirement. These provisions are merely a means for the government of the day to avoid the operation of essential consultation processes, and we also believe that they can be open to abuse.</para><para>Finally, in terms of the areas before the Senate, the powers of the regulatory review body to limit the consultation requirement should, we believe, be retained, as set out in the bill.</para><para>As a result of deliberations here last time, and the considerations that we have taken since the debate here just a few months ago, we will pursue amendment 15 in precisely the same form as we proposed last time. We pursue amendment 14 in a modified form. Amendment 16 that we moved last time will not be proceeded with. We have included the old form of amendments 14 and 16 in our original list of amendments so that senators can see how they differ, but we do not intend to pursue them.</para><para>I note also that our amendment proposal should address the majority of concerns expressed by the Attorney in his speech on 17 November 1997. As I said during the debate, the only substantial area of disagreement between us now is in relation to the 12-month temporary instrument. That still stands between us for the reasons I have already stated.</para><para>Whilst I have been putting this explanation on the record, I hope that other senators have been able to work out whether we will proceed at this particular stage with 15, 16 or 17, or whether it is desired that we proceed just 
 with 17. Can I say that we are talking about exemption from the consultation process, and I believe the three amendments can be handled cognately at this stage.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>2822</page.no><name role="metadata">Vanstone, Sen Amanda</name><name role="display">Senator VANSTONE</name><name.id>7E4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Justice</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Senator Bolkus, by way of clarification, did you want to include your amendment 11 as well?

It should stay until a proper process of scrutiny is worked out between all the parties that might be a party to these agreements.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>2824</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am partly guided in this by the precedent that I have seen established in this parliament, and that is the party which represents the opposition—that has been in government previously and I guess hopes to be in government again—is very mindful of the relationships between the Commonwealth and the states and how they operate.

My first point is your argument is working on the basis that this is an appropriate mechanism. However, you are silent on the issue of when there was an intergovernmental scheme that had three or four parliaments in it and any one parliament could just pull that government out for the time being. I think it is appropriate that these sorts of schemes do have proper scrutiny. We have the states, territories and the Commonwealth working on a proper system of scrutiny that can be agreed to all around Australia.</para></talk.start><para>It is egotistical and folly in the extreme in both cases for us to proceed to set up a system without waiting for the outcome of those sensible negotiations. Every other day on the radio you will hear people saying, `Why cannot these people work together?' I am indicating that, apparently somewhere, we have officers from the states, territories and the Commonwealth working together on getting a sensible scrutiny mechanism. We are saying that, until we do have that mechanism in place, these schemes should be exempt.</para><para>We are not denying the need for scrutiny; we are at one on that. We are saying do not assume that we here in this chamber now—with all the knowledge that I am sure is here in the Democrats, in the opposition and in the government—know best. Let people have a go at working it out together sensibly, and that is what I hear from the men and women in the streets all the time.</para><para> As to your second point, which is fed by a paranoia—paranoia is seen as a negative word—or something approaching a paranoia 
 in the parties with smaller numbers that the two big parties will always get together to defeat them, you think it is only on the occasions when great principle comes into play that a major party would support other parties such as your own and defeat the government of the day in relation to one of these schemes.</para><para>I make two small points on that argument. Firstly, the principle is principle—whether it is great or small does not matter. The principle is what distinguishes it from a mere viewpoint. Secondly, you have over there the former Labor government that said, `We would never sell the Commonwealth Bank.' They got into government and did. They said, `We won't sell the rest of it,' but then, after an election, came back and sold the rest of it. What else did they sell?  Australian National Line and Qantas. Privatisation was in principle a bad thing before an election and in principle a good thing after an election. When they were in government, their practice was it was a good thing. Now they are in opposition, for no other reason than political opportunism, it is seen as a bad thing.</para><para>While I disagree with the Democrats' general views on contracting out and privatisation, at least you are consistent. They are not. I have given you one classic example of where you cannot say where those opposite stand—a classic example of where political opportunism will be taken by them and used. Frankly, I do not see that you can say that the experience of government will encourage the Labor opposition as it now stands to vote according to principle in any way at all.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>2825</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Minister, as you know in debates, sometimes your best points are made by the other side. I think you have made the point that, quite frequently, governments and oppositions vote together on issues in which they have agreement, such as the sale of the Commonwealth Bank. Whilst we disagree, that is a fact and that is the precedent.</para></talk.start><para>I have a second question for the minister: is it your view that, when you sit with the states government as the Commonwealth government, you sit as equals or that you sit as the pre-eminent parliament and the pre- 
 eminent government of this country?  The country is not run by the states; the country is run by the Commonwealth government. This is not a parliament which is acting just as one of nine; this is a parliament with a particular constitutional weight and authority, and acts accordingly.</para><para>I would also point out that it is open to any parliament to pass similar amendments to the ones which we are passing, which would give that parliament the power to withdraw from such a scheme. So it is not necessarily just in your hands.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>2826</page.no><name role="metadata">Vanstone, Sen Amanda</name><name role="display">Senator VANSTONE</name><name.id>7E4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Justice</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Very simply, Senator Murray, of course all senators would say this is the pre-eminent chamber in the pre-eminent parliament. I suppose the members of the House of Representatives, who have all got batons in their back pockets thinking one day they will be prime minister, would say that the House of Representatives is the pre-eminent house in the pre-eminent parliament. But to specifically answer your question, it depends on what the scheme is. If it is a scheme where the constitutional power lies entirely with the states and the Commonwealth is there by virtue of using its spending power to be a part of that scheme, I think it would be somewhat audacious for the Commonwealth to regard itself as being the superior member of such a scheme. It depends on what the scheme is. Everybody has their place and moment in the sun. We can all kid ourselves that we are the pre-eminent parliament or the pre-eminent chamber, but everybody has their place.</para></talk.start><para>Amendment agreed to.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN (Senator Crowley)</name></talker><para>—We now move on to opposition amendment No. 28.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>2826</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Can I suggest we defer consideration of this amendment.

We have consistently said throughout the series of debates on the Legislative Instruments Bill that we congratulate the government on bringing this bill forward. We have consistently said that in most of its parts it is a real advance in the legislative armoury that the government and the parliament provide themselves. We have made the analogy before that for us it is like a good athlete with a hole in the heart. The danger we see is that the sunset provisions, with which we agree, could result in throwing good regulations out with the bad.</para><para>We said in our negotiations with the government—and I will repeat my remarks of yesterday; I thank both the Minister for Justice and the Attorney-General for the manner in which they tried to approach discussions on this, but we could not agree—that we believe that it is the place of parliament to have the opportunity to reject the intention of government to sunset a particular regulation. All regulations of this type are delegated. They are powers delegated by the parliament to the executive. The parliament that gives can take away. Our view is that either house of parliament should have the opportunity to recommend that, in any particular list proposing sunset legislative instruments, say, one or two should not be done away with or alternatively should be remade.</para><para>That retains the authority and responsibility of parliament. It is an issue we all understand. It is not a difficult issue to understand, but it is the most fundamental  principle of democracy—that is, that the representatives of the people have the power to deal with legislation 
 of both the primary kind and the delegated kind.</para><para>This process would add a further burden on both houses. We would need to provide the relevant committee—probably the Regulations and Ordinances Committee—with the resources to deal with the lists that come before them. My experience as an observer of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee both past and present is that they are a non-partisan, very effective and very professional body, well serviced by the secretariat they enjoy.</para><para>We have tried to develop here a process whereby this could be undertaken. We are aware of the government's need for speed of response and we have therefore given a time frame of six months within which matters can be considered. In the event of a resolution of either house of parliament that a legislative instrument is kept alive, it would be kept alive for a further five years until the sunset provision comes up again.</para><para>As I see it, it would happen as follows. A list of 100 legislative instruments would come to either house of parliament, the appropriate committee would look at it and they would recommend that three should be retained or remade and the appropriate house would pass the appropriate resolution. The government might disagree with one or two of those resolutions, in which case they would then bring a repealing motion before the house and that would be decided upon.</para><para>We think it is a perfectly reasonable approach. It retains the government's ability to review the list. It retains the government's ability to get rid of old, outdated and unnecessary regulations but it also retains the parliament's right to have an overview and reflect on the powers and activities of the executive of the day. Quite frankly, if this got up and per chance you are not the government next time or the time after you might welcome the fact that this sort of provision was retained in the legislation.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>2827</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We have had the debate on this before.

The government, as part of its proposals for public sector reform, is also seeking to exclude various legislative instruments relating to public sector terms and conditions from amongst those instruments which are disallowable. Those instruments are currently disallowable. The government knows that its reforms are not acceptable to the Senate. They know that because the 
 Senate has twice rejected the Public Service Bill 1997. They know that they are not acceptable to the Senate because those Public Service reforms, euphemistically known as structural changes in the workplace, mean nothing other than reduction of terms and conditions for the Australian public sector.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I will digress for a moment. In the wash up after the budget this week, we had both domestic and international commentators talking about the need for structural reforms in the workplace. I say to them, whether they are domestic or representatives of Zurich Insurance—and David Hale finds himself on Australian television often these days—`Why don't you just come clean and tell the people what you are talking about? When you talk about structural reforms in the workplace you are talking about reduction in wages and conditions. You are talking about, at the least, reduction of protection in terms and conditions of employment. That is what you are talking about. That is what this government is on about.</para><para>If the government wants a workplace like they have in the United States where people have to rely on tips, by way of charity, to ensure that they have accommodation and food to sustain themselves and their families, why isn't it brave enough and honest enough to say so? Sitting in Zegna suits on international television telling Australian workers that they do not need protection against avaricious employers and business is a bit rich for me. This is what this part of the legislation is about. It is about ensuring that government can remove terms and conditions of employment, and remove them in a non-accountable way.</para><para>If you want to make this legislation a trigger for a double dissolution, then the focus of that trigger will not be the legislative instruments proposals and all the technical details we have spent canvassing this morning and yesterday; it will be the public sector. Our message to the public sector will be: this legislation takes away reviewability and the Senate's capacity to protect you against governments removing your terms and conditions. That is the message from this legislation. If you are going to be foolhardy enough 
 in your ideological zealotry to go out there and use this as a trigger for a double dissolution, we will make sure that the public sector knows that this bill, together with the Public Service Bill 1997, is geared towards removing their protection against government unlawful and unfair interference with well and long fought for terms and conditions of employment.</para><para>We say to the government: if you want to reform the public sector, if you want to reform the public sector terms and conditions of employment, do it honestly and do it through the Public Service Bill. We will not let you do it through this particular piece of legislation. We will not let you change legislation to an extent that the Senate's role is removed from the process. Until such time as the Public Service Act is changed, then arrangements relating to disallowance of instruments arising under it should not be changed either. That is the basic position here.</para><para>As I said, it is incredible that the government is pursuing a non-negotiation approach in this legislation and pursuing it to the extent that it may be used as a trigger for a double dissolution. But in the circumstances that it may—maybe the government does want a double dissolution—I point out to other government senators who may be listening from their offices that some of them should enjoy those offices for the moment because a good half a dozen at least will not be back here. If the government does embark upon a double dissolution, then the likelihood, in fact the probability, is that six or seven of government backbenchers and maybe the odd frontbencher will not see themselves back in this place.</para><para> With the Prime Minister's hell-bent intention of using Wik and other legislation as a trigger for a double dissolution, you have to ask yourselves: what is the rationale? What is the prospect of a conservative government, for instance, with a reduction of numbers in the Senate being able to get through legislation that it wants to not only during the next three years if it is successful but also at a joint sitting? That is the other point that needs to be taken into account by governments that 
 want to pursue a double dissolution at the moment. The way the polls are, what is most likely is a very close result. To actually get a majority in a joint sitting, this government would need to get a majority of at least seven or eight, if not 10, in the House of Representatives. The likelihood of that happening, according to the polls at the moment, is not all that strong.</para><para> I say to anyone who might be listening, and I hope this message does get through to Senator Vanstone at least: this legislation should not be used as a trigger for a double dissolution. The government should be showing some flexibility here. We are on this side. We are not pursuing quite a number of our amendments, but an amendment we will pursue is one that protects the wages and conditions of the public sector.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>—The question is that opposition amendments 30, 32 and 33 be agreed to.</para></talk.start><para>Amendments agreed to.</para></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>—We now move to clause 52 and Democrats' amendment No. 6.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>2829</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I withdraw amendment No. 6 on revised sheet 968.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>—Would you care to move amendments 7 and 8, Senator Murray?</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>2829</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I move:</para></talk.start><para>(7)	 Clause 66, page 70 (line 6), omit "that gives", substitute "the sole or principal purpose of which is to give".</para><para>(8)	 Clause 66, page 70 (line 8), omit "that confers", substitute "the sole or principal purpose of which is to confer".</para><para>These two amendments refer to clause 66 on page 70 and relate to the sunsetting recommendations.

It includes the introduction of the new government dissavings rebate scheme, together with the major proposed change to the superannuation system, known as the `choice regime'. This debate takes place against the background of the so-called tax reform debate taking place in Australia at the moment. I say `so-called' because there is no debate really taking place and that is for the reason that the government—specifically the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, and the Treasurer, Mr Costello—refuse to participate in a debate.</para></talk.start><para>It is a fair question as to why the government will not come clean on this issue. Why has the promised discussion paper on the taxation of trusts been suppressed, for example? Is it because so many coalition frontbenchers—19 in all—have trusts, the most notorious being the trust arrangements of Senator Parer? Is it because so many coalition backbenchers have trusts and this government is more interested in protecting the financial 
 interests of its members—exemplified by Senator Parer—than it is about doing something effective about tax avoidance in this area?</para><para>We have the ludicrous situation where these two leaders of the government—the Prime Minister and the Treasurer—are constantly denigrating Australia's tax system generally through false claims and wild exaggerations of the scale of particular problems, yet they absolutely refuse to tell us what they are planning to do. There is no doubt there is an electoral ambush in the making.</para><para>What they are engaged in is a concerted effort to falsely worry Australian business people and families into thinking that the Australian taxation system is broken. We know, and we have certainly argued, that that is patently untrue. The truth of the matter is that the tax system is in very much better shape than it was when Labor came into power in the early 1980s. Then it was fair to say that the tax system really was broken, and it was broken because of the negligent stewardship of the then Treasurer, the current Prime Minister. It was broken because paying tax was made optional for those with access to specialist taxation advice. The then Treasurer, Mr Howard, refused to act for years on the taxation advice provided by Taxation Commissioner O'Reilly. He was deliberately protecting a small minority of the community, as is demonstrated by the protection and total support he has now given to Senator Parer.</para><para>Looking at the specific provisions of the bill, I wish to focus on superannuation choice provisions, the savings rebate provisions, dividend streaming and the changes to private company shareholder loans. Schedule 5 of the bill implements the government's policy on choice of superannuation fund. The introduction of this policy is arguably one of the most significant changes to superannuation since Labor introduced the superannuation guarantee in 1992 and will change the entire nature of the superannuation industry.</para><para>Public debate on choice of superannuation funds has highlighted the unsatisfactory attempts by other countries to introduce choice of superannuation fund, particularly the United Kingdom and Chile, and the impact 
 which the failure of choice of fund has had on the retirement incomes of people in those countries. In the United Kingdom, for example, some 570,000 people were sold inappropriate retirement income products as a result of the introduction of the Thatcher government's superannuation choice model, which this government has adopted. The compensation bill for those people is currently $10 billion and climbing. If that were to happen in Australia, it would be the end of superannuation.</para><para>What those experiences of other countries suggest is that any choice of fund proposal should be carefully scrutinised by the parliament before it is introduced. To that end, Labor supports a Senate inquiry into the choice of fund, with Labor and Democrat senators recommending that the government's bill not be passed without substantial amendment. The government has got it wrong on the choice of fund issue.</para><para>The government claims that its choice model will benefit consumers through increased competition in the superannuation industry, leading to lower fees and charges and thus resulting in better retirement incomes. However, the evidence suggests otherwise. A recent survey of 354 superannuation funds by Sedgwick Noble Lowndes reported that the government's choice of fund model will lead to increased costs to fund members. The survey stated that 87 per cent of funds believe that choice of fund will increase fund administration costs, with the cost increasing by some 10 per cent.</para><para>Alarmingly, around 10 per cent of the funds surveyed believed that costs would increase by up to 50 per cent. A cost increase of that order would have a disastrous effect on the retirement incomes of thousands of Australians. And that is before anyone has even made a choice of fund that could see uninformed people end up in inappropriate funds with high fees and charges and comparatively low returns.</para><para>In addition, the government's choice of fund proposal is certain to disadvantage employers through increased administrative costs of up to $21 million initially and recurrent costs of up to $15 million per year. 
 These figures are provided by the government in the explanatory memorandum to the bill that introduces its choice model—the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 7) 1997.</para><para>There is also a strong likelihood that employers may be legally liable under its choice model in a number of ways, despite attempts to legislate away employers' potential legal liability in clause 32V of the same bill. The Senate Select Committee on Superannuation received evidence suggesting that it is impossible to legislate away the common law duty of care that employers must exercise towards their employees. Higher fees and charges and uninformed choices will result in lower returns to fund members and lower retirement income to Australians, which is inconsistent with broader retirement income policy.</para><para>Unfortunately, time does not allow me to further highlight the failures of the government's choice model, but I am sure that other speakers on my side of the parliament will do that.	Needless to say, I will pursue this matter in more detail in the committee stage of this debate.</para><para>I now turn to Labor's model. Labor believes we need a phased two-stage model which educates employers and employees about investment options and offers genuine employee choice. Stage 1 would be investment choice. Stage 1 requires superannuation funds with more than 50 fund members to offer a minimum of three investment choice options to fund members—that is, choice within existing funds. It would not be compulsory for members in a fund to exercise an investment choice if they chose not to do so, but a default fund arrangement could apply based on age-risk profiles. Due to their unique nature, defined benefit funds would be exempt from having to offer investment choice.</para><para>We recommend member investment choice as a first step forward for several reasons. Firstly, the option for funds to offer choice of investment already exists. It is set out in subsection 52(4) of the SIS Act. Secondly, investment choice within funds is a good way to begin to educate fund members about their retirement income options and control of their superannuation savings.</para><para>Thirdly, investment choice provides real options for choice as opposed to the government's model which could see consumers faced with identical choice options, just from different service providers. The clear example here is that we now have three commercial television channels in Australia. I remember when we had only two. We thought the addition of a third one would offer more choice. We have a third commercial television channel, but the programs are essentially all the same. Finally, an added feature of investment choice is a default investment option based on age-risk profiles. This would ensure that fund members do not find themselves in inappropriate investment products which are not suitable to maximising fund members' final retirement income.</para><para>Stage 2 of Labor's proposal concerns genuine employee choice of fund. Stage 2 of our proposal offers choice to those who should exercise it—employees. It would begin only after an extensive education and consumer protection campaign. I will now outline the key features of our genuine employee choice model. If an industrial award requires an employer to pay superannuation contributions to a specified superannuation fund on behalf of an employee, employees can nominate and, if employers agree, have superannuation contributions paid into a complying fund other than that set out in an industrial award. The nomination must be made in writing and must be signed by the employee. Employers and employees who negotiate a certified agreement or an Australian workplace agreement would be taken to have exercised choice.</para><para>Regulations would be drafted governing standard disclosure provisions applying to key feature statements offered by funds directly to employees, particularly to enable simple comparison of fees, charges and fund earnings—a most important issue. In the event of a dispute between employer and employee, the Industrial Relations Commission would act as the independent arbitrator. Finally, where a workplace is not covered by an industrial award or agreement, the default fund would be that to which the majority of employees at that workplace belong. In the 
 event of a new business which is not covered by an industrial award or agreement, the fund specified in the designated award would apply.</para><para>Labor believes that this offers genuine choice of fund to employees. It more accurately reflects the demand for choice of superannuation fund from workers, rather than choice driven by government or by vested interests. It is simple to administer and avoids the complications of the government's model. It is broadly consistent with the choice of fund models which presently operate in the New South Wales and Queensland state jurisdictions, therefore leading to less confusion and creating greater national consistency between state and federal choice of fund models.</para><para>Employers and employees would have the protection of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission in settling disputes. It limits employer liability compared with what the government is putting forward, it would avoid the default fund problems that the government model has, and it would also avoid some of the transitional problems in the two models that the government's bill contains.</para><para>If unsuccessful, Labor proposes to move a range of amendments on the choice legislation in the Senate. Briefly, they include: exemption of funds which already offer member investment choice within funds; excision of clause 32U, which overrides federal award provisions and inclusion of award contributions; an intention to ban or severely limit the sale of products where a financial adviser derives income through the use of trailing commissions—this was a major problem with the UK choice fiasco; minimum standards for default funds, including insurance and investment options based on age-risk profiles; a redefinition of industry based funds to exclude funds with high fees and charges; inclusion of third-line forcing provisions which prevent employers from gaining a financial benefit at the expense of their employees; and an amendment which may require funds to be year 2000 compliant before they can accept superannuation guarantee contributions under the new choice arrangements.  </para><para>Labor's amendments will make the bill much fairer and simpler to administer, while still allowing employees the opportunity to choose a superannuation fund, not have one forced on them unnecessarily by their employer.</para><para>Turning now to the other provisions of the bill, schedule 8 deals with the problem of dividend streaming. Dividend streaming, in its simplest form, is where a company streams franked dividends to its shareholders who are best placed to take advantage of the attached franking rebate and hence minimise tax. More likely than not, such shareholders are Australian residents, as foreign shareholders or exempt bodies either have no use for or can make no use of the attached franking rebates. Hence a foreign shareholder may be paid unfranked dividends and Australian residents a disproportionate amount of franked dividends in order to maximise the tax advantage which franked dividends provide.</para><para>This schedule will introduce general anti-avoidance rules to such schemes that are used to obtain a tax advantage in relation to the imputation credits. These general anti-avoidance rules will supplement the specific provisions for anti-streaming and the announced but as yet not introduced provisions aimed at countering trading in imputation credits. The opposition supports these changes.</para><para>One would hope that these changes will also put an end to the blatant dividend streaming arrangements entered into, supervised and implemented, for example, in the tax dodging case of Senator Parer. As we know, Senator Parer has a dividend streaming arrangement through the AQRM trust which holds one H class share in Senator Parer's coal company QCMM Pty Ltd. From the writ lodged by Senator Parer's former business associate, Mr Adams, we know that the AQRM trust was established for the sole purpose of creating a pool of fully franked dividends from which bonuses to key directors and employees would be paid. Given that Senator Parer was Chairman of QCMM Pty Ltd, one would safely assume that he was a beneficiary of this blatant dividend streaming arrangement.  </para><para>As we know, Senator Parer has a penchant for tax avoidance schemes, having participated in no less than three of them, including the AQRM dividend streaming trust. I would therefore ask the minister—he is not in the chamber at the moment, but when he does appear—whether he can advise on the status of Senator Parer's dividend streaming arrangements facilitated by the AQRM trust under these amendments, and whether or not it will become void. If he cannot answer that question in his second reading speech, then I put the minister on notice that we will have a very long and interesting committee stage of this debate.</para><para>Schedule 9 of the bill seeks to ensure that all forms of advances by way of loans or other credits made by private companies to shareholders are treated as assessable dividends to the extent that such payments are made out of company profits in the form of tax-free distributions. This has been a fairly common practice in order to disguise the real form of the payments being made so as to avoid tax.</para><para>Evidence before the Senate Economics Legislation Committee from the Australian Taxation Office was such that the current section 108 of the tax act has been shown to be ineffective due to relevant AAT and subsequent court cases. Consequently, a tightening up of the provisions is called for. The Labor opposition supports these changes and notes the plethora of amendments the government has subsequently introduced to clean up its original farcical drafting, which included payments such as SGC obligations under the original definition of benefit and hence were deemed to be dividends and therefore taxable.</para><para>Once again, this amendment strikes right at the heart, one would hope, of another tax avoidance scheme, no doubt masterminded and implemented in the form of Senator Parer's schemes. It is becoming a sad state of affairs, but Senator Parer seems totally unable to keep his hands out of the public till.

Once again, the writ lodged by Mr Adams is very illuminating about the operation of this scheme.

Notional dividends declared on shares that have not yet been issued but are disguised as non-taxable loans. And who has their hands in that arrangement? That is Senator Parer.</para><para>I am also concerned that during the committee hearings into this bill, I asked the Australian Taxation Office specifically how it could be possible to declare notional dividends on shares that do not exist and then to show them as loans in company accounts. The ATO's response was that they did not understand the concept of what notional dividends were. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>2835</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Before I commence my remarks on this bill and in accordance with standing orders, I declare the potential for an interest in this matter since I am a trustee of a family trust.</para></talk.start><para>The Australian Democrats are very mindful that this bill contains a number of important, if unrelated, measures—it is really an omnibus bill. Most of these measures flow from the 1997 budget and are, therefore, way overdue for consideration—indeed, the savings tax rebate was the centrepiece of the government's 1997 budget announcements.</para><para>The Australian Democrats acknowledge that—everything else being equal—there is virtue in moving towards budget balance and 
 a moderate surplus. But surpluses are only warranted if they are achieved without causing hardship in the community. And hardship has been the cost of the deregulatory policies and the economic rationalist policies of both treasurers Keating and Costello, particularly from the cost-cutting policies of the current government.</para><para>We believe the increasing division of Australian society under these policies is ripping the fabric of Australian society. Governments are not just here to provide a level playing field for business. In a liberal democratic society—and that is a small `l'- governments have roles in nation building, in supporting the development of a sense of community, and in providing the forms which give effect to cultural and social development and national self-definition. Governments also have a responsibility to provide services and to ensure that we provide opportunities and support for those in difficulties, whilst improving our standard of living and our national wealth.</para><para>A different route is required to achieve budget balance and surplus. Rather than slashing expenditure, the aim of balancing the budget can be achieved—in part—by closing tax loopholes and by eliminating other measures which reduce revenue without serving worthwhile social or industry development goals. We need to bear in mind that Australia can cope with additional taxes, as it is one of the lowest taxing countries in the OECD. Against that background, several of the measures in the bill are laudable, and the Democrats will not impede their signing into law.</para><para>However, the bill, as submitted into the House of Representatives, was sloppy in many respects. The government conceded this in developing its 83 amendments, which have now been incorporated into the revised bill. But problems remain, and while we will be moving amendments to address some of these, we consider it the responsibility of the government—not our own—to fix most of the glitches.  </para><para>I have to say, too, that the government has been its own enemy with regard to this bill. It is the government which determines its 
 legislative program and the government had strongly stated that it intended to deal with the bill last year and, then, well prior to Easter. On this basis the Australian Democrats agreed to the rapid consideration of this bill by the Senate Economics Legislation Committee, and to an early reporting date. Mr Chairman, you were intimately involved in this matter and you suffered some stress as a result.</para><para>In the event, the bill has not been considered until now. The rushed reporting date meant that the committee had totally inadequate time to deal with a number of very complex, detailed and important tax issues. We had the farcical situation of witnesses before the committee hearing being unable to discuss the bill confidently, since they had not had time to assess whether the government's 83 amendments to the bill had met their concerns. The other consequence of misleading the Senate and senators as to the timing of bringing on of the bill is to make us less inclined to believe the government again, and that is regrettable.</para><para>The Australian Democrats again place on record our objection to the government's practice of squeezing the legitimate deliberations of committees to meet unrealistic projections for Senate consideration of government legislation. It is not the government's practice with regard to every bill, but in a number of bills recently it has been the case, and it is to be deeply regretted.</para><para>I now want to deal with the substantial elements of the bill. One of the major elements is superannuation and the choice that exists within superannuation. I will leave that area to my colleague, Senator Allison, who will speak separately on that matter.</para><para>Turning to the remainder of the bill, I will address, firstly, the payment of reportable payment systems, known as RPSs; prescribed payment systems, known as PPSs; and pay-as-you-earn deductions, known as PAYEs. In general, we have no problem with the schedule, which allows for the more efficient payment of these deductions, reducing considerably the		expenses of the Australian Taxation Office.</para><para>We do, however, question whether it is reasonable to make it effectively	compulsory for large remitters to do so electronically rather than by otherwise valid forms of payment. It is clear that the Taxation Office has	an interest in encouraging remitters to do so electronically. However, a penalty of $500 each time for not using electronic means can come to an annual penalty of $26,000.</para><para>The Australian Democrats will consider whether the Australian Taxation Office should be obliged not to apply the $500 penalty without consideration of individual	circumstances and to discuss with individual remitters their particular situations and their abilities to remit cheaply in this way. We also suggest that the government—or the next government—re-assess this measure after a year of operation and consider whether there should be any amendment.</para><para>In terms of the franking of dividends and other distributions, considerable concern was raised in the Senate hearings about these provisions. A principal criticism is that the test for catching an action is that gaining a franking credit benefit is `an other than incidental' rather than `a dominant' purpose. Several witnesses expressed concern that this would catch franking arrangements which are otherwise legitimate in their intent and operation. Witnesses also criticised the lack of a definition of `dividend streaming' and its retrospectivity.</para><para>The Australian Democrats consider there may be problems with the drafting of this schedule. However, within the limitations of the committee considerations, we had inadequate time to explore the provisions and to refine improvements. In any case, we consider that it is the responsibility of the government with its extensive executive resources to ensure that the drafting of a bill is satisfactory. This schedule is one which could be flagged for reconsideration when there is the inevitable rewrite of taxation law next year following the election. Having said this, the Australian Democrats support the intention of this schedule to minimise taxation loss in this area and will not oppose its passage through the Senate. Distributions from private companies are dealt with in  schedule 9. What a 
 mess that has been. Again, there were major drafting problems with this schedule. While it is essential that a democratic state have community watchdogs out there who help us by alerting us to the dangers of any particular legislation, we should not need to rely on them as much as we were forced to here. Fortunately, those watchdogs did growl loudly. It also suggests that the Australian Taxation Office or the Treasury—or both—may need to review their consultation processes and listen more carefully to the concerns raised by special groups in the industry before submitting legislation.</para><para>To the government's credit, though, they did change their own legislation with a truckload of amendments and they did respond to well expressed community concern. And we thank them for that. In large measure, concerns with the schedule seem to have been addressed as a consequence but, in the Senate committee, witnesses indicated that there some outstanding technical problems. Again, we consider that it is for the government to address these problems rather than for non-government parties to be devoting their limited resources to trying to do so. The schedule is nonetheless very important in clawing back an estimated $110 million over three years in what the Treasurer (Mr Costello) likes to refer to as tax rorts.</para><para>There is one important area we do want to address, and that is in relation to employee share ownership schemes. The Democrats, as the Senate knows—and many senators agree with us on this—are great supporters of employee share ownership schemes and would like to see as many employees as possible participating in the enterprises which they work for. 	The coalition's 1996 pre-election policy on employee share ownership plans emphasised the importance of such plans improving national savings. The coalition promised to widen the taxation incentives for employee share ownership plans. We will be moving to ensure that such plans are indeed not caught up by this schedule and continue to be given preferential treatment.</para><para>Finally, I will speak to the last schedule of this bill, which relates to the savings rebate. We recognise that this was a key feature of 
 the 1997 budget. The Australian Democrats support measures to increase Australian private savings as a means of reducing overseas borrowing requirements, as a means of financing Australian business development, and as a means of advancing Australia's national wealth. To this end, the rapid growth of Australian superannuation funds to $326 billion is extremely pleasing—and we believe that the Labor government that preceded the present government should take credit for much of that effort. I should say though that the Democrats would discourage the investment of too much of those funds overseas, because that does not necessarily benefit Australia as much as it otherwise could.</para><para>The current amount invested overseas is $52 billion—or some 16 per cent. I recognise it is a moot point as to how much is how much, but it is an area on which we are alert to dangers. Unfortunately, we believe that the savings rebate will not achieve that aim of increasing savings. Let us be honest. Since last year's budget the measure has not had a happy stay in the anteroom of the parliamentary doctor. We had the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) renouncing his personal claim to the rebate pretty well immediately—which was not exactly a clever way to say that he thought it was a good idea—before it became clear that the rebate would be provided automatically by the Australian Taxation Office. That also indicated that it was a fruitless gesture. But, worse, we had Treasury revealing that the rebate would actually reduce net national savings.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">SHERRY</name><name role="display">Senator Sherry</name></talker><para>—`A big risk', in Mr Evans's words.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3M6</name.id><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name></talker><para>—Yes. It is that which is the fatal problem with this schedule. The reason that it reduces net savings is that it will not adequately change individual investor behaviour. High income earners will be rewarded for doing what they are already doing. The wealthy do not need encouragement to save. Regrettably, low income workers will be limited in their ability to take advantage of the measure because their incomes are already committed to the day-to-day expenditures which keep a roof over their heads and food on the table. If you want the 
 lower income members of our society to save, you need to progress policies which actually advance their standard of living, advance their income, and allow them to become more productive members of the community. But it is those who are better off in society that we must look to at present for savings.</para></talk.start></continue><para>With three to four per cent for cash interest rates, the taxpayer needs to have $75,000 to $100,000 in bank savings to earn the top rebate. The rebate in this case is capped at too high a level, in our view. The reward for superannuation is more easily achieved, as only $3,000 is required to achieve the same maximum benefit of $450.</para><para>This bill moves the rebate part of the way in the right direction. It should be targeted towards medium-term and long-term savings. One of the most important initiatives governments have taken over the last decade is to address the issues of lengthening life expectancies, consequent longer periods spent in retirement, and the projected increase in the ratio of those who are retired to those still in the work force. We have had to find ways to support people in providing for themselves in their retirement so they can retain a decent lifestyle when it will be impossible for the state to provide adequate pensions from year to year revenue. Both the preceding government and this government have been alert to that problem.</para><para>With this in mind, the Australian Council of Social Service, known as ACOSS, suggested four principles for making the rebate more effective and equitable. Firstly, the rebate should be restricted to long-term financial savings such as those through superannuation and financial institution accounts maintained for at least five years. Secondly, the rebate should be linked to contributions and deposits rather than interest so as to make savings of smaller amounts worthwhile. Thirdly, the rebate should be added to the account rather than paid to the taxpayer directly. Fourthly, the rebate should extend to compulsory superannuation so that low and middle income wage earners can significantly benefit or, at the very least, be restricted to longer term financial savings other than superannuation and to be strictly income tested.</para><para>The Australian Democrats, before the 1996 election, said that the savings rebate should be targeted towards longer term savings and be means tested. The coalition has changed its own pre-election views on the savings initiative. Specifically, it has changed from a concessional tax rate to a rebate. But, more importantly, the coalition government has removed the income threshold at the same time as scrapping the superannuation employer contributions. The income threshold is vital if we are to achieve equity in the taxation system, for this is a very expensive measure, and it is a very expensive measure which will result—to repeat what I said earlier—in a net reduction in savings.</para><para>Last year's budget projected losses in revenue of $350 million, then of $1.4 billion and a massive $2 billion over the next three financial years—totalling nearly $4 billion. It makes little sense to be enacting this measure so shortly before an election for which the central issue, the government tells us, will be taxation reform. Two billion dollars per year of rebates is a significant mass in the overall scheme of taxation revenues. Certainly, such an ad hoc measure would be reshaped within a sensible, comprehensive overhaul of the Australian taxation system.</para><para>The Australian Democrats, therefore, suggest that this close to an election the measure should be delayed until savings measures have been comprehensively debated within the broader context of producing an equitable, effective tax system which advances national wealth. I suspect the government might prefer to do this as well, and I would be surprised if their tax reform committee is not looking at this very issue. Nevertheless, if the government does proceed with this measure so as to keep its commitments from before the election and the last budget, we will move an amendment. Consistent with the government's 1996 pre-election commitment, we will move to phase out the rebate between $35,000 and $39,000.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>2838</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—<inline ref="r421">Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1998</inline>  that the Senate is considering deals with a range of very important provisions. The issue that I intend to make a contribution 
 on today relates to the so-called introduction of choice of superannuation products. There are a range of other matters relating, for example, to the rebate. I have made a contribution on previous occasions on that issue. There are a range of other pieces of legislation with respect to superannuation choice in the industrial relations area and the public sector area, and I will make a contribution when that legislation comes before the Senate.</para></talk.start><para>Firstly, let me give a brief overview of current superannuation arrangements in Australia. Superannuation has been compulsory for employees in Australia since the introduction of the superannuation guarantee charge by the then Keating Labor government. At the time, it was controversial, but it is now hailed as a universally necessary measure in order to boost both national savings and individual retirement incomes. It is currently six per cent of wages, rising to nine per cent by the year 2001-02.</para><para>These contributions are made by the employer, but they are moneys that belong to the employee and, in part, they are superannuation contributions in lieu of a wage increase. These funds are administered by the private sector, and they are administered and managed, in the main, by independent, non-profit trusts, either through a company or industry fund structure. In both these cases, there are joint employer and employee trustees. The trustees, who exercise management decisions, tender in a competitive way for the administration, investment and insurance products for the funds that they manage. Trustees, using their economy of scale, bargain very successfully on behalf of their individual members. They are cost efficient, reliable and safe, and enjoy a good long-term average return.</para><para>Another product in the superannuation market is personal superannuation. It is often sold by agents. We have also recently had the entry of banks into the superannuation market with retirement savings accounts, commonly known as RSAs. In respect of personal superannuation products they have often been criticised, I think justifiably, for their high administrative charges. In respect to RSAs, they are certainly delivered at a reasonable 
 cost in terms of administration, but they are a low return product.</para><para>What does superannuation choice mean? If we look at the second reading speech of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister, Mr Miles, it is interesting to note, initially, that the government's explanation for superannuation choice is only five paragraphs long. This is interesting because the measure we are considering is one of the most radical and far-reaching changes that will affect millions of Australians. It will have a very significant implication. I find it disturbing that there is only a five-paragraph contribution in the second reading speech on this issue.</para><para>What does superannuation choice mean in reality? In reality, it is the deregulation of the retail market for superannuation in this country where the employer agrees. The effective choice is largely left to the employer.	That is a significant change to the government's original budget announcement. The Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp, made significant changes to effectively give the employer the right of veto over the choice made by employees. The Assistant Treasurer refers to the changes as `enhancements'. Effectively, it was a backdown in the face of employer pressure to ensure that the employer had the right of veto.</para><para>We are not considering legislation that gives the employee the right of choice. But, in reality, what does choice mean? Effectively, as I have said, it is the deregulation of the retail end of the market. Before I make some comments about the implications of that, I should emphasise that there is a form of choice in respect of the superannuation market at the present time. There is choice of investment within a significant number of superannuation funds that currently exist. In many of the funds that offer the product, a member can indicate the sort of investment area they want their moneys invested in. That is a feature that is emerging more and more in the range of superannuation funds that exist in this country.</para><para>It is also interesting that this government has identified choice as an issue since the advent of the superannuation guarantee and of industry superannuation funds. It is interesting 
 to note that it never regarded choice as an issue when superannuation was confined to a minority of the work force in this country and confined, largely, to in-house employer funds.</para><para>I would like to make a few comments about the theory of competition. Assurances are given in Mr Miles's speech and by Senator Kemp and others. Mr Miles said:</para><para>The choice of fund arrangements are designed to give employees greater choice and control over their superannuation savings, which in turn give them greater sense of ownership of these savings. The arrangements will increase competition and efficiency in the superannuation industry, leading to improved returns on superannuation savings.</para><para>Let me emphasise that last sentence again:</para><para>The arrangements will increase competition and efficiency in the superannuation industry, leading to improved returns on superannuation savings.</para><para>That is the claim by the government. Let me deal with the theory of competition, because it is very important when considering the issue of choice. The theory of competition relies on a number of important criteria. The two relevant criteria here are, firstly, that superannuation should be delivered by a significant number of players. We should not have an oligopoly or a monopoly; there should be a considerable range of products from which to make a choice. That criterion certainly exists in the superannuation industry.</para><para>The second important criterion for competition is product knowledge and understanding. This will be very important in respect of the individual Australians, the individual consumers, who will be compulsorily required to make a choice as a consequence of this legislation.</para><para>I am very sceptical. In fact, I am sure that there is a very limited product knowledge held by the millions of Australian consumers who will be required to make this choice. Interestingly, at the hearings before the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, there was considerable evidence about the lack of knowledge of Australian consumers in this area.</para><para>I note that Mr Ken Lockery, who is the principal of Towers Perrin, noted that the majority of employees in large employer based or industry funds would not receive any 
 benefit and that they might, instead, suffer a net economic loss as a result of the introduction of choice, simply because their individual knowledge of making a choice about a superannuation product is very limited and, in many cases, non-existent.</para><para>If there is to be a choice, it is important that it is an informed choice. The Australian consumer should be able to sit down and make a valid comparison between various superannuation products and the costs and returns associated with the range of products on offer. In that regard, education is very important and it is critical to Australians making an informed choice. Education is a great deal more than a well- planned advertising and, I would argue, propaganda campaign by funds as to the different products they offer. Of course, there also needs to be a sufficient time period in which to conduct an education campaign.</para><para>Even with a properly presented education campaign directed at the Australian community, I am very sceptical about us being able to adequately inform Australians as to making an informed choice of superannuation product. Let us assume that we can educate millions of Australians to the level of financial literacy required to make an informed choice. What about the 2.5 million Australians who are either illiterate or functionally illiterate? What hope is there of educating those 2.5 million Australians adequately in order for them to make an informed choice.</para><para>Choice has been introduced in two countries, and disturbing evidence of the significant problems which have arisen has come from both those countries—the United Kingdom and Chile. Firstly, let me deal with the United Kingdom. In the 1980s, the Thatcher conservative government decided to allow employees to opt out of their company pension fund and set up a personal pension arrangement instead—indeed, they were forced to. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—Order!

The financial supplement is a loan scheme under which students can obtain $2 on loan for every $1 of Austudy or Abstudy entitlement, up to a maximum of $3,500. This scheme, which was one of the innovations of the former Labor government, is designed to benefit students and to provide them with greater flexibility in income support. This is in stark contrast to the harsh treatment that students have received under the coalition.</para></talk.start><para>The financial supplement loans are repaid through the tax system, but not for the first five years after they have been made available. On 1 July of this year, the first loan recipients, those from 1993, will be required to start repayments if their taxable income exceeds the minimum threshold. The minimum level at which repayments begin—$29,307—is set at the annual equivalent of average weekly earnings and requires payments at the rate of two per cent of annual income. At an income level of $33,305, three per cent repayments apply, rising to four per cent at the income level of $46,629.</para><para>These thresholds are the same, after indexation, as those that applied under Labor's HECS scheme. Under the coalition government, the HECS repayment threshold is set at the ridiculously low level of less than $21,000. We are pleased to note that the government has at least recognised in this bill that to pile further repayment obligations on students earning only $21,000 would be totally unreasonable. It is an extraordinary contrast that this particular measure has been maintained while the broader aspects of the HECS changes have forced students to undertake such unreasonable burdens.</para><para>The financial supplement scheme provided loans for around 44,000 students in 1993, its first year of operation. While the vast majority of these still have some outstanding debt, it is not known how many will be required to commence repayments in the 1998-99 tax year because their income levels are also unknown. By 1996, around 13 per cent of Austudy and Abstudy recipients, or 68,000 students, were taking out loans under this scheme.</para><para>This bill also introduces a 14-day cooling-off period for financial supplement applications. This means that students can have a full two weeks to consider their financial options and whether to proceed with trading their Austudy entitlements for twice as much in the form of a loan. If they wish, students can choose to have earlier access to loan funds, thus waiving the cooling-off period. The opposition supports this refinement.</para><para>With the passage of the youth allowance legislation, students currently receiving Austudy will be dealt with by the Department of Social Security, although Abstudy recipients will remain with DEETYA. It is disappointing to note that the full details of the financial supplement scheme are not spelt out in legislation setting up the youth allowance or the Austudy payment to apply to students aged 25 years and over. Under the amendments to the Social Security Act passed by the Senate this week, the financial supplement scheme is referred to only in general terms, raising concerns that the government plans to make the Labor initiative less generous to students.</para><para>The opposition has been assured by Senator Newman that administrative difficulties have been the cause of this omission. As I indicated in the debate earlier this week, I am concerned at the resources of the department not being made available to ensure that these measures were fully spelt out in the legislation currently before the parliament. We have been given to believe that the government will rectify this situation by the end of the year if at all possible. I look forward to that assurance being met and to seeing legislation put down to ensure that these provisions are reflected in a legislative framework. In terms 
 of the bill before us, the opposition supports the legislation.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>2842</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Democrats support the <inline ref="r464">Student and Youth Assistance Amendment Bill 1998</inline> .

We also support the 14-day cooling-off period for people who are applying for the supplement. We think it is appropriate that people should be given the opportunity to reconsider their supplement request.</para></talk.start><para>I place on record the concerns that the Democrats have had with the operation of a loans or a supplement scheme. I was reading through comments by former senator and Democrat education spokeswoman Karen Sowada who debated this legislation on behalf of my party in 1992. The concerns that she stated in the chamber then are the same concerns that the Democrats have today with a system that, instead of providing for an adequate system of student financial support in the form of grants, relies on supplementation in the form of loans. It should be resourced in a way that enables people to have a livable income. In that debate, Karen Sowada said the her concerns were that:</para><para>Instead of redressing the blatant inequities in Austudy, this scheme is what the Government is actually offering the struggling students of this country. Loans will be available to those students eligible for Austudy and Abstudy—those students who are, by definition, the hardest hit and the poorest in our community.</para><para>She thought it was inappropriate that those people who were already struggling to participate or to enter into the higher education system should be slugged further with incurring a debt.</para><para>While the Democrats are the first to suggest that students, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds, should have access to some form of student assistance, we believe it should be available in a grants form because the loans scheme only ensures that students are saddled with increasing amounts 
 of debt. I should note that, in light of the recent changes to the higher education contribution scheme and also the possibility of up-front fees and charges under the current government, it is not unrealistic to believe that many students in Australia will have debts at least the equivalent of the cost of their parents' house.</para><para>Various research studies have indicated that, for example, a student studying a law degree over four or perhaps even five years at the rate of at least $5,500 per annum in HECS debt, not to mention comparable loans that they may incur, will have huge amounts to repay at the end of their degree or when the threshold kicks in. As Senator Carr said, that threshold is at an inappropriate and unrealistic level these days at just over $21,000. That is something again that the Democrats do not support.</para><para>I urge the government today to do something about ensuring that there is an adequate level of support and financial assistance to students in this country. We know that Austudy or the loan supplement by no means provides a livable income for many young people and for students. I draw the attention of the chamber and in particular the minister to the National Union of Students' Commonwealth budget submission for this year which points out how you could ensure that students were on a livable income—that is, one that is over the poverty level—not the current levels of student assistance which we know are at best around 60 per cent of the poverty line and on average around 35 per cent of the poverty line. Perhaps the government could take some clues from that submission as to how we can ensure that students are assisted with their studies and are resourced in a way that not only enables them to buy study materials but also to have such basic things as shelter and food.</para><para>The Democrats have long called for the reform of student financial assistance in relation to the eligibility criteria and in relation to the amounts paid and we will continue that campaign. I also acknowledge that elements of the bill before us are contingent on the passage of the common youth allowance legislation.   </para><para>While I will not discuss the bill that is specifically before the parliament, I note there is considerable community debate on to some of its negative aspects, specifically how 16- and 17-year-olds will survive without benefits if they are not in employment, education and training. There is also the long debated issue of how we define `independence'; that is, the age at which young people and in particular students qualify for the independent rate of Austudy and other financial assistance. That is not assisted by the government's proposal that students should be dependent upon their family until the age of 25 in the common youth allowance bill. That is an issue we have raised not only during the loans debate in 1992 but also before that.</para><para>I bring to the attention of the chamber once again the fact that the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs—I do not know at whose request—organised a media strategy document to counter some of these negative criticisms and concerns.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>AW5</name.id><name role="metadata">CARR</name><name role="display">Senator Carr</name></talker><para>—No, Social Security.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3I6</name.id><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name></talker><para>—Sorry, the Department of Social Security.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>AW5</name.id><name role="metadata">CARR</name><name role="display">Senator Carr</name></talker><para>—DEETYA is not that bad.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3I6</name.id><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name></talker><para>—DEETYA hardly exists any more, Senator Carr, they have cut it back so much.

I believe, however, that they are misguided in that view. The Bill currently places very tight, often judicial control, on the undertaking on non-consensual intimate forensic procedures. Accordingly, we believe that these protections are sufficient.</para><para>The Democrats amendments make further limitations by, for example, defining as a "suspect" certain persons but not persons whom the ordinary members of the public would believe to be a suspect, in other words a person reasonably suspected of having committed a criminal offence.

The bill gives the Australian Federal Police broad powers to conduct forensic procedures, ranging from finger and foot prints to taking samples of hair, and to initiate forensic procedures by having appropriately qualified persons taking genital swabs and other intimate samples. The bill distinguishes between intimate and non-intimate procedures, but there is no clear distinction between the two since the procedures are on a continuum from least intimate and intrusive to most intimate and intrusive.</para></talk.start><para>There are conflicting views as to the need for the bill. On the one hand, the bill is presented as necessary to advance the protection of human rights, as it is clear that forensic procedures are not only in widespread use in police work but are also not properly managed at this time. On the other hand, the bill introduces new powers to take samples from persons who have not been charged with an offence and to force them to give these samples. At common law, there is no power presently to compel a suspect to provide a sample of his or her blood, hair, saliva or other bodily matter. Undoubtedly, the bill significantly erodes conventional civil liberties by altering this common law constraint. The question is whether the bill significantly advances the public good in so doing.</para><para>One way to measure this is to establish whether significantly advanced criminal detection rates will result from the bill. It is 
 readily apparent from the evidence put to the hearings that no such case is made by the proponents of the bill. There has been no quantification of an expected detection and conviction rate improvement. I would remind you, Madam Acting Deputy President, that the question of quantifying the benefits of bills are well established in financial bills, and I would have thought a bill which alters our civil rights accordingly would have had its effect quantified. One inescapable issue dominates any consideration of the bill. The bill gives the police powers to detain and take samples from persons who have not been arrested or charged.</para><para>The development of the modern law of evidence has its origins in the 17th and 18th centuries. By and large, it is a collection of exclusionary rules, rules declaring that certain matters which might well be accepted as evidence of fact by other inquirers will not be accepted by the courts—rules declaring, in other words, what is not judicial evidence.</para><para>The evidence of a fact is that which tends to prove it—something which may satisfy an inquirer of the fact's existence. Courts of law usually have to find that certain facts exist before pronouncing on the rights, duties and liabilities of parties, and such evidence as they will receive in furtherance of this task is described as `judicial evidence'. Judicial evidence consists of testimony, hearsay, documents, things and facts which a court will accept as evidence of the facts to be debated in any given case. The main facts in issue are all those facts which the prosecutor must prove beyond reasonable doubt to succeed.</para><para>The main point is obviously relevance, and the main general rule governing the entire subject is that all evidence which is sufficiently relevant to an issue before the court is admissible and all that is irrelevant, or insufficiently relevant, should be excluded. It has been said that the first rule of evidence is relevance. It should perhaps be added that the first rule of collecting evidence should also be relevance. In legal terms, if the prosecution cannot prove that a piece of evidence is relevant to the case at hand, the judge will exclude it from the consideration of the jury.</para><para>In my view, and in the view of the Australian Democrats, the collection of evidence by any investigatory body should be relevant to a criminal investigation and admissible as evidence before a court of law. There is a general exclusionary ability in this bill. It enables the Australian Federal Police to detain, force a sample from and then exclude from any further inquiries any suspect they think is reasonable to deal with. The question of relevance is determined in these instances by the police, not by the courts.</para><para>Evidence of a fact is that which tends to prove it—something which may satisfy an inquirer of the fact's existence. That is not to say that all evidence is admissible. For instance, a telephone tap may tend conclusively to prove that someone is dealing in drugs. However, if the tap is not lawfully obtained, it may be ruled inadmissible by the court. In contrast to the United States where the courts are firmly of the opinion that illegally obtained evidence should be automatically excluded, Australian courts will admit illegally obtained evidence if, on a balanced analysis, the public good sufficiently outweighs the infringement of the legal protection.</para><para>As a society, we include as democratic principles the adherence to the rule of law—that is, citizens are ruled by laws and those administering them. Democratic dictates also require the respect for human rights and the protection of minorities against the possible coercive and oppressive power of the majority—thus the arguments for a bill of rights and constitutional protection against the tyranny of any given majority. It must be said that wide, unfettered discretion of this kind is, therefore, contrary to the concept of the rule of law as we have known it.</para><para>Contrary to popular belief, the police do not have any greater power to arrest than the average citizen. Lawful arrest is the only circumstance in which a citizen's personal liberty can be deprived, and then only according to the rule of law. The check against the abuse of this power lies in the civil law protection against unlawful imprisonment. This action is taken by the citizen against the arresting officer personally. The police officer must, therefore, be very clear that the action 
 of arrest is reasonable in all the circumstances.</para><para>Despite this apparent civil law protection, there have been cases where citizens have been unlawfully arrested. There are strict limits on the amount of time someone can be held under arrest before being charged, released or bailed, and we are all familiar with the writ of habeas corpus. In the present environment of legal aid cuts and increased court fees, it is questionable as to whether a citizen could now prosecute a successful civil law claim. In this bill, it is significant that the onus would be on the victim to assert their rights in the event of the powers being abused.</para><para>Fundamental to the criminal justice system is the presumption that someone is innocent until proven guilty. The onus is, therefore, placed upon the prosecution to rebut this presumption. The prosecution must provide evidence to prove beyond reasonable doubt the guilt of the accused. This bill significantly alters the presumption by allowing the police to obtain evidence not only to prove guilt but also to now prove innocence. This represents a fundamental departure from what is commonly considered should be the role of law enforcement bodies in the criminal justice system.</para><para>The bill clearly intends that someone could have a body sample taken to prove that they were not an offender. This distorts the nexus of both relevance and probative value of evidence, which is fundamental to presumption of innocence and, we suggest, to the rule of law itself. If everyone is assumed innocent until proven guilty, there is no need to accumulate evidence to support a proposition that the law is already compelled to accept.</para><para>Although significantly altered in recent years, there is still a significant component of the presumption of innocence that says a person should not have to do the prosecution's job for them. The presumption of innocence dictates that the prosecution, not the accused, must prove the guilt. It must be stated that the bill significantly departs from this privilege because of the coercive nature of collecting the evidence. There is some weight in the argument that states, if you can 
 not be compelled to answer questions, the more significant removal of bodily matter, by requirement, should be at least on a par with that prohibition. The bill will make lawful activities by law enforcement agencies which are not presently lawful in any state or in the Commonwealth, except in Victoria. It actually extends police powers.</para><para>The point of contact of police with a citizen is the point where the state and its coercive powers are at their most significant. Some farmers, of course, maintain that the same applies when you have Customs officers knocking on your door. The intercession of the rule of law is what distinguishes democratic and just societies from despotic and oppressive regimes.</para><para>The nature of police work is unusual in so far as power and discretion is inverse to that of seniority and rank. In police work, young constables are the persons who engage the public the most and are authorised to carry arms and, in certain circumstances, use deadly force. In this bill, senior constables are authorised persons, and at the hearings the committee was given evidence that these persons would typically not be younger than 26 years old. By any number of criteria, the nature of police work includes a wide range of discretion.</para><para>At almost every point of contact with the citizen, the police officer makes decisions and value judgments about that citizen. While it is acknowledged that most policing necessarily involves the use of discretion, it is also true that the rule of law requires that this is limited to the absolute minimum. The Australian Democrats are not convinced of the necessity for all the bill's coercive and intrusive powers. We do accept, and we do support, the regularisation of current forensic procedures, the regularisation of data usage, and procedures for the storage and destruction of forensic samples.</para><para>It is quite clear that in our society and with modern technology this is an area which deserves the legislative attention of the Commonwealth. It is quite clear that the AFP do need guiding legislative principles. So we are not opposed to those elements of the bill, but we do think that the bill goes too far. 
 Accordingly, we have introduced a number of amendments, which I have circulated, on amendment sheet No. 840. Those amendments will seek to: restrict the use of coercive and pre-emptive police powers where not appropriate, limit the applications of sample procurement, require the police to provide training in forensic procedures policing and provide for appropriate review and reporting on the use of these powers.</para><para>We do think that this is a very important bill in terms of human rights, in terms of Australian civil rights and in terms of civil liberties. We do think it is important that the parliament considers the extreme possibilities that may arise out of the provisions of the bill. Therefore, we hope the amendments we have put forward to moderate it will be acceptable to the Senate.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Minchin</inline>) adjourned.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Sitting suspended from 1.14 p.m. to 2.00p.m.</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title><type>Questions Without Notice</type><page.no>2847</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Budget 1998-99</title><page.no>2847</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>2847</page.no><name role="metadata">Gibbs, Sen Brenda</name><name role="display">Senator GIBBS</name><name.id>6L6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Family Services, Senator Herron.

Certainly, if it had been, it was clearly not at the forefront of anyone's mind in the ABC because it had to be sent out at short notice to effectively ensure that there was no coverage of a pro-government rally in relation to the waterfront. At the very same time, Carolyn Tucker, on ABC Radio in Brisbane, was out there giving chapter and verse to all those who wanted to attend an anti-government rally; they were welcome to go to St Mary's Cathedral with Father Kennedy at 5 p.m. that evening.

I am told that the head of the Indonesian armed forces has said that any wrongdoer will be properly punished. Therefore, we accept that what has been announced is in the right direction. We have also expressed our concerns as to what has occurred to others within the Indonesian government. We recognise that circumstances in Indonesia are difficult at the moment as a result of the financial crisis, rising prices of food and other items, the falling value of the currency and high unemployment. Nevertheless, even in such circumstances of financial and, following from that, social stress, it is important that any government maintains respect for human rights and also acts in a way to encourage stability during such periods of tension.</para><para>That is the way in which we are approaching the matter; to look for ways in which we can assist and support Indonesia during and through this difficult period, in an effort to avoid social tensions deteriorating into outbreaks of the type of violence that has occurred in recent days.</para><para>The honourable senator will be aware of the action that the Australian government has taken in conjunction with the IMF to contribute towards stabilising the currency and building a stronger, more sustainable economic base for Indonesia.

 Indonesia and the training programs that we have been sponsoring for Indonesian officials and the like.

The ETAS provides a visa issuance process which is immediate and almost invisible to eligible visiting foreign tourists.

Suggestions by some sectors of the industry that 50 per cent, or around two million visitors, will pay the $50 application fee are wrong. The number of visas issued through ETAS as a percentage of total long-term and short-term business and visitor visas was around 70 per cent in March this year. The percentage in several of our key tourist markets was higher—for example, in Japan 94 per cent, in Malaysia 95 per cent and, in the USA, 96 per cent.</para><para>In those developing markets which do not have access to the ETAS, there remains a need for immigration officers to instigate a range of checks for short-term visa applicants to ensure that Australia's border integrity is 
 maintained. The government needs to ensure in these cases that we have a visa processing infrastructure in place which can efficiently cater for the expected increase in visitor visa applications, particularly in relation to markets such as China, now that we have been granted approved destination status.</para><para>The processes I am talking about do not come without cost.

What we have seen is his persistent ideological attack on the ABC.</para><para>Today I asked Senator Alston a question about his most recent attack on the ABC and his claim of alleged bias over the way the ABC has handled its coverage of the waterfront dispute in recent weeks. From my reading of the record and various press clippings, around 27 and 28 April Senator Alston accused the ABC of biased coverage of the waterfront dispute and, in particular, an associated matter that they would not give publicity to a farmers rally in New South 
 Wales. He said that this was a clear case of bias and attacked the ABC.</para><para>This minister launched that attack, apparently without any discussion with the ABC. Some days later, after he launched that attack accusing them of bias and, therefore, of breaking their charter, et cetera, he sent a letter to the ABC. I made it clear that I thought the minister did have the right to send a letter to the ABC seeking clarification about matters he was concerned with, but not after he had already abused them and found them guilty by making a statement alleging bias. I think it would have been a much more appropriate process for this minister to have written to the ABC—in this case, to the Chairman of the ABC—seeking clarification on matters with which he was concerned. If he was not satisfied after he had the answer, it would have been quite appropriate for the minister to express a view. But he did it around the other way: he condemned them first, found them guilty and then wrote the letter asking for an explanation of why they were guilty.</para><para>This minister cannot get the process right. He cannot get right his understanding of what his responsibility is as the minister for this statutory authority, this great national institution, the ABC. When I asked him my supplementary question today, he acknowledged that, yes, he had sent a letter; he was not satisfied with the reply given by Mr Johns and the chairman, Mr McDonald. Of course, Mr McDonald was appointed by this government as chairman and he is a close friend, apparently, of the Prime Minister. They both wrote back to Senator Alston explaining that they were satisfied with the ABC's coverage of the waterfront dispute and related matters.</para><para>Today, Senator Alston said that he had five points in his letter. He gave some bumbling explanation about what one of those points was, but gave no more. But when I asked him in a supplementary question to table the letter, he fudged; he went weak at the knees. He did not know whether he should table it or whether he should not. If you are going to get up and bag the ABC, if you are going to demand responses to claims of bias, it is only reasonable that you have a process whereby the public can judge whether the minister's 
 accusations are valid and relevant to the ABC's charter. But this minister ran away from the opportunity today in the Senate to table his letter. Minister, I still ask you to have the courage—table your letter and let the public judge whether you have treated the ABC fairly or unfairly.</para><para>This minister is into intimidation; he is into thuggery against the ABC. In the history of the ABC, there has been no minister who has more consistently attacked it than this minister. There has been no Prime Minister who has attacked it more often than the present Prime Minister. It is part of this coalition government's agenda to intimidate the ABC and put the heat on in the lead-up to the next election. They always claim that there is bias in the ABC, but they never make the same accusation against any other journalist from the private media. It is always the ABC that is in the gun as far as they are concerned, yet they have never demonstrated factually systemic bias in the ABC. If they were going to do that, you would think that the minister would have tabled the letter today. This minister is a gutless minister when he will not table the letter containing his criticism. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>2863</page.no><name role="metadata">Tierney, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator TIERNEY</name><name.id>O15</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I do not think Senator Schacht actually established his case in that tirade. It is a pretty difficult case he is trying to establish if he is trying to say that the media—any media, let alone the ABC—is even-handed in its treatment in this country.</para></talk.start><para>I think it has been very obvious over the last two years not only how biased the media has been against this government but, in particular, how biased the ABC has been. This came home very clearly to me, Senator Schacht, in this particular case of the waterfront and the treatment of it by the ABC and by other media.</para><para>Let me give you two examples from my own area which I actually eye witnessed. John Howard, our Prime Minister, came to Maitland about five weeks ago. We really had a great day. He was out in the community; he was out in the rural areas. There were some great stories to report. He spoke to a huge public gathering in the Maitland Town Hall. 
 But was there any evidence of this on the media that night, on the ABC or anywhere else? No.</para><para>What did they report? They reported that the waterside workers were out the front of Maitland Town Hall and, as John Howard swept in, they took that particular footage, which was about one minute out of a full day. What appeared on that night's news broadcasts—the ABC included—was that footage. None of the good news was reported. The reporting was biased against the government, particularly on this waterfront issue.</para><para>To move on one week: Tim Fischer came to the Hunter Valley to launch a new ship at ADI in Carrington. This was showpiece technology for this country. It was a great story. A huge crowd was there in the pouring rain to help launch this great ship. Outside the entrance to the shipyards was a very small band of protesters—a little under 30 people. Some of them were protesting about educational issues, but the great majority of those 30 were waterside workers protesting against the Prime Minister. This very small group was in a tent, in the rain, outside the shipyard.</para><para>What did the media—and the ABC in particular—report on that night? They reported on the small group of protesters. They took very sharp-angled shots of the protesters so they looked like a crowd, but there was not a crowd there at all. There was a really good news story there, but they did not report it, they reported on this small group of protesters. The ABC is not the only one that does that; all the media does that.</para><para>To try to establish a case for one branch of the media like the ABC and say that it is even-handed is nonsense. None of the media is even-handed, particularly the ABC. We see it time and time again in the reporting on this government. The ABC takes minor points, distorts them and blows them up. Probably the worst example in two years was the reporting of the waterfront dispute. The ABC reported it in such a way as to try make the government look bad. This government is trying to reform the waterfront. The previous government wasted $480 million and did not achieve any real workplace reform.</para><para>We have started. We have had the guts to do it. The ABC should be reporting in an even-handed way that this government has had the courage to reform the waterfront, which is one of the main ways in which we will get the economy in this country back on track. We have to do it, but it must be reported properly. We have not seen proper reporting from the media generally, and we certainly have not seen it from the ABC.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>2864</page.no><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator CARR</name><name.id>AW5</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The answers today of the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts, Senator Alston, reflect his frustration on behalf of this government at the failure of this government to succeed in its illegal attempt to remove the MUA from the Australian waterfront. This minister is thrashing about trying to find a scapegoat for what is fundamentally flawed government policy. This policy is based upon the government's deep-seated hatred of working people and of the MUA in particular. That deep-seated hatred is perhaps only exceeded by its deep-seated hatred of the ABC itself.</para></talk.start><para>What we heard today was quite an amazing proposition from this minister, a minister who delivered his answer in his classic manner of guile, evasion, double-speak and deceit. He tries to cover up in a classically weak and sneaky manner his attempt to bully and intimidate the ABC into submission. This attempt was exposed by Errol Simper, who had a leak directly from the minister on 4 May. Details of the letter the minister had sent to Brian Johns were published in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline>. He had written to Johns rather than putting his complaints to the board of the ABC.</para><para>That reflected the minister's deep-seated hatred of the ABC which has been demonstrated again and again in this place. It has been demonstrated on behalf of the coalition by other coalition members over many years. In 1991, the coalition members on their expenditure review committee proposed deep and savage cuts to the ABC. The ABC inquiry was set up by this minister, through Senator Chamarette at the time, in which he sought to arm himself with a series of quite hideous and scandalous terms of reference. 
 Those terms of reference were predicated on the assumption of the ABC's fault, the ABC's guilt.</para><para>Those terms of reference were highlighted by such terms as `the failure of the ABC'. The assumption of failure of the ABC is constantly written into their very thought processes. Words like `controversy', `conflict', `dysfunction', and `deep-seated problems' were put into those terms of reference. So biased were those terms of reference that they had to be amended because they were totally inappropriate for any Senate committee let alone one such as this. This minister, who was chair of that particular committee, undertook what effectively amounted to an inquisitional equivalent of a guttercrawl. He went right through the ABC seeking to find every piece of dirt he could in an attempt to discredit the ABC.</para><para>Last year, the attack on the ABC was continued, based upon the budget cuts of what now amounts to $192 million from the ABC. Claims were made by the minister in 1996 that the ABC budget was bloated. He said, `It is all very well for the ABC to win awards, but no-one is watching and we have to ask ourselves if we should really be producing these programs.' Again, he was setting himself up as the arbiter of high quality and integrity in the ABC. What a person to make such a claim.</para><para>I recall that the Prime Minister also embarked upon this attack. He said that the ABC was politically correct to a fault and that it tended to concentrate on one particular point of view. I remember that the Treasurer, Mr Costello, following the audit commission's criticism of the ABC as he saw it, said that the ABC needed to be more accountable. By accountability they mean that the ABC should ape the answers given by this minister—it should follow the directions of this government. That is their notion of editorial independence. It is a notion that says that if you raise issues or concerns and things do not go the way this government thinks they would, it has to find a scapegoat—and how easy it is to blame the ABC.</para><para>How appropriate it is that the ABC should be defending its integrity, should be defending 
 its independence and should be ensuring a quality service that all Australians can enjoy, and not just the sycophancy and criminal acts that this government has been involved in in regard to the waterfront. How can you object to being exposed in the courts for the actions that you have undertaken—actions which some 10 judges across this country have now highlighted as being totally inappropriate to the way that industrial relations should be conducted in this country—and for the conspiracy that this government is so deeply involved in? <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>2865</page.no><name role="metadata">Lightfoot, Sen Phillip</name><name role="display">Senator LIGHTFOOT</name><name.id>WP6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I listened to Senator Carr with his statements and emotive words such as `deep-seated hatred of working-class people', `scapegoats' and `sycophants'.

At times, it is also impossible to find any common ground with the ABC.</para></talk.start><para>There is no question in the fair and reasonable minds of people in Australia that the ABC has a bias. When you analyse the organisation and find that the peak union of the ABC is part of the ACTU movement—the same as the Maritime Union of Australia—you can see where that influence comes from. 	It is not in the best interests of the ABC, because it is partly unionised and significantly so, for it to portray anything other than a bias towards the union movement. That is the very nub of the problem. The problem is that the union movement in Australia must be based on a volunteer organisation and not be a closed shop, whether you use coercion or whether you are up-front with it like the MUA.</para><para>If one goes back to the charge of bias against the ABC, one only has to see, as has been mentioned before, the cameras down there on the wharf—predominantly from the ABC—showing wharfies going to a church service. It is a wonder the roof did not fall in on the place they were attending. It ought to have been a salutary experience because not many of them would have ever been to church in their life before. When I was a 
 young man I belonged to the Waterside Workers Federation and, strangely, three of us on this side belonged to the Waterside Workers Federation—so we know what we are talking about. For Senator Carr to say that we have a `deep-seated hatred of working-class people' is completely erroneous. Not only erroneous, it is about as far wrong as you could possibly get. For some reason, Senator Carr gets it wrong most often—more often than other people on that side of the chamber.</para><para>This is the comparison. I have never heard the ABC be strident in its criticism of the waterfront, yet you have other media outlets that are doing just that. The <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> in early April said:</para><para>At last, Australia appears to be reaching a big bang end-game to its decades- long quest to remove the shame on its waterfront. Today's farmer-inspired battle on the docks will define whether the country can work out how to earn a quid in the globalised economy.</para><para>There was nothing of that nature from the ABC. The <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline>  in early April said:</para><para>A union monopoly is being broken: the waterfront is being opened to genuine reform, and the results, by degrees, will benefit the entire economy. Instead of being part of a necessary and long-overdue reform process on the waterfront, the MUA stood outside the effort and tried to undermine it with tactics like strikes, picket lines and class-war rhetoric—</para><para>the same type of rhetoric that Senator Carr uses in this chamber—</para><para>that were dusted off from the 1950s. The point of all this was not to protect workers' rights in any general sense, but to protect waterfront workers in a specific sense. . . </para><para>The ABC never came out with anything approaching that sort of criticism of one of the most corrupt unions and one of the greatest collections of thugs in any union—apart from the painters and dockers—that this nation has ever seen. Again, in later April, the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline>  said:</para><para>The forces of change on the waterfront are not directed against unions and unionists. They are against waste, greed and inefficiency. They are for the good of all Australians. And they are unstoppable.</para><para>That is what has to get through hardline leftists—old leftover communists like Senator 
 Carr—that the union movement on the wharf is finished, that the movement created by the National Farmers Federation is unstoppable and that the waterfront will never be the same again. You have in Mr John Coombs the Arthur Scargill of Australia. He should take a lesson out of Arthur Scargill's book. It will never be the same. You cannot and you will not return to what was one of the greatest rorts in Australia. It was not simply that it was a rort; it was simply that it was affecting everyone in Australia—it was affecting our lifestyle. That simply has to stop, and it is stopping. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>2866</page.no><name role="metadata">Bourne, Sen Vicki</name><name role="display">Senator BOURNE</name><name.id>TW4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Senator Alston answered three questions today on the ABC. He answered one from me about Radio Australia, one from Senator Boswell about diminished ABC services in the bush and one from Senator Schacht about bias. I do not know if I can call them answers—I suppose that is being a bit generous to Senator Alston—but I will discuss what he said when replying to these three questions.</para></talk.start><para>First of all in relation to Radio Australia, the minister said that it was recommended by Mr Mansfield in the Mansfield report that Radio Australia be closed. Yes, it was recommended by Mr Mansfield. But, if you have a look at the terms of reference that Mr Mansfield was given, they did not include Radio Australia, they did not include ATV—they did not include international broadcasting by the ABC of any sort. Because they did not include those organisations, nobody made submissions on them.</para><para>The millions of people in Indonesia and in Asia and the tens of thousands who wrote to the ABC saying, `What's going on?' and `What's this I hear that you might be closing RA and that you might be closing ATV?' and the heads of state who wrote to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) and to the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts (Senator Alston) saying, `Please don't do this'—all of those people would have made submissions. I would have made a submission. A great many 
 thousands of people around the world would have made submissions.</para><para>I do not know that that would have made any difference to this government, because what this government wants to do is punish the ABC. That is its prime objective in life. Sometimes I feel as though what this government really wants to achieve out of its period in office is to punish the ABC and, if possible, to destroy the ABC. Even though there was nothing in the terms of reference whatsoever—absolutely nothing—one recommendation of the Mansfield report was that Radio Australia should be closed and that ATV should be closed. That was plan A. Plan A was incredibly stupid and everybody realised that was the case.</para><para>Then we went on to plan B. Plan B was to send out Radio Australia only by satellite. If you are a rich Asian person—and there are not an awful lot of rich people in Asia; most of them are not—then you will be able to hear a reasonable, fair, unbiased news service and current affairs and so on. If you are poor, `Sorry, to bad.' Plan B died a hideous death as well, which was excellent.</para><para>Then we have plan C, which is where we are at the moment. Plan C is that Radio Australia is sent out into Asia. Most people are desperately in need of good news and current affairs which they do not get on as regular a basis from America, Britain or anywhere else in the world as they would from Radio Australia if we were transmitting. It would be sent out on satellite via short wave to the Pacific. This is totally ludicrous and inadequate.</para><para>Secondly, I will talk a bit about Senator Alston's answer to Senator Boswell about diminished ABC services in the bush. I can tell Senator Boswell that it is only going to get worse. Until the ABC is properly funded—and the ABC is not properly funded at the moment; it is appallingly funded at the moment, it is vastly under-funded at the moment—the bush is going to suffer. The rest of us are going to suffer. Everybody in Asia is going to suffer.</para><para>Thirdly, let me talk about Senator Alston's answer to Senator Schacht about bias. A couple of days ago the ABC released a report 
 that found that 79 per cent of all respondents believe that the ABC does a great job and is balanced and even-handed in politics. Some 95 per cent stated that the ABC does a good job in providing reliable and accurate news and current affairs programs. I take it the Liberal Party comes in that other five per cent. Certainly the ministers come in the other five per cent.</para><para>The ABC board requires reports on accuracy, impartiality and objectivity. Those reports do not demonstrate bias. Issues included in the current report are some of the most volatile. Bias was not demonstrated. It is interesting to note who some of the most strident complainants are. They are members of the Liberal Party—the federal director, one of the Prime Minister's advisers and the minister, who is a very strident complainant.</para><para>Mr Johns does not have to respond to the minister and his incredibly ridiculous and long letter.

The Report covers two new treaties, one subsidiary instrument, and withdrawal from three obsolete treaties—and the Government would draw attention to this as evidence of its determination to keep Australia's international legal obligations transparent, appropriate, and current. The status of the treaty actions in question is as follows:</para><para>.	 Denunciation of the Constitution of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO)</para><para>-	 Instrument deposited on 23 December 1996, with effect from 31 December 1997.</para><para>.	 Agreement to amend the Agreement with the Socialist Republic of Vietnam for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income</para><para>-	 Entered into force on 23 July 1997, after exchange of Notes on 6 March  and  23 July 1997.</para><para>.	 Agreement with Hong Kong concerning Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters</para><para>-	 Signed on 23 September 1996; continued applicability after 30 June  1997 confirmed by exchange of Notes with People's Republic of China on 9 and 26 June 1997; will enter into force thirty days after exchange of Notes with Hong Kong, which awaits Hong Kong implementing legislation.</para><para>.	 Trade &amp; Investment Agreement with the United Mexican States</para><para>-	 Signed on 13 November 1994; entered into force on exchange of Notes on 3 April 1997.</para><para>.	 Denunciation of the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage</para><para>-	 Instrument deposited on 7 April 1997, with effect from 15 May 1998.</para><para>.	 Denunciation of the International Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage</para><para>-	 Deemed to be denounced with the Liability Convention, with effect from 15 May 1998.</para><para>These treaty actions reflect the Committee's tacit or explicit support for Government proposals, as recorded in the Report at Paragraphs 2.40, 3.64, 
 4.15, 4.27, and 4.37. The Report contains only two formal recommendations, concerning the withdrawal from UNIDO and the Tax Sparing Agreement with Vietnam. It also contains an extensive discussion of consultation, with reference especially to tax treaties; and the establishment through the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) of appropriate consultative mechanisms to respond to the Committee's concerns has delayed the preparation of this response.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">2.39  The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties recommends that savings achieved from Australia's withdrawal from the United Nations Industrial Development Organization be redirected to other areas of the aid program where they can be more effectively utilised.</inline></para><para>The Government notes and endorses the approach reflected in this recommendation. In doing so, the Government welcomes the Committee's conclusion (Paragraph 2.38) that `more effective utilisation of Australia's aid budget may be obtained through the funding of other aid programs.'  The Government notes, however, that the anticipated savings are part of managing the Australian Agency for International Development's (AusAID) global budget rather than a discrete sum that might be identifiably re-allocated. With reference to Paragraph 2.36, it notes that, at the time the decision to withdraw was made, AusAID wrote to all parties affected by the decision to advise them of the withdrawal and the rationale behind it.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">3.63  The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties recommends that the Department of Foreign Affairs &amp; Trade and the Australian Taxation Office keep the exclusion of accounting and audit services from tax sparing incentives in the 1992 Double Taxation Agreement with Vietnam under review and, if Vietnamese legislation is amended, commence negotiations to remove that exclusion.</inline></para><para>The Government is pleased that the Committee supported early ratification of the amendments to the Double Taxation Agreement with Vietnam and has given effect to that ratification following the passage of the enabling legislation.</para><para>However, the Government is not in a position at this time to provide a positive response to the recommendation in Paragraph 3.63 of the Report. The possible removal of the exclusion of accounting and audit services from the scope of the tax sparing provisions in the Agreement with Vietnam would be a matter for decision by the Government, in the context of its overall policy on the grant of tax sparing, if and when the relevant Vietnamese legislation should be amended.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Trade &amp; Investment Agreement with Mexico</inline></para><para>With reference to Paragraph 4.23 and to clarify its final sentence, the International Wool Secretariat 
 has entered into a Co-operation Agreement with the Mexican development bank Nacional Financiera and launched a development plan aimed at developing Mexico's wool textiles industry, with a view to gaining access to North American markets under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Consultation</inline></para><para>Paragraphs 3.46-58 of the Report provide the Committee's views on aspects of the treaty-making process. The Government endorses the importance of National Interest Analyses tabled in Parliament being both comprehensive (3.48-50) and comprehensible (3.51-3) and welcomes the Committee's continuing guidance as to the styles of document most helpful for the Parliamentary consideration of proposed treaty actions.</para><para>The Government has provided some comment on the issues of consultation in the concluding of bilateral treaties, in its response to the Committee's 4th Report. The onus remains on line Departments and agencies to identify and consult all significant stakeholders as early as possible in the negotiating and treaty-making processes. In the specific matter of tax treaties, the ATO has been exploring issues related to the establishment of a Tax Treaties Advisory Panel to include tax professionals and representatives of business organisations—notably the management of industry involvement while respecting international practice that bilateral treaties are confidential to the parties (governments) until signature. The Government reiterates its readiness at a mutually convenient opportunity to provide the Committee with a full briefing on the principles of tax treaties in general, so as to facilitate its consideration of the merits of specific instruments in future.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>2868</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Auditor-General's Reports</title><page.no>2868</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report No. 43 of 1997-98</title><page.no>2868</page.no></subdebateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—In accordance with the provisions of the Auditor-General Act 1997, I present the following report of the Auditor-General:</para></talk.start><para><inline font-style="italic">Report No. 43 of 1997-98—Performance Audit—Life-cycle Costing in the Defence</inline></para></interjection></subdebate.2><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report No. 44 of 1997-98</title><page.no>2868</page.no></subdebateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—In accordance with the provisions of the Auditor-General Act 1997, I present the following report of the Auditor-General:</para></talk.start><para><inline font-style="italic">Report No. 44 of 1997-98—Performance Audit—Australian Diplomatic Communications Network—Project Management.</inline></para></interjection></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>BUDGET 1998-99</title><type>Miscellaneous</type><page.no>2869</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Portfolio Budget Statements</title><page.no>2869</page.no></subdebateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—I table the portfolio budget statements for 1998-99 for the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff and a corrigenda for the Department of the Senate portfolio budget statements.

</para><para>At 5.00 p.m. on the afternoon of 7 April, Patrick's industrial relations director, Mr Bill Clayton, concluded the four Patrick's companies employing 2,000 workers were insolvent. He had a meeting half an hour earlier with Mr Peter Scanlon and Mr Chris Corrigan. They told Mr Clayton in formal termination notices that the labour contracts were to be terminated. These labour hire contracts could be terminated by Patrick if there were strikes, lawful or not, and of course the wharfies had not been told of these company changes.</para><para>The trap was sprung. It was an illegal trap. It was designed by the minister for workplace relations, the disgraced former minister for transport and the Prime Minister by Dr Stephen Webster and others. The National Farmers Federation and Patrick also made important contributions to its development.</para><para>Mr Gillespie of the department told his minister on 10 March that the MUA work force had to be dismissed and replaced by a new work force before any action to reinstate existing workers could occur. Mr Corrigan's corporate structure achieved that objective. If I can refer back to the 10 March minute to Mr Reith, under the heading `Next steps', the minute says:</para><para>Propose a further discussion—possibly with the Prime Minister in April.</para><para>There was a meeting with the Prime Minister about the Reith plan, and I will come back to that issue later. A very interesting article appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline>  newspaper on 23 April. It was written by Mr Frank Costigan QC. The Senate would recall that between 1980 and 1984 he conducted the Royal Commission into the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union. He was sent to get the union movement but he finished up getting corporate Australia. I would like to look briefly at the terms of reference of that inquiry, which read:</para><para>. . . without restricting the scope of your inquiry, we direct you, for the purpose of your inquiry, to give particular attention to the following questions:</para><para>(a)	 whether any executive, administrative or other body forming part of, or established by, the Union has been used, or is being used, for the purposes of illegal activities, other than activities involving only breaches of laws, whether 
 of the Commonwealth or a State, relating to trade unions;</para><para>(b)	 whether the Union or any of its officials or members has been or is engaged in demanding or receiving payment (other than payments of an ordinary commercial nature or payments in accordance with an industrial award or agreement in respect of work actually performed or to be performed) from employers or other persons and, if any such payments have made—</para><para>	 (i)	 the persons by whom and to whom any such payments have been made;</para><para>	 (ii)	 the reasons for, or the purpose of, any such payments;</para><para>	 (iii)	 the subsequent or proposed use or disposal of any such payments;</para><para>(c)	 whether the Union or any officers or members of the Union have engaged in illegal activities in relation to the election or appointment of officers of the Union or the conduct or purported conduct of the Union's affairs;</para><para>(d)	 if the Union or any officers or members of the Union have engaged in activities of any of the kinds referred to in this or the preceding paragraph, whether the employment conditions applying to the work of ship painters and dockers have contributed to the development of those activities:</para><para>What did Mr Costigan discover? He discovered massive tax fraud with union members being made straw directors of shell companies which were asset stripped by the scheme promoter. Mr Howard, of course, was the Treasurer in the late 1970s. He was reluctant to move on taxation avoidance, despite warnings from the Australian Taxation Office. In the end he was forced to do so by the electorate. It now appears that corporate Australia has found a new use for shell companies.</para><para>In the early 1980s, companies were stripped to avoid paying tax. In the 1990s, they are being stripped to avoid meeting the legal liabilities to their workers. The man who was so reluctant to move on this issue in the 1970s not only was aware of this new application of an old corporate scam but also explicitly endorsed it. What did Mr Costigan say in his article in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> on 23 April? He said, amongst other things:</para><para>I have followed with despair over the past few months the approach taken by Patrick and the Government . . .  
</para><para>. . .              . . .             . . .</para><para>Of special concern in this dispute is the manner in which the union employees of Patrick were deprived of their employment.</para><para>He went on later to say:</para><para>I am concerned with the restructuring by Patrick of their corporate entities.</para><para>He goes on:</para><para>In his judgment on Tuesday, Justice North set out in summary form the procedures adopted by Patrick to denude the employing companies of their assets, and to arrange contracts between those companies and the operating Patrick company which contained clauses making it simple to dispense with the services of the union members. The mechanism to achieve this was set up in advance, ready for action.</para><para>There is no suggestion that these changes were designed, like the bottom of the harbour schemes, to avoid the payment of tax. However their effect, and inevitably their design, was to avoid obligations under the Workplace Relations Act.</para><para>The behaviour of Patrick in relation to its reorganisation of its corporate structure deserves the strongest condemnation.</para><para>This is Mr Costigan QC talking; these are not my words. Later he says:</para><para>It is almost beyond belief that such endeavours attracted the applause of the Government.</para><para>And applause of the government they did attract. He says later:</para><para>The events surrounding the late-night sacking of the workers, enforced by security guards and dogs, and the asset stripping of the employing companies, constitute an example of financial, corporate and industrial misbehaviour which is unacceptable in this country.</para><para>Then he said:</para><para>For my part I am bound to declare that it is offensive to ordinary concepts of decent behaviour. It is the responsibility of the Australian Government to take appropriate steps to make certain it cannot happen again.</para><para>It is inevitable, because of its action, that this government stands condemned in relation to this action. Last September Patrick started to reduce the level of capital in its employer businesses and sell assets and shares to other companies in the Patrick group. Up until the third week of September, Patrick Stevedore's companies Nos 1, 2 and 3 employed waterside workers, owned equipment, ran terminals and had contracts with shipping companies. 
 But the business was sold for $300 million to a company further up the corporate chain while assets were sold for $7 million.</para><para> The employer companies reduced their capital base by almost $70 million by buying back and then cancelling shares. This soaked up all their cash. Patrick Stevedore's No. 2 paid $24.4 million in buying 609,922 shares at a $1 par value, a $39 premium per share. Patrick Stevedore's No. 1 paid $36.9 million for 45.4 million $1 shares, a 19c discount on par value. Patrick Stevedore's No. 3 paid $6.8 million for 13.5 million shares, a 50 per cent discount on the par value of the $1 shares. I am not aware of any evidence that the terms of section 206 of the Corporations Law were addressed through the appointment of an outside expert opinion to ensure that the share buybacks were fair and reasonable, but I guess we will find out all about that in due course.</para><para>When the company assets were sold to another Patrick company, the original employers entered non-exclusive labour supply deals with that company. These labour supply contracts contained automatic termination provisions if the subsidiaries were placed in the hands of administrators. As I said earlier, the contracts could also be terminated if there was industrial action, legal or illegal. In contrast, the P&amp;C contracts signed by Patrick gave the farmers 30 days to rectify a fault with the labour supply once it was identified. The contract could not be terminated if the fault was corrected in that time. That is a remarkable difference.</para><para> The Reith plan proved very effective in stripping these companies. At the first meeting of creditors of the four Patrick companies, the creditors were told that they had $400 million in liabilities and just $14 million in assets. The administrator, Mr Peter Brook, said that $150 million was owed in employee entitlements and $250 million to secured creditors, mostly banking syndicates. But this was not a problem for Mr Corrigan. Mr Corrigan said:</para><para>As far as we are concerned the companies that are in administration no longer have any rights to supply labour to our facilities and so we won't be proceeding to allow those people entry. 
</para><para>He told the ABC:</para><para>We have taken actions which we are confident are completely lawful and completely honest and have no regrets whatsoever, or no concerns whatsoever about them.</para><para>On the <inline font-style="italic">Face to Face</inline>  program he was asked:</para><para>But my point to you though, is these companies, at the point they sacked those workers, they could not actually fund the redundancies that were due to them, could they?</para><para>Mr Corrigan answered:</para><para>Most companies can't fund the redundancies if they sack the entire workforce.</para><para>Question: But you planned to. That's the difference.</para><para>Mr Corrigan then said:</para><para>No, we didn't plan to. We negotiated until the very end.</para><para>He was then asked:</para><para>Exactly how long were you involved in discussions with the government on this issue?</para><para>Corrigan then said:</para><para>. . . Oh only about 2 weeks before it happened. We went to the Government and said we are getting to the point of complete exasperation. We may need to make people redundant in one form or another. What are the mechanisms through which you might provide redundancy arrangements.</para><para>But he then said that the Howard government made mention in December that it was willing to put in place some sort of fund. However, the plan, as we now know, was well in place before that time. So Mr Corrigan thought the plan was legal and appropriate. The government was obviously happy with the plan. After all, it was the mechanism to deliver the minister the scalp of the MUA. Mr Reith was happy to own up to the fact that the government gave Mr Corrigan lots of legal advice. Mr Reith was asked on the <inline font-style="italic">AM</inline>  program on 22 April:</para><para>So you did give him that advice?</para><para>He was referring to the advice to dismiss their entire work force and replace them quickly in a way that limits ordering reinstatement. Mr Reith said:</para><para>We gave both of them quite a lot of legal advice. So sure, we've been very activist.</para><para>What have the courts said about this? I want to quote firstly from the summary of the Federal Court's decision of 21 April. On the 
 second page of that decision at point 12, it states:</para><para>The cancellation of the labour supply contract and the appointment of administrators on 7 April 1998 were made possible by a complex inter-company transaction which occurred in September 1997. By dividing the functions of employing workers and owning the business between two companies, the Patrick group put in place a structure which made it easier to dismiss the whole workforce. It is arguable, on the evidence, that this was done because the employees were members of the Union. So there is an arguable case that the Patrick employers acted in breach of s298K(1) of the Act.</para><para>Point 13 says:</para><para>There is also an arguable case that these acts amounted to a breach of the employees' contracts of employment.</para><para>I would like to draw the Senate's attention to page 15 of the decision, where it states:</para><para>The corporate counsel of Lang Corporation Ltd deposed to the reasons for the restructure, which involved the making of the BPAs and LSAs, the share buybacks and debt repayments. The reasons were to avoid customer confusion, confusion as to which entity owned which assets, to allow better performance monitoring and to allow borrowing at better rates.</para><para>I want you to listen to this passage of the judgment:</para><para>There is no express denial that a reason for undertaking the restructure in this particular way was to facilitate the termination of the employees' employment.</para><para>The court draws the attention of the public to the fact that the Lang Corporation did not deny that was the purpose of the restructuring. The decision goes on:</para><para>The reasons given do not explain why clause 13(1)(b) of each LSA took the particular form. Furthermore, the reasons given are not inconsistent with the reason alleged by the applicants. Section 298K(1) requires the prohibited reason to be one reason, but not the only reason.</para><para>So the court was very clearly finding against them and in a telling way in that regard. On page 17 of the summary of the decision, it states: </para><para>Although Patricks made generalised complaints about the employees' work practices, there is no material which would justify the conclusion at this stage that the workforce was unsatisfactory. Indeed, the company accounts for the year ended 30 September 1996 show that the first respondent 
 made an after tax profit of $10,911,000 for the year ended 30 September 1995 (the first year) and an after tax profit of $20,431,000 for the year ended 30 September 1996 (the second year).</para><para>They are very interesting passages from the Federal Court decision. The High Court decision in a number of places is also very interesting to read. On page 5 of the majority decision, the High Court notes of the restructure of the business:</para><para>Thus the security of the employer companies' businesses was extremely tenuous. The security of the employees' employment was consequentially altered to their prejudice.</para><para>A deliberate tactic. The High Court also highlights on page 6 of the joint decision that:</para><para>There is no express denial that a reason for undertaking the restructure in this particular way was to facilitate the termination of the employees' employment.</para><para>It also highlights on page 22 that:</para><para>. . . in effecting the 1997 reorganisation, the employer companies disposed of their assets including their stevedoring businesses, reduced their issued capital and disposed of a substantial amount of money by the buy-back of their shares and became the mere suppliers of labour, they exposed their continued commercial viability to the discretion of Patrick Operations No 2 (and later to Patrick Operations) in the event of any disruption in the supply of labour.</para><para>There are many passages from that decision that I could quote.</para><para>Despite the view of Mr Costigan QC, despite the view of Justice North, despite the view of the full bench of the Federal Court and despite the view of the High Court, the Prime Minister continues to back Mr Corrigan to the hilt. In fact, he has said that the events on the waterfront are a defining moment in Australia's industrial relations history. That statement is dead right.</para><para>The government all but ignored the Attorney-General's Department when it put this strategy together in this matter. The plan outlined in the 10 March minute was developed by Dr Webster and others, including the law firms Minter Ellison and Dunhill Madden Butler. What was developed was a commercial structure.</para><para>I am sure there are a lot of questions being asked in the Attorney-General's Department 
 as I speak about how the government—particularly the minister for workplace relations, the former minister for transport and the Prime Minister himself—could have put itself in such a risky legal position. The government has been caught out because the Attorney-General's Department was left out of this matter. The role of the Attorney-General, and his department, in this fiasco will be revealed and it will make fascinating reading. The extent of the government's legal dilemma is highlighted by the heavy hitters brought in to help it and its alleged fellow conspirators. Patrick has hired Freehills, the NFF has hired Minter Ellison—which were also consultants to the government in relation to waterfront reform; and some very interesting questions were asked at estimates which have not yet been answered in relation to that conflict—the administrators are being represented by Phillips Fox and the government has hired Dunhill Madden Butler.</para><para>The key point in this whole waterfront fiasco was the endorsement of the strategy provided to the minister for workplace relations on 27 February last year. That paper was the basis for the actions taken by the government and Patrick around Australia at 11 p.m. on 7 April. I have advised the Senate on a previous occasion that the waterfront paper was initially prepared by Mr Derryn Gillespie and Dr Greg Feeney when the maritime transport division was located in the Department of Transport and Regional Development. However, the paper was rewritten by Mr Gillespie with no reference back to his colleagues. I assume it was provided to Mr Reith's office in draft form and was rewritten accordingly. Mr Gillespie refocused the paper on the confrontationist option and that led to the sacking of the work force on 7 April.</para><para>According to the now famous 10 March minute from Mr Gillespie to Mr Reith, it was intended that the 27 February paper provide the basis for a meeting with the Prime Minister. I am advised that the strategy outlined in the paper—sack the entire work force to get the MUA—was presented to the Prime Minister before Dr Webster's consultancy commenced, and he explicitly endorsed the plan. The Prime Minister was also kept 
 up-to-date on the progress of the plan as it was fleshed out by Dr Webster, the National Farmers Federation and Patrick's. What this government now confronts is an economic and political disaster of its own making. It set about building a plan to destroy a union. It is going to fail, and it is going to get into a lot of trouble over it. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>2874</page.no><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGAURAN</name><name.id>WH4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The government rejects the general business motion which is listed under Senator Faulkner's name. The first thing I note is that Senator Faulkner was not here to move his own motion. Instead, it was moved by Senator O'Brien, who brought nothing new to this long, drawn-out saga on the waterfront—and there is more to come. Senator O'Brien attempted to construct what we have heard before, but in some sort of new smoke and mirror fashion—that what Patrick's has undertaken is illegal and that the courts have found it to be illegal. Well, they have not. They have not found the restructuring by Patrick's to be at all illegal. A prima facie case has been established and the main case is still to be undertaken.</para></talk.start><para><inline font-style="italic">Senator Carr interjecting</inline>—</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGAURAN</name></talker><para>—The motion that is before the Senate is based on the false premise that Patrick's hire companies are illegal entities; they are not.

We await, Senator Carr, some of those commercial decisions and realities which the administrators are now pondering over. It is important to say that because the government would not be supporting any company for any reason if they undertook their affairs illegally.

Did anyone notice that Senator O'Brien did not once mention the reforms that are so necessary down on the waterfront? His defence of the MUA really was a case of the means justifying the end. The end, for those 
 on the other side of the House, is that the MUA stay in their established form as the most powerful union within the trade union movement, as the supplier of funds and the propper-upper of the Labor Party, and all their rorts and extortions down on the waterfront continue beyond the year 2000 into the next century.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The truth is that the motion before the Senate is an exercise in defending the indefensible. It is yet another strident defence of the MUA by the Labor Party because, as I said, the MUA pays the bulk of the bills of the Labor Party. It dominates the union movement. The MUA leaders are notorious rorters and extortionists. This dates way back to the fathers of the union—way back to the Second World War, when they held our waterfront to ransom through shocking behaviour, when our fighting troops were denied supplies and arms. It was utterly against the national interest. This is what happened way back in the 1940s. Those fathers of the union have not changed at all. The MUA—under another name; that is all—is behaving in the same way.</para><para>This is not a union representing the working class or the battlers of Australia; I wish it was. For example, a crane driver, for 14 hours work a week, can be paid over $90,000. This is a practice which adds costs to our exports and to our imports. They are sacrificing the jobs of other workers. This has a cascading effect through all industries throughout Australia.</para><para>While all this vitriol is being heaped upon Patrick's throughout this dispute, the most interesting development in the last couple of days has been the entry of P&amp;O into this debate. They are now demanding fundamental reforms which are no different from Patrick's. For months now, the Labor Party have been demonising Patrick's, saying, `Why can't Patrick's be like P&amp;O?' How ironic! Like Patrick's, P&amp;O are now demanding reforms on the waterfront, because their workplace agreements are only now falling due. P&amp;O were just biding their time. Don't think P&amp;O are on your side; they are more like Patrick's than Patrick's are like them.</para><para>As the realities of the marketplace hit home to those opposite and to the MUA, and as the debate drags on, the government's determination is proven. In the coming weeks the MUA have two choices: to reform their work practices and change the culture down on the waterfront, or leave. Those are their two choices. They will take the latter, you wait and see. Should they be foolish enough to take the latter, there are others willing to take up the jobs that they will walk out on, such as the NFF-run P&amp;C Stevedores. However, we will wait and see how the MUA deal with the market realities that they face in the coming weeks.</para><para>One obvious factor throughout this whole waterfront dispute has been the importance which the MUA have placed on public relations. We have all noticed it—the gloss over and above the substance. With regard to winning media opinion, they have certainly done that to a great extent—none more so than the ABC. They have won the ABC over to their side, there is no doubt about that, but that is never hard to do.</para><para>John Coombs has been so conscious of reshaping his public image that he has called in Jane Singleton on a daily basis to get advice, to whack on the make-up, to know what to say and how to dress up. Jane Singleton is reshaping John Coombs. The tough, rough nut from the waterfront is now looking just a little more decent before the cameras. He is all done up by the public relations people. So the usual grand gesture of the deluders is now occurring. They have been on their way to the picket lines to support their brothers in arms in the MUA.</para><para>These self-deluders have made ridiculous comparisons of the MUA to Poland's Solidarity movement and South Africa's union movement against apartheid. Only last night in this chamber, Senator Forshaw was idealising the MUA, making comparisons with the Polish struggle against communism or the union struggles—and good struggles they were—against apartheid in South Africa. The truth of the matter is John Coombs is no Lech Walesa, no matter how the public relations departments dress him up. He is more like an Arthur Scargill, who, if you remember, was 
 paid by the Russian communists at the time he brought England to its knees when he carried out his strikes.</para><para>Sure as can be, the MUA is no Solidarity, nor is their cause. They do not represent the Aussie battlers, particularly on their hourly rates. Was the union movement so strident—the ACTU and their political allies across there—when the timber workers lost their jobs against the ridiculous ambit claims by the green movements? When the Ravenshoe workers lost their jobs up in Queensland several years ago, was the union movement defending their jobs? They were battlers, they were working class, they were driven from their jobs: where were you?</para><para>But you were all out on the platforms and the pickets with the MUA, the money men of the union. Best estimates are they have $20 million cash in their bank account. They are going to need it for all their legal fees. That is why you succumb to the MUA's call and not to the call of the battlers and the real workers from Ravenshoe when they were driven out of their jobs. They are the working-class people who deserve a strong and decent union and a strong political arm. The point is, the general public are not fooled by this; you are fooled, you are self-deluders, the general public are not.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Senator Carr interjecting</inline>—</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGAURAN</name></talker><para>—We are willing to go to an election on that, Senator Carr, if you so wish. I would have thought, for all the expenses the union is paying for public relations that the public relations department would not have made such a huge error, at least in Victoria, when they wheeled out Joan Kirner and Bill Kelty to have their pictures taken on the picket lines. For all Victorians, this brings back memories of the worst possible face of the union. Isn't Joan Kirner best remembered as the Premier who drove the state into its gloomiest and darkest period, its most depressing period, all because she was then a captive of John Halfpenny's Trades Hall Council? And isn't Bill Kelty best known and remembered for his `blood in the streets' comments during the last election? On both occasions, it cost you votes and it cost you a public image before the people of 
 Victoria. It cost you elections, but you still wheel out the two of them. I invite you to keep wheeling them out before the cameras and in the newspapers, and have them on the picket lines. It only proves the point that these people are the friends of the MUA, that these people are self-deluding.

That is something Senator O'Brien never talked about. Yet that is the substance of this debate. That is looking beyond the public relations exercise by the union and the union know that the reform that is going to occur is just a matter of time. A great deal has been said in regard to what reform can be achieved on the waterfront and in the past few weeks we have seen the publication of the Productivity Commission handed down. It is a damning document for just how inefficient our ports have been. You can add the Productivity Commission's report to the pile of other documents about the inefficiencies of the waterfront—several of them were produced by the Labor government.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Given the Asian economic crisis, it is now imperative that this government moves to reform our waterfront. Time has run out for Australia and, therefore, time has run out for the MUA. To this end, the government has recently published seven benchmarks which it seeks to achieve. The first one is overmanning. Quite frankly, even the MUA's leader John Coombs concedes that there is definitely an overmanning problem down on the waterfront. Improved productivity: that is a very general term, but we can bring it down to the benchmark of crane rates. Australia's average is some 18 container lifts per hour and we are seeking a benchmark of 25, which we believe is achievable.</para><para>I shall give an example as a measure of what 18 means and how inefficient 18 container lifts per hour is. I have just returned from parts of southern Africa where I was part of a political delegation. We visited Mozambique—a war-torn country for more than 25 years which has just made peace. It is now in the infancy of its democracy. The main capital—Maputo—was basically boarded up just four years and the port has just be 
 come operational again over the last couple of years.</para><para>P&amp;O Australia have bought the management rights for this port and own some 30 per cent of it. It intends it to be a major container port for the southern African region. Their equipment is antiquated, their docks are basically bombed out, and their workers are incredibly inexperienced. They have really only been going for the last couple of years.</para><para>To P&amp;O Australia's credit, they see a future in this area. They are lifting 16 containers per hour with antiquated equipment and with inexperienced workers. They have told us that within 12 months, once they get these workers up and running an operation, they will surpass Australia's 18. There is a benchmark that we cannot even match in a bombed out country that has been war-torn for the past 25 years. They have a great deal of hope in that country and it would be a disgrace to see Australia surpassed by the efforts of P&amp;O in Mozambique. So overmanning is the problem.</para><para>The third problem is greater reliability. Australian ports have the worst strike rate in the world. The level of industrial action on the waterfront in 1996 was 1,250 working days lost per thousand employees. Just as a measure, compare that with the rest of the Australian economy. Against 1,250 working days lost per thousand employees, only 135 working days were lost per thousand employees in all other industries. This is a ratio of 10:1 compared with other industries in Australia. As two per cent of the world's shipping trade is in Australia, the waterfront has the highest level of industrial unrest in the world—23 per cent of working days lost on the waterfront across the world. We are the worst strikers in the world: little wonder that is a benchmark.</para><para>Occupational health and safety is the fourth of the seven benchmarks the government is attempting to achieve. The fifth is lower stevedoring costs. Of course, with greater  stevedoring competition—like the NFF's P&amp;C—lower costs will be established by market pressure. The sixth benchmark  relates to making the best use of new technologies, which will require a massive capital injection 
 by the existing and new stevedores. And of course, training is the seventh item.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>AW5</name.id><name role="metadata">CARR</name><name role="display">Senator Carr</name></talker><para>—Where were the registered trainers down on the wharves?

Experience will make them better, but this is no complicated job and it can be done better. They have proven it, particularly some of the young women who are driving the big cranes. They have greater concentration and greater work effort than many of the MUA workers. Not all the MUA workers are to blame—it is the leadership and the thuggery clique that they have around them.

Regardless of who is involved in a particular issue, the very concept of allowing employers or anyone with a contractual obligation to escape those obligations—to employees or to any other creditor—through corporate restructuring is an extremely dangerous and evil concept. For any government of the day to even hint at—and this government did not hint; it was forthright about it—support for any corporate asset strippers, is a serious misjudgment. The outcry from those of all political persuasions against this assault on our moral and legal values has surprised many of those who thought that bashing 
 wharfies was an easy way to get electoral support.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The fact is that if corporations are allowed to set up subsidiaries, are allowed to withdraw their assets and their financing and then to declare them bankrupt so that they can avoid their contractual obligations, then we are all at risk. It is not just employees; it is creditors, bankers—their contracts could be affected by such restructuring, landlords. tenants, the small business people whom Minister Reith recently put a fair trading act through to protect, and it is any supplier. When this restructuring device was activated by the Patrick group, a shiver of fear went through numerous people who realised that their contractual obligations could be avoided by the same device.</para><para>This is not a new issue. It has been raised before in the bottom-of-the-harbour days, and it was raised and covered in 1988 by the Law Reform Commission when it conducted a general insolvency inquiry. As a part of that inquiry the commission considered the possibility of making related companies liable for the debts of an insolvent company in certain circumstances, and the commission recommended that companies should be so liable. Because of that advice which was given to the Labor government of the day by the Law Reform Commission, the Australian Democrats have constructed an amendment to the Corporations Law which is to be debated in the next session. The amendment will seek to prevent corporate groups from stripping assets from insolvent companies to prevent payments to employees or to any other creditors. We hope that we will get the support of the Senate to end the practice, but I think the point made by Senator O'Brien is that this is a little late; it is bolting the stable door too late—the horse is gone. We have to hope that the courts will regard this means of avoiding obligations to employees as not only improper, not only immoral, but hopefully they will regard it as illegal.</para><para>The Australian Democrats have clearly put on the record their dislike of any system which applauds the wholesale sacking of 1,400 workers because they belong to a union. It does not matter whether they belong 
 to the MUA, a communist union, a farmers union or any other kind of union; it is wrong to sack workers because they belong to a union. It is just as wrong to avoid the obligations you are required to have as an employer by structuring or restructuring your assets and your companies in such a way that employee entitlements cannot be paid. It has not missed the attention of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), of other ministers and of the Senate that that same device has recently been used on the workers of Cobar and Woodlawn and has affected them. Pretty soon, we will all have tenants or suppliers or banks or somebody else who is a creditor knocking on our doors and squealing about this. Over and above the adversarial politics of who loves and who hates what, we must pay attention to the very real dangers identified in this motion that corporate asset stripping poses for anyone who has a contractual obligation and who can avoid it by what I regard as shonky, sneaky, improper actions using a device to be abhorred.</para><para>We hope that the amendment we are putting up will make this practice exceptionally difficult in future. I am aware that the Labor Party have further amendments, and I would hope that the government would move to support them. If the government's intention was to reform the waterfront, to damage their own case so savagely by even pretending or starting to support any kind of activity which smacks of such immorality is a very silly thing to have done because, as a result of it, large sections of the community have been turned against the very objective they were trying to achieve.</para><para>I do not have much more to say on this issue. I think the Senate should condemn the government for condoning the practice of asset stripping. They should not confuse the objective of improving productivity on the wharves—an objective supported by the Labor Party, the Democrats, the coalition, the MUA and the employers; we differ over the means, not the objective—with allowing companies to behave in a manner which avoids their contractual responsibilities and obligations and puts families at risk. Next time it could be the families of farmers, next 
 time it could be the families of retail tenants or the families of some supplier. It is just not the proper behaviour for government to agree with. I was deeply distressed and ashamed that ministers of the crown could have supported and applauded such behaviour. Accordingly, I indicate that the Democrats will support the motion moved by the opposition.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>2879</page.no><name role="metadata">McKiernan, Sen James</name><name role="display">Senator McKIERNAN</name><name.id>1I4</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I commend Senator Murray, my Western Australian Democrat colleague, on the content of the speech that he has just made to the Senate.

Senator McGauran embarked rather on an attack on the Maritime Union of Australia, the trade union movement in general and the Labor Party as well—all lumped in together.</para></talk.start><para>To help people who might want to understand what this debate is about, I repeat for the record the text of the notice of motion by the Leader of the Opposition (Senator Faulkner) and moved and spoken to so admirably by my colleague Senator O'Brien earlier this afternoon. The motion reads:</para><para>That the Senate condemns the Government for condoning the practice of asset-stripping companies in order to evade the normal contractual responsibilities of employers to their employees, as evidenced by Government support for the corporate re-structuring and asset-stripping of Patrick Stevedores' labour hire companies.</para><para>I am tempted to seek to amend the motion to not only delete the word `condoning' but also insert the words `the government jumping into bed with the various individuals who have operated around Patrick Stevedores'. It is becoming more and more evident day by day as further evidence is brought to the attention of the public that senior figures—senior ministers in this government, senior figures in ministers offices and senior identities in a number of government departments—have been up to their necks in the conspiracy to destroy the Maritime Union of Australia, and they have done it by the foulest means possible. They have done it by illegal means and 
 they seek to cover their tracks. The law, it seems, is actually bigger than even senior figures in this government, as three very recent decisions of the courts have upheld. I refer to two decisions—one in the full court of the Federal Court and a later decision of the High Court of Australia.</para><para>This whole debacle began in February 1996 when the then opposition spokesperson on transport promised that a coalition government would, if elected, break the grip of the Maritime Union of Australia. Mr Sharp said that in 1996. It would seem the government has held to that promise since it has been elected. As a result, we have seen major disruption in various ports throughout Australia, in ports where there has been no industrial disputation for a large number of years. Yet the individuals employed were sacked merely because they were members of the Maritime Union of Australia.</para><para>Who were the major players in the game? There have been many and some have been named by my colleague Senator O'Brien and other speakers today. The main character in all of this, I would suggest, was Mr Chris Corrigan. Mr Corrigan now needs no introduction to the people of Australia. He certainly needs no introduction to corporate Australia and the trade union movement in Australia. His actions, since he took over Patrick Stevedores, have had one main objective—not necessarily to make a profit for his organisation, which essentially should be what he was appointed to do—which is to break a trade union.</para><para>The game has not been fully played out yet. Perhaps at the end it will be Mr Corrigan who is broken. Already Mr Corrigan has, out of his own mouth, been exposed to be a liar of the highest order. He misled, deceived and lied openly in order to advance his objective about breaking a union and sacking the employees of his company. All of this is on the public record. Unfortunately, it is not on the public record in the detail that would allow every individual in our society to understand the type of character Mr Corrigan is and the types of people that he is dealing with.  </para><para>I want to use the time of the Senate this afternoon, when speaking about this asset-stripping exercise, to read into the record the transcript of a meeting that occurred between Mr Corrigan, Mr Michael Wells and Mr Peter Kilfoyle. Mr Wells and Mr Kilfoyle were the operators of a company called Fynwest. Fynwest achieved notoriety for the fact that it organised, hired and arranged for a number of Australians to be recruited to its company before moving to the port of Dubai in the Middle East to be trained as waterside workers. The meeting that I refer to occurred on 31 January this year, after the Dubai exercise had been exposed. I quote in part:</para><para>Corrigan	 . . . I have to have credibility. If I tell a blatant lie and I really know what the answer is, and down the track something emerges, then my credibility is shot and then the next phases won't work.</para><para>Wells		 But you have already said you weren't involved.</para><para>Corrigan	 Mmm, I've hedged around and in more recent times I've hedged deliberately so in fact there's a trail now that says I've been equivocal. That might sound subtly different but it is actual important in the sphere. I'm not protecting myself, I'm protecting the overall scheme. But in the end game it may be that I have some credibility anyway, so I can't just come out and totally deny it. So it may be, depending on how it emerges, it may be that I have to `fess up. If I `fess up, I certainly am going to say that I did not know these people were serving military people, and I most certainly would say that I wouldn't have done it that way had I known.</para><para>Kilfoyle	 That what annoys me with Dubai, I know you don't agree with me, but there was no—</para><para>I am not sure about this next word; I do not know whether I should say it or not. It is somewhat of a profanity which refers to a particular part of the male anatomy—</para><para>saying look here is the document, this is a legal thing that we are doing. We needed a . . . from Fynwest, nothing more. To get up and say, hey, this is all legal, here is the letter from the CO, here's the clause from the army saying they can bloody do it . . .  
</para><para>Corrigan	 It would only work if the person releasing the press statement is credible. The structure we had in place was fatal from the beginning because Fynwest or whomever could have come out with a press statement, but the facts of the matter are that Fynwest couldn't say where the money was coming from, couldn't say who the principal was, and at the end of the day, I have to remind you, you contradicted your colleague here on day one about where they were going to work. The credibility of Fynwest from day one was chopped to pieces and so you could have come out with all the statements that you liked, but the press wouldn't have had a bloody penny of it.</para><para>Kilfoyle	 That's because there was no credible person, as far as a press person to bloody handle it. If that would have happened and we had another week Dubai, we would have had these guys right.</para><para>Corrigan	 I know that. We made that mistake and at the end of the day it was structurally a disaster. Remember why we made the mistake, because we thought we were able to keep it a secret. And we didn't. If we thought it through clearly enough, we would have said to ourselves, we'd never keep this a secret, we've got to . . . the structure that allows us to be credible.</para><para>I am actually quoting verbatim from those statements, and if the grammar is not correct, it is not necessarily my fault. This is an intriguing document in relation to this meeting of people who, at this particular point in time, were bedfellows in breaching the law and attacking the working people of this country through the MUA. They were acting as agents for the federal government at this particular point in time.</para><para>Since the meeting on 31 January, they have indeed fallen out, and Mr Wells has gone public with his declarations that were published in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> newspaper a couple of days ago. So what we have here is actually what occurred prior to the falling out. Corrigan is an interesting character, and there are some more quotable quotes from this meeting that will serve the record well. I quote again from the transcript:</para><para>Corrigan	 From a political point of view everybody needs this to go away. It's be 
 come politically bad news. Now I agree with you, it's not right, but it doesn't matter whether it's right or wrong. You only have to read the press, they constantly want to link these things up and get Patricks in the middle of it say. Patricks is the common thread through here. What they're trying to do is to link everything up into this giant conspiracy leading up to Government.

But if you ring them up and tell them `You will get a job' and one of these blokes goes to the press and says `I've been told I will get a job', finished.

But, for them to get this off the ground they've got 76 problems, problem children.</para><para>Corrigan	 I don't look at it like that. At the end of the day that's not the point. These people, we owe these people a chance to have a go. That is the way I look at it. That is the facts. They are not problems, they are opportunities. What we've got to do is work out how to minimize the problem to give these blokes a fair go. Okay.</para><para>Kilfoyle	 May I say . . . </para><para>Corrigan	 The only way to do that, the only way to do that, is to close this off and somehow to give these people the hint that they will be given a good hearing over here. Which they will be, I can assure.</para><para>Kilfoyle	 What do you call a good hearing Chris? The records stand as they are.</para><para>Corrigan	 They are going to get jobs, but you can't tell them that.</para><para>Kilfoyle	 I realise that. Okay that's all I wanted to know.   
</para><para>Corrigan	 I'm going to go out of here tomorrow, we reach an agreement today. I'm going to go over there with all the list.

The minute this thing arises, the minute this thing arises, the Farmers are going to say `We want nothing to do with them' because they can't afford to. It has to be very delicately handled.</para><para>It seems that Mr Corrigan in his wisdom at that particular point in time was, despite what he said earlier, worried about the press reaction to what they were doing. They were worried about their own people—the mercenaries they had recruited to send to Dubai to train as waterside workers. They were worried that these loyal individuals that they had recruited to take the jobs of other Australians were worried about what was going to happen to them when they fronted up to the National Farmers Federation front company that was going to take jobs on the waterfront.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>AW5</name.id><name role="metadata">CARR</name><name role="display">Senator Carr</name></talker><para>—The courts were what they should have really been worried about.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>1I4</name.id><name role="metadata">McKiernan, Sen James</name><name role="display">Senator McKIERNAN</name></talker><para>—They were worried about the courts, but they were also obviously worried about the public relations at that particular point in time.

The Australian public has not accepted the right of the government, the National Farmers Federation or any company to go in in the dead of night and take the jobs of workers using thugs disguised in balaclavas, carrying weapons and using dogs. That action has backfired on the government. Public opinion is telling them so.</para></talk.start></continue><para>It may be that certain sections of the public are not as friendly to waterside workers or MUA workers as some of us are. I do not have a problem with saying that I have been 
 down to the picket lines and stood by my colleagues, representatives of the workers. Some people do not know the full story of what happens on the waterfront. They do not know about the dangers or the levels of incomes of those people. Some people have swallowed—hook, line and sinker—the propaganda that was put out, particularly by Minister Reith, about the earning power of waterside workers. However, they are learning.</para><para>Whatever they feel about waterside workers, they are not going to stand for the terrorist type activities that were engaged in with the complicity of ministers of the Crown. They are not going to stand for those tactics. They condemn them, and they are quite proper in condemning them. In condemning the government, they are condemning Mr Corrigan and his ilk for what they, in turn, have done on the waterfronts of Australia. The actions that we have seen in the last six or eight months in particular, starting with Cairns and continuing through to Dubai and then to all the ports of Australia, are un-Australian activities and they are condemned.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>2882</page.no><name role="metadata">Chapman, Sen Grant</name><name role="display">Senator CHAPMAN</name><name.id>FF4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Nothing underlines the fact that this resolution on asset-stripping of companies, which has been put forward today by the Labor opposition, has no substance whatsoever than the remarks we have just heard from Senator McKiernan. This motion seeks to condemn the government for allegedly condoning the practice of asset-stripping of companies in relation to Patrick Stevedores' labour hire companies and the current efforts to reform the waterfront.</para></talk.start><para>Senator McKiernan had the gall to stand up and condemn Senator McGauran for not addressing that resolution relating to asset-stripping, and yet we have just heard from Senator McKiernan for 20 minutes and he has also completely ignored this resolution—having just condemned Senator McGauran out of hand for not speaking about the details of the resolution. Senator McKiernan commented on the Federal Court and the High Court cases and then he gave a long and very boring reading of alleged transcripts of con 
 versations of people supposedly involved in waterfront reform.</para><para>Senator McKiernan said at the outset that the actions of those seeking waterfront reform had been illegal and had been declared illegal by the courts. That is not true. In its final decision on the appeal from the Federal Court, the High Court reinforced the role of the administrators in the management of Patrick Stevedores' labour hire companies. After the decision was handed down by the High Court, the MUA trumpeted victory in its court action against Patrick's, but it was no such thing. It was not a victory—and if it was, it was certainly a pyrrhic victory because the High Court declared very clearly that the future of Patrick's was to be left in the hands of the administrators and that they had the ultimate decision as to whether or not the MUA members would be re-employed.</para><para>Senator McKiernan went on to quote at great length from alleged transcripts of meetings, essentially regarding the Dubai training exercise. At one stage I heard him refer to alleged comments that said that the matters needed to be delicately handled. He said that that was evidence of a conspiracy and, perhaps, of a public relations problem. Again, it is evidence of no such thing. It is evidence of the history of thuggery and intimidation on the waterfront which has been engaged in by the MUA. Obviously, to avoid that intimidation and thuggery, matters have to be dealt with with a measure of experience and delicate handling—especially if the history of thuggery and intimidation from the MUA was not to succeed in this particular situation. That is what the reference was to.</para><para>Let me come back to this motion which alleges that the government is condoning asset-stripping in relation to Patrick Stevedores. Where is the evidence that the government has condoned that alleged asset-stripping?  No evidence whatsoever has been presented by either of the two Labor Party senators that we have heard speak in support of this motion today.</para><para>The only illegality that we have so far experienced in this matter is the illegality perpetrated by the Maritime Union of Australia itself, because in the Victorian Supreme 
 Court today Justice Beach has declared just that illegality. He has found the MUA to be in breach of his order regarding picketing and to be in contempt of court. The only illegality in relation to this matter has been declared in the Victorian Supreme Court today. Let that be an end to any claims of illegality from those opposite.</para><para> The Labor Party is locked into this illegal behaviour, because the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) himself has given support to these illegal pickets on the waterfront. Another senior Labor spokesman, Simon Crean, when asked while on the picket himself why he was breaking the law, replied, `No, I don't believe I'm breaking the law at all.' The Victorian Supreme Court has found today that they were breaking the law, and he was a participant in that—quite obviously—on that occasion.</para><para> We have the Labor Party continuing to support union heavies like Greg Combet who said, `Bad laws should not be respected.' I seem to remember a bloke called Don Dunstan who used to have that attitude too, and we know how South Australia finished up as a result of his years of maladministration. In relation to the Supreme Court, Dean Migehll said to `totally and absolutely ignore it' and Jennie George of the ACTU said something similar—that she would simply ignore the Supreme Court. John Coombs, the doyen of the MUA, says, `We cannot take legal action, so we'll take a bit of illegal industrial action.' There is where the attitude to the law on the part of the trade unions stands very clear in this dispute. They have no respect for the law whatsoever. Yet we find the Labor opposition coming in here, seeking to condemn the government and seeking to condemn Patrick's because of some `as yet to be proven' allegations of asset-stripping and the government allegedly condoning such activity.</para><para>The reality of this issue is that the MUA set out to break Patrick's, because Patrick's had the intestinal fortitude to stand up and say, `Enough is enough. The waterfront needs reform.' Enough certainly was enough for Patrick's, because it had lost $56 million due to the behaviour of the MUA over an extend 
 ed period of time. No wonder Patrick's stood up and said, `It is time we had some proper reform on the waterfront.' The industrial warfare in which the MUA has engaged has cost Patrick's $56 million and has sent it broke. That is what cost the wharfies their jobs when they were necessarily retrenched by the labour hire companies operating under Patrick's. </para><para>When people are retrenched, no-one wants to see people lose what entitlements they might legally have. The government is certainly willing to look at areas that might strengthen the rights of employees in a situation where there is illegal activity undertaken. But no illegal activity has been found in this matter.</para><para>In calling on the Senate to act on this issue today, both Senator Faulkner and Senator O'Brien—Senator Faulkner gave notice of the motion and sent Senator O'Brien in to do his dirty work for him—are actually asking the Senate to condemn their own laws. These are laws that were put in place by the previous Labor government. The Corporations Law, as it stands in relation to this matter, is not a law of the Liberal-National party government; it is a law that was put in place by the previous government and that has been there for 13 years without any changes. So if there is any substance in this matter, let us sheet home the blame to where it belongs, and that is to the previous Labor government—not the present government at all.</para><para>The proposals to make some changes to this law as a result of this issue are designed to protect employee entitlements. But it needs to be remembered that this issue crosses boundaries between the Corporations Law, industrial law and policies. It is a complex issue when an employer is insolvent. Attempting to protect employee entitlements in that situation is not something that can be fixed with a snap of the fingers as the opposition seem to be suggesting. The fact is there are already widespread provisions within the Corporations Law to protect employees in these circumstances. </para><para><inline font-style="italic">Senator Conroy interjecting</inline>—</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>FF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Chapman, Sen Grant</name><name role="display">Senator CHAPMAN</name></talker><para>—The other thing that needs to be remembered is that there are some 
 one million corporations in Australia which would be affected by changes to the Corporations Law. It is very important that we do not have any unforeseen and undesirable consequences as a result of changes to the Corporations Law.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Senator Conroy has been interjecting here in the last few minutes. He is a member of the Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities which I chair. He would know only too well the very detailed process that has been gone through on the current areas of the Corporations Law that are being reformed through the CLERP. A lot of study has been done on the need for change and on the areas that require change. Draft legislation has been published, comments have been sought on the draft legislation and now we finally have bills before our committee for consideration. To have a knee-jerk reaction because some alleged issue has arisen—to immediately advocate some changes to the Corporations Law without at all examining what the unintended consequences of those changes might be for companies not in any way involved in the situation that is extant—would be very unwise indeed.</para><para> The other thing that needs to be remembered is that the Corporations Law is a cooperative scheme that relies on the cooperation of state and territory governments, and changes to the Corporations Law have to be processed through the Ministerial Council for Corporations. It would be quite without precedent for the federal government to support any amendments to the Corporations Law which firstly have not been examined by that Ministerial Council.</para><para>The government has, however, taken steps to examine the issue. At a recent meeting of state and territory ministers for labour, the Departments of Labour Advisory Committee has been asked to undertake a detailed examination of the matter, including consultation with all affected parties. The Departments of Labour Advisory Committee is going to report to the next meeting of the council of labour ministers. The government has responded to this issue but it is doing so in a proper and considered way in order to examine all of the issues, see if any necessary reforms are 
 needed and determine the process that needs to be undertaken for those reforms.</para><para>Let us not have any suggestion—as we have in this motion today—that the government is condoning any alleged improper activity on the part of a corporation to deny its employees their entitlements. That is simply a red herring that the opposition seeks to draw across the real issue, which is the continued intransigence of the Maritime Union of Australia to accede to any waterfront reform. This reform becomes more urgent as every day goes by.</para><para>The reason the Labor Party want to avoid focusing on this issue is that they completely failed in their limited attempts to reform the waterfront. That is notwithstanding the fact that they threw $420 million at the issue for a few years in attempts to buy people out of their jobs. They acknowledged, when they embarked on their limited process of reform, that the waterfront was about 50 per cent overmanned.</para><para>Instead of taking firm action to deal with that problem, they simply threw money at it and sought to buy people's retirement by offering them golden handshakes. A number of people took those golden handshakes. What happened? Not long after taking those golden handshakes, in many instances they returned to the waterfront as part-time or casual employees. It did not achieve the efficiencies that were required.</para><para>Even with the limited reduction in manning levels that were achieved, the real reforms were never achieved. The rorts and problems that are inherent on the waterfront and that have been detailed over many weeks now—such as the nick-offs, the double time and so on—remain. They are the rorts and the problems that this government is intent on dealing with and finding a solution to so that we have world's best practice on the Australian waterfront. That is absolutely required by this country because of its dependence on export earnings as a major generator of the nation's and the community's wealth. We need to proceed with that issue.</para><para>That is where the previous government failed. They did not give Australian industry—and all of the workers in all of 
 Australia's industries that are dependent on the waterfront—the benefit of that reform process. Instead what Labor gave employees was high interest rates and high unemployment. It continued to protect the MUA's monopoly situation on our waterfront.</para><para>In contrast, the Howard Liberal-National Party government is determined to take those important issues head-on and find solutions to them. That is why we have been prepared to support Patricks. As I said earlier, Patricks was prepared to stand up and say, `Enough is enough. We are going to be part of a waterfront reform process.' They were driven to that by the fact that they were sent bankrupt by the thuggery and inefficiency of the members of the MUA on the Australian waterfront.</para><para>The reform is absolutely essential. It is interesting to note that reform is achievable, despite the fact that the MUA says that they are working at their best capacity. They have brought forward bogus reports to say that the crane rates are highly efficient—I think the claimed rate was 19, as published in a study by the MUA a few weeks ago. They say that that is the best we can do in Australia.</para><para>It is interesting to note that today the MUA admits that productivity on the Australian waterfront has increased by up to 10 per cent since action was taken by Patricks and others to bring this matter to a head and seek proper reform on the waterfront. It is the old saying: `Nothing concentrates the mind like knowing you are going to be hanged in the morning.' That is exactly what has happened with the MUA. They are now confronted with the reality of their future employment and job security because of the actions they took in the past sending one company broke. P&amp;O is now signing on to the government's reform program. It is signing on to achieving the seven waterfront benchmarks that we have established. The MUA know that the game is up and that unless some improvement is found rapidly their jobs are in jeopardy.</para><para>Now that they are back at work we see productivity up by 10 per cent. That productivity improvement must continue. Ten per cent is a start, but it is certainly not enough to achieve the benchmarks that the govern 
 ment has established. That reform process must be maintained and strengthened. We must have an end to the industrial warfare upon which the MUA has embarked which has cost Patricks $56 million and which costs each ship $25,000 a day when it is held up in a port.</para><para>In Adelaide last weekend we saw the MUA refuse to allow P&amp;O waterfront employees to load a scrap metal ship bound for the United States because that contract was originally a Patricks contract. Supposedly, Patricks was back in business with their employees returning to work but, because of the industrial action, Patricks had subcontracted that work to P&amp;O and that subcontract remained in force. The MUA refused to allow the P&amp;O waterfront employees to load that ship and were attempting to insist that the reinstated employees of Patricks would load it. Because of the dispute initiated by the MUA, the ship remained idle for several days. As I recollect, in the end a third stevedoring company, Sealand, finished up loading that ship. It hired the Patrick employees on a temporary basis.</para><para>That is the sort of nonsense that the MUA carries on with. Even when the dispute was resolved and the opportunity was there for them to return to work, they wanted immediately to overturn plans that had been put in place as a direct consequence of their own earlier industrial action. There is clearly an attitude in the MUA that they are not willing to compromise and not willing to meet the reform process. Their leader has made it very clear, on a number of occasions, that although they want to go back to work with Patricks they do not want to embark on any serious achievement of reform.</para><para>Again, it is worth noting today that P&amp;O has put up a proposal for there to be no strikes for the next six months on the waterfront. P&amp;O sought an order preventing any industrial action by MUA members at any terminal for the next six months, obviously as a precursor to developing more productive practices on the waterfront. What did MUA secretary John Coombs do? He described that proposal, the fact that there should not be any industrial disputes, as nonsense.</para><para>I would have thought after the past few months when many working hours have been lost through industrial disputation—and it was that which in the end forced Patrick to make their workers redundant, the fact that there were some 30-odd days of industrial action by their employees prior to the retrenchment of their workers—that surely the MUA has learnt from this experience. It is time that they accepted the need for waterfront reform, that they accepted the need for greatly improved productivity, that they accepted the need to get rid of all the rorts that have been so exhibited on the waterfront over many years in Australia, so that those industries whose lifeblood is dependent on an efficient waterfront can produce the wealth for this country. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>2886</page.no><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name><name.id>3L6</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I wish to rise again to discuss the role of Mr Peter Scanlon so that all senators can know and understand why it is totally inappropriate for the government to do business with him. This is a man who is at the centre of this argument. Government senators can try to ignore the sorts of people that they, through their government and Peter Reith, the minister for industrial relations, have got into bed with, because that is what they have done. Not a word has come from government senators about their attempts to breach their laws. Senator Chapman liked to talk about the laws of the land. The laws that the government senators voted for over there have put Peter Reith in the dock because that is where Peter Reith will end up. That is where Peter Scanlon will end up again. It is a breach of your government's laws that is going to see the embarrassment and the documents dragged out.</para></talk.start><para>Remember, it is Mr Peter Scanlon who had to resign as the chairman of the Victorian TAB when he was facing criminal charges. Mr Peter Scanlon is still under investigation by the National Crime Authority and not surprisingly has not been reappointed to any position within the Victorian government. Despite this, he has been hand-picked by Peter Reith and the coalition government to carry out waterfront reform. I would like to quote from Mr Ken Jarrett's statement to the court in March 1994, which shows clearly the 
 character of Mr Peter Scanlon and why this federal government should have nothing to do with him.</para><para>For those on the opposite side of the chamber who do not know who Ken Jarrett is, he was an intimate business associate, one of the key financial people at Elders during the 1980s—John Elliott's right-hand man. Peter Scanlon worked with Ken Jarrett for years. Ken Jarrett speaks with complete authority on Peter Scanlon and the scams, rorts and shams that went on inside Elders, which have been the subject of much debate in this chamber. So Ken Jarrett is a man in a position to talk about Peter Scanlon and the sort of bloke that he is. I start by quoting from paragraph 10, which states:</para><para>By the early 1980s Scanlon had become involved with strategy. He played the dominant role in the Elders and Carlton United Brewery merger transactions.</para><para>Paragraph 11 states:</para><para>At some time after the merger between Henry Jones IXL and Elders, Cowper moved to Monaco with Wiesener—</para><para>two of the other principals whose names continually recur when it comes to that Melbourne establishment club of spivs that took over some of the companies—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5L6</name.id><name role="metadata">FERRIS</name><name role="display">Senator Ferris</name></talker><para>—They're all your mates.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name></talker><para>—I don't think they are any of our mates, not by any shot, Senator Ferris. Ken Jarrett went on:</para></talk.start></continue><para>They both then ceased to be Directors of Henry Jones IXL. Cowper and Wiesener together established a business providing merchant banking and financial services in Monaco. I am aware that they continued to maintain associations with Elliott and Scanlon and, to an extent, with myself and other executives of Elders. They continued to identify opportunities for Elders.</para><para>So this is the man who was dealing with Elliott, who was dealing with Peter Scanlon. Paragraph 12 states:</para><para>In about June 1984 EXL, through a subsidiary Elders N.V., made an issue in Europe of convertible bonds having a face value of U.S. $160 million. The motivation for the issue was partly a need for EXL to raise capital and partly to enable executives of the company to take up financial interests in the company in a manner which could be self-funded. I believe the scheme to finance 
 executive participation was proposed initially by Bankers Trust. It was attractive to the intended beneficiaries in that it was expected that the bonds would increase in value as EXL prospered and it would enable them to maintain some control over the company.</para><para>Paragraph 13 states:</para><para>I became involved in discussions relating to the proposal initially with Wiesener and Elliott. By the time that issue was made Elliott, Scanlon, Wiesener, Cowper and Lord were, to my knowledge, aware of the executive participation.</para><para>So what you have happening here is a decision by Elders executives, including Ken Jarrett, to set up a hidden transaction where they became the beneficial owners of these bonds which gave them a significant controlling influence at Elders. That would be fine if they wanted to go out and raise  the money themselves, but that is not what actually happened.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">CAMPBELL</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Campbell</name></talker><para>—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order.

Of course, this government does not condone the practice of asset stripping companies in order to evade their normal contractual obligations and responsibilities. But in relation to the Patrick hire companies, it is an untested assertion that asset stripping took place in those companies. There is no evidence yet to prove or even convincingly suggest that asset stripping took place in the Patrick hire companies. In fact, it is quite the contrary.</para></talk.start><para>Patrick was an adequately funded company to the extent of $60 to $70 million. The proviso was that the unions observed the agreement and actually went to work. The companies only had an insufficient asset base 
 when the MUA waterfront union withdrew their labour for more than 40 days of a 90-day period. In other words, for almost half of the working days, the company was unable to supply labour to the waterfront because the union had withdrawn its labour; that is, $56 million of the company's assets walked out the gate with the MUA's labour. Just today, Mr Corrigan is quoted in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> in relation to this issue. He said:</para><para>. . . the supply contracts were structured so that every worker could earn $85,000 a year and the companies would still be profitable.</para><para>Is that evidence of a conspiracy? There is no moral mystery about if this company was asset stripped. What any responsible government should be concerned about—and, of course, we are—is that any political party which supports this sort of corporate thuggery, and any group which engages in tactics to deliberately smash a viable public company carrying out a job on behalf of Australia, stands condemned. Yet today, the opposition in the other place voted against the bill which will provide a levy on stevedoring companies to provide redundancy payments to waterfront workers affected by restructuring. Mr Beazley had, of course, already indicated his support for the MUA who have engaged in these actions. He said:</para><para>On the whole, the union movement has handled this quite well and I think they ought to go on handling it that way, that is, quite well.</para><para>So it is Mr Beazley, the Leader of the Opposition, who is condoning the behaviour and practices which should be held in contempt by all Australians. Justice Barry Beach in Victoria today agreed. He found the MUA are in fact in contempt of the Supreme Court in relation to his early ruling.

The taxpayers received no improvement in productivity on the waterfront for the $430 million which was spent just a few years ago on the WIRA process that Mr Beazley is now desperately trying to claim was reform. How many of those people who received redundancy payments under the WIRA process are still back at the waterfront?

In refusing to support this piece of legislation, they are ensuring that the stevedoring companies will benefit from the waterfront reform but the taxpayers will meet the bill. How fair is that? WIRA revisited! That 
 will mean waterfront reform at the expense of the taxpayers and not at the expense of those who will benefit, that is, the stevedoring companies.</para></talk.start></continue><para>John Coombs, the MUA's chardonnay socialist—self-declared, as he walked through his chardonnay grapevines—said on <inline font-style="italic">60 Minutes</inline>, `If there were Olympic games for crane drivers, we would win as many medals for crane driving as we do for swimming and other forms of athletics.' I wonder if the MUA would be more qualified for the Masters Games? In fact, on their performance to date, they would probably win a gold medal as masters of indolence.</para><para>All the noise that John Coombs and his colleagues are making about how misunderstood they are reminds me a bit of the boxer who boasts that he is the world champion at his sport but has never, ever taken on any challengers. And, like that boxer, John Coombs and the MUA will never be able to prove to Patricks—the subject of the motion before the chair—that they are as effective as other waterfront workers until they are prepared to have non-union labour on the docks working beside union members to export product for the wealth of this nation. Maybe that explains a lot about John Coombs's motivations for opposing waterfront reform.</para><para>The MUA waterfront workers should accept the challenge of competition—as Patricks have done in working with P&amp;O—and show just how good they can be at doing their jobs. They should not only say that they are the best but should want to show that they are the best—that they would win the stevedoring Olympics gold medal. And now, Patricks and this government are offering them the opportunity to prove it. They should remember that jobs on the waterfront in Patricks—the subject of this motion—only follow when employers have the money to pay their work force and that money comes from having contracts to undertake the export industries that the stevedoring companies are established to provide.</para><para>If the wharfies think that they are misunderstood, they have only got themselves to blame for their image problem. Peter Reith could not have got a more effective group of people from central casting to have rattled 
 those gates than those who turned up on the television screens that night. When I put this to the group of waterfront workers who came to visit me as part of their PR campaign through this building, they nodded and said, `But we were very proud of the boys and how they behaved on the waterfront that day.' And I said to them, `Well, Peter Reith could not have got a better lot from central casting.'</para><para>If they thought that was doing their union some very good PR, what would Jane Singleton have advised them to do? Remember this PR information kit that they brought with them when they visited me? I am sure they left it in many other offices around this building. It was packaged inside a folder that had half a ship, half a truck and a twisted set of piles on its cover. It was labelled, `The Docks'. What else needs to be said—half a truck, half a ship and a twisted set of piles. Like any other product at the end of the day, the waterfront product from Patricks or their colleague P&amp;O has to be marketed like any other product in the Australian marketplace. And to get customers, to get clients, to get contracts it actually has to offer something that Australian industry wants to buy, otherwise it is a product that will not sell.</para><para>Let us have a look at the Patricks product performance—thanks to the MUA. Our crane rates are well below international benchmarks. Industrial disputes are 10 times higher on the waterfront. We are talking about the employees of Patricks and the rorts, the overmanning, the low productivity and the unreliability of that work force. This product must be marketed to Australian industry to get them to buy contracts with Patricks—the subject of this motion. Why would anybody buy a contract with Patricks? What can Patricks deliver? And how can Patricks deliver to the employees of Australia—never mind to their own—when they are unable to provide the service that they offered when they signed their contracts?</para><para>Given the other products now available to service the wharves, and there are now—interestingly enough—quite a range of them, which would the consumer be likely to buy? Whose product would they choose if they went to the waterfront and had a look at what was available? There is no doubt about which 
 product they would choose: not the ones rattling the gates, not the ones throwing the bricks, not the ones calling ordinary Australian workers trying to do a job, `Dirty, filthy, stinking scabs.' That is not a product that belongs in Australia. That is the language of the 1950s. That is the language that belongs to a past era of industrial relations in this country.</para><para>It is certainly not in the spirit of Australians tolerant of one another in this society when one group of workers, going to work legitimately, face a barrage of stones, bricks and insults by a group of Australians who have chosen to stand at the gate at an illegal picket and abuse them. That is not a product that Australian companies want to service the contracts that they sign with Patricks, the subject of this motion.</para><para>The Labor Party's conspiracy with the MUA and the trade union is the one which should be condemned in this place today. And it has been condemned by all Australians—by four to one, in surveys that have been done all around this country. I have no doubt that the Leader of the Opposition and his colleagues in this place today, if they were honest, would admit that that is the information they have been receiving along with the Ray Martin program, along with the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline>, along with the Saulwick poll and various other polls that have been done around Australia.</para><para>In 1996 Labor were told by the unions to oppose the Workplace Relations Act reforms and—surprise, surprise—they did as they were told. Labor are now being told to oppose the government's reforms to the waterfront, and they are doing as they are told all over again. They were told to oppose them, and this morning they did. They would rather have the taxpayers of this country pay for the inevitable redundancies on the waterfront than let the stevedoring companies be levied, quite legitimately, to pay for the reforms that they themselves will ultimately benefit from.</para><para>This week the Labor shadow cabinet again did the unions' bidding by deciding to oppose the $250 million redundancy package for any waterfront workers who are found to be redundant under the waterfront reform process 
 by Patrick, the subject of this motion before the chamber today. Today the Labor opposition again did what it had been told to do: it opposed the $250 million redundancy legislation, and did so by voting against it in the other place just this morning.</para><para>Unlike Tony Blair's New Labour who were able to do so and whom the opposition can only dream of emulating—never mind the labels the opposition try to pin upon themselves—the Labor Party have not been able to cut the umbilical cord from the trade union moneybox. They are still tied by those silken threads to the union movement's treasure chest and the training college that has delivered so many members into this place. Now they are even being told what to say and how to say it. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) has already told the other place that they are using MUA research to `craft' his public statements about the waterfront. Talk about ventriloquists' dummies! I will leave my colleagues to decide who the Charlie McCarthy doll is.</para><para>Now that P&amp;O is also publicly conceding that the MUA's work practices leave a lot to be desired, are they going to be accused of conspiracy and collusion as well? Are we going to see Senator Conroy trawling the history books around the world, making trips to Europe to trawl the Swiss bank accounts to see what he can find in the P&amp;O company, as he has done with Patrick, the subject of this motion before the chamber? How long before we see union and non-union workers standing side by side at P&amp;O? How long before we see them working together at P&amp;O? And realistically, how long before we see them working side by side at Patrick, the subject of this motion before the chamber today?</para><para>We simply cannot lose sight of what this wider community debate is really about. All this week they have been trawling everywhere—and I do not blame them for trying to take the heat off the absolutely crushing budget that they have had to deal with in the last couple of days and that, I suppose, they will try to deal with tonight—and looking up every dictionary to find every word that means conspiracy. In their desperate search to find a villain and a victim, they have today 
 come up with this motion to condemn a company. And there is no evidence for their claims. The chairman of Patrick has said today that there was no conspiracy; the companies were adequately funded; and $53 million was available.</para><para>And did you note that Mr Corrigan said in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> this morning that he was prepared to pay every waterfront worker an average of $86,000? Well, that is not bad. These people are not strugglers and battlers; they are very well paid Australians. And the only comment I would make on that is, `Let them be well paid Australians, but let them, like the rest of Australia—the nurses, the police, the teachers—do an honest day's work for the $86,000 that Mr Corrigan is expected to pay them.' This waterfront reform process is about making our ports more competitive, and that will be good news for all Australians, and perhaps even for Senator Conroy, who can relax and look up other words in his dictionary instead of `conspiracy', in his desperate search to nail the Elders conspiracy to this one, when there is no evidence for it and there are assertions that it does not exist. It is a desperate search to try to move the process away from the budget. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>2896</page.no><name role="metadata">Collins, Sen Jacinta</name><name role="display">Senator JACINTA COLLINS</name><name.id>GB6</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I was querying what to use in the brief amount of time we have left.

Because who can think of Dorothy without her supporting cast? I look across at this government and I find the audition hall overflowing for the parts of the lion without courage, the tin man without a heart, and perhaps most oversubscribed of all, the scarecrow without a brain. So somewhere over the rainbow, there you'll find the Treasurer, far up and away, and off with the bluebirds on his technicolour journey, skipping and singing, singing and skipping.</para><para>We all have our sustaining fantasies, Madam President, and listening to this budget on Tuesday night I realised that we're not in Kansas any more.	Because only in the Treasurer's fantasies can there be good in this 
 budget surplus built on a million small deficits in the lives of ordinary people. The teeth are not fixed. The pills are not bought. The kids in backyard care, or the mother out of work. The apprenticeships not found. The holiday not taken because of the cost of a mother's nursing home. The university degree out of reach, and the fulfilling career therefore not had. The shame of the young school leaver's hundredth unsuccessful job interview. The corroding despair of the long-term jobless, and the alarm of their families. The grief of the parent farewelling a child leaving town for good. The factory closed. The trauma of selling-up and moving. The hundred unspoken small goodbyes of ordinary people to their ordinary lives.</para><para>These are the human losses on which this accountants' surplus was built by a government that has long ceased—or has never learned—to care. And these indeed are the hard yards. The long haul. The shouldered burden of battling Australians that somehow fuels the happiness of a Treasurer long unacquainted with the ordinary needs of his fellow Australians. The griefs and consolations, and the quiet unprotested sufferings which underpin the triumph of his numbers and the failure of his government's decency.</para><para>The government will have you believe that all the pain was essential. It was not. If it was essential, why did Tuesday's budget contain spending increases of $10 billion over the next four years? If it was essential, why is it that when we look at the effect on financial year 1998-99 of the three Costello budgets, we find that in net terms he cut $6 billion in the first budget, $1 billion in the second, and then put back $2 billion in the third? Why didn't the Treasurer explain here on Tuesday why he has effectively run down two flights of stairs, and back up one on fiscal policy? He didn't, because the admission would be too great.</para><para>In the first two budgets, we had selective leaking and pre-announcement of the bad news. This one has been selective leaking, and admission of failure in small instalments, the only instalments a battered, unpopular and fundamentally untrustworthy political outfit 
 can afford. He was wrong, and he can't admit it.</para><para>But the net effect of this government's policy changes on financial year 1998-99—the net effect of going down two flights of stairs and up one—was $5.4 billion. Subtracting that $5.4 billion from the surplus announced by the Treasurer leaves us with an underlying `no policy change' deficit of $2.7 billion—no cuts, no surcharges, no fees, no pain.</para><para>Now let me tell you something that Gareth Evans said about an alternative budget strategy for Australia—not this week, not last year, but two years ago, after the coalition's first budget, and I quote:</para><para>. . . we say we can get to budget balance within a reasonable time—in fact, within the lifetime of this parliament, by 1998-99—with a much less savage budget strategy. . . . We can get to that by targeting savings of no more than $3 billion by that third year.</para><para>In other words, $1 billion of new savings each year in three budgets would have produced a starting point surplus this year of at least $300 million. On top of this, the higher economic growth, which Labor's budget strategy would have allowed, would have seen a 1998-99 budget surplus of similar dimensions to the one announced on Tuesday.</para><para>Our argument was then, as it is today, that fiscal consolidation in the economic climate this government faced in 1996 was necessary but did not need to be nearly as harsh as what they immediately embarked upon. We need surpluses, of the kind that Labor delivered four years in a row not long after inheriting a $25 billion deficit from the then Treasurer, John Howard—surpluses built on jobs and growth. We need to retire public debt, but we must keep that issue in perspective too. Despite what the Jeremiahs might say, Australia's fiscal position was very good by international standards when this government came into office.</para><para>That is not to say that we should become complacent. We should not. But it does seriously question why you would sell Telstra to reduce what, in our last year in government, was the third lowest public sector debt in the industrialised world. That debt, as a 
 percentage of GDP, was less than half of Canada's, and two-thirds the proportion of France, Germany, the United States, and even Britain after a decade of Maggie Thatcher's budget cutting and privatisations.</para><para>Why, then, should we allow up to $20 billion worth of Telstra, this great national asset, to go to foreigners? After only four years, we will lose more in Telstra dividends than we will save on our interest bill—dividends that would otherwise be there for generations to pay for hospitals and schools, railways and roads.</para><para>This budget puts aside $580 million for the financial managers as costs and commissions for the Telstra float. That is more than half a billion dollars we could save tomorrow, and keep a great national asset into the bargain.</para><para>In any budget that spends money like this one, there are things to be welcomed, and you should offer praise where it is due. Two praiseworthy ideas are the extension of the gold card to all World War II veterans, and the extension of the health care card to more self-funded retirees. Labor was proud to establish both cards in our time in government.</para><para>It is unfortunate, however, that benefits for a small number of our retirees should accompany reductions for the vast majority. Twenty times as many have experienced those reductions as have received benefits now. Had those self-funded retirees obtained their card under Labor, they would have had access to free dental care, lower-priced prescriptions and free hearing aids. Two hundred and twenty thousand benefit; four million Australians lose.</para><para>But all of them now confront a massive expense on entry to essential care in nursing homes. Our specific policies will be announced closer to the election—but I can say two things: we will restore capital funds cut from nursing homes in full, and none of our retirees—or any Australian for that matter—will have to pay a GST on any of their goods or services.</para><para>But even though this budget has spent some money, it leaves too many questions unanswered. It cannot answer the people who 
 ask themselves what all the pain was for in the first place, or why someone else's pain was more worthy of being reversed than theirs was.</para><para>How precisely did the government make the decision not to restore Commonwealth dental funding? How did it decide it was relaxed about the situation of one woman whose letter to the member for Gilmore was submitted to a recent Senate inquiry, a woman who has been informed that all her teeth need to be extracted and, despite living in constant pain, it will be 18 months before she can be treated? Even then she will have to wait for each individual tooth to cause her pain before she is entitled to have that tooth extracted. What thought processes, what overarching philosophy, what quality of mercy goes into that kind of decision?</para><para>And how did the government decide it was relaxed about elderly Australians, in their hour of greatest fragility, still having to sell the family home to pay for entry into a nursing home—and that, after all the backflips and all the reversals—some 14 of them—the fees remain, and the government still circles the family home. How did it decide that it could go right ahead and spend that money elsewhere?</para><para>How did it decide there was no relief for women forced out of the work force by spiralling child care fees? How did it decide instead to factor their despair into its employment projections? The bad employment estimates in this budget are still heroic. At a minimum, they only stand up because of the thousands of women driven out of the work force by this government's decisions on child care. The Prime Minister thinks this is about family values. It is not. It is simply a collapse in the living standards of low-income working families.</para><para>And how, after all its claims, can there be not one single dollar more for public hospitals in this budget than was on the table when the Premiers walked out on the Commonwealth's last offer in disgust?</para><para>Let me say that John Hewson, who seems to have picked the impact of the Asian crisis far better than this government, was absolutely right in saying that this health offer is 
 nothing like 15 per cent over five years. The Premiers walked out on that, because they knew that to sign on would be a wholesale betrayal of their public hospital patients. That inadequacy this budget happily endorses.</para><para>But there is one large group of Australians which suffers most from these three budgets. I am speaking, of course, of the unemployed. To see why, we need to remember the level of economic growth before John Howard came into power. In the financial year 1993-94, economic growth in Australia was 4.6 per cent. In 1994-95, it was 4.4 per cent. In 1995-96, it was 4.1 per cent. Australia's economic growth rate for John Howard's first full financial year in office was just 2.7 per cent.</para><para>Four percent growth plus under Labor. Not even two-thirds of that in the first year under the coalition. And we are meant to accept that this had nothing to do with the entire government frontbench preaching economic doom for a full five months before the first budget in 1996. Nothing to do with that budget which took $27 billion out of the economy over four years.</para><para>Growth got above the parapet of three per cent last year, and now it is forecast to flatline back at three per cent, with unemployment stuck around eight per cent.</para><para>But when the Treasurer was asked on Tuesday night about the unemployment rate, this is what he said:</para><para>No it bounces around a bit. You know, it's 7.9, it's 8, it's 8.1. We think it's around the 8 mark at the moment, but it will bounce. It's been bouncing for a year.</para><para>I am sick of that kind of talk. I am sick of people like the Treasurer with a screen full of teeth making glib analogies about real lives. These are real people, Mr Treasurer, not footballs, not Dr Kemp's rubbery statistics. They are real mums and dads, with real children dependent on them, trying to get a start in life. You were not elected to bounce unemployment around. You were elected to get it down.</para><para>Before March 1996, the unemployment rate had been falling for three years. This government came in and worsened the unemployment position immediately. In our last two years in government, Labor created 550,000 
 jobs. In his first two years, John Howard created not half as many. The difference was 315,000 people—three MCGs jam-packed full of people who would now be in work, and not on the dole queue, if the coalition had just managed to keep up the pace we set.</para><para>And anything it has managed to do on unemployment, or might manage, has to be judged against another MCG crowd of nearly 100,000 people who have simply given up looking for work since this government came into office. And what of those left on the dole queue longer than they ever feared, because of the growth this government put on hold? The number of people unemployed for a year or more fell by over a third during Labor's last term in office.</para><para>So far, during this government's term, it has actually risen. When you started cutting into skillshare and other labour market programs in May 1996, there were 206,000 long-term unemployed Australians. Figures released this morning show that their ranks have now increased by 33,000 people as a result of your policies. Long-term unemployed used to be a quarter of all unemployed. Today, they are a third.</para><para>And they have been ill-served by a government which has wrecked the support systems putting long-term unemployed people into work—exemplary programs emulated around the world put on the scrap heap. Or worse: some of them have been put into the hands of people with no office, no staff, no experience—some of them without even a telephone!</para><para>This is where we count the cost of this budget. Having counted the beans, the government has closed the book on Australian families. It is not going to redress the pain of the last two years; it is not going to tell them where it wants to take them next century. As far as the government is concerned, there are only two more stops in the journey—the GST and an election.</para><para>So let me talk about their GST—the dead heart of the hidden tax package. John Howard has built a career avoiding the unequivocal, but three years ago this month, he was absolutely unequivocal. These are his words, and we remember them well:</para><para>No, there's no way a GST will ever be part of our policy. Never ever. It's dead. It was killed by the voters at the last election.'</para><para>Peter Costello has built a career avoiding being quiet, but his budget speech was silent on the issue of a GST. He was like Basil Fawlty, you know—`Don't mention the war!' The budget papers on Tuesday included $20 million for the administration of this tax package, so we are now in the farcical situation where the coalition will tell us what it will cost to implement the tax package, but it will not tell us what is in it.</para><para>But one thing is for sure: the GST has come back when no-one thought it would. This tax on jobs, this tax on the poor, this tax on families is back. And as we prepare for its stealthy arrival, we need to remember that it comes back with none of the integrity that was there in its initial presentation when John Hewson put out his fully-costed package, openly and frankly, more than a year out from an election.</para><para>John Howard told his party two days ago that we could be in the last parliamentary session before the election. Just weeks to go, but the voters are not going to see the tax package yet. It is something to be dropped, and then scuttled away from, to the polls, before anyone can get the wrapping off and find out what is underneath.</para><para>That changes where we stand as a party. Those of us who oppose a GST now have only one course of action. I want to make it clear tonight that the Labor Party believes that John Howard has forfeited any right ever to claim a legitimate mandate for his GST. And our opposition will be there whether we win or lose the next election. A vote for Labor is a guaranteed vote against the GST. If we are elected, you will not get one, and if we are in opposition, we will oppose it in the Senate.</para><para>We do this because the lateness of the hour means we are expected to take this Prime Minister on trust. But we see nothing in this government's record to trust that the package will be fair or equitable. The Treasurer has explicitly refused in this place to rule out a GST on the following items: doctors bills; dentists bills; school fees; university fees; 
 power bills; food; nursing home fees; local government and water rates; and even rent.</para><para> We see nothing in this government's record to trust that its awesome complexity will become, in their hands, anything other than a complete disaster—a disaster for businesses, workers and all consumers, implemented in the usual manner—with all the grace and poise of Inspector Clouseau in a ball bearing factory. We refuse to help John Howard get his agenda into place, and we will not inflict his tax on the Australian people.</para><para> Modern government, as we approach a new century, is about skills, innovation, infrastructure and exports. It is not simply about bean counting. It is not simply about achieving a surplus by any means. It is about achieving a surplus in periods of moderate economic growth, at the same time as creating a modern, successful state which rewards, advances and enhances excellence.</para><para>For Australians, this means recognising something about our own country. It means recognising that many other countries have advantages we do not. We are a nation in nobody's trading bloc. We make our way in a region where the big countries are growing by an amount equivalent to our entire population every single year, while we occupy a great proportion of that region's real estate.</para><para>It also means recognising what makes us proud to be Australians—our history of innovation, our scientific endeavour and our national courage. Too often, as we have approached issues of reform over the last 15 years or so, we have been critical of Australians' willingness to work hard, innovate and change based on their own convictions rather than on some official view. Too often, we have underestimated how much Australians pride and value their own work and their achievements. Too few Australians, too few members of this parliament know that Victoria and South Australia combined have won more Nobel Prizes in the sciences than the whole country of Japan.</para><para>Government must value and enhance those great Australian characteristics. Micro-economic reform is not about depriving people of wages, depriving people of leisure 
 and depriving people of things which make for a constructive family life. We must be about enhancing skills, building on our record of innovation and developing our outward-looking attitude to opportunities in our region. Just try to find anything substantial in these three budgets from this government which builds on these strengths.</para><para>Instead, the vast bulk of savings made in the three budgets have been at the expense of this Australia. They have come from our universities, from the labour market programs helping to keep our population permanently skilled, from research and development incentives and from assistance to exporters to gain a foothold in international markets.</para><para>The effects are clearly documented in the budget. It forecasts a drop in net export growth. It shows business investment growth slowing throughout the year. Recent figures show growth in business spending on research and development, which reached an all-time record of $4.3 billion in Labor's last year, has stopped dead for the first time in a decade, following the swingeing cuts to R&amp;D support in the first coalition budget.</para><para>This is why there is no point in delivering a surplus ringed by deficits. It is a surplus bought from the million deficits in family budgets, a surplus sitting alongside a level of foreign debt which has worsened by $28 billion since the coalition came into power and a current account deficit forecast to grow by another $31 billion over the coming year—and nearly every single independent analyst thinking that is an understatement.</para><para> This is why we need a government with a broader vision,  why we need to restore the balance, why we need a government that sees where it can forge a partnership with the Australian people: a partnership supporting family life, supporting unemployed, supporting industry, supporting investment and supporting exporters. We need partnership, and we need to have their visions as well.</para><para>Two years have told us all we need to know about John Howard's ambitions for Australia. He wants an Australia with him as Prime Minister, and that is where the vision ends. He wants an Australia moulded into the shape he thinks will keep him there—a nation 
 riddled by division, neatly carved up into the few groups whose dislike of each other, encouraged by this government, he thinks will keep him in power forever.</para><para>Labor will go into this next election believing in a different Australia. We believe in a proud, confident, intelligent Australia. Labor believes in an Australia that wants security in its workplaces, peace of mind in a strong health system and opportunity flowing from an education system which gives its citizens the best chance they can get in a global economy.</para><para>We understand with absolute clarity the importance of the Asian financial crisis for the Australian economy, and the corresponding need for fiscal restraint in that environment. Kim Beazley promised back in February that Labor would deliver three underlying surpluses in our first term in government, and that promise stands as long as this government's projections for the budgetary position and economic forecasts stand.</para><para> But Labor is going to look at priorities. We are going to look at where this government has spent money wastefully, and where the money could be used more intelligently and to greater benefit for greater numbers of Australians.</para><para>We are not going into this election year with a fistful of dollars as a grudging apology for pain rendered over the previous three years. We are going into this election year with a vision of where we want Australia to go, what Australians want in their everyday lives and how, within the means available to us, we can go in that direction. These three budgets have sacrificed the security and opportunity of the population to Liberal Party prejudices. This is a government that has forgotten its responsibility to govern for all Australians and is now prepared to experiment with an unfair, job-destroying tax in a period of uncertainty.</para><para>In the last two years, over the last three budgets, the Australian people have learnt what they were getting when they elected this government. I maintain they deserve something better than what they got. Normally, it would be hard to close the book on a government after only three budgets. Normally, it 
 would be hard to say a government is not worth considering again when it has been around for only two years. Normally, a first-term government just turns up in the queue for another term like it is waiting for dessert. But this is not a normal government. This is not the normal run of events at all.</para><para>This is John Howard's government and John Howard's Australia. We know that millions of Australians want no more to do with this government—no more of this government that loses seven ministers in just 18 months; no more of this government that puts black shirts, balaclavas and dogs on chains in our workplaces; no more of this government that defends ministers with tens of millions in their family trusts, and wants working Australians to pay a GST on their grocery bills, their clothing, their rent and their rates; and, no more of this government with a quarter of a billion for companies that want to sack workers, and nothing for those companies who want to keep them on.</para><para>These were your three budgets, and they are over. If there was a time and a place for a government as harsh and chaotic as this, it is long, long past, and in another, lesser country. If there is a place for it now to go, it is out of our lives, and out of our lives for good.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>2902</page.no><name role="metadata">Lees, Sen Meg</name><name role="display">Senator LEES</name><name.id>8U4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to present the response of the Australian Democrats to the 1998-99 Costello budget. In doing so, I propose to do three things. Firstly, I shall discuss the context for the budget, the policy settings and what passes for the rationale underpinning it. Secondly, I shall outline the Democrats' response in specific portfolio areas. Thirdly, I shall outline just how the Democrats propose to address the budget when the appropriation bills come into the Senate.</para></talk.start><para>It is hard for me to remember a less inspiring, less stimulating budget than the one Peter Costello has just brought down. It was a singularly unimaginative document. Generally, its contents had been either leaked or announced well before the session. Virtually all the new spending initiatives were repackaged, reheated leftovers, even the size of the surplus was common knowledge to any taxi driver 
 you would like to consult. They all knew it was somewhere between $2½ billion and $3 billion.</para><para>I searched long and hard for items of some significance in the budget, and I came to the conclusion that what was really significant about this budget was not so much what was in it but what was not in it. There is nothing in this budget to address Australia's unemployment rate, which is forecast to stay stuck at around eight per cent this year. There was nothing in it to address our ballooning current account deficit—for example, no strategies to improve our export performance. There was nothing in it to repair the damage done by $7 billion of spending cuts over the last two years. There was nothing in it to boost consumer and business confidence, which is critical to maintain local demand for goods and services as well as improve export performance in what we all acknowledge will be a difficult year ahead.</para><para>Simply, this is a budget with nothing much in it. This budget may well deliver a fiscal surplus, but it suffers from a chronic imagination deficit. This government is widely acknowledged to be ungenerous and mean, and this budget is an accurate reflection of the government. It has failed to address the social and economic pressures on ordinary Australians.</para><para>Let me remind senators of the mindless economic mantra chanted morning and night by those on the treasury benches, the mantra from which this budget has been drawn. Where there is a public service, privatise it or contract it out. Where there is an industry concession, they must be rorting. Where there are financial market commentators, we bow the head and kiss the feet. Where there is a government benefit, label the recipients as cheats and bludgers. Where there are people who cannot find a job, blame them. Where there are people who desperately need a public health system, ignore them and pour money into the private health insurance industry. Where there are people who cannot afford a decent education, ignore them and pour money into the private education system. Where there are people who do not kneel in 
 homage at the foot of budgetary surpluses, mock them.</para><para>The much vaunted surplus, we are told, is a matter of greatness, a huge achievement. I am sorry to have to rain on Mr Costello's parade, but I cannot quite get excited about it, and neither can a lot of people, if letters in our national papers across the country are anything to go by. All the government has achieved is the replacement of a budget deficit with a gaping social deficit.</para><para>Let us not forget where the budget surplus came from. It was $1 billion hacked out of public health, $1 billion hacked out of industry and export programs, $1 billion hacked out of programs to help the jobless get back to work, $1 billion hacked out of Australia's education, training and research sectors, $1.6 billion hacked out of Australia's social welfare safety net and $1.5 billion in new taxes and charges that they like to keep very quiet about. These are the foundation stones on which this budget has been built. It has been the sick, the jobless, the aged, the students and those Australians on low incomes, including many small business people, and the young who have paid for these stones, who have paid for this surplus, and they are still paying.</para><para>In fact, the Melbourne Institute of Applied Science and Economic Research estimates that the government's program has left the average Australian family worse off by about $7 a week. This rises to a massive $38 a week if the breadwinner is unemployed. I cannot imagine that the people who have paid such a high price for the deficit reduction will be wanting to dance in the streets to celebrate Costello's surplus.</para><para>But, when you read the budget papers carefully, you soon discover that the budget black hole turned out to be $3 billion less than Treasury said it would be. It is now clear that $3 billion of the $7 billion of spending cuts were never necessary, and that the government could have achieved a balanced budget in 1998-99 without them—just read the budget papers.</para><para>In last year's budget, after the $7 billion of spending cuts, Treasury was forecasting a budget deficit in 1997-98 of around $3.9 
 billion and a surplus in 1998-99 of $1.6 billion. But in this year's budget papers, we find that the budget deficit for 1997-98, apart from new spending, came in $3.3 billion better and that in 1998-99 the surplus was going to be $3 billion better. The Democrats forecast this last September in our economic statement Restoring Confidence and again in my pre-budget submission released last week. We said then that there was an opportunity for government to do more to give the economy the confidence boost that it desperately needs and we say it again.</para><para>In my pre-budget submission Repairing the Damage I reiterated that the budget should give priority to the restoration of some of the cuts that should never have been made, such as the cuts to public health, to Australia's schools and to our tertiary education sector. I argued that the budget should help insulate Australia from the Asian meltdown by boosting domestic demand and business investment, particularly in the export sector and infrastructure.</para><para>The new Treasury forecasts vindicate completely what the Democrats have been saying. Both Treasury and the Reserve Bank are on the record now admitting that the spending cuts in the 1996 budget hit the economy much harder than they thought they would. It is now clear that if the cuts had been kept to a more modest level there would have been a lot more Australians in work now.</para><para>For the last five years the Democrats fiscal policy position has been constructed on three basic principles. Firstly, we recognise the need to improve the capacity for economic activity and to expand, to employ more Australians and to do this without driving up foreign debt or interest rates. Secondly, we recognise the need for this generation of Australians to meet is own commitments, at the same time ensuring that national savings and public sector assets are not squandered for future generations. Thirdly, we recognise the need to ensure that the benefits of economic activity are fairly and equitably shared and that the costs, especially the environmental costs, of economic activity are recognised and minimised.</para><para>Let me turn to history for a moment. Back in 1996, the Democrats recognised the need for deficit reduction. Importantly, however, we stressed the need to identify the causes of the budget deficit. And, however hard the Labor revisionists might like to try to rewrite history, the real reason that the budget deficit blew out was the rise in unemployment following Paul Keating's recession—the one that we had to have. What seems to have escaped the economic rationalists who framed this budget is that the best and surest way to reduce the deficit is to reduce unemployment. Every one per cent growth in employment saves the federal government $1½ billion.</para><para>The Democrats pointed to the findings by prominent economists Fred Argy, John Neville and Fred Gruen that half of the budget black hole was cyclical and that the budget cuts of only about $4 billion, which represented Labor's policy failures, were justified. The Democrats argued then that if cuts were deeper than that the economy would suffer, and on every point we were proven right. But the coalition argues that it has delivered lower interest rates. A nice line but they have only partly delivered that benefit. Let us just move on past the army of government spin doctors—no doubt up there again tonight—and get to the truth.</para><para>Of the estimated $220 billion of new debt created in Australia in the past two years only three per cent was incurred by the Commonwealth government. In fact, Australia has the second lowest level of public debt, second only to Korea, and the seventh lowest budget deficit of any industrialised country. It is not the public sector driving interest rates in this country. Interest rates are low because inflation is low and unemployment is high. It has little to do with this government's deficit reduction strategy. The fact is that interest rates are not actually as low as Peter Costello would like us to believe.</para><para>Any economist can tell you, even the tub-thumping economic rationalists that you listen to and that you are eager to impress, that it is not the nominal rate of interest that is important, rather it is the real rate of interest when you adjust for inflation. Adjusted for inflation in real terms, home loan interest rates are now 
 two per cent higher than they were when Neil Armstrong walked on the moon in 1969.</para><para>Australian businesses face the highest interest rates on business loans in the industrialised world, largely because of this government's abject failure to do anything about the banks, to regulate them properly and rein in their whopping profit margins on loans. The Netherlands, for example, which has a lower unemployment rate than Australia, a higher budget deficit and a much higher level of public sector debt, provides for its business sector loan rates five percentage points lower than Australia. What the Netherlands has that Australia hasn't is a much lower current account deficit. In fact, Australia's current account deficit is forecast to rise from $18 billion last year to $31 billion next year.</para><para>If you look in the budget to see if it addresses that, you will find there is nothing there. Instead, the budget fails to undo the $125 million cut to the export market development grants scheme, the $120 million cut to soft finance for Australian companies to invest in developing countries, the $90 million in cuts to Austrade's programs, the $400 million cut to tax breaks for research and development, and the $300 impost on business inputs through tariff concession orders.</para><para>The Democrats believe that Australia must pursue export markets more aggressively, chase business investment and generate jobs and economic growth. We also believe that foreign investment must be in Australia's interest, rather than just adding to our current account deficit as it does now through repatriated profits. This budget fails on all these counts as well as failing to repair the damage done across a wide range of community services.</para><para> The budget contains no good news for the unemployed with the admission that the unemployment rate is expected to stay stuck around the current level of eight per cent during all of next year. The only use for the unemployed is that, if you are unemployed now, you are likely to stay that way.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="metadata">KEMP</name><name role="display">Senator Kemp</name></talker><para>—It doesn't say that at all.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>8U4</name.id><name role="metadata">Lees, Sen Meg</name><name role="display">Senator LEES</name></talker><para>—I would check your budget papers if I were you, Senator, because the forward estimates for unemployment benefits suggest that Treasury is planning for unemployment to stay stuck at at least eight per cent for the next four years. The only new news in the budget was that another 9,000 public sector jobs are to go, bringing to 32,000 the total of number of jobs slashed by this government. Compare that to the government's pre-election promise to confine public sector retrenchments to just 2,500 over three years. That is another one of those optional promises and non-core promises that we had.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The aged, we are told, are big winners from this budget. The Democrats certainly welcome the extension of the seniors health card to self-funded retirees. I do remind the government, however, though, that I first called for that five years ago, and it has been a long time coming. When you factor in the higher cost of pharmaceuticals, the fact that many doctors have given up bulk-billing, the longer waiting queues and the longer waiting lists in our public hospitals, I doubt if too many of Australia's aged can say they are better off now in terms of health than they were three years ago. What we are particularly disappointed about in this sector is that there was nothing in this budget to address the $1 billion shortfall in capital funding in nursing home facilities, particularly in regional areas.</para><para> The other big winner was supposed to be the bush. But, like so much else in this budget, when you really look at it up close, there is nothing in it. The Democrats do welcome the small new measures for the bush such as the tax rebates for landcare projects, a bit of extra funding for regional development and a small boost to rural health. But these measures are very small beer. They do not address the steep decline in regional Australia caused by the massive public sector cuts, massive cuts to services, massive cuts to infrastructure funding for roads, local government and things like nursing homes. We all know what is happening to rural hospitals and schools. Then, of course, there is what you are doing to the ABC.</para><para>The really bad news for the bush was the inclusion of the Telstra sale proceeds into the budget papers. Telstra's service capacity in the regions has dropped significantly since the staff cuts began in preparation for the sale. In regional Australia, they know they can expect a greater decline if the rest of Telstra is sold. Regional Australia will also suffer from this government's continuing and pathetic vendetta against the ABC. Indeed, we heard more of that after question time today. Just $20.8 million is provided to fund the ABC's digital conversion, less than a quarter of that recommended as an absolute minimum by the Arthur Anderson report. This will mean that regional Australia is unlikely to get the full benefits of the ABC eventually converting over to multi-channel digital technology.</para><para> Australia's farmers are big losers. Australia's family are particularly big losers. Cuts to child care, the continuing squeeze on public schools and the huge cuts to tertiary education remain firmly in place. In the area of health, this budget succeeds in putting back only one-third of the $1 billion of annual cuts inflicted on the public health system. I repeat: your cuts are $1 billion annually, and it is from that that we must look at the current budget. Most of the few health initiatives such as the gold card for veterans have already been announced. Other existing programs such as the influenza vaccine initiatives and funding for medical research have merely been extended. This budget does nothing to address the most important health issue facing our nation—that is, the serious underfunding of our public hospitals. All this budget has done is to repackage again the offer to the states that they have already comprehensively rejected on a number of occasions.</para><para> The Democrats do welcome the return to the full indexation of Medicare rebates, but we add that this should not just be a one-off increase for a year. All the evidence is though that this will not be enough to get many of Australia's GPs back bulk-billing. Those who gave up are unlikely to reverse their decision. We also welcome the modest increase in funding for indigenous health, although small handouts will not address the fundamental issue of Aboriginal people's right to self- 
 determination, a right which has been continually undermined by this government.</para><para> This budget contains very bad news for the environment, hidden in sleight of hand arithmetic which mixes core funding with funds from the Natural Heritage Trust. In other words, I think it is going to take a lot of questioning at estimates to try to unravel this particular puzzle. Funding for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority is to be cut by 20 per cent despite an increase in its responsibilities. Indeed, I think the environmental priorities of this government are best demonstrated by Warwick Parer's win of an extra $36 million to find new fossil fuel, oil and gas deposits. Interestingly, this is exactly the amount cut from the Energy Research and Development Corporation, an organisation established to research cleaner, renewable energy sources for our future.</para><para> On the tax side, the government has announced—if that is the correct word—that the provisional tax uplift factor will be cut from six per cent to five per cent, but that was already going to happen, Senator, because of amendments made in this chamber some two years ago. The new concessions for computer software and dealing with the millennium bug are important and generally welcome, but I have little faith that your tax crackdown on high wealth individuals will get very far—this seems to be an annual announcement—until your government gets serious about tax reform and addresses the use of trusts, personal service companies and other tax planning devices. These crackdowns will be basically ineffective. We will be back again next budget. Let us have another round of tax crackdowns.</para><para>On the revenue side, the government perversely fails to recognise the negative effects of the sale of Telstra; the effect it will have on future budgets if it is sold. Based on Telstra's 1996-97 profit performance, the sell-off of the remaining two-thirds of Telstra will cost the Australian public sector approximately $560 million a year. The failure to tell the true story of the impact of Telstra on future budgets really puts the lie to this government's much vaunted charter of budget honesty. The government does admit it will 
 be spending $580 million to sell the rest of Telstra. One piece of honesty is that which points out that the real winners of the Telstra sale will be the stockbrokers, the financiers, the lawyers and the advertising agency who will actually run your float. They have already pocketed an estimated $300 million from the sale of the first one-third.</para><para>In short, the 1998 budget will be remembered as the one with nothing much in it. There is nothing in it to start the process of repairing the damage done by the $7 billion in cuts which largely, as we have shown, have been unnecessary. There is nothing to boost the economy, business confidence and investment, employment and export performance. And of course there is nothing in it about tax reform. Your plans on what sort of a GST we are going to be having and what you intend to inflict on Australia remain hidden. These are very great failings.</para><para>On budget night I said as an ex-teacher that I would have marked the budget two out of 10 and instructed the student to repeat the exercise. Sadly, Peter Costello is unlikely to redo his budget. However, the Senate would be in error if it did not try to repair at least some of the economic damage arising from the spending cuts. The Senate is unable to touch the outlays side of the budget but we can move to modify some of the new measures on the revenue side. What the Democrats propose is to provide some incentives through the tax system to encourage business to innovate, export and employ. We propose to do this in a way that does not affect the budget bottom line but has the potential to improve the current account deficit and lower the unemployment rate.</para><para>The Democrats have already announced that we will move to means test the savings rebate announced in last year's budget, and that will save about $1 billion in the year 2000. We will also move to restore the full benefit of the export market development scheme by providing an equivalent tax rebate where an eligible firm is denied funding because of the cap imposed on the grants scheme. We will move to restore the R&amp;D concession up to 150 per cent to encourage business. These two measures alone will provide a very 
 significant boost to Australian business, helping them to get on with the job of chasing new markets and opportunities.</para><para>We also propose to move amendments to the tax act to provide important and necessary relief to small business. Let us remember that small business has been doing it pretty tough in the last year. Mid last year, the Yellow Pages index reported that most small businesses regarded the economy as in recession or at a standstill. Bankruptcy rates have soared. Small business income rose in 1997, but just by 1.7 per cent. Yet for provisional tax purposes, under your government, you have deemed that incomes have soared by six per cent.</para><para>Budget papers forecast economic growth of three per cent and income growth of 4.25 per cent, yet we have a provisional tax uplift factor of five per cent. This means that your government will be collecting $75 million extra off small business in the year ahead. We will move to reduce the uplift factor to four per cent and provide a very welcome $75 million boost to small business cashflows. And we will move to correct the anomaly in the sales tax system that places independent retailers at a disadvantage against big retail chains like Coles and Woolworths, which own their own wholesale operations. These measures will help small business get on with the business of creating new jobs and opportunities, despite the enormous cost of finance they face because of your reluctance to tackle the banks.</para><para>In taking these actions, the Democrats are demonstrating that we are deadly serious about getting unemployment down. We are deadly serious about improving Australia's trade position, and we are deadly serious about ensuring that small business remains a vibrant and growing generator of new jobs. If these measures win the support of the rest of the Senate, it will then be up to government to accept or reject them, as they bring with them a proven record of creating jobs and opportunities.</para><para>The Democrats will be watching very closely to determine whether the government is prepared to match its rhetoric with some action. In particular, the Democrats will be 
 putting pressure back on the government to repair the damage done by the spending cuts to Australia's economic and social fabric and to get more Australians back to work.</para><para>In conclusion, the Democrats believe that, despite the government's windy rhetoric, there is nothing in this budget as it stands. This budget might have been put together by the scarecrow, the tinman and the lion from the <inline font-style="italic">Wizard of Oz</inline>—no brains, no heart, no courage and certainly no yellow brick road for anyone other than the high priests of the financial markets. This budget does not set out a blueprint for the sort of equitable, the sort of fair and the sort of just and compassionate society which all fair-minded Australians want. That is what we looked for when we opened the budget papers yesterday, but there was nothing much in it.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>2907</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to respond to the budget announcement on behalf of the Greens (WA). This budget is one that produces a nice bottom line surplus, but at what cost? The government is playing up the textbook tick and sidelining the other indicators that show the manifest inequities and deficiencies of government policies. This budget is a perfect example of how imperfect these narrow and deceptive economic indicators are. These measures are clearly not providing an accurate indication of the pain being felt in the community. This budget is a perfect example of the need for genuine progress indicators to identify wellbeing in Australia.</para></talk.start><para>Genuinely reflective national accounts have been suggested by the United Nations. Senator Robert Hill, as long ago as September 1996, announced that the government was committed to linking the environment to the economy through indicators and accounting systems. What has come of this commitment? Absolutely zip.</para><para>The annual funding of approximately $300 million for the environment pales into insignificance when compared with the true growing environmental debt in this country. Just one example of the true debt is the estimated annual $1.5 billion in lost production due to land degradation.</para><para>The tunnel vision focus on the surplus this year represents regression from broadening the indicators of national wellbeing. This budget, in conjunction with the last two budgets, produces and reinforces social, environmental and economic debt. All the pats on the back belie the realities of what burdens have been borne to create the surplus.</para><para>There are two main things I would like to address tonight. Firstly, I would like to examine who has borne the brunt of this budget. Secondly, I would like to examine some fundamental problems with the government's general approach to the budget process. The flippant claims by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) that the burdens have been shared by all and the benefits will be shared by all are an absolute farce. The burdens of the last two budgets have been borne disproportionately by social security recipients, indigenous people, students, the unemployed, the elderly, the sick and people in rural and regional communities. The government forcibly tightened the belts of those who could least afford it, driving an ever increasing bitter wedge between the rich and the poor.</para><para>This year the Treasurer has come out swaggering with his smug smile. He has thrown a few crumbs at those who had the potential to be wooed before the election. The Australian people are not fooled by a free jab in the arm and an extension of the seniors health card. These measures are no compensation for the $3.6 billion that has been cut from pharmaceuticals, hospitals, dental care and Medicare in the last two budgets. Less than $2 billion has been put back. The fact that the states were so appalled by the federal government's offer on the Australian health care agreements that they walked out indicates how hopelessly inadequate the so-called increased funding to hospitals really is.</para><para>The government cannot pull the wool over the eyes of regional and rural Australia. They are not fooled by the balloons of hot air about the government's commitment. It is abundantly clear that the commitment to rural and regional communities is in a drought. All of the so-called `initiatives' are simply a recycling of funding. For instance, the landcare tax 
 rebate for farmers comes out of the already stretched Natural Heritage Trust.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>HX5</name.id><name role="metadata">WOODLEY</name><name role="display">Senator Woodley</name></talker><para>—That is if they have an income to pay any tax.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>DX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name></talker><para>—That is right. The tax rebate is also worthless for those struggling farmers who are earning so little income that they do not pay any tax—great minds think alike! There has been no recovery of the permanent cut in funding of $15 million per annum that local governments lost last year. Such cuts seriously undermine the ability of regional and rural councils to provide desperately needed services.</para></talk.start></continue><para>This commitment drought comes at a time when the continued quality of telecommunications and postal services is under a huge question mark with the proposed sale of Telstra and Australia Post. Australians will not forget what has happened under the coalition pursuit of the bottom line. Families will not forget the loss of $821 million from child care. Students will not forget the missing $900 million from higher education. Indigenous people will not forget the $4 billion black hole in housing and infrastructure provision for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities.</para><para>A society with a sense of justice for all will not forget the slashing of over $100 million from legal aid. Unemployed people will not forget the $1.8 billion ripped from labour market programs and workers will not forget the fact that the government is threatening job security through industrial laws and by collusion with large companies.</para><para>The Treasurer has continued to play on prejudices and target certain groups so as to create divisions in society. After slashing labour market programs by $1.8 billion in the last two budgets, the government has put in an additional $350 million to pump up the work for the dole scheme. It is a scheme that is yet to be evaluated; a scheme that mutates the concept of mutual obligation—that is something the government should be doing—beyond recognition. Mutual obligation appears to mean, from the government's point of view, conscription and forced labour. Meanwhile, the new jobs network is putting $147.6 million back into the government's pocket 
 while it abrogates its responsibility for dealing with unemployment.</para><para>Propping up programs such as work for the dole is a tactical manoeuvre by the government to shift the parameters of the problem from unemployment as a social and economic phenomenon to the unemployed as individuals.	The general catchcry is: if you are unemployed, it's your own fault and you should pay. It even goes in the song: `You've got to look for the hero inside yourself'. It plays on and promotes the imagery of the dole bludger in a deeply insidious way.</para><para>The Treasurer has also sought to play on the One Nation style prejudices against immigrants. By flexing their muscles and pumping money into tightening border controls, they promote the image of the mischievous illegal immigrant, attempting to unfairly dip into the Australian honey pot.</para><para>Now the Treasurer claims that Australia has options; options to distribute benefits in the future. He strongly hinted that a GST will pay for income tax cuts. These hints, that deliberately antagonise the welfare lobby, are an attempt to derail a constructive and positive debate on tax reform. Moreover, this simplistic notion of tax reform has very clear winners and losers. Those who pay more income tax will reap the greatest benefits. The way in which personal income tax is determined means that, even if every marginal tax rate is diminished, high income earners will get the biggest windfall. They will get a tax break at every marginal rate.</para><para>It is widely understood that a GST disproportionately affects low income earners. It is clear to see who Mr Costello is lining up to get the rewards of all the hard yards. It is not the people who have borne the brunt of the burdens; it is those who have already had many of the advantages society has to offer. The government is driving a deep wedge between the prosperous and those struggling to make a reasonable life for themselves and their families. This budget amplifies that wedge.</para><para>The government, in the last two budgets, has placed a priority on debt reduction through a cutback in public sector outlays. The aim and focus has been primarily on a 
 nice, fat bottom line. The government boasts about moving towards surplus and tightening our belts. The government claims that these priorities are the so-called `fundamentals' of the economy, and once we get those fundamentals under control, there can only be prosperity for everyone.</para><para>Australians are crying out for the government to understand the economy in the context of the `fundamentals' of society, the `fundamentals' of the Australian ethos—fundamental concepts such as caring, tolerance, quality of life and a fair go for all Australians. This means 100 per cent of Australians; not just the prosperous or corporate Australians, but indigenous Australians, Australians living in poverty—mind you, over 30 per cent are living below or just above the poverty line—rural Australians, disabled Australians, elderly Australians, young Australians and sick Australians.</para><para>The result of previous cutbacks has been devastating for the most disadvantaged part of Australian society. The results are becoming more and more obvious. In a relentless pursuit of efficiency, a society of the overworked and unemployed is emerging. Welfare providers on the ground are seeing a massive increase in the need for their services. Just ask them. Welfare providers have seen people come through their doors who have never had to ask for help before. Things have got to such a desperate state, however, that people have had to lower their dignity and actively appeal for help because they just cannot make ends meet.</para><para>In 1998, we have a growing working poor in Australia. Despite all the evidence on the ground, the government has not heard the cries of the Australian people. The government has closed their eyes to the impact of their relentless pursuit of debt retirement. They have been conveniently mesmerised by that nice fat bottom line. Despite any realities in Australian society, despite the blow out in the current account deficit and despite the falling exchange rate, they continue to claim that prosperity will come. Just you wait and see.</para><para>Not only does the government's approach produce social problems, but the economic 
 basis is, to say the least, questionable. In economic terms, does Mr Costello really deserve a pat on the back for the budget surplus? Is he justified in expecting the surplus to expand? The government is happy to take the accolades for the surplus and to wear the badge of economic responsibility, but is this truly an economically responsible strategy?</para><para>As pointed out by Professor Quiggin in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> today, this fiscal strategy is highly questionable. The government fails to recognise that Telstra is a major contributor to public savings. Telstra uses retained earnings to finance investment and produces over $1 billion in retained earnings every year. This is obviously a huge contribution to public sector savings and it does not show up in the budget papers. Quiggin also notes that Treasury fails to take into account the fact that the government does not claim franking credits. Private shareholders, however, are sure to claim these credits. Quiggin estimates that this will be a cost to revenue of $600 million. So the projected $700 million gained in interest savings by 2001-2002 is looking rather irresponsible in light of the $1 billion in retained earnings and the $600 million lost through franking credits.</para><para>Surplus? The longevity of the surplus is a sceptical proposition. The government took bows for the recovery of the `$10 billion Labour deficit', despite the fact that nearly half was due to bracket creep—a thing that they decried Labor for on a number of occasions. Similarly, the government is taking the bows for surplus projections despite the fact that Treasury provided the government with a $5.5 billion windfall by adjusting the parameters on which the budget is based. How nice to be able to spend some of this handy windfall while being able to present an ever increasing surplus estimate for the coming years.</para><para>Many commentators, including John Hewson, have pointed out that the surplus forward estimates should be taken with a truckload of salt. The impact of the Asian crisis has been underestimated, and the surplus projections have been bolstered by unrealistic spending projections and artificial 
 ly low spending projections. What we should be doing is looking at structuring the Australian economy to better weather the external storms. Bottom lines provide no real projections. If we have in this country a situation where every time there is an increased consumer confidence we have a blow-out in imports, somebody should be asking questions.</para><para>The government's suggestion that economic benefits will flow from pushing the budget to surplus is another dubious proposition. This is certainly not the case in relation to the current account deficit. The coalition's policies and claims are based on the concept of the `twin deficit theory' pushed by the International Monetary Fund. This theory is based on a link between budget deficits and surpluses and the current account deficit or surplus. As a result, the IMF continually pushes free market style structural adjustment policies—they pull it out of the drawer and they give it to every country they go into—labour market reform and substantial cuts to government spending as the best means of addressing problems such as large current account deficits.</para><para>The coalition has been a great fan of IMF style policies. Indeed, the Prime Minister was reverberating advice coming from the IMF's Mr Camdessus on page 2 of the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> on Friday, 8 May 1998, by claiming that our recent current account blow-out meant that tight fiscal policy was needed. The idea of the twin deficit theory has never been born out in practice. This is overwhelmingly illustrated by the latest current account figures. Despite moves towards budget surplus over the last two years, our current account deficit is at its highest level ever. If anything, it appears that the more the current account deficit blows out, the more the Reserve Bank is able to produce more favourable dividends, which in turn makes the budget easier to balance.</para><para>The current account deficit, which reflects the state of the national economy, deserves serious attention. A good current account deficit can give leeway to deal with government budget deficits. A bad current account deficit can cause national economic collapse in spite of government surpluses.</para><para>The short-term focus of the budget surplus has failed Australia miserably. It has entrenched social, environmental and economic deficit. Socially, it has increased poverty and tension. Environmentally, it has ignored the real damage that is occurring and the reality that future generations will have to pay the mounting environmental debt. Economically, it will be shown to be wanting in the long term. Wipe that smug smile off your face, Mr Costello. Judge the budget truthfully. The Greens will be watching you and looking at the real indicators of Australia's well being on behalf of the forgotten community.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Parer</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ADJOURNMENT</title><type>Adjournment</type><page.no>2911</page.no></debateinfo><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Parer</inline>) proposed:</para><para>That the Senate do now adjourn.</para><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Budget 1998-99</title><page.no>2911</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>2911</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferris, Sen Jeannie</name><name role="display">Senator FERRIS</name><name.id>5L6</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This week, probably for the first time in Australian political history, we have seen a consensus reached between the established parties on the need for a balanced budget. This is truly an historic moment of consensus in the debate about the future of our country's finances and the direction of Australia's economic policy. This week on the <inline font-style="italic">Face to Face</inline>  program, Gareth Evans, Labor's shadow finance and treasury spokesman, said that the Labor Party now supports the goal of a surplus, that is, a balanced budget, one which is out of the red and into the black.</para></talk.start><para>Mr Evans told Glen Milne on the <inline font-style="italic">Face to Face</inline> program that he agrees that we should have a balanced budget and, in fact, he claimed that Labor would try to produce a budget surplus. Do not hold your breath though, Mr Evans, that opportunity is years away.</para><para>Labor's newest graduate from the Democrats' finishing school, Mrs Kernot, also said over the weekend that a budget surplus was an `appropriate and symbolic goal'. Surely this statement begs the question: from 1990 to 1995 did she let the world's greatest treasurer know of her secret, symbolic goal? It would not appear so, because in May 1992 
 Mrs Kernot told the Senate that the Democrats did not support `the balanced budget nonsense' being pursued at that time by the coalition in opposition. So we can only conclude that this newly discovered appearance of responsibility has been collected on her way across to Mr Evans's office, from where she faxed her resignation to Democrat party headquarters. So now, former Senator Kernot and former Senator Evans have yet another new compact. But, as usual, no praise from her for this government's sensational budget surplus delivered by our Treasurer just two days ago.</para><para>Appropriate and symbolic—that is how Labor now describes the notion of a balanced budget. Of course, in the nineties, Labor often said they would have liked to have brought in a balanced budget. But, instead, they created the recession we had to have and the deficits just grew and grew like Topsy, until thousands of people woke up and gave them the sack. Even so, they left all of us with a disgraceful $10.3 billion deficit.</para><para>Meanwhile, back in the Democrats' newly reconstructed post-Kernot cottage, they also seem to be trying to improve their image and, goodness knows, they need to. Senator Meg Lees released the party's pre-budget submission last week, outlining her views and the party's views on budget policy—surely a new experience for the Democrats. She has elaborated on them in here tonight, and guess what? The Australian Democrats now also believe that, and I quote:</para><para>There is room for a modestly more expansive fiscal policy that delivers a balanced Budget and simultaneously provides a boost to the economy.</para><para>Fancy that! The budget proposals of the Democrats also represent a balancing act and also advocate a surplus as a desirable economic goal, although one a lot more modest than the one we produced just two days ago.</para><para>Despite the many shortcomings of the Democrats pre-budget submission, it is significant to take note of one important concession. That is, that the Democrats share our support for the government's determination to make a balanced budget a permanent part of Australia's economic policy making environment. This is a very commendable objective 
 from the cottage of the Democrats. This consensus between the established parties about the desirability of a balanced budget represents a historic pact in Australian politics which should not be overlooked. It is a commendable objective.</para><para>With this newly discovered consensus, the policy debate can now move steadily onwards. We have been warning that Australia can no longer live beyond its means with the profligate tax and spending policies of the former government. Isn't it now refeshing, and perhaps a little surprising, to find that both other established parties now agree? However, fundamental differences still remain, of course, especially in terms of our capacity to deliver on these economic policies. The Democrats' pronouncements reveal that they still fail to appreciate that it is the very budget surplus which is proving to be our key safeguard against the financial chaos now sweeping the Asian region.</para><para>The surplus is part of Australia's very precious insurance policy. `She'll be right, mate' may be part of the Australian idiom but it should not be part of any responsible political party. Never again should a political party in government be allowed to accumulate the massive debt that lay under the mat on 3 March 1996—never again. There should be no debt, no burden for our children, no crippling interest rate bills and, especially, no Beazley bankcard.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Waterfront</title><page.no>2912</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>2912</page.no><name role="metadata">Gibbs, Sen Brenda</name><name role="display">Senator GIBBS</name><name.id>6L6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Monday 4 May 1998 was a defining day for the Australian labour movement. The High Court of Australia in a six to one decision decided that the sacked employees of Patrick Stevedores should be immediately reinstated. Despite the best efforts of the `spin merchants' for Minister Reith, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), and Patrick, the High Court judgment was an unambiguous statement on the question of the unfair sacking of the unionised work force. The fact that the coalition government is trying every conceivable stunt and scam to ensure that the Patrick labour hire companies fall over is a testimony to how deep a hole they have dug for themselves in this debacle.</para></talk.start><para>On the same day, over 15,000 unionists took to the streets of Brisbane in the largest Labour Day march since the 1930s. The large turnout signalled the level of anti-Howard government feeling for the way it has handled the maritime dispute. This ill will is generated by the deceit of Dubai, the pack mentality of dogs and security guards displacing		people from their workplace, and the initial delight with which this government greeted the midnight sacking of an entire unionised work force.</para><para>Regardless of any questions about waterfront reform, Australians do not like to see this confrontation forced upon other Australians. This imagery will linger in their thoughts for quite a while, and people have only naturally been asking themselves the question, `Is my job safe?'</para><para>Over the past few weeks we have heard conflicting stories from the Prime Minister, Minister Reith, Dr Webster, Mr Corrigan, and former Fynwest owner, Mike Wells, and there is no doubt it is time the Australian public was afforded a factual account of the events of the past 12 to 18 months. It is time for a full independent inquiry, although I would be quite happy to see Minister Reith squirm under questioning from Jennifer Byrne and Kerry O'Brien on the <inline font-style="italic">7.30 Report</inline> a couple more times before the full facts become known.</para><para>I would like to focus on a Queensland aspect of the waterfront dispute. Queensland, you will remember, is the state where the Premier, Deputy Premier and industrial relations minister were begging the NFF to set up their operation before a state election. The Borbidge government was desperate to escalate the dispute to extract any ounce of political advantage, and Mr Borbidge demanded that his police commissioner get tough with peaceful picket line protesters. Mr Borbidge and his industrial relations minister, Mr Santoro, taunted and antagonised the wharf workers in a divisive attempt to seek an election trigger.</para><para>Like their federal colleagues, they have completely misread the central issue for the public—job security concerns.	Like their federal colleagues, they have shown that the 
 key feature of this dispute never has been waterfront reform; it has always been about smashing the Maritime Union of Australia and, as a result, commencing the dismantling of the Australian union movement. The stevedore, Sea-Land Australia, which has a good relationship with the MUA and defends the productivity of its workers, has also shown that this dispute is not about waterfront reform.</para><para>The events we have witnessed in relation to the waterfront dispute represent the most serious effort in nearly a century by the forces of the conservative establishment to do a hatchet job on the Australian labour movement. These forces—manifested as Prime Minister Howard, Minister Reith, the NFF and myriad unknown business backers—have failed legally, economically and socially to break the resolve of the MUA.</para><para>The coalition, as the political lap dogs of the conservative elites, have been prepared to introduce a sense of anarchy and zealotry into Australian society in an attempt to pursue their ideological vendetta against unionised workplaces. In the best traditions of coalition governments, they have attempted to stir up old hatreds in Australian society. Wharfies have been accused of disloyalty to Australia in wartime, working only 14 hour weeks, and being responsible for all the failings of the Australian economy. Regrettably, all this hysteria has done nothing for national cohesion and reconciliation.</para><para>In the process, the coalition has made a mockery of its own legislation. What their actions are saying is that it is not an issue for them to defy the dismissal and freedom of association provisions of the Workplace Relations Act, but that it is essential that the MUA and the ACTU follow to the letter the secondary boycott provisions of the act.</para><para>What this government induced confrontation has also displayed is that the Australian Industrial Relations Commission is the best forum in which to settle workplace disputes. However, the coalition's ideological obsession to strip the commission of its authority and Mr Corrigan perjuring himself at a commission hearing earlier this year  indicate the low 
 esteem conservatives in Australia have for this institution.</para><para>The NFF contribution to this dispute and the actions, including the inactions, of its affiliates and individual members should be condemned in the strongest possible terms. It was not too long ago that the farmers of Australia enjoyed a considerable degree of goodwill from the rest of the community. Due to the soul destroying and financially crippling effects of drought, Australians got behind primary producers and supported them in their tough times. As many people would appreciate, the MUA was one of the most generous donors to farmers. Now we see the peak farm representative organisation, the NFF, telling us about multimillion dollar hidden fighting funds and their desire to be a leading stevedore enterprise. All Australians, not just waterside workers, would be entitled to ask whether they have been conned in the past for feeling sympathy for the farm sector. The actions of the NFF have, by association, put under the microscope the activities of the rural sector. If this sector is serious about seeking reform on Australia's docks, let it come into the debate with clean hands. Let it address some of the anti-competitive, highly protectionist practices within its own industry.</para><para>I read an excellent article in last Saturday's <inline font-style="italic">Courier-Mail</inline> called `Is It Time For Rural Reform, Too?' by award winning journalist, Tony Koch. He questioned the figures which suggest a majority of farmers are on low or negative incomes and whether the average farm indebtedness of $240,000 should be a message to producers and government that perhaps it is time for these people to leave the land. Mr Koch suggested that unproductive farming practices did not deserve to receive an array of state and federal government funding, which includes subsidies for fertilisers, water, diesel, power and freight, amongst a raft of other areas.</para><para>He suggested that farming in geographically unsuitable areas and supporting farmers simply to maintain a family generational connection with the land are no longer acceptable and that governments should review their subsidies in these instances. The article also revealed the inefficiencies and the potential 
 rorts in the administration of various producer organisations. It was revealed that, of the 359 statutory authorities in Queensland, 121 related to primary production. Surely this unwieldy form of administration is in need of reform?</para><para>The budget revealed that the Howard government is keen to extend and entrench these unproductive practices even further within the rural sector. The announcement of a tax rebate of up to 34 per cent for producers to maintain their own land, which will be potentially available to 70 per cent of farmers, will do nothing for genuine farm reform. The initiative is designed to appease the core constituency of the National Party who have been threatening to change to One Nation in their droves. Like so many of the entrenched subsidies to the farm sector, they are draped with a political pandering emphasis. In calling for reform on the waterfront, the rural sector is putting its own industry under scrutiny, and it needs to appreciate this point when it allows its peak industry body to lead the charge against the MUA.</para><para>Finally, I would like to defend the reputation of workers on Brisbane's wharves. These people have been denigrated by both their Prime Minister and their Premier as `not workers but wharfies'. An article in an edition of last month's <inline font-style="italic">Business Queensland</inline>, hardly a publication known for its sympathy to employees, outlined that, of the major container ports in Australia, the Port of Brisbane has probably the least room for a large improvement in crane rates. It stated that Brisbane, like Fremantle, is often a port which is either a first or last port of call. This means that, when loading and unloading containers, crane operators usually have to unload other containers to gain access to the ones they really want to unload. The article also highlighted the folly of making comparisons between Brisbane and the world leader, Singapore. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tax Reform</title><page.no>2914</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>2914</page.no><name role="metadata">Watson, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WATSON</name><name.id>VJ4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Tonight I take the opportunity to open up for public debate within the tax reform environment the need for a limited carry back of tax losses. Currently, Australia enjoys a 
 carry forward of tax losses, but such an environment does not help all companies, particularly those that face the insolvency or bankruptcy of a major client and a situation where they have paid tax on an accrual basis and have paid their income tax on that. The result is generally difficulty for the business and a problem for continued employment.</para></talk.start><para>Prior to that I wish to spend a moment or two on tax reform generally. As we all know, the tax system was designed in the 1930s. The 1936 income tax act had only 120 pages. It now has some 3,300 or more. In fact, over the last seven years it has doubled in size. Therefore, few would disagree that the existing system is inefficient, uncompetitive, inequitable, high-cost compliant and increasingly complex. Both the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Treasurer (Mr Costello) have stated that comprehensive tax reform is now a matter of urgency, widely sought and widely desired.</para><para>The objectives that the government has set for the reform of the tax system are to provide incentives to work, save and invest and to boost international competitiveness, thus promoting job creation and leading to improved living standards. As we enter the new millennium, it is imperative that Australia go forth with full vigour in order to maximise our potential and to regain our place on the world stage.</para><para>Inheriting an underlying budget deficit of $10.3 billion was a major setback and a major shock for the coalition on winning government. I must say that it has taken strong fiscal management in order to fill that black hole left by Messrs Keating and Beazley. There have been no increased taxes, just careful restraint of outlays, to return Australia's macro-economic fundamentals to a sound footing. That has been particularly important given the Asian meltdown.</para><para>Tax reform, however, remains the greatest piece of unfinished business on the economic agenda. Business, operating in highly contested domestic and global markets, needs little convincing of the benefits of tax reform. The current system is imposing costs which can no longer be afforded. Small business and larger companies have separate as well as 
 common concerns for reform. Governments at all levels are seeing their revenue bases gradually eroded by structural change in the economy and are having to apply complex, inefficient and unpopular bandaid measures in response. The Howard government, through tax reform, will achieve better economic and social outcomes, higher living standards, strengthened families and real jobs.</para><para>On 13 August, the Prime Minister announced the formation of an interdepartmental task force to report to government on options for reform. The broad guidelines given to the tax consultative task force were: there should be no increase in the overall tax burden; there should be major reductions in personal income tax, especially for families; a broad-based indirect tax should be considered to replace some or all of the existing indirect taxes; compensation for those deserving of special consideration must be part of the package; and a reform of government and state financial relations must be addressed.</para><para>From these guidelines it is clear that the government's present thinking involves comprehensive reform of both direct and indirect taxes. But I remind the Senate that tax reform must be more than providing tax savings or tax cuts to individuals or shareholders. The reform must assist business to ensure that cost compliance is at a minimum and enable it to take advantage of competitive environments in both domestic and international markets. Many individuals and representatives of the community have taken up the government's offer to present their views on how best to improve the current system. There have been over 500 submissions to the committee. This has been an important and constructive process which continues.</para><para>There is a need to support and enhance the competitiveness of Australian industry in both the domestic and export markets. Many countries have provisions which allow losses to be offset against income from other periods. Carry forward of losses, where losses can be written off against future years profits, is provided for in most countries. Carry back—the concept that I am encouraging people to examine tonight—is where current losses can be written off against past years 
 profits. This measure is provided for in a number of OECD countries and it has a number of advantages for companies and employment.</para><para>Carry back involves a procedure of amended assessments and refunds. The value of any carry forward or carry back of losses will depend on a variety of factors affecting the business of a company. A company just commencing operations will be unable to use any carry back, while a company ceasing operations will be unable to use any carry forward. Of the OECD countries studied, only Australia and New Zealand do not allow any carry back. The carry back is limited to three years in Canada and the UK, two years in the US and Germany and only one year in Japan.</para><para>Because of our dividend imputations, which complicates the situation, what I am advocating for Australia is just a one-year carry back. But in Canada, the US and Japan, the taxpayers have a choice of carrying the loss forward, back or using a combination. In Germany, unused losses are automatically carried back across the two preceding years, with any excess loss being carried forward. The carry back of losses in Germany is limited to DM10 million.</para><para>As well as carry back, Germany and the UK allow an indefinite carry forward; however, in the UK the carry forward and deduction of losses is allowed only against income from the same trade as a loss. Carry forwards are indefinite in Australia, the UK, Germany and New Zealand. They are limited to 20 years in the US, seven years in Canada and five years in Japan.</para><para>So in comparison with the OECD group, the current Australian treatment of losses suffers because there are no provisions for actual carry back. It is difficult to allow the carry back of losses under a full imputation system such as that in Australia. However, allowing the carry back of losses for one year would be practical, would minimise the loss of revenue in consequence of having given credit to individual shareholders, and would bring Australia into line with the intent of carry back provisions of other OECD countries and our major trading partners.</para><para>The United Kingdom treatment of trading losses and their offset against profits of preceding periods is an excellent example to examine. For current accounting periods after 31 March, the end of the UK financial year, a company's trading losses can, to the extent to which they cannot be used against the current period's profits, also be carried back against profits arising from the previous 36 months, with any necessary apportionment of the results of a previous accounting period being made to effect this.</para><para>A company in the UK must make its claim for relief within two years of the end of the accounting period in which it made its loss, with a statutory power in respect of the general three-year carry back to increase the limit where appropriate. Relief is given against profits of a later accounting period before those of an earlier accounting period.</para><para>The present system in Australia prejudices those businesses receiving very large payments in one year, with considerably smaller payments in the next, with a consequent higher tax payment. A case could well be where a subcontractor, with a contract spanning two years, receives a very large progress payment in one financial year and, because of a profit circumstance, is subject to a higher than normal bill for taxation. Because of cash flow requirements in order to complete the contract, the subcontractor is forced to borrow funds in order to settle his commitments to the tax office.

 owa being summonsed in respect of 54 criminal charges of uttering and forging which are being prosecuted against her.</para></talk.start><para>Upon the serving of those summonses, the Labor Party dismissed her as the candidate and brought back the existing member who, some time previously, had announced that he was too old and that it was time to give it away and let a younger person have a go. Suddenly, he has been thrust back into the limelight; he is standing again in the forlorn hope that he might retain the seat.</para><para>In the unlikely event that he does retain the seat, he would be there only as a caretaker; he has no interest whatsoever in remaining in the state parliament, knowing that he would be in opposition yet again. That would result in a by-election at very great expense to the Queensland taxpayers, and it would mean that the people of Thuringowa would have a lame duck member who was not interested in representing them. But I do not think that is going to happen, because it is unlikely that Mr McElligott will win the seat. I am quite confident that the Liberal candidate, David Moore, who is a young person—the sort of person that Mr McElligott, the current Labor member, indicated should take over in that seat—will win and give the electors of Thuringowa the sort of representation they deserve.</para><para>I was surprised at the fact that people do listen to the parliamentary and news network. Following my speech there were quite a number of calls to my office from people who, like me, were sickened by the evidence of vote rigging by the ALP in the state preselection contest in Townsville—a practice which seems to be fairly widespread in the ALP. I quoted yesterday some evidence from Victoria and New South Wales, and indicated that this malaise, this disease, in those states has now spread to North Queensland.</para><para>It was bad enough that Ms Ehrmann was summonsed on 54 counts of forging and uttering and was dismissed by the Labor Party—although, just a couple of days before that, the state leader of the Labor Party in Queensland, Mr Beattie, had been expressing great confidence in this candidate, and had even agreed to come to Townsville to open 
 her campaign office this Saturday. Of course, Mr Beattie is too weak and too ineffectual to be able to control some of the shenanigans and goings-on within the Labor Party in Townsville.</para><para>That was bad enough, but we find out today that, as a result of all that preselection vote rigging by the ALP in the Townsville area, a Townsville City Council alderman, Councillor Shane Foster, has also been charged as part of that racket. He has been charged with 32 counts of forging and uttering. I emphasise that he has only been charged; he is, of course, not guilty until the court proceeds with those matters.</para><para>For those of us who live in the Townsville area, it is something that has been expected for a long time, because the preselections up there have been particularly bitter. It has now happened that the successful candidate, who some say won as a result of that vote rigging, has now been forced to stand aside.</para><para>Those sorts of rumours have been going around as well in the state electorate of Townsville, where the former mayor, Mike Reynolds, defeated the current mayor, Tony Mooney, for preselection for that state seat. In fact, a report in the <inline font-style="italic">Townsville Bulletin</inline> this morning said:</para><para>Mike Reynolds, an Ehrman—</para><para>and Ehrman was the candidate who had been forced to resign after receiving those summonses—</para><para>pre-selection ally and candidate for Townsville, reacted angrily when asked yesterday whether he had been summonsed.</para><para>Again, he says he has not, but you get the flavour of what is happening from the article on the front page of the <inline font-style="italic">Townsville Bulletin</inline> . The people of Townsville wait to see whether, in addition to the candidate for Thuringowa, a city council alderman, other ALP candidates may be caught up in this vote-rigging, fraudulent, criminal exercise.

I understand that he wishes to pay tribute to the recently deceased mayor of the town of Casino in northern New South Wales, Mr Senthil Vasan, a man whom I knew very well. In closing my speech, I indicate that I would like to associate myself with the comments that Senator Sandy Macdonald will make about the former mayor of Casino.</para></talk.start></continue></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Dr Senthil Vasan</title><title>Waterfront</title><page.no>2917</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>2917</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Sandy</name><name role="display">Senator SANDY MACDONALD</name><name.id>CX5</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I wish to take a moment tonight, with some sadness, to pay tribute to the late Senthil Vasan who was the mayor of Casino. I know that Senator Ian Macdonald had been to Casino a number of times and also knew Dr Vasan quite well. As members of the Senate will be aware, Dr Vasan was tragically killed in a plane accident late last week. His passing is a great loss to his family, his friends, the people of Casino and to the north coast of New South Wales generally.</para></talk.start><para>Dr Vasan was born in Malaysia 62 years ago and arrived in Casino in 1977 with his wife Vicki and two sons. He immediately became involved in the local community and, during his 21 years as a doctor in general practice in Casino, he was also an active member of Rotary, a visiting medical officer at Casino Hospital, and a member of the aero club.</para><para>Dr Vasan entered local government and he was both committed and effective. In 1991, Dr Vasan was elected mayor of Casino. At that time he said, `Casino has been good to me', and he repaid Casino by being good to it. The general manager of the Casino council, Mr Ross Schipp, said:</para><para>He was a visionary. A person able to appreciate the bigger picture, something which can be difficult in local government.</para><para>Dr Vasan also sat on the Northern Rivers Regional Development Board, was president of the Northern Rivers Regional Organisation of Councils, a past president of the Country Mayors Association and a member of the Premier's Taskforce on Regional Development.</para><para>As the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Tim Fischer, said at the funeral, Dr Vasan was a truly outstanding citizen. From my personal contacts with him I know that he was someone who got the most out of life. He was devoted to his family and to his many friends. He was involved in everything. Perhaps most importantly, his energy, initiative and hard work had won him the respect of many people in his new country.</para><para>He was a charming and interesting companion and he had a certain mysticism about him that was very much a product of his heritage. His close friend and the deputy mayor of Casino, Councillor Mulherin, told the <inline font-style="italic">Northern Star</inline> newspaper:</para><para>Council will carry on because we have to, but we are going to miss Senthil like mad.</para><para>I express my deepest sympathy to his wife and sons, who have lost a loving and caring husband and father.</para><para>On another matter, I cannot let the opportunity pass without making some comments about the contribution of Senator Gibbs tonight. I do not know what stone Senator Gibbs has been under. She comes in here and reads into <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> her clapped-out left-wing rhetoric concerning the MUA and the current waterfront dispute. It is a mockery of good reason for Senator Gibbs to defend the MUA and, in a subsequent breath, to criticise Australian farmers.</para><para>The comments of my `good friend' Lindsay Tanner are really telling. He is reputed to have said, `It is impossible for us in the ALP to defend the indefensible.' Senator Gibbs's comments breach the Hobart resolution of the ALP conference held in January or early February to open up the waterfront. There is a history of rorts and intimidation. The MUA 
 is not a friend of the farmers: it never has been and it never will be.</para><para>In the brief time that I have, I would like to go back to some of the reasons for the reform efforts and note the role that the Australian farmers have played in this area of industrial relations reform. Waterfront reform will boost jobs and exports for all Australians, and this is especially true for primary producers, country people and rural people generally.</para><para>With the live sheep dispute in 1979, which was a perfectly bloody-minded effort by the MUA to prevent the export of live sheep to the Middle East, the birth of the NFF was assured. It was a great win for commonsense. Live sheep were exported then and they are still being exported.</para><para>Next, in the late 1980s were the changes to bulk handling of wheat on the waterfront after an enormous amount of capital investment which ensured world's best practice. These bulk handling terminals are now substantially operated without union membership—and certainly not by MUA membership.</para><para>In 1982, the NFF took on the AWU over the wide-combs dispute in the shearing industry. Here, if ever there was an example of a union being ignorant and bloody-minded, this was the AWU. The AWU destroyed their membership and deserved to do so.</para><para>They attempted to stop probably the hardest working people in the country—shearers who get paid piece rates only for what they actually do—not like the MUA who are paid $73,000 a year for meter reading. The AWU tried to stop these people using a bit of equipment that made their job easier and more productive, and ensured them an income which they would not have had if they had continued to work with the smaller combs. It was no wonder that the Australian shearing industry gave the two-fingered salute to the AWU. They left the union membership and have never returned.</para><para> In 1985, of course, we had Mudginberri where, again, a union tried to prevent a legitimate operation of an abattoir in the Northern Territory. The NFF was instrumental in making the job of the meat workers in 
 volved in that dispute absolutely impossible for them to survive.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><adjournment><adjournmentinfo><time.stamp>21:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>2919</page.no></adjournmentinfo><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senate adjourned at 9.24 p.m. until Monday, 25 May 1998, at 12.30 p.m.</inline></para></adjournment><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>2919</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tabling</title><page.no>2919</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following documents were tabled by the Clerk:</para><para>Defence Act—</para><para>	 Defence Determinations 1998/18 and 1998/19.</para><para>	 Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal—Determinations Nos 13 and 14 of 1998.</para><para>Financial Management and Accountability Act—Determination under section—</para><para>	 20—Australian Greenhouse Office Reserve.</para><para></para><para>	 21—Commonwealth Superannuation Administration Fund.</para><para>Insurance Act—</para><para>	 Determination No. 1 of 1998.</para><para>	 Insurance (Designated Security Trust Funds) Rules 1998.</para><para>	 Insurance (Lloyd's Security Trust Fund Arrangements) Determination 1998.</para><para>	 Regulations—Statutory Rules 1998 No. 80.</para><para>Insurance (Agents and Brokers) Act—</para><para>	 Approval of Form No. 1 of 1998.</para><para>	 Approval of Form (and Manner) No. 2 of 1998.</para><para>Taxation Determinations TD 98/8-TD 98/10.</para><para>Telecommunications Act—Determination under section 7A, dated 14 April 1998.</para><para></para></subdebate.1></debate></chamber.xscript><answers.to.questions><debate><debateinfo><type>Answers to Questions on Notice</type><title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title><page.no>2920</page.no></debateinfo><para>The following answers to questions were circulated:</para><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Family Reunion Programs</title><page.no>2920</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 1105)</subtitle><id.no>1105</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>2920</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator Bartlett</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice, on 23 March 1998:</para></talk.start><para>With reference to an article in the Sydney Morning Herald of 19 March 1998, which reported the Minister as saying that parents migrating to Australia as part of family reunion programs come disproportionately from countries which do not have social security systems: (a) can a detailed breakdown be provided of the countries of origin of the migrants who were issued parent visas in the financial years of 1995-96, 1996-97 and to date in 1997-98; and (b) can a breakdown be provided of these countries of origin which do not have social security systems.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>2920</page.no><name role="metadata">Vanstone, Sen Amanda</name><name role="display">Senator Vanstone</name><name.id>7E4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Justice</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs has
