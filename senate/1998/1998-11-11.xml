It has been proven over the past two years that it can achieve substantial savings in public expenditure.</para><para>The Data-matching Program is also valuable in encouraging voluntary compliance with the rules in place to ensure payments are targeted to those in need. It reminds the community that it is not a case of if fraud will be detected, but when. It has now become an important feature of the review mechanisms that are helping to build the integrity of the system and the confidence of the public that the system is, in fact, secure from fraud.</para><para>There are on-going review and reporting arrangements in place to allow the Parliament to maintain its scrutiny of the Program. The present Government, when in Opposition, argued successfully for continuation of this scrutiny. The Privacy Commissioner continues to play an important role in ensuring that the Government agencies participating in the Data-matching Program abide by the strict conditions already set down in the legislation to protect the privacy of individuals. In addition to the Privacy Commissioner being able to seek information and scrutinise the activities of the Agencies 
 involved in the Data-matching Program, there is a requirement that those Agencies report annually to the Privacy Commissioner. The act also requires that these reports are laid before the Parliament. There is also a triennial report to the Parliament covering the three previous financial years. The first triennial report is due in the second half of this year.</para><para>Madam President, in 1996 the Australian National Audit Office (ANAO) conducted a follow-up of its 1993 Audit of Data-matching within the Department of Social Security. This review was in keeping with this Government's 1996 election commitment to review the Data-matching Program.</para><para>Madam President it can be noted that the ANAO's Audit opinion given in its 1996 report was as follows:</para><para>Overall the Department has made substantial achievements through implementing legislative changes, improved reporting procedures, savings collection, better targeting and project evaluation processes. These changes have resulted in both substantial increases in savings generated by the Program and in efficiency improvements.</para><para>When the Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Act 1990 was first enacted it incorporated a sunset clause to take effect in January 1993. That sunset clause has, however, been extended by the Parliament on three separate occasions. The latest occasion was in 1995 when the sunset clause was extended until 23 January 1999. In part the sunset clause was kept in place because of concerns in the Parliament that the Data-matching Program would not achieve the expected savings and in part as an attempt to allow the Parliament to maintain scrutiny of the Program.</para><para>Madam President, the Data-matching Program has now proven that very substantial savings can be achieved, and the Parliament has been regularly informed of the operation of the Program in addition to its deliberation of bills previously introduced to deal with the sunset clause. The Program has become an important feature of the overall social welfare system and one that needs to be given a permanent place in the continuing efforts to maintain and improve that system. In the event that the sunset clause is allowed to come into effect, the loss of savings that could be achieved would be in the order of $560 million over the four years from 1998-99. Accordingly, this bill seeks to remove the sunset clause.</para><para>Madam President, I commend the bill to the Senate.</para><para>Ordered that further consideration of the second reading speech of this bill be adjourned till 14 days after today, in accordance with standing order 111.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (STRENGTHENING OF PROVISIONS RELATING TO CHARACTER AND CONDUCT) BILL 1998 (No. 2)</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>59</page.no><id.no>s180</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>59</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kemp</inline>) agreed to:</para><para>That the following bill be introduced: a bill for an act to amend the Migration Act 1958, and for other purposes.</para><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kemp</inline>) agreed to:</para><para>That this bill may proceed without formalities and be now read a first time.</para><para>Bill read a first time.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>59</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>59</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI table the explanatory memorandum and move:</para></talk.start><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para><para>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline></para><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The speech read as follows</inline>â</para><para>The purpose of this bill is to ensure that the Government can effectively discharge its fundamental responsibility to prevent the entry and stay in Australia of non-citizens who have a criminal background or have criminal associations.</para><para>This bill is largely the same as one which was before the Senate in the last Parliament.</para><para>The Government has, however, made two changes from that bill. The first of these extends the time limit for lodging review applications with the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, and the second doubles the time in which that Tribunal will have to review such applications.</para><para>In considering this bill, we must remember that the vast majority of non-citizens who come to Australia are in fact law-abiding people.</para><para>In a world of rapidly increasing people movements, our immigration arrangements must be designed to streamline the entry and stay of all genuine visitors, students, business people and permanent residents. However, a small proportion of non-citizens seeking to enter Australia do have substantial criminal backgrounds or criminal associations. Others commit crimes while they are in Australia.</para><para>Steps to improve the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs' ability to detect visa applicants with substantial criminal backgrounds or associations are being taken including consultation 
 with law enforcement bodies overseas. For these steps to be effective, however, they must be complemented by legislative provisions to ensure that non-citizens with criminal backgrounds or criminal associations can be refused a visa. The provisions must also enable the Government to remove those non-citizens who are detained following convictions for crimes committed in Australia.</para><para>Experience over recent years has shown that the existing legislative provisions are inadequate for this task. This is despite the fact that they were amended as recently as 1992 with the express purpose of improving the Government's ability to deal with visa applicants and visa holders with a substantial criminal background. In broad terms, the bill seeks to enhance the Government's ability to deal with non-citizens who are not of good character in three ways:</para><para>.	 First, decision-making in routine cases will be improved by:</para><para>-	 requiring applicants to show that they are of good character;</para><para>-	 deeming that certain levels of criminal sentences will lead to an automatic finding that the non-citizen concerned is not of good character; and</para><para>-	 allowing the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs to give binding directions to decision-makers.</para><para>.	 Secondly, in exceptional or emergency circumstances, the Minister, acting personally, will be given powers to act decisively on matters of visa refusal, cancellation and the removal of non-citizens.</para><para>.	 Thirdly, information provided by Australian and international law enforcement agencies will be afforded more effective protection so that such agencies can be confident about passing information to immigration decision-makers.</para><para>I will now describe the major provisions of the bill in more detail.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">The character test</inline></para><para>The amendments proposed in this bill introduce the concept of a character test. Under this test, the onus will be on visa applicants and visa holders to satisfy decision-makers that they can pass the test. This will redress a significant deficiency in the legislation arising from the changes made in 1992. Since that time, decision-makers have been required to establish that a person is not of good character before they could refuse a visa to an applicant or cancel a visa. This has meant that, whenever there has been doubt about the criminal background or criminal associations of a non-citizen, the doubt has been resolved in the non-citizen's favour. I understand that this was not the intention of the 1992 amendments.  
</para><para>This bill then takes us back to the situation that existed before 1992 by placing the onus of proof on the visa applicant to demonstrate that he or she is of good character. This means that where there are real doubts about the criminal background or criminal associations of a visa applicant or visa holder, the objective of protecting the Australian community will take precedence in immigration decision-making.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Deeming provisions</inline></para><para>This bill also seeks to establish clear benchmarks for criminal behaviour that would automatically lead to a non-citizen failing the character test. Non-citizens who have been convicted to a single sentence of detention of 12 months or more, or where the length of several sentences aggregates to two years or more, will fail the character test. This will truncate the character assessment process and cover most non-citizens of character concern who come to notice. This will provide more certainty as to who is able to pass the character test.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Binding directions on exercise of the discretion</inline></para><para>Once it is established that a visa applicant or visa holder does not pass the character test, decision-makers will have to decide whether to refuse the application or to cancel the visa. Exercise of this discretion will need to take into account a wide range of factors including: the non-citizen's links to Australia; the nature of crimes committed; and any international law obligations.</para><para>This bill will enable the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs to give precise written directions on what weight is to be given to each of these factors. These directions must be binding on all decision makers, including merits review tribunals, to ensure a consistency of approach. The written directions will be tabled in Parliament.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Protection of criminal intelligence </inline></para><para>Criminal intelligence and related information is critical to assessing the criminal background or associations of non-citizen visa applicants and visa holders. At present, it is difficult for the Department to use such information in making character decisions because its disclosure might be threatened. Australian and international law enforcement agencies are reluctant to provide sensitive information unless they are sure that both the information and its sources can be protected. Greater protection for such material would complement broader national and international strategies to counter transnational crime and the activities of those associated with it.</para><para>This bill increases the level of protection for such information. I cannot overstate the importance of this protection to the job of preventing the entry of foreign criminals to Australia. This was highlighted in the Minister's recent discussions with officials of international law enforcement agencies. 
</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Merits review </inline></para><para>The opportunity to appeal character decisions to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) will be retained. However, there is a critical need to reform these arrangements in two main respects: first, in terms of speeding up merits review processes; and, secondly, in terms of ensuring that merits review decisions reflect community standards and expectations.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Merits review streamlining and time limits</inline></para><para>Where a non-citizen who is already in Australia is refused a further visa or has their visa cancelled on character grounds, it is essential that merits review cannot be used to prolong stay in Australia at taxpayers' expense. The average time currently taken for such cases at merits review is 227 days from the initial notification to a final decision. Many cases take even longer.</para><para>During this time, the non-citizens involved, many of whom have committed serious crimes, either will be in detention at great cost to the taxpayer or will be at liberty in the community. Quite frankly, this must stop. This bill introduces more streamlined procedures for dealing with such cases. It also introduces a strict 84 day time limit for the conduct of merits review cases involving character where the non-citizen is in Australia.</para><para>We will ensure that all relevant documentation necessary for the AAT to determine the matter will be provided quickly, at the outset of the process. The amendments will establish a new process where the Department will be required to provide two copies of the relevant documentation to the applicant at the time of the decision. Then, at the time the appeal is made, the applicant only has to lodge one copy of the documentation with the AAT. The need for strict time limits is consistent with other review processes in the immigration area where delay can prejudice both the applicant and the community.</para><para>The provision will result in a more streamlined process, with the applicant, the Department and the AAT using less time and resources to obtain the necessary documentation. Currently much effort is devoted to, and delay arises in, pursuing papers and documentation from non-citizens and the Department.</para><para>The strict time limit will prevent non-citizens from further attempts to delay the resolution of their case.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Minister's power to intervene or set aside Administrative Appeals Tribunal decisions</inline></para><para>Over the past 12 months or so, the AAT has made a number of character decisions that are clearly at odds with community standards and expectations. The AAT has found a number of non-citizens, who have been convicted of very serious crimes, to be 
 of good character, and has ruled that they should be granted a visa. This has alarmed the community and I might say the community, when they are aware of these decisions, hold the Government and not the AAT responsible.</para><para>It is essential that the Minister, acting personally, have the power to intervene or set aside such decisions in the national interest. The Minister should, however, continue to be required to table the making of any such decisions in the Parliament.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Emergency cases </inline></para><para>From time to time, there will be emergency cases involving non-citizens who may be a significant threat to the community. These people may be threatening violence or some other act of destruction or have a prior history of serious crime. In these emergency circumstances, the Minister, again acting personally, should have the power to act without notice and have them taken into detention.</para><para>Once the visa is cancelled, the non-citizen will have a right to make a submission to the Minister as to why the cancellation should be revoked. Natural justice will apply in such cases. However, if they cannot satisfy the Minister that they pass the character test, they should be removed immediately. Parliament should be notified of the making of such decisions but the decisions should not be subject to merits review because of their national significance. The Minister is very accountable for his actionsâto the Parliament, his colleagues, and to the people of Australia.</para><para>The provision is similar in nature to other provisions already present in the Migration ActâSubdivision F of the Migration Act (section 128) provides for cancellation offshore without notice and the right of the non-citizen to make a subsequent submission as to why the cancellation or refusal should be revoked. This Subdivision was inserted in 1992 by the previous Government.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Conclusion</inline></para><para>In summary, this bill sends a clear and unequivocal message on behalf of the Australian community. The Australian community expects that non-citizens coming to Australia should be of good character. To discharge this expectation, the Government must have the ability to act quickly and decisively, wherever necessary, to remove non-citizens who are not of good character.</para><para>During debate in the House of Representatives before the election, the Opposition indicated that they supported the objective that the Government provides for in this bill. This bill now incorporates some amendments reflecting discussions between the Minister and the then Opposition spokesman.</para><para>I commend the bill to the Chamber.</para><para>Ordered that further consideration of the second reading speech of this bill be ad

Section 20 of the ESOS Act is a sunset clause which will deactivate the act on 1 January 1999.</para><para>The government requests an amendment to the sunset clause by extending the date the sunset clause takes effect from 1 January 1999 to 1 January 2002. This amendment recognises that the ESOS Act:</para><para>.	 has universal and strong support of stakeholders in the industry; and</para><para>.	 has achieved its objectives of ensuring the quality of providers and courses and a stable domestic environment for the industry.</para><para>A stable domestic environment is particularly important to maintain confidence in Australia's international education industry during the current volatile period in many of Australia's major source markets.  
</para><para>The ESOS Act was introduced to provide both financial protection and quality assurance for international students who choose to study in Australia. In 1993 the ESOS Act was amended to enhance the quality and integrity of our educational products and to strengthen the protection the act offers to international students' prepaid funds. Assurances are provided by registering providers of international education and training, based on State or Territory approval and accreditation, and by imposing financial conditions on private education providers.</para><para>The principal act was introduced in 1991 to meet three main objectives, namely:</para><para>.	 to ensure that international students in Australia are treated with equity and fairness;</para><para>.	 to provide a positive basis for promoting Australia's international reputation as a provider of reliable high quality education and training; and</para><para>.	 to ensure that tax payers' funds are not required to recompense international students who may have been let down by individual education and training providers.</para><para>These objectives remain relevant today. This is the universal view of industry representatives expressed to independent consultants in national consultations in 1996 and in further consultations with stakeholders in April and May 1998.</para><para>In 1996 the ESOS Act was amended to extend the sunset clause from 1 January 1997 to 1 January 1999. This followed a review of the ESOS Act by an independent consultant which indicated universal support for the continuation of the current cooperative approach to industry regulation. The reviewers found strong support for the Commonwealth maintaining a regulatory role in relation to the education exports industry. The relevant arguments relate to international trade, immigration and foreign affairs matters which could not readily be coordinated by the States or Territories or by industry bodies.</para><para>International trade in education and training services will earn an estimated $3.4 billion for Australia in export revenue in 1998. Stakeholders argue that the existing regulation of the industry adds value in the market place and they have indicated strong support for retaining the ESOS Act as part of a cooperative Commonwealth, State/Territory and industry approach to regulation. In particular, they want to maintain the Commonwealth Register of Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students (the register).</para><para>There are costs to the Commonwealth in maintaining the regulatory framework, including the register. The costs are shared by the Commonwealth and industry through the collection of annual and initial registration charges, introduced in 1997. 
</para><para>The cooperative regulatory model, with the Commonwealth's ESOS Act as the key national element, has successfully maintained a stable domestic environment for the education and training services export industry over the past five years. This is evidenced by Australia's highly successful engagement in education exports and the continued strong support which stakeholders have for the ESOS Act.</para><para>Stakeholders' support for the ESOS Act recognises that the growth of Australia's international education industry depends on the confidence that students overseas have in the quality of the courses they undertake and the protection of the moneys they invest in receiving an Australian education.</para><para>The international education and training industry is an important and valuable one for Australia. It is a major part of Australia's growth in the export of services, bringing many intangible benefits, including the development of contacts for future trade, and ideas and international perspectives. The confidence of students is fundamental to the credibility and viability of the industry which accounts for over $3 billion in export earnings annually. This industry deserves the support of the existing Commonwealth, State/Territory and industry cooperative framework and this bill enables the framework to continue until 1 January 2002 during a volatile and uncertain period for export services industries.</para><para>A three year extension to the ESOS Act's sunset clause will allow a stable domestic environment to be maintained during a time of economic volatility in major source markets.

Those honourable senators who take part in the debate on the motion may also be partaking in a process which may change or even be abandoned in the next parliament. The Governor-General's speech outlined, as is customary, the legislative program to be pursued in this parliamentâthe 39thâby the newly elected government.</para><para> The first and principal objective of the government will be to legislate for taxation reform. There is overwhelming agreement in the community that our present system of taxation has many disadvantages. It is unfair and therefore inequitable in some of its aspects; conceptually, it is a product of many generations past and therefore reflects the needs of a past society; it places heavy imposts on export industries, imposts which competitor nations do not bear. Above all, its complexity is such that only specialised professionals understand the act and then only 
 sections of the act. If the playersâthat is, the taxpayers of Australiaâdo not understand the rules, they can be forgiven if they do not play the game properly.</para><para> No-one at this stage can predict in what legislative form the government's proposals will emerge from this parliament. The only certainty is that the amendments to those proposals, if there are any, will have their origins in the Senate and be the subject of strongly contested debate. There is an argument that can be advanced that, if the government does not achieve its tax reform objectives in legislative form in this parliament, then it can move progressively in later parliaments to achieve its goals; that since there is no such thing as a perfect tax system, because society is constantly changing, there is no final end point to reform in taxation legislation.</para><para> As an experienced legislator, I have a marked preference for incremental and logical change to society rather than radical and precipitate change. But the nature of the change proposed by the government to our taxation laws is such that partial implementation of those proposals will achieve nothing and may well be contrary to the community's interests.</para><para>The government will conduct a referendum through 1999 into whether Australia becomes a republic or not as a consequence of the Constitutional Convention held earlier this year. Like the tax reform legislation, the wording of the legislation setting up the referendum will occasion intense debate in this chamber. The difference will be that no party lines will be enforcedâat least on the government sideâfor this debate. It is quite conceivable that no one position will attain majority support in this chamber. The referendum will, however, proceed because the Australian constitution provides that a referendum proposal needs the support of one chamber only to be put to the people, if after three months the other chamber fails to agree.</para><para>Apart from legislative matters, two major issues will demand a high priority in the 39th Parliament. The state of the economies of the nations of the world will be an ever present concern through the life of this parliament. Of 
 particular concern to Australia is the state of the Asian economies both with respect to international trade and the impact depressed economies have on political stability. Our two nearest neighbours, Papua New Guinea and Indonesia, are nations which are enduring very grievous economic circumstances, which is a matter of great importance to Australia.</para><para>The other great area of interest through this parliament will be the preparations for the Olympic Games and the celebration of the foundation of the Commonwealth of Australia in 2001. Both these events, the games and the centenary celebrations, provide enormous opportunities for Australia's growth and development as a society and as a nation.</para><para>While reconciliation with our indigenous members of our Australian community stands distinct as an issue in its own right, and it is a matter that the government says will be addressed in this parliament, it also has a central role in relation to Australia as a cohesive society. As this society grows and changes, there is a fundamental requirement not to form a grey, characterless uniform society but a vibrant society of diverse interests, but having agreement on common social goals and values. The games and the centenary celebrations are very important to us as a nation in this context because they provide opportunities for us to reaffirm the beliefs that we share as a community.</para><para>Let me in the final passage of this address-in-reply return to my comment at the beginning about the future. Clearly, if we have a republic, there will be no pledge of loyalty to a monarch. If there is a republic, I am sure though that some form of support for the administrative system of Australia will replace the current address-in-reply. While such exercises are not devoid of elements of symbolism, they do serve to remind us that we are here as custodians for the time being of the principles under which democratic government takes place.</para><para>Whether or not Australia becomes a republic is a matter for the Australian community to decide, and I will not use this opportunity to enter the debate which is properly a matter for another time. The one point that should be made is that the present system has worked 
 very well. Our system of parliamentary democracy has been tested and not found wanting. It has been tested in peace, in economic and constitutional crises; it has been tested in war; it has been tested originally by a homogenous society and, more recently, by a multicultural society. It has not failed us.</para><para> As someone with a very deep interest in parliamentary procedures and great respect for the institution of the parliament, I believe we have the best system of any democratic process in the world. Most of the faults we have in our parliamentary process arise from human failings not from the organisational structure. To me as a legislator, the virtue of our present system which transcends all others is the existence of a neutral umpire in the form of a governor-general. As a senator, I have had the privilege of serving under four governors-generalâSir Zelman Cowan, Sir Ninian Stephen, Bill Hayden and Sir William Deaneâall eminently distinguished Australians, all deeply and unambiguously Australian in character.</para><para>To me it is a pedantic point of no moment that they are the Queen's representatives. They were and are the de facto head of state of Australia and they are Australian to their bootstraps. Whatever my personal views on a republic, I cannot share the view that I am somehow diminished and the nation is diminished because we have a Governor-General rather than a president. Nor, on the same theme, though I have lived out of Australia for a considerable part of my adult life and travel internationally frequently, have I ever experienced any lack of respect for Australia by citizens of any other country because we have a Governor-General.</para><para>But I want to return to the concept of the neutral umpire. Government is difficult. It is an unrelenting duty, irrespective of what political persuasion the government of the day is. The longer a government is in power, the heavier the load becomes. There is a constant and great temptation on a ministry and on a prime minister to take an expedient route to ease the load, particularly in emergencies. The fact that these steps have not been taken by an Australian government is due in no small part to the presence of a Governor-General 
 divorced from the mainstream political process.</para><para>While claiming that our system of government and a democratic parliament is a superior one, I do not discount the desirability of change in detail of some of our procedures. Since the Australian constitution was framed by practising politicians who were all members of political parties of the day, it has always seemed strange to me that debate in the chamber has always been vested with the pretence of an air of objectivity. Sadly, it is not true to say that a senator can make a cogent and well-reasoned speech and convince his or her political opponents of the logic of their case and enlist their support. Then, as now, political outcomes in relation to legislation are determined outside the chamber, not on its floor. That is not to say that there should be no debate permitted in second reading speeches or in the committee stage. Of course there must, so that various senators can explain their position. But surely we can find a procedure when there is no opposition to a piece of legislation so that it can pass through the chamber without senators speaking to the bill and thereby taking up the time of the chamber. Such a move would cumulatively save quite a deal of chamber time in a year, time which could be more profitably used for other purposes.</para><para>My basic point is that the parliament should represent the interests of the community. Legislative procedures take up most of the time of this chamber, but parliaments should have wider horizons than passing bills compelling citizens to do this or that. General business on a Thursday afternoon provides a useful window and an opportunity for those not in the government to debate an issue not of the government's choosing. General business does, however, suffer from a degree of inflexibility. The chamber has little opportunity to discuss issues of community interest or concern. True, another opportunity exists under matters of public importance and urgency motions, but they invariably involve an adversarial and partisan approach and seldom are creative.</para><para>The Senate does need time, and should make time, to discuss and acquaint itself with 
 community issues of interest other than those covered by bills before the parliament. For example, we invest a great deal of time and resource in our committee system. The committee system is one of the great assets of the parliament. I have often said that I would have left the parliament many years ago but for the committee system. I find that committees serve both as an intellectual outlet and in an educative role. They also have an important role in educating and informing the public and to some degree in influencing government policy.</para><para>In an age where the parliament is increasingly seen as divorced from the community, the committee system through public inquiries serves as a very valuable bridge for the populace at large to have direct contact with their elected representatives. They can make written submissions to inquiries. They can be called as witnesses to appear face to face with their legislators and put their views without any intermediaries.</para><para>As I said a few moments ago, we put a great deal of effort and a great deal of money into our committee system, yet we never have time to have a meaningful or effective discussion of the reports of the committees when they are presented in the Senate. The opportunities should be provided for the Senate to discuss at length committee reports when it so chooses. At the same time, other issues of community interest not subject to current legislation should be discussed within this chamber and in a non-partisan way. That takes time and the inevitable consequence of that is an extension of our sitting weeks. I see nothing wrong with that because I see my primary role as a senator as being involved in the workings of the Senate.</para><para>While on the subject of committees, we ought to review objectively where we are at. In my judgment we are not performing optimally. We have far too many committees in the Senate. We have to recognise that we cannot have committees for everything. There are only 76 of us in this chamber and, more importantly, the major parties only muster around 30 senators plus or minus three or four, and from those there have to be deleted office bearers, ministers and other personnel. 
 Our human resources are very finite. We cannot continue with our present number of committees.</para><para>Another matter which I would like to see addressed is the bipartisan atmosphere in the committees. The regular or standing committees of the Senate should try to avoid references that are controversial in a partisan political way. That is not always possible but with good chairmanship it can be attained in most cases. Committees should operate objectively and in the national interest. The competition of ideas and, therefore, dissenting views are the very lifeblood of politics and are inseparable from it. Partisan political issues should be the subject of select or ad hoc committees, not the topic of inquiries of standing committees.</para><para>The Australian Senate has a very proud and creative role in the development of its committee system, as instanced by the formation of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee in 1932. The Senate estimates committees have made a significant contribution in making the executive government accountable to the parliament. However, it has now become increasingly difficult to accommodate the time for estimates committees in one major and one minor hearing each year. Is it not time to consider a continuous role for the estimates committees where, in a controlled manner, they monitor the expenditure of departments through the year as and when they see fit? There is no reason why this cannot be done.</para><para>In relation to committees, one final aspect merits consideration and that is the presence of ministers in the Senate. This is not an original idea but a very hoary old chestnut, but it has not been discussed for many years. It is now pertinent to reconsider this issue, now that the Senate has apparently permanently changed as a consequence of the amendments to the Electoral Act in 1983. Those amendments resulted in a situation where no party can gain a majority in the Senate. Like it or not, the consequence of this change is that the review function of the Senate has greatly increased. The argument to be considered is whether the abolition of ministers from the Senate and their replace 
 ment by an enhanced committee system would improve this review function. There is no constitutional requirement that there must be ministers in the Senate.</para><para>I am not suggesting for a moment that if ministers disappeared the Senate would become apolitical and party politics would disappear. The party system would remain and be as strong as at present. But the absence of a ministry could arguably lead to a less adversarial relationship in the chamber and a more productive legislature.</para><para>The Governor-General yesterday outlined a program for the 39th Parliament that is imaginative, creative and, above all, courageous and which will address not only the problems which beset us at present but will position us as a nation to face the challenges of the next century. One of the top priorities of the last parliament was the need to address and rectify the dire economic circumstances that the then new government faced. That has now been corrected and this parliament can now turn its mind to building a stronger Australiaâstrong not only in an economic sense but in a social sense. We can and must devote the required attention to the broader social issues within our community through the 39th Parliament.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>66</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Chee, Sen Bill</name><name role="display">Senator O'CHEE</name><name.id>EU4</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI second the motion. In so doing, it is appropriate to note that already the battle lines have been drawn for the start of this parliamentâbetween the opposition and the crossbenches and the governmentâand the battle lines are over taxation reform. This is an interesting development because there were many in the government party room who in the life of the previous parliament urged that taxation reform should be brought on immediately as a direct consequence of the decision of the High Court to strike down various state indirect taxes.</para></talk.start><para>There was at that time, and there remains, a need to have taxation reform and to repair the indirect tax mechanism. But it was decided in the government party room at the time that it would be inappropriate to do so without first going to an election to put the issue before the people. The reason for that was that it was felt that if the government were to put forward taxation reform before an elec 
 tionâto bring it before the parliament before an electionâthe Senate and the crossbenches of the Senate would argue that the government had no right to so legislate. And that was the decision.</para><para>That is not a great revelation; it is I think probably a matter of record. But having had the election, the government having been returned and the people having had a chance to decide whether to return a government which they knew would make taxation reform and the introduction of a broadly based goods and services tax a central part of its economic policy, we now find the opposition and the crossbenches of the Senate compelling themselves to frustrate, delay and block at all cost. There we see the Opposition Whip smiling at the prospect of delay and obfuscation, but it is a delay and obfuscation not just of the government but of the business of this nation.	This nation decided at the last election to elect a government which would implement taxation reform.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>YH4</name.id><name role="metadata">MacGIBBON</name><name role="display">Senator MacGibbon</name></talker><para>âWe don't want uncertainty.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>EU4</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Chee, Sen Bill</name><name role="display">Senator O'CHEE</name></talker><para>âWe don't want uncertainty, as Senator MacGibbon quite correctly says. This was not a second, third or fourth order priority issue. This was the central issue of the last election. The Labor Party cannot say that they did not campaign against taxation reform. They did campaign against taxation reform, and they lost. They cannot say that the government did not campaign for taxation reformâwe did, and we won. And the Democrats cannot say that they were not warned that we would seek to legislate in this fashion, nor can anybody else who sits on the crossbenches. Yet I was surprised to hear yesterday the proposals from the Leader of the Democrats for reference of matters relating to taxation reform to up to eight different Senate committees.</para></talk.start></continue><para>This can be nothing but a facadeâa sham attempt by the Democrats to reopen an issue which has already been decided at a general election. When you look at the proposalsâthe sorts of the things that the Democrats want these various committees to examineâit is quite laughable. We see the suggestion that the Economics Committee should be required 
 to look into the restoration of a 150 per cent tax concession for research and development and the suggestion that we should have a capital gains tax rate of other than 30 per cent. Then they want the Employment, Education and Training Committee to look at the scope and effectiveness of proposed zero rating arrangements for education in maintaining its quality and affordability. This is a traverse of every irrelevancy that the Democrats could come up with in the time that it has taken to move from the election to now.</para><para>This is an insult to the decision of the people of Australia who chose to have a government which they knew would implement taxation reform. But of course for the Democrats, who went into the election saying that they would probably support taxation reform, this is all an irrelevancyâthe view of the people is an irrelevancy. And the great irony is this: the Democrats have hitherto always campaigned on the basis that they would keep various people honestâone assumed the government. Here is a government that wants to be honest to its election promises. We went to the people saying, `We want to have taxation reform.' We advocated taxation reform, we argued for taxation reform, we won on a platform of taxation reform, and we want to be honest to our promises. And yet here is a crossbench and an oppositionâthe Democrats and Laborâwho want somehow to make us walk away from political honesty. And this government is not for walking away from political honesty. This government is not for abandoning the solemn pledge it made to the voters of Australia at the last election.</para><para>The reason why we made that solemn pledge was we knew that, without taxation reform, the ability of this country to grow, to expand, the ability of Australia's population to enjoy higher wealth and greater prosperity, would be limitedâlimited not by a lack of resources, limited not so much by a lack of national will, but limited by a ramshackle and outdated taxation system. As my friend and colleague Senator MacGibbon said, it takes a very specialised mind to now understand the vagaries and intricacies of our taxation system. That is this nation's shame. It is this 
 nation's shame that our taxation system, the legislation of this parliament, is in fact a brake on the opportunity of ordinary Australians to enjoy a better standard of living.</para><para>It follows from that that those people on the other side of the chamber, those people who inhabit the nether regions of the crossbenches, in opposing taxation reform conversely must support the existing taxation system. Senator Collins shakes her head. They support a continuation of the existing illogical taxation system. They support, for example, a 12 per cent sales tax on various items of foodâfor example, soft drinks or fruit juicesâyet they oppose a 10 per cent goods and services tax on food. How illogical it is to say you oppose a 10 per cent goods and services tax on food but you support a 12 per cent sales tax on certain items of food like fruit juice and biscuits.</para><para>This is the logical limit of the ability of the opposition and the crossbenchers to think this issue through. They have failed to think this issue through. Every day they come into the Senate and they seek to delay the legislative program of the government, every day they do so, by consequence they also vote, yet again, for a continuation of this absurd taxation system. Every day they come in here and seek to frustrate the government's legislative agenda for taxation reform, they continue to vote for higher personal income taxes because the only way in which the personal income tax cuts can be delivered is by delivering a broadly based goods and services tax which will help ensure that the government can stay in surplus.</para><para>These issues may not be of great consequence to members of the Labor Party because, after all, through most of their years in government, the Labor Party never bothered to have a government surplus. They were happy to run this country into debt. From the safety and comfort of the opposition benches, they maintain the pretence, of course, that budget surpluses are not important, but ask the people of Indonesia, ask the people of Korea, ask the people of Thailand, if budget surpluses are important or unimportant.</para><para>One of the reasons why this country's economy is in such good shape, one of the 
 reasons which is quoted by every economist who reviews Australia's economy for why it has not gone down the road of Thailand, Korea or Indonesia, is that this government has got the budget to balance. The only way in which we can maintain a balanced budget and at the same time give the income tax cuts that ordinary Australians so desperately need is if we have indirect taxation reform. But, of course, in opposing indirect taxation reform, the opposition and the crossbenchers also oppose the opportunity for cuts to the income taxes for ordinary Australians. The opposition, therefore, oppose the attempts of this government to give incentive, real incentive, to Australians who need it.</para><para>In opposing the taxation reform package which we have brought before this chamber, the opposition and the crossbenchers also oppose our attempts to give real and meaningful benefits to families, our attempts to give real and meaningful tax breaks to families, because none of this is possible without reform of the indirect taxation system. But all this has been lost on the opposition. All this has been lost on the Democrats. Why? Because, instead of coming to this parliament with a constructive purpose, they have come here to indulge in the politics of negativity, and that is tragic.</para><para>It is tragic that, in the last parliament of this century, the opposition and Democrats should be seized by the politics of negativity, seized by the fascinating attraction of saying no.

They ensure that many ordinary Australians bear a top marginal rate of 48Â½c in the dollar. That is a consequence of the Labor Party's policies. That is a consequence of the policy of negativity. That is a consequence of their delay and obfuscation. That is why they are sitting on the opposition benches.</para><para>This government intends to ensure that the promises it made to the people at the last election are delivered. The opposition forget that this was a platform which was critical to Australia and critical to our election. The people of Australia chose, in a majority of electorates, to deliver a coalition government. The opposition may not like it, but if they respect the will of the voters in those electorates they have to understand that the government has a right, a duty and an obligation to legislate, and that is what we will do. We will legislate to ensure that we deliver to the people of Australia real opportunity and real tax cuts and ensure that the government's good economic record is maintained. Of course good economic credentials have never been a strong point of the Labor Party, and that is why these issues go right over the tops of their heads.</para><para>Maybe if they do not want to consider economic reform, they should consider some of the other elements of the agenda set out in the Governor-General's speech yesterday. One of the elements of the agenda I wish to concentrate on briefly is that of reconciliation. This government has signified its intention to push on with real reconciliation. There are varying views as to how this should be done, but, in my belief, one of the great flaws of Australiaâand I say this in a constructive fashionâis that it has few unifying, cohesive social documents. In part that is because our history has never been one which has been racked by conflict. It always seems that when 
 a country is almost destroyed by conflict and then forced to bring itself back together people create great social compacts. In the United States, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights and the Declaration of Independence are all great unifying social documents. It strikes me that Australia has missed the opportunity to turn certain events in its past into great unifying events for the future.</para><para>What we should do in this parliament, and what the government intends to do during the life of this parliament, is bring about reconciliation. If you have reconciliation, then obviously there has to be an end point in the process. Unless you set an end point in the process, then reconciliation is never achieved. My belief is that what Australia needs is a unifying social document which achieves reconciliation. I am not proposing a treaty, nor am I proposing some sort of legislated Bill of Rights like the Americans have. A Bill of Rights of that fashion imposed into this constitution in the Westminster system would be an abhorrent legislative intrusion into the everyday life of the public.</para><para>A legislative Bill of Rights which gives constitutional rights for people to sue other people or sue governments and so on would be a precursor of a fractious and litigious society rather than a cohesive one. But we have the opportunity in the life of this parliament to draw up a document, be it a charter of common citizenship or some such similar term, which sets out to identify the things which unite us as a nation and the aspirations to which we can all move together. That at the ending of the first century of our history as a nation would be a worthwhile objective for each and every member of the Senate and the House of Representatives.</para><para>It is my fervent hope that, in the two years remaining before the end of this century, certainly before the life of this parliament, we could conclude a common charter of Australian citizenshipâa common charter that sets out what it is to be Australian and sets out what objectives we hope for future generations of Australians. I do not mean in the American context of some sort of means of suing other people and going to court and dividing ourselves further, but rather the sort 
 of document that young Australians a century from now will learn in school, the sort of document which a century from now young Australians will be proud to know and recite, the sort of document which will carry us into a new century with the same spirit of optimism and opportunity with which we began this one.</para><para> A lot of things have happened in a century, many of them very great. Very shortly we will remember some of the more terrible aspects of this century. But I defy anybody to say that Australia is not a great country. I defy anybody to say that this is not still a land of opportunity. In dealing with the issues with which this parliament will have to grappleâfor example, the issue of constitutional changeâ(and, like Senator MacGibbon, I wholeheartedly hope that we will maintain our existing, effective and functional system) this parliament and this nation must be optimistic. I believe that, in responding to the Governor-General's speech, each of us should look to how we can improve Australiaânot how we can be negative but how we can be positive. I believe the parliament, in going about the business of reconciliation, should look to create a great social charter of all Australians which will survive not just this parliament and not just this century but centuries to come.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>70</page.no><name role="metadata">Collins, Sen Jacinta</name><name role="display">Senator JACINTA COLLINS</name><name.id>GB6</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âYesterday we heard the government's articulation of its framework for the next term of office. I would like to thank Senator MacGibbon and Senator O'Chee for their contributions in speaking to the motion that the address-in-reply be agreed to. I would also like to thank the Governor-General for his speech and note that the one pleasant element was the lack of the coalition's usual senseless attacks on the Senate, although I note that Senator O'Chee has not restrained himself in that respect. The Senate is, of course, the house of review.</para></talk.start><para>Before I refer to the issue of the GST, let me say one thing about Senator O'Chee: he was the last person who I thought would deliver a lesson on logic to me. There is nothing inconsistent with the Labor Party's position of support for tax reform and its 
 opposition of a regressive GST. I will get to those points later.</para><para>Firstly, I think it is useful to reflect on the Governor-General's address by looking at the framework that was presented by the government for its first term of office and by assessing whether the rhetoric was matched by reality. In April 1996 the government spoke of its desire to improve productivity and to deliver higher growth and living standards to the Australian peopleâa laudable objective. But what the government delivered was a crushing blow to the Australian economy, which resulted in a one per cent reduction in the growth of an economy that the Prime Minister had described as `better than good in parts'.</para><para>The government hacked $27 billion from government services in the 1996 budget and $14 billion in the 1997 budget. Some examples of the targeted service cuts are: $500 million was removed from aged care funding and $800 million was removed from public hospitals. Those and other punitive cuts affected services that battling families relied upon in their day-to-day livesâservices such as child care, schools, bulkbilling, dental services, Austudy and the purchase of medicines.</para><para>The Public Service was clearly not a concern of this government, and the rhetoric continued in the Governor-General's address yesterday. It has been estimated that the Howard government's cuts to the public sector have seen a reduction of close to 90,000 Commonwealth employees over its first term of office. This figure does not take into account the impact of the latest round of Centrelink job cuts.</para><para>As a consequence of this assault by the government on living standards and working standards, many Australians now do not feel secure, relaxed or comfortable in their jobs. Australians have seen that this government has been not only a tremendous job killer but also an ineffective job creator. The Howard government has effectively halved the rate of growth in jobs in its term in office. Six hundred and fifty thousand jobs were created in Labor's last 30 months of government 
 compared with 300,000 for the same period under the Howard government.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="metadata">KEMP</name><name role="display">Senator Kemp</name></talker><para>âHow about in the last 60 months?

Senator Kemp knows a lot about cooperation! The government embarked on a program to take industrial relations back to the 1890s. The government promoted award stripping, paring back wages and working conditions and putting individuals on secret contracts, and then it actively and sordidly colluded with employers who wished to push for industrial relations confrontation, not cooperation.</para></talk.start></continue><para>This was a government which sought to remove protections for those who in many cases struggle to defend themselves. It removed the concept of an independent umpireâsomething that I note Senator MacGibbon was referring to earlier. In the industrial relations field, the government removed this concept which had effectively functioned in Australia for nearly a century. The symbol we now have of industrial relations in this country is a large man in a balaclava holding a vicious dog on a leash. Let us not forget that.</para><para>Again, in the 1996 address, the Governor-General spoke of the government's desire to overcome our current account deficitâagain emphasising that Labor acknowledges the importance of the economy. Our foreign debt has increased by over $30 billion whilst the community waits for the government to implement a decent industry policy. In fact our manufacturing industry has effectively sat in recession  whilst the Howard government sat on its commissioned industry reports. I was disappointed to note that industry policy was barely mentioned in the Governor-General's speech yesterday. It rated only two full lines.</para><para>On the last occasion, the Governor-General spoke of the government's employment programs, which would be more effectively linked with the mainstream training system. He also spoke of apprenticeships and other 
 work based training opportunities for young people, which would be strengthened. But what did the government do? It slashed funding for employment programs. It gutted the CES. It presided over the Job Network scheme, which is clearly failing, and it created a body, Centrelink, as the referral agent to the Job Network, which is about to be butchered and privatised.</para><para>Over the past days we have read of the government's commitment to unemployment, but it will axe 5,300 Centrelink staff in a move that will cripple its capacity to deliver services for the unemployed, the elderly and low income earners. There is something Orwellian about a government which cuts jobs to a service that is so overloaded already that many clients' calls are not answered and then claims that it will deliver more services with fewer staff. Senator O'Chee, perhaps that is a lesson in logic.</para><para>Whilst the government congratulated itself on its brave initiatives, hundreds of thousands of job seekers the CES formerly helped were no longer eligible for assistance. Also, in most states and territories many job seekers have to pay to get a job. I know of no greater disincentive to job growth than that. As well as that, many small business operators are being slugged hefty fees for services that the CES formerly provided for free. Again, where is the logic, because that is not an incentive to employment either? Whilst the government fiddled, 50,000 additional Australians joined the ranks of the long-term unemployed and 194,000 Australians simply gave up looking for work.</para><para>The Governor-General's speech yesterday made mention of the government's desire to pursue a better system of delivering job services for all Australians, and it praised the Job Network as an important and successful initiative. If there is one credibility test of this address and of this framework, it has to be that claim. It is simply laughable.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>9L6</name.id><name role="metadata">MACKAY</name><name role="display">Senator Mackay</name></talker><para>âAbsolutely.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>GB6</name.id><name role="metadata">Collins, Sen Jacinta</name><name role="display">Senator JACINTA COLLINS</name></talker><para>âIt is absolutely laughable. On top of that, it actually makes a mockery of the unemployed, who are being abused within this current system. I could refer to the health issue, but I will be 
 limited in time, so I will move on to the particular mention that was made in the 1996 address to the government's desire to facilitate a cohesive society. We have talked about industrial relations and what has happened there. Let me also address the promise that the government made to govern in the national interest and not for vested interests.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Over the term of this government we observed, with increasing concern, the rise of One Nation and the Prime Minister's seeming inability or unwillingness to confront the Hanson phenomenon. The effect of the Prime Minister's apathy was profound. Many Australians from a multicultural background were seriously affected by the change in attitudes of tolerance and respect for difference which had previously characterised the Australian community. But it was not only these individuals who were affected; it was the community as a whole; it was the business community; it was our international standing. Anyone who visited Asia during that period knows that the reputation of Australiaâwhether it be a republic or otherwiseâsuffered seriously through the Prime Minister's lack of action in this area.</para><para>In the industrial relations area the government's active discrimination against employees and their interests looks set to continue under the current framework. Meanwhile, the coalition boast that their tax package has $10 billion worth of tax breaks for business. A tax cut for Australian business will mean a tax hike for Australian families, and that is what the GST about is about.</para><para>Finally in the 1996 address, the government mourned the increasing numbers in the community who had lost respect for the parliament and its members, and it undertook to improve the standing of the national parliament. We all know that that has not occurred. As we know, Mr Howard's document <inline font-style="italic">A Guide on Key Elements of Ministerial Responsibility</inline> was tabled in April 1996, but it has been consistently ignored, forgotten or watered down. The Howard government has lost eight frontbenchers in less than three years and would have lost another five under reasonable interpretations and consistent application of these guidelines.</para><para>The Prime Minister's vacillation on this issue has registered deeply within the communityâso much so that the editorial in yesterday's issue of the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> commented:</para><para>Standards of conduct especially by ministers were amongst the greatest disappointments of the first term of the Howard Government.</para><para>Let me conclude my comments on the Governor-General's address back in 1996. Upon reflection of the government's lofty words, we now know that the Australian people were cruelly deceived by a prime minister and a government whose actions during its last term in government were the antithesis of its articulated aims. The problem was that they were worse than the aims articulated, and God help us if that is the case now. We also know that we had core and non-core promises. Will that trend continue? That would be my question to Senator O'Chee.</para><para>We can theorise why the government concentrated on a GSTâthat is, the tax that we would never, ever haveâin the election. If the GST had not dominated the election campaign, perhaps the Australian public may have been able to focus on the debacle of the government's nursing homes policy, or on its destruction in the area of education policy, or on the absence of a cohesive industry policy, or on the sacked ministers and the collective amnesia surrounding the much vaunted ministerial code of conduct.</para><para>The Australian people know that this government cannot be trusted on the GST. That is why nearly 52 per cent of people voted against them in the lower house and, more importantly, 60 per cent in the Senate. The government have no capacity to claim a mandate on the GST. Headlines in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> such as `Why Upper House annihilation means a mandate no more' are indicative of the spuriousness of that claim.</para><para>This government has been revealed for what it is. People will not be fooled by the empty rhetoric of its grand frameworks and new grand adventures. Mr Howard promised a grand adventure in the tax reform process. He promised a system of tax reform by reintroducing a tax that had been rejected by the 
 people twice before. He released details of this complex package just two weeks before the election campaign. He refused to allow parliamentary scrutiny of the GST prior to the election. He applied the snake oil of $17 million of taxpayer funded propaganda, and he now wants to force the package through the Senate before 30 June next year. He established a committee that has only 17 days to make crucial decisions as to how vital services, medicines and charities will be taxed. He steadfastly refused to release the Treasury analysis of the real impact of the GST on household expenditure and particularly on the poor.</para><para>This parliament has now finally been given the opportunity to scrutinise the government's tax plans, some 18 months after the announcement of the great tax adventure. Just after the election Mr Howard indicated that he wished to be different this time around. I think that being different now probably just means being a bit more obvious. I would like to quote from a recent article in the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> by Laurie Oakes in which he says where he thinks the government is currently coming from. He says:</para><para>In fact, Howard thinks that, in some respects at least, he was too soft in his first two-and-a-half years.</para><para>Tell that one to the waterfront workers, to the Centrelink staff and representatives and to the members of our indigenous community. Oakes continues:</para><para>Hence the abandonment of any real pretence at consultation over GST exemptions in the areas of health, education, religious activities and charitable servicesâeven though such consultation was promised before the election.</para><para>That must not have been a core promise, Senator O'Chee. Oakes continues:</para><para>Hence also the backflip over accepting the vote of Independent Senator Mal Colstonâregarded before the election as tainted.</para><para>Perhaps that was another non-core promise.</para><para>The point the government needs to understand is that we do not need it to break its promise; we need the Senate to have a full, comprehensive inquiry into the GST. Then, if the force of logic applies, the GST will not be 
 deliveredâregardless of how those opposite vote.</para><para>Mr Howard's more recent comments about business philanthropy to charities bear all the hallmarks of a return to the 19th century and the Ebenezer Scrooge approach to the community. Mr Howard seems to be moving back to the notions or concepts of `the needy', `charity' and `the deserving poor'âGod help us.</para><para>Mr Howard should concentrate on making high wealth individuals and large businesses pay their fair share of tax, not contributions to charity. Contributions to charity in themselves are good. But we need to ensure that high wealth individuals and large businesses are making their contribution to the public purse rather than to charity; that is the role of government. The GST is not going to make these people pay their fair share in taxâand a scrutiny of the proposals will prove that.</para><para>The public is also rightfully cynical about Mr Howard's $6.6 billion annual tax cut to the richest 20 per cent of Australians in his proposed GST packageâand that will not bear public scrutiny. The questions that can be asked under an inquiry are: what would the money do in terms of public hospitals, schools, child care and nursing homes; what could the money do in those areas?</para><para>It is now becoming apparent to the community that the government is actively discriminating against those on low incomes. Mr Reith, one of the pretenders to Mr Howard's crown, has blithely drawn the comparison between the number of people living in poverty or under the poverty line in Australia and those living under similar circumstances in the United States. But the Prime Minister rightly notes that he would not like to be an ordinary worker in the United States who becomes ill. Do we want to repeat this trend? Mr Howard and Mr Reith should both note the recently produced ACOSS report which talks about the growing number of poor or people in poverty in Australia because of this government's agenda.</para><para>I could talk further about the GST, particularly about its implications for employmentâwhich are vastâand its implications for Commonwealth-state financial arrangements. 
 But I am short on time, so I will conclude by stating that Labor's position has always been clear with respect to the GST. We oppose it, period. It is regressive. But we support an inquiry into the GST because we believe that a genuine inquiry will ensure that all senators are fully informed of the full implications of supporting any form of GST. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>74</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âOn election night the Prime Minister said thisâand I quote him:</para></talk.start><para>I say to all of my fellow Australians that the government that you have elected tonight will lead this country into the 21st century. The government you have elected tonight will be a government for all Australians. The government you have elected tonight will dedicate itself to the welfare of all the Australian people.</para><para>This government never has governed and never will govern for all Australians. In the last two and a half years John Howard has done more to erode the welfare of the Australian people than anyone thought imaginable. For example, the government's most recent decision to slash 5,000 jobs from Centrelink comes just weeks after Mr Howard's statement about dedicating himself to the welfare of all the Australian people. We probably will be stuck with this government into the next century, but I can say this: John Howard definitely will not lead us there.</para><para>Commencing the 39th parliament, we return to a government presiding over an unemployment rate stuck above eight per cent. John Howard cannot and will not say whether that rate will come down. Mr Howard's government is back, but public hospitals are still underfundedâand we now have no prospect of that situation improving. The government might have ditched Warwick Smith, but older Australians are still stuck with upfront fees of over $4,000 to get into a nursing home and extra daily fees on top of that. Spending on education will continue to slide for our schools, our TAFE colleges and our universities. As Kim Beazley said during the election campaign, the very best Australians can hope for from this government is that it will be the same for the next three years as it has been for the last two and a halfâand what an indictment! </para><para>When Mr Howard announced his front bench, he said that his front bench team representedâand I quote himâ`a significant renewal of the government as we take on the challenges of a new term and a new century'. But John Howard lacked the ticker to make the necessary changes to reinvigorate his ministry and to choose a front bench that was truly up to the challenges of a new term and a new century. He has either kept or promoted his failures of the previous government. Of course, his so-called new front bench is set to be just as incompetent and muddling as the one we saw during the life of the first Howard government.</para><para>One of the biggest backward steps, in my view, was the appointment of that dinosaur, Mr Wilson Tuckey, to the ministry. I was pleased to see that Mitchell Grattan commented upon this in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline>. This is what she said:</para><para>And Wilson Tuckey. The PM's camp will tell that you Tuckey, that old Peacock man who intrigued against Howard, is Minister for Forestry and Conservation because he is a good political performer in WA. I prefer to think it's because of John Howard's sense of humour.</para><para>We all do. Perhaps that same sense of humour was behind the reappointment of Senator Herron as Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. The only defence of Senator Herron's appointment we have seen in the public arena, besides, of course, by the Prime Minister himself, who always seems to come to Senator Herron's defence, has come from the Prime Minister's own biographer, David Barnett, who called upon the Prime Minister, in a recent article he wrote for the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> , to leave Senator Herron where he was. Even Mr Barnett's best defence of Senator Herron was pretty weak. It was a pretty weak endorsement. All he could say was `Herron's task has not been easy, but he's trying.'</para><para>I am not sure how much easier Senator Herron's task can get. Every major challenge in Senator Herron's portfolio is given to someone else to manage. We had stolen children given to Mr Howard. We had native title given to Senator Minchin. We now have reconciliation with Mr Ruddock. Senator Herron brings nothing but incompetence and 
 paternalism to this important portfolio. Without responsibility for the fundamental issues of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs and without a department, what has Senator Herron done? He has set about basically dismantling the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. At least Senator Parer fell on his sword. Senator Herron really should have had the guts and the honour to do the same.</para><para>In my view, even taking into account some of these characters, such as Mr Tuckey and Senator Herron, there is no greater disappointment on John Howard's renewed front bench than the prematurely resurrected Minister for the Arts and the Centenary of Federation, Mr Peter McGauran. Mr McGauran's reappointment to the ministry has destroyed any hope that there may eventually be some substanceâjust a skerrickâto Mr Howard's professed commitments to higher ministerial and parliamentary standards and to higher ministerial accountability. We all know about Mr McGauran's history. But Peter McGauran is not the only dark cloud over Mr Howard's second term of government, and he is certainly not the biggest dark cloud. There is a much bigger storm looming with the goods and services tax, as we know.</para><para>It is fair to say that John Howard's campaign for his GST has been underhanded and deceptive right from the beginning. Do not forget that Mr Howard was first elected in 1996 on a platform that included the promise that he would never ever introduce a GST. It did not take him long to dump that commitment. In fact, I do not think anyone believesâI certainly do notâthat the GST was ever off John Howard's agenda. But his announcement of the details of his GST plan was preceded by a hefty endorsement from the Business Council of Australia, which kindly ran a promotion campaign for him to pave the way for his GST launch. We look forward to seeing the details of the contribution to that campaign in returns to the Australian Electoral Commission.</para><para>But he finally launched the details of his GST plan weeks before the election. He refused to release the critical Treasury figures that would demonstrate the impact of the GST 
 on ordinary Australians. Of course now that the election is behind him, he is apparently prepared to release a limited amount of that material. At the same time, he launched a $17.8 million advertising campaign to promote his election policy, which was not an operating program of government, sponsored by the Commonwealth government and paid for by Commonwealth taxpayers.</para><para>As the Prime Minister said at the 1 November state convention of the Queensland Liberals, this effectively gave him a seven-week election campaign. The biggest chunk of advertising dollars that was spent by the Liberal Party in what Mr Howard described as his seven-week election campaign was paid for by the Commonwealth taxpayer, not the Liberal Party. It was paid for by ordinary Australians. The Liberals have been skiting about it since the election. All through the election campaign, John Howard and Peter Costello maintained that there would be a proper examination of the parameters of the GST or, in their words, `the finetuning'.</para><para>With the election now over, not only do they want to deny the Senate the right to investigate the GST but they have given their own committee, the Vos committee, a completely unrealistic and ludicrous set of terms of reference and reporting timetable. It is a 17-day reporting time frame, which of course has been widely condemned by business and by community and interest groups. Even the committee chairman, Mr Vos, admitted that two weeks was inadequate and that he would have liked to have had, in his words, `a couple of months'.</para><para>Mr Howard and Mr Costello have got the nerve to argue that the Labor opposition have no right to push for an inquiry if we intend to oppose the GST regardless, conveniently forgetting their own arguments in opposition. Let me remind the Senate of Mr Costello's proposal in November 1994 for Labor's employee share ownership legislation. This is what he said:</para><para>We are going to vote against the Government's proposal to extend fringe benefits tax to employee ownership schemes. We will defeat it in the Senate and we will initiate a Senate inquiry to have a look at the whole matter and make sure bona fide legitimate employee ownership schemes are not 
 rubbed out in the way that Mr Keating wants to do with his fringe benefits tax.</para><para>So, instead of coming clean, signing on to an adequate Senate inquiry into the implications of a GST, to reassure Australians that what he proposes is what he claims it to beâa painless conversion to a consumption taxâMr Howard and his accomplice in this, Mr Costello, have fought tooth and nail to avoid scrutiny. They have fought tooth and nail against an effective and meaningful parliamentary inquiry, parliamentary scrutiny and public scrutiny, as they always do, because we know and they know that a GST is a job destroying tax that will hurt ordinary Australians.</para><para>John Howard and Peter Costello want to have their GST rammed through the parliament with minimum scrutiny before the new Senate takes its place in July next year. John Howard of course claims to have an electoral mandate to push ahead with his GST legislation unhindered. But remember the fact that 51 per cent of Australians voted in the House of Representatives for parties with an anti-GST platform and 60 per cent of Australians voted for a Senate that would oppose a GST.</para><para>What about Mr Costello? The Treasurer is in today's <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> putting forward a ludicrous proposition that Labor senators who were elected in 1993 should vote for the GST because that was Paul Keating's promise at the time. I am a bit surprised, frankly, that the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> would publish this sort of tripe. This really is an illogical and ill-considered position of Mr Costello's. Whether his analysis is just a particularly shallow one or in fact is just a direct challenge to Mr Howard's leadership, time will tellâthat is not clear to usâbut what the article does reveal is how bankrupt the government's GST mandate argument actually is.</para><para>If you take Mr Costello's position, his argument, his analysis of mandate to its logical extreme, then the Liberal senators elected in 1993 and still waiting for their new terms in mid-1999â17 of themâshould vote for a GST exempting food. That is Mr Costello's argument. After all, that was Dr Hewson's final version of Fightback that he took to the people in 1993.</para><para>And the Liberal senators elected in 1996 are all `never, ever' senatorsâthose who should enforce the 1995 John Howard pledge and promise that a GST should never, ever be implemented in Australia. In fact, the 18 Liberal senators who were elected on Mr Howard's `never, ever' promiseâthat famous Tweed Heads declaration of May 1995âinclude Senator Hill, Senator Herron, Senator Kemp, who is over there, Senator Alston, Senator Newman, and of course the scrupulously honest Senator Watson who was muzzled by the leadership of the Liberal Party just last Monday. But, according to Mr Costello's logic, every Liberal and National Party senator, every Labor senator, and every Democrat and Green senator who was elected in 1996 was elected on a platform which was specifically opposed to a GST.</para><para>The truth isâand that dopey article from Mr Costello is really going to highlight thisâthat until July next year, only two senators in this whole chamber out of 76 senators can claim a personal mandate to support the government's current GST proposalâSenator Reid, the President of the Senate and ACT senator; and Senator Tambling from the Northern Territory. They are the only two who can claim a personal mandate to support the current GST proposal. But I think that Mr Costello's outburst was more likely an attempt to really get in thereâjust like he always likes to doâand humiliate Mr Howard as much as he can, to remind people of Mr Howard's commitment of May 1995âthe Tweed Heads declaration; the `never, ever' declaration. It is just another subterranean attack by Mr Costello on Mr Howard.</para><para>You read in the media about Mr Costello. One of Mr Costello's close friends was recently quoted in the media as saying about Mr Costelloâit sort of rang true to meâthat `Every cell in Mr Costello's body is carnivorous.' This is just another example. Mr Costello knows that by putting forward that ludicrous proposition, that false analysis, that spurious nonsense in the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> people will point out Mr Howard's duplicity and what this really means in terms of personal mandates and party mandates of senators in this chamber.</para><para>I suppose Mr Howard is getting used to humiliation. Take, for example, his most recent humiliating backflip, his grovelling for the tainted vote of someone who was elected as a Labor senator and whose vote should be unambiguously anti-GST. In April last year, Mr Howard was forced to finally cut Senator Colston loose. It is worth remembering what he said:</para><para>Now what we have done has been measured, responsible, correct. What I am announcing this morning is a very, very clear message to the people of Australia: that until this matter is cleared up, we are not going to accept Senator Colston's vote.</para><para>John Howard said he would not accept the tainted vote of Senator Colston until the charges that Senator Colston was facing were resolved. Those charges have not been resolved. Nothing has changed since April last year except John Howard's desperate need for Senator Colston's vote in this chamber in order to deliver a policy that most Australians would prefer Mr Howard and the government to shelve.</para><para>It was an unprincipled and opportunistic move, a move which he deliberately concealed from Australians both before and during the last election campaign. The electorate was not put in the loop by Mr Howard on this matter. Not only has the Prime Minister said he will accept Senator Colston's vote but we know that he has actively solicited it.</para><para>The Prime Minister said previously it was a matter of standards. John Howard's standards speak for themselves. He has revived the disgraced Peter McGauran and he has embraced the tainted vote of Senator Colston. I think this next parliament will be more of the shabby, shameful, sleazy operation from John Howard. That is what augurs in the 39th Parliament and Labor will continue to expose his deceit.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>77</page.no><name role="metadata">Reynolds, Sen Margaret</name><name role="display">Senator REYNOLDS</name><name.id>XI4</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIn speaking in the address-in-reply debate I want to remind honourable senators that the opening of a parliament is a very splendid occasion.

There is a great deal of pomp and there is a great deal of

Regardless of our differences of views in that campaign, we have all worked very hard and we set aside the differences to come into this place for the opening.</para></talk.start><para>The speech prepared by the government did not match the splendour of the occasion. Where was the vision for the next century? Where was the commitment to better job opportunities for all Australians? Where was the grand plan for improved living standards? Where was the outline for upgraded community services? Where was the newly invigorated, different John Howard? Where was the fresh style of government to capture the imagination of the nation? Sadly for Australia there were none of these ideas woven into the Governor-General's speech prepared by this new government. It was merely a catalogue of cliches, a repetitious listing of tired old policies which have failed in the past and will fail in the future.</para><para>A number of editorials indicated that yesterday was the day for the Prime Minister to outline his vision. In fact, an editorial in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> on 10 November, entitled `A fresh start for John Howard', claimed:</para><para>The Government must map out a broader vision for Australia in this parliamentary session.</para><para>Was it a fresh start? Was there a broader vision? No, it was not a broader vision. The 40-minute speech was dominated by economic and tax issues. Of course those issues are vital to the future of this nation. But where were the ideas? Where was the creativity? Mr Howard's strategy is to encourage private enterprise and individual effort to limit the role of government and to further remove regulation and obstacles to growth and industry development.</para><para>I could not help noticing during the Governor-General's speech that many on the other side, like those of us on this side, looked disappointed. I suppose you looked more disappointed than we did because we did not have high expectations of a newly invigorated Prime Minister. We were expecting more of the same, but I think some of you did not expect more of the same. You believed your leader when he said after his narrow victory 
 that things would be different, that it would be a more compassionate government. Quite clearly from the expressions on your faces you were disappointed. Having very few expectations, we also could not believe that there was such a lack of vision in what was outlined in the Governor-General's speech.</para><para>I want to take this opportunity to remind the chamber and the community that the coalition government holds 23 seats with a margin of less than three per centâ10 of them are held by less than one per cent.

I want to speak about job opportunities, particularly job opportunities in the public sector. I want to focus on the massive cutbacks in public sector jobs in this country over the last 2Â½ years. I want to speak on the goods and services tax. I want to speak on Telstra and its community service provision. I want to 
 speak on health, particularly women's reproductive rights and their health services. I want to speak on the environment, and I want to speak on reconciliation.</para></talk.start><para>Many of us would have assumed that the massive cutbacks in public sector jobs over the last 2Â½ years would have seen the end of the government's slash and burn approach to the public sector. But, no, just this week, on top of the 90,000 Public Service jobs that have already disappeared, 5,000 more jobs at Centrelink are to go. This is going to mean more hardship for those seeking information and entitlements through Centrelink and more hardship for those who are being retrenched.</para><para>Today's announcement of 5,000 jobs lost at Centrelink will mean less service, fewer jobs and more hardship. The government has said that between July 1997 and 2002 at least 5,000 jobs will be cut. That is about 20 per cent of Centrelink's total staff. Twenty-one hundred jobs have already been cut this year, with the total for the financial year expected to be 2,700. The government's estimates for the next three to four years is for 2,300 further jobs to be cut.</para><para>Notwithstanding the commitment given in the Governor-General's speech yesterday, I ask: how many regional offices will be affected? How will people who have been trying to get through the telephone services get through? At the height of the youth allowance debacle, of the million calls attempted on a single day, only 90,000 got through; 900,000 got an engaged signal. What is going to happen with this further reduction in staff? Looking at Queensland, I note that in 1998-99 there will be a reduction of 40 jobs from North Queensland and 80 jobs from Brisbane. The total reduction required in the next two years will be 105 jobs from North Queensland and 180 jobs from Brisbane. That is in addition to the previous numbers that I quoted.</para><para>I can only agree with the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> editorial of today entitled `Centrelink plan is hard to justify'. The editorial states:</para><para>The news that up to 5000 jobs (800 of them in the ACT) will be cut from the Commonwealth service delivery agency Centrelink over the next three years should concern every one of the six million 
 Australians who are in receipt of some kind of government assistance.</para><para>I would add `entitlement'. It continues:</para><para>How ironic that the announcement of the planned cuts should come in the same week as the Commonwealth Ombudsman tabled his annual report, in which he listed Centrelink as far and away the most complained-about government agency in the country.</para><para>The second issue I would like to raise is that of the concern that we on this side of the chamber have about the impact of the goods and services tax as proposed in the Governor-General's speech and which was the focus of the recent election campaign. The St Vincent de Paul Society agrees with the concerns that have been addressed by so many on this side of the house. A press release by Mr John Mooreânot the government's John Moore but the National President of the St Vincent de Paul Societyâstates:</para><para>"Where is the compassion and concern for the welfare of low income earners in this country?" . . . "Not only has the promised six month consultation period on the impact of a GST been replaced by a 17 day examination of existing papers but the committee has a limited agenda".</para><para>The Society of St Vincent de Paul does not oppose a GST or a value added tax system because that decision is properly one for elected politicians. "But it is simply unjust and un-Australian if a new regime is introduced which leads to a deterioration in the well being of the 30% of Australians who are on low incomes".</para><para>I seek leave to table the letter that was written to all parliamentarians by St Vincent de Paul which details their concerns for the people they provide assistance to: 35 per cent of whom are single parent families; 20 per cent of whom are families with children; 40 per cent of whom are unemployed, including migrants, refugees, people with disabilities, young and old; and five per cent of whom are age pensioners. I understand from a discussion with the whips that this has been approved.</para><para>Leave granted.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>XI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Reynolds, Sen Margaret</name><name role="display">Senator REYNOLDS</name></talker><para>âThe third area of concern I want to raise in this speech today is the community service provision that has been guaranteed by Senator Alston in relation to the further sale of Telstra. Just last week we had a classic example of how neither the 
 Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts nor this governmentâno-one in this placeâcan guarantee community service provision by Telstra. Telstra has gone ahead to cut back the number of service centres which provide 000 services. The 000 service is the most important service that Telstra provides.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Instead of having a service centre based in all capital cities, we will have just twoâone in Sydney and one in Melbourneâand, surprise, surprise, a backup service in Hobart, which I am sure Tasmanians will welcome. But I am not convinced that the people of north Queensland, the people of Darwin, the people of Broome, the people of Western Australia and the people of Alice Springs will be particularly impressed with the fact that, for whatever reasons, Telstra has decided to give a backup service to Hobart but is not prepared to give backup services in northern and other more remote areas of Australia.</para><para> I asked a Telstra employee why this was the case and I was told, `Hobart is more vulnerable; Tasmania is more vulnerable.' `Vulnerable from what?' I asked. `Vulnerable geographically because it is an island.' Hobart is closer to Melbourne than north Queensland and Hobart is closer to Melbourne than Western Australia, yet the backup service is being provided in Hobart and not in other centres.</para><para> I have a special concern because of the approaching cyclone season in north Queensland. I have asked a number of questions of Telstra about the cost of the existing service and the cost of the new service. What are the savings? How many people will be employed in the new service and how many in the old? What will be the staffing cutbacks? Will Telstra guarantee appropriate numbers of staff to ensure there is no occasion when there are services that are not adequately staffed? Has Telstra calculated the numbers of staff required for an average time and during a national disasterâagain, with my special focus on what will happen to 000 services at the time of a cycloneâand how was this differential calculated? What special provisions will be made to accommodate 000 calls from north Queensland during the cyclone 
 season? Why does Hobart need a backup facility? Will Telstra be conducting education awareness campaigns throughout regional Australia? How will Telstra staff be able to recognise the extent of geographic locations throughout Australia?</para><para> I am sure that Telstra staff are extremely competent and that they have a certain amount of training but to recognise in an emergency situation the immediate location of any centre anywhere in Australia is a very tall order indeed. I would like to have some answers on those questions from Telstra.</para><para>The fourth area that I wanted to speak on today is health because the government does refer to health services in the Governor-General's speech but it does not refer to health services in relation to women's particular needs. In the election campaign we had an excellent example of how this government is not prepared to identify the special needs of women. We had the approval, proudly announced, of the drug Viagra. I am not going to argue about whether or not Viagra should have been approved. It seemed a perfectly natural thing that that particular drug would be approved for men.</para><para> Let me detail the reproductive drugs that are still awaiting approval through the Therapeutic Goods Administration of the Department of Health and Aged Care. There has not been speedy passage of these reproductive health drugs for which Australian women have particular need. They include new fourth generation contraceptive pills; the vaginal ring laced with progesterone which acts like a diaphragm; the Norplant implant, which is effective for three to five years; injectable contraceptives, other than Depo-Provera; new, safer IUDs; the contraceptive sponge and female condoms; the purpose packed emergency kits of the morning-after pill; and RU486. As we know from previous debates in this chamber, we had to have special legislation and special approval by the minister for RU486. There is a double standard in relation to how this government is considering reproductive sexual health for men and women. Viagra has been approved for menâand that is fineâbut all these drugs are still waiting for approval by the Therapeu 
 tic Goods Administration. These drugs do not have the ministerial fast-tracking process because they are only reproductive drugs for womenâthat must be the government's view.</para><para>The next issue that I wanted to raise is my concern about how this government is treating the environment. Yesterday we heard that the government gives a high priority to the environment. Why is it then that on Monday top marine scientists called on world heritage authorities to send a field mission to the Great Barrier Reef to help avert the `slow death' of a priceless ecosystem? Their confidential letter to the World Heritage Bureau in Paris is highly critical of the Commonwealth and Queensland governments and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and is asking for urgent action.</para><para>Finally, I want to speak very briefly on reconciliation. I would like to put on the public record that David Buckingham, Executive Director of the Business Council of Australia, has a much more appropriate and progressive view to reconciliation than does this government. In a recent speech he gave on 25 October at a meeting of community leaders, he said it was vital to understand what reconciliation was about, that it was not just a matter of granting Aborigines full citizenship rights such as adequate health services. That is taken for granted because as citizens they are entitled to those services. Ultimately, he said that reconciliation was about indigenous rights, issues of indigenous law and custom, that reconciliation involved a willingness to seek understanding of what obligations might be associated with such law and customs and might eventually lead to having to consider the possibilities of sovereignty and, in the final analysis, indigenous self-government. He said that for some the real issue will be whether there is scope for a nation within a nation.</para><para>As I have said on a number of other occasions, I urge this government to send Senator Herron and a team of representatives of indigenous Australians to Canada where sovereignty, indigenous rights, indigenous law and custom and the question of nationhood of the first peoples are taken for granted; they are incorporated into Canadian law and 
 practice. That is the basis of what true reconciliation should be about into the new century.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>81</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI begin by adding a word of special thanksâthe words are too short of the markâand ongoing remembrance, not only to those Australians who in their tens of thousands have given their lives for this country but also to the many more who have had their lives damaged, ruined and saddened by the ravages of the horrendous wars of this century. It is remarkable enough that out of that we have in this lucky country of ours one of the freest, and still the most egalitarian and beautiful places to live anywhere on the face of the planet.</para></talk.start><para>In February of this year I was on the Thalys high speed train rocketing through the lowlands of Belgium and France between Brussels and Paris. The trip now takes 1Â½ hours, at an average 300 kilometres an hour. I could not but help think of how rapidly horrendous events can disappear into history. My mind was riveted by the horrendous circumstances of so many hundreds of thousands of Australians, and the equally wonderful and beautiful people from both sides of the great wars in that vicinity undergoing horrendous circumstances in which no human being should ever be put in the struggle for power and supremacy over others which has so degraded human history and which will continue to do so until we come to a recognition that we are one species, that we are one humanity.</para><para>As we move towards a population of six billion next year, at the end of this century, which at its start saw one and a half billion people on the face of the planet, it is even more compelling for us to come together as one humanity, united in service in our need to protect this planet as a place for all life and, in particular, our need to take into account all coming generations of people in everything we do.</para><para>One way we Greens differ from all other political parties is in putting forward that imperative in all we do. In every question we consider, in every answer we seek, in every policy we devise, in every approach we take to policy, in this place or elsewhere, this question should first be asked: will people 
 100 years from now thank us for doing this? If we cannot answer that question in the affirmative, if we cannot say yes to it, or if we do not know the answer, then we should not be proceeding. That is commonsense which every Australian, I am sure, would agree with. Yet it is a rejected point of view as far as the rapid process of politics in general is concerned, not just in this country but around the world. The imperative is much more the short term, the immediate, the instant need, and particularly the view that the next elections can be no more than three or four years away and that is what must mark the way we behave. But it is a short-sighted and ultimately self-defeating way to behave. We must elevate our view of what we do to include the disenfranchised future generations who are the big losers from the modern materialist way the world is being driven.</para><para>In responding to the Prime Minister's words, as delivered in the Governor-General's speech yesterday, I will read from the current edition of the New Internationalist, from a keynote article by David Ransom, which sums up the point of view that we Greens take in applying ourselves not only to the problems but also to the opportunities of this great country of ours. Mr Ransom, having talked about the destruction of the Amazon rainforest and the apparent helplessness of the indigenous people of the Amazon as the big corporations move in to make a quick profit, amongst other things through building dams to provide electricity for aluminium factories to produce coke cans for people who will never get to the Amazon and so who do not know the damage that that process creates in the lives of those people in their forests, goes on to say:</para><para>Without any doubt, the two overarching political issues of our time are human inequality and environmental destruction, the consequences of which may be starkly visible in places like the Amazon, but apply almost everywhere. But while passionate advocates of equality or ecology have sometimes ventured beyond their territory, the bridge between radical Red and Green politics has lacked the strength to carry much political weight and bring about lasting change.</para><para>It is, nonetheless, increasingly clear that inequality and destruction are directly linked. Indeed, it would be very much harder to demonstrate that 
 they are not linked, given that they are both happening at the same time. They are also interacting in complex ways that accelerate their growth alarmingly. 	 This is because global consumer capitalism, unless it is restrained, grows faster and faster. Anything not devoted exclusively to the service of its immediate interests it seeks to destroy. The destruction is compounded because it must either grow or blow: it cannot contain itself. It is self-destructive, too, shot through with contradictions which make it blow precisely because it grows, like some force-fed hothouse vegetable. </para><para>One such contradiction is that it feeds by inflating profits, deflating wages and thus increasing inequality.</para><para>Mr Acting Deputy President, there are two issues which to me seem to be the top issues for us to be addressing in this country. One is the growing gap between rich and poorâinequalityâin a country where, as I mentioned earlier, so many people lost their lives fighting for the ethos of a fair go. The other is environmental destruction, which has not only enormous aesthetic losses for we human beings but also huge economic and job ramifications for this and consequent generations.</para><para>I cannot let the opportunity go by to talk for a moment about the GST, which is part of the package that this government is bringing before this Senate shortly. There will be a lot said and done about the manoeuvrings and the numbers and who will set up the inquiry and what the parameters will be, but ultimately the matter of interest is what the outcome will be for this country and for the people living in it and their environment. Let me point to a couple of those things. The Greens, seeing the GST coming, did our homework 12 months before the last election. Our consultant, Dr Louise Crossley, consulted widely with people who are experts in the field because they have lived under GST regimes in other countries. We know what the impact of the GST has been there and, without exception, it has been one which widens the gap between the rich and the poor.</para><para>You cannot shape a GST in a way which is going to close that gap, which is going to benefit those who are disbenefited. You can add artificial contrivances which make it appear that you are going to try to offset the damage that the GST does to the concept of 
 a fair community. The government, of course, has come up with claims that it is going to compensate people through tax breaks of the sort much publicised in the election campaign. But, remarkably, this government even then loaded that compensation package so that the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. Let us make no mistake: this GST package is going to accelerate the already growing gap between the haves and the have-nots in Australia. The package is designed to do that.</para><para>I have this to say to our Democrat friends: you have now said that you will open the possibility of rejecting the GST package in toto if it is found not to be fair, if it is found to disbenefit those people in the Australian community who need help, if it is socially unjust. No inquiry into the GST, no matter how complex or simple, will find otherwise. This GST package is underscored by its unfairness. It is socially unjust, and it cannot be fixed so that it becomes socially just, so that it advantages the poor as against the interests of the rich. That cannot be done.</para><para>At the end of this process, the Democrats are going to have a very big decision to make. They went to the election saying, `We will shepherd the GST provided food, books and a few other items are exempted.' But, at the end of this process, it is going to be found that, even if that is done, the GST is socially unjust. I believe that the Democrats are then going to be left with a decision as to whether or not they stand by their words and reject this package. I believe they will be left with no alternative. We are not going to have a government that is going to accept a package that makes it just. The philosophy of the government is oriented towards the rich and those who already have the best go in this society. They are not going to change that package to alter that philosophy. So it will come down to a very hard question for the Democrats to tackle. I believe there will be a very stark responsibility on their shoulders to change their election policy because that policy in itself is socially unjust.</para><para>I predict that at the end of this long inquiry period there will be negotiations between Senator Harradine and the government to ameliorate somewhat the government's pack 
 age but nevertheless to put it through before 1 July, and no amount of inquiries is going to change that political reality. Community groups will be given an opportunity to express their concern about the disadvantage they are going to have and about the millions of dollars which are going to be raked out of charities and non-government organisations in this country by the government through the GST package at a time when the government is giving less than ever before for charitable purposes and to welfare in this country. The GST is going to take money off them and make their job harder and that much more impossible. This is an anguishing outcome, I would think, for those organisations and, not least, those millions of volunteers who put so much time into working for social justice in this country. They will suddenly find that, as a rule of thumb, one-tenth of their efforts will be diverted into the government coffers, not for the charitable purposes to which they are devoted.</para><para>The other item, of course, is the environment. During the election campaign, I, with other Tasmanian citizens, slowed the progress of the Prime Minister's car as he was heading to a fundraising breakfast on the Hobart wharves. I got some criticism for that. A number of letters came in, and I have responded where I can. But what happened on the streets of Hobart was quite different. Young people came up all over the place and said, `Good on you for making a stand,' because they are aware of the enormous damage being wreaked on the wild forests and the wildlife of Tasmania by Mr Howard's policies.</para><para>In August 1996, I had a cup of tea with the Prime Minister and invited him to come and see the Tasmanian forests because I knew it would be a major issue of contention for us Tasmanians and, indeed, all Australians in the years ahead. He never came. He turned down consequent invitations, but last year he flew to Forestry Tasmania's premises at Perth and signed a regional forest agreement, which is the death warrant for some of the most magnificent forests on the face of the planet.</para><para>Last Friday, with other members of my staff, I visited the Styx River valley north- 
west of Hobart. In this valley is a small stand of trees which are the tallest hardwoods on the face of the planet. One of them reaches to 95 metres above the valley floor, second only in size, stature and height to the giant redwoods of California. Across the way we stood on a ridge watching a cable logger destroying such forests, dragging them off to a convoy of trucks to take them to the woodchip mills of Tasmaniaâthe job shedding woodchip mills of Tasmaniaâon their way to the rubbish dumps of Japan through its paper making process which, by the way, is undercutting recycling in that country, creating enormous environmental problems and job losses for the Japanese.</para><para>How can we look future generations in the eye as a nation? How can this government be praised for its responsibility when its leader refuses to go and see the very thing he is destroying, when its leader refuses, because he is frightened of the reality of the destruction of world heritage value forests in Tasmania, to go to see what his death warrant is causing?</para><para>In 1991, as part of the Green-ALP accord in Tasmania, we stood firm and the government lost office because it wanted to breach its commitment to restrict woodchipping to a little under three million tonnes per annum. Currently the rate of woodchipping in Tasmania is 4.6 million tonnes per annum. The convoys of trucks taking the destroyed forests and the lost wildlife inherent in that through Hobart, Launceston and Burnie are at record levels when fewer of these wild forests exist than ever before.</para><para>This national tragedy may have been taken off the agenda because both of the major parties agree that it should be allowed to happen under their authority, but we Greens will continue to oppose it in every peaceable way we can while ever we draw breath, just as we endorse the sentiments of Senator Reynolds, who spoke just before me, and the call of scientists to come and look at the barrier reef and the degradation of this world attribute appealing to world authorities because of the lack of action of the Australian government. Further north-west again in Kakadu, we have just had a visit from world 
 authorities to see whether Kakadu should not be put on the world endangered list.</para><para>Within a short decade, instead of Australia leading the world in adding places to the World Heritage List because of their sheer magnificence, we have three of those world heritage listed attributes in the aim of international authorities because of the threat and damage through government action or inactivity. What a terrible way to be ending this century.</para><para>We are an optimistic lot despite that. We Greens stand for closing the gap between rich and poor. We stand for defending the environment. As I said to those wonderful disabled people protesting outside Parliament House yesterday because of their concern about the GST, if we do not have social justice, we will not ultimately end up saving the environment either. Our commitment to both of these things remains strong and you will see it repeated in the coming three years of this Senate. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>84</page.no><name role="metadata">Lundy, Sen Kate</name><name role="display">Senator LUNDY</name><name.id>7G6</name.id><electorate>ACT</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise today also to make my contribution to the address-in-reply debate, the speech having been delivered by the Governor-General in this place yesterday. I would like to raise a number of issues and to move through the points raised in the speech presented on behalf of the government by the Governor-General.</para></talk.start><para>Indeed it is a time in Australia where what we need most are ideas and a vision for the future. Over the past 2Â½ years, however, we have seen a government that is prepared to put the future aside and prefers to look at the short termâthe myopic vision of where Australia is both economically and socially.</para><para>For young people particularly, this represents a very sad period in our political history. It represents a period where more than ever young people carry with them a feeling of disillusionment in the political institutions and a feeling of disappointment that, in fact, our leader does not carry with him an eye to the future and hope for employment, prosperity and, indeed, a decent life but is preoccupied with some of the drier aspects of managing certainly the fiscal affairs in the economy of this country and puts people last.</para><para>This approach to running Australia contributes significantly to the disillusionment that young people have. It contributes in such a way that I do not believe this government will be able to show themselves over this next term to be any more suited to the role of running this country than they have shown themselves over the last 2Â½ years. The last 2Â½ years have seen a record of broken promises, of commitments made and then forgotten and, in many cases, the expression of a certain view or an agenda that was just let lapse when other priorities emerged. Indeed, none was more blatant than the issue of the GST.</para><para>It was politically expedient for the coalition to dispel with the GST following an earlier election defeat, and they saw the same expediency arise again when they desperately needed an election issue to deflect the attention of the community away from what was a very poor performance during the time of the last government. The `never, ever' tax, the GST, re-emerged not just to take a place in the campaign platform of the coalition but to become the central feature, the central focus.</para><para>I would like to spend a few minutes speculating on what would have occurred had the GST not been the central focus for the coalition in this election campaign. The community would have been forced to focus on the deconstruction of the social welfare safety net in this country. The community would have been forced to focus on the massive cuts to higher education and the changes to the funding in public education that have left our public school system at risk in the future of not providing the quality service and quality education that our young people need. The community would have been focused on issues like the changes to the youth allowance, to Centrelink and all those other changes and elements that were put in place over the last 2Â½ years that represented a specific downgrading of service to the citizens of Australia.</para><para>Had the GST not been there, we would have been forced to focus on what has happened with the delivery of telecommunications services in this country with the privatisation of Telstra and how that has 
 directly related to a lowering and diminution of services particularly to regional Australia. At a time when industry most needed active support from government to grow and for jobs to come for the future, we would have been forced to focus on this government's cuts to research and development support. We would have been forced to focus on its cuts to the various mechanisms within industry policy designed to support, foster and grow our local businesses. All of these issues present a very pitiful picture of what this government has achieved over the last 2Â½ years. I could go on. What we had instead was a sharply focused debate around the GST. I have to say that the evidence is there that this is not a fair tax and yet we find ourselves with a government that is insisting upon pursuing this.</para><para>I am concerned that the inequities of the GST will be something that Australia forever has to bear with in terms of our economic future. We know, because international evidence shows us, that this tax does not provide the solutions the government claims it does. We know that the GST provides a far greater benefit to those on the higher income end of things than those earning less. Surely the role of government is one of redistributing wealth amongst those in a community who need helpâthe disadvantaged. I often wonder why representatives of the coalition support the mainstream and not the interest groups. When they stand up and talk about the interest groups, the loud voices in the community, why don't they understand why people gather together and advocate certain causes? Why? Because inequities exist. Because disadvantage exists in the community, and that requires a political response.</para><para>Representing and supporting those who are at a disadvantage in the community is a role of government. It is a legitimate role of government to ensure that all in our community share the same level of hope and opportunity as everybody else. But it is this role of government that puts the coalition in such stark relief compared to previous governments. They do not believe there is a specific role of government in society. Every single policy decision has demonstrated their willingness to extract government from the 
 community. The result of this is that many in the community are left isolated. It is a program of privatisation. It is a program of contracting out and outsourcing government services, never mind the quality outcomes. The consistent justification for this is cost savings which they thereby somehow argue deliver some sort of cost saving to the taxpayer. I do not know anybody in Australia, outside of the coalition, who does not believe that there is a specific role of government in delivering those social services.</para><para>We have shown, and it has been shown over time, that the government sector, the public servants of this country, is very often best placed to deliver tangible, practical and meaningful support to the community. Extracting government from the community, as this coalition government has attempted to do, does two things. First, it pays no mind to the quality of the service. Whilst contract law is forever imperfect, establishing the appropriate service level of agreements with outsourced services is always going to be an imperfect process. We have seen a number of Commonwealth Ombudsman reports articulate this point precisely. When there is a transfer of service from public to private, the liabilities, the responsibilitiesâwhere the buck stopsâbecome very unclear and can only be resolved in the courts. Is this an efficient way of delivering services? I think not.</para><para>The second impact that extraction of government from the community has is one of severely disenfranchising individuals. Imagine this: the worse the service becomes, for whatever reasonâthe inability of the government to maintain a quality level of serviceâthe worse it reflects directly on the government from the individual's perspective. Take the Austudy  debacle, for example. Thousands upon thousands of queries came through my electorate office and the offices of my colleagues in the lower house here in Canberra alone about the administrative problems that that was causing. That was not as a result of outsourcing, but it was a direct result of a policy decision of this government.</para><para>The upshot is that the lower the quality of service delivered by government the more frustrated citizens and individuals become 
 with the ability of the government to deliver that service. It reflects badly on the government of the day, the coalition, but it also reflects badly on government. So the self-serving rhetoric of extracting government out of people's lives becomes exactly thatâself-serving. A vicious spiral emerges where the worse that that government service becomes the more people feel that government is unable to provide the quality of service that they require, and maybe there has to be another solution.</para><para>That is one of the main challenges and main features, I think, of the insidious nature of this government's policies with respect to the Public Service and the role it has in our society in delivering support, in delivering a tangible outcome in a whole range of policy areasâsocial security, social welfare, education and industry development. There are many other challenges that we are confronted with at this time.</para><para>At the beginning of my speech I spoke about what the future holds. We are fast approaching the new millennium. Never before in the minds of Australians has there been such a desperate need, a desperate craving, for leadership. I believe this is in response to having 2Â½ years of very poor leadership in this country. People are now looking towards the new millennium perhaps with not as much hope as they otherwise could have. When a government is in place that insists upon focusing on short-term outcomes, be it in the education area, social policy or industry development, it is very difficult for citizens to have faith in promises and what the future holds.</para><para>Employment is one of the most critical areas and certainly one of the major platforms that Labor put on the table during the election campaign. Where are the jobs going to come from? Jobs are the key to so many other outcomes in terms of health, social security, education and housing. To have a job means economic independence for families, for people. So an analysis of the last 2Â½ years of employment policies, industry development policies and education policies shows that, despite the endless rhetoric about jobs, there has been no tangible expression in a policy 
 format before or after the election from this government that puts in place a plan to create jobs for the future.</para><para>There are some very specific examples where this government has actively undermined the prospect of creating new jobs and new industries. There is none more glaring than one of the industries of the future. The information technology and telecommunications sector does more than just provide jobs. This sector is an enabling sector. Whilst John Howard may not acknowledge and accept the role that these new technologies play in our lives now and will continue to play to a greater extent in the future, there is a burning need to address not only industry development in this area but also how we skill our nation's young people and, indeed, those already in the work force or looking for work in a way that they will be able to participate actively in not just the information society but the knowledge society.</para><para>Telstra, as our major carrierâformerly a monopoly holder of telecommunicationsâhas a critical role to play with respect to this sector. Therefore, Telstra's privatisation sits firmly in the heart of what could have been an exciting and comprehensive plan to bring Australia into the 21st century, not just dragging ourselves over the line but being in a position of great strength. Connectivityâthe ability to get as many people, as many businesses, as many community groups, as many government agencies connected on-line and able to communicateâpromotes growth, promotes new ideas and innovation, and we lead the world, as we do in many areas already, with these new technologies.</para><para>Regional Australia has a particular voiceâunfortunately, a particularly ignored voiceâin this specific area of policy. We have an unemployment crisis in the region. In my travels prior to and during the election campaign, I found that no area was seen as providing more hope for the future than information technology and telecommunications. That is not because there is going to be a chip plant in every country town but because, for those businesses and for those individuals, to be connected is the key to their ability to communicate, to gather information, 
 to share, to participate in the society of the future.</para><para>Yet what we have seen under this government is the partial privatisation of Telstra, which has resulted in the delivery of substandard services to the bush. Since the election we have seen the political response to this outcry from people living in the bush who seek better services. We have seen promises of programs to deliver greater connectivity, of internet access, of higher bandwidth. We have even seen Telstra buy into the fray, with promises of new networks, higher bandwidth, greater services.</para><para>Surely this is an area where, more than anywhere else, vision is required. Australia distinguishes itself in so many areas but none more so than in the area of innovation in new technologies. If there were a vision, would we have seen the cuts to research and development? Would we have seen the extraction of government from taking an active role in industry development? Would we have seen the bizarre case of so many very important and meaningful reports about industry growth and where the future lies being so consistently ignored? They have been picked up in an ad hoc manner through a plethora of policies; we are seeing special little programs all over the place, but no vision.</para><para>If this government did have a vision, many of these issues would not have been confronted in the last election campaign; they would have been resolved. I am gravely concerned, not just for my own home townâfor Canberra and the public servants who lost their jobs and continue to lose their jobs under this government that has actively broken commitment after commitmentâbut for all Australians who are looking to their leader for some vision and who, sadly, continually find it to be completely lacking.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>87</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen George</name><name role="display">Senator GEORGE CAMPBELL</name><name.id>NB5</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIn his address to this chamber yesterday, the Governor-General outlined a number of key issues which will form the legislative agenda of the government over the next two- to three-year period. The central issue of that agenda is taxation reform and, more directly, the introduction of a goods and services tax.</para></talk.start><para>In the time that is available to me today I do not want to spend much time addressing that issue, other than to say that we have seen that presented over the past 12 to 18 months by this government, and again yesterday in the Governor-General's address, as a panacea that will cure all our ills. It is not. It is nothing more than another way in which you can collect revenue from the Australian public. It will be introduced in such a wayâas is usually the caseâthat those at the bottom end of the income heap will finish up paying a greater share of the taxation burden.</para><para>There are a number of other issues which I think are probably more important for this parliament to address in terms of what will shape the nature of this nation into the new millennium. They are issues that are being written about and discussed in the community but that are not necessarily receiving the attention that they deserve by this parliament or by the government of the day.</para><para>In my view, the first of those issues is the question of population policy. We have seen over the past two- to three- year period a very weak position adopted in relation to immigration policy, a position that has essentially been driven by responding to the racist activities of One Nation, rather than a policy agenda being driven by what are seen to be the needs of our community into the future.</para><para>I think it is spurious in the least to suggest that, somehow or other, by cutting back on immigration we will generate more jobs for those Australians who currently live here. There is no empirical evidence or data to suggest that that is true or that it has been true in the past or, indeed, that it will be true in the future. The issue of population is critical in terms of determining the rate at which this nation will grow and the capacity of this nation to grow in such a way that we can sustain job growth and wealth growth within the community.</para><para>These issues were discussed at a recent enVision conference in Melbourne where a couple of key players in Australian industry had something to say. Tony Berg, the Chief Executive of Boral, made the comment that more people create more investment, more jobs and, as a consequence, more wealth. I 
 agree with that statement. There is not too much that I agree on with Tony Berg, but I do agree with that. He also went on to say that the housing and construction sector would remain stagnant for the next 15 years unless immigration levels were increased.</para><para>We all knowâanyone who has come out of industry knowsâthat the housing sector is a key generator of growth within the economy. If your housing sector is growing, your manufacturing sector is employed, and a range of other activities are generated out of it. If Tony Berg is predicting that there will be stagnation in the housing sector over the next 15-year period, then at the end of the day that will translate into higher levels of unemployment. He goes on to argue the case for increasing the intake of skilled and entrepreneurial migrants as well as look atâalong with John White, the Chief Executive of</para><para>Visy Boardâsetting growth targets for our population into the future. In fact, John White argues that in 50 years time we could support up to 50 million people in this country.</para><para>But, in terms of population policy, population growth in itself is not the only issue; the other issue that is critical is population distribution. In this country we are witnessing a continual drift towards the coastline. We now see, for example, that Sydney has a population of four million people; 21 per cent of the total Australian population now live in the Sydney region, and this figure is predicted to increase to six million within 20 years.</para><para>A number of significant statistics in relation to our population I think are particularly important. For example, something like 12 million of our 18 million inhabitants now live on the coastline between Brisbane and Melbourne. We are crowding out that part of our landmass while at the same time we are doing nothing about generating and encouraging growth in our regional and rural communities. In fact, the opposite is the case. We have neither a vision nor a strategy for growing regional and rural Australia, for encouraging development in those regional and rural communities.</para><para>I spent a fair bit of this year travelling around the country with the Senate education committee looking at regional unemployment, 
 and two things struck me about each of the regions or rural communities we visitedâand we visited regions and rural communities in every state of the nation. One of those two things was that there were people working in those communities who had creative ideas about what should be done to stimulate growth in their community; people who had developed through community forums specific projects that, with proper resourcing, could be implemented which would lead to growth in employment opportunities in those regions, those communities, and, in addition, would assist in keeping young people in the regions where they were born and grew up, allowing them to make a contribution to the future development of that region. They had a lot of ideas, but it was also apparent that they were disconnectedâdisconnected from the national economy, the national economic framework of our nation. They did not know how to access the finance markets. They did not know where to take their projects to seek financing. They did not know who were the leading providers of finance for projects within our community. They were disconnectedâdisconnected in a number of ways.</para><para>The other thing that was significant about those communities was that they were really dying on their feetâand the people in those communities recognised it. A significant lesson out of those visits we paid to those communities around the nation was that the market will not resolve their problems. They cannot rely on market forces to provide jobs in Whyalla, in Nowra, in Rockhampton, in Burnie or in Ballarat. They could only seek and would only achieve solutions to their problems through direct government intervention.</para><para>It is encouraging to note that the current government has allocated responsibility to a number of ministers for regional development; whether or not the current government will be as enthusiastic about committing resources to regional development that will make the difference to whether those communities are able to turn around the problems they confront is another matter. We will watch with interest to see the type of policy formulation that comes out of the current government in 
 addressing some of the problems of those regional communities.</para><para>But, if those communities are to have a positive role in the development of the nation, it is critical that they be linked into the national economic framework. That means that we have to generate policies related to developing our industrial base. It has been argued at various forums right across this nation for the past decade or so that there has been a glaring need to expand the base of the Australian economyâto reduce our dependence upon primary production and commodity based activitiesâinto manufacturing and service related activities; to expand that sector of the economy by implementing a positive agenda for growth in our industry policy. That means looking at developing new industriesâthe type of industries that Senator Lundy has just referred to in the information technology area.</para><para>We have great potential to grow a significant industrial base out of the convergence of our communications and media and entertainment industries. That convergence is under way in a significant way today even as we debate these issues in this parliament. But we also need to look at our traditional industry. There is no easy transfer from the industries of the past to the industries of the future. It is a matter of progression across one to the other. Significant activity can be achieved out of our traditional industries in terms of their ability to export if the right incentives are given to them to do a number of things, particularly in the research and development of new products. But you cannot be optimistic that this government will address those policies in a positive way.</para><para>I recently participated in the Senate Economics References Committee. It released a report entitled <inline font-style="italic">Promoting Australian Industry</inline> in July this year. It made a series of recommendations not dissimilar to the type of recommendations that came out of the Goldsworthy report and the Mortimer report. We have not seen a lot of activity by this government in implementing the types of recommendations that come out of those reports. But that committee, which was a joint committee, adopted a set of recommendations unanimous 
 ly. It recognised that the key to solving the problems of unemployment in our community lies in our developing and promoting Australian industries by growing those industries.</para><para>It also recognised that a key to the growth of those industries is investment in research and development. Yet we have seen through this government in the last financial year R&amp;D expenditure cut by something like 50 per cent. They have made it so difficult for companies to access resources that companies are just not even bothering to make the applications. As a consequence, there is a very significant decline in the amount of R&amp;D activity occurring right across industries in this country at present. It is an area that needs addressing urgently. I will be interested to see the type of policy formulations that the new Minister for Industry, Science and Resources, Senator Minchin, brings before this chamber.</para><para>Another key issue that was addressed in that report which is critical to the development of our industries is capital gains tax. There is the question of using the capital gains tax regime to encourage patient capital investment in our industry. It is about actually rewarding those investors who are prepared to leave their money in our industries and enterprises around the nation in the longer term. Patient capital investment is investment in real jobs.</para><para>What we are witnessing in this country at present are investment decisions driven by short-term profit taking. We are witnessing traditional manufacturing companies in this country being forced to make decisions about closing enterprises and getting rid of assets. They are decisions not based on whether those assets are sustainable in the longer term or create jobs or a reasonable rate of return on the investment. They are decisions driven by the demand of institutional investors for a fixed rate of return over the shortest time. It is an investment strategy that is working contrary to the interests of this nation and its inhabitants. It is an issue that needs to be addressed with some urgency.</para><para>Another issue that I believe needs to be addressed if we are to grow as a nation into a dynamic community over the next decade 
 or so is telecommunications. It is a question of how Telstra operates into the future. It is not about privatisation. The privatisation of Telstra will be an absolute disaster in terms of our ability to influence the direction of communications over the longer term. But there is an argument that ought to be had in this place about the nature and the way in which Telstra is currently structured and whether that structureâthe way in which that business is runâallows it to operate in the best interests of the community it is supposed to be servicing.</para><para>A range of arguments have been put forward about the different ways that Telstra can be restructured. There are arguments that it ought to be set up into separate business units covering the various service areas that it provides. I have heard arguments from experts in the field that we would be better served by separating the services provided by Telstra from the delivery of the communications infrastructure.</para><para>I have heard argumentsâthey have some meritâthat we ought to consider breaking up Telstra into a number of separate identities servicing specific regions within Australia. It would be set up in such a way that it would be much more responsive to the needs of the community it represents. There are a number of examples around the world where small telcos have been very successful in generating industry development activities associated with the information technology area despite the fact that they are providing services to, in one instance, only 500,000 subscribers.</para><para>So big does not necessarily mean effective in the communications industry, but we certainly ought to apply some creative thinking to the way in which our communications companies are structured and whether or not they can be restructured to provide more effective communications services to regional and rural Australia and, through that process,  link regional and rural Australia into the national economic network. Unless we do that, no matter what else we do at the ground levelâat ground zero, so to speakâit will be irrelevant if they are not part of that national network.  </para><para>There is a range of other areas which I think also would have been worthy of address by this government in the Governor-General's speech yesterday but received very scant attention. Senator Brown, in his comments, referred to the linking of social justice with saving the environment. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>90</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe address-in-reply debate is traditionally a time in which senators can range fairly considerably in the topics they cover. There are two areas I want to focus on today. In the address yesterday from the Governor-General there was considerable comment about the need for, in the government's words, tax reformâthat is, a goods and services tax: the tax that we were never ever to have, according to the declaration of the Prime Minister.</para></talk.start><para>What also concerned me was the lack of vision in the retirement incomes area, and I will come to some issues relating to that shortly. Labor made it very clear in the lead-up to the last election and the election in 1993 that it would not support a goods and services tax, and it has no intention of changing that position given the election result. There are a number of fundamental arguments that Labor holds and believes in very strongly as to why it will not be supporting a goods and services tax, and I just want to run through those issues very quickly.</para><para>The goods and services tax does not create jobs. It is a tax on all goods and services, and a GST is, by its nature, a tax on jobs. If a GST did create jobs, European countries with a GSTâand most have itâwould have lower unemployment than the United States. Interestingly, the United States is one of the few advanced economies in the world that does not have a goods and services tax, and the unemployment rates of European countries are frequently double that of the United States. The only new jobs likely to be significantly created by a goods and services tax are the extra staff that will be needed to administer it in the tax office. In fact, a GST will cost jobs in many sectors of the Australian economy, particularly in the service sector. The service sectorâthe hospitality industry, for 
 exampleâhas been Australia's greatest job creator in the last 20 years.</para><para>Most importantly, I think a GST is fundamentally unfair to low- and middle-income earners. Everyone pays the same tax on goods and services regardless of ability to pay. People on low or middle incomes or social security pay proportionally more tax. After all, an extra $10 at the checkout counter means a lot more to a bus driver's family than it does to a lawyer's. Any shift from the taxation of income to the taxation of consumption is felt most by low- and middle-income earners. What is interesting is that big business is all in favour of a GST, because the shift in the burden of tax moves away from large business to the consumer more generallyâparticularly low- and middle-income earners and small business. It is no wonder that the Business Council of Australiaâwhich is dominated in its membership by the banks, major retailers and Australia's biggest companiesâwants a GST.</para><para>I would have to say that, from the point of view of hypocrisy, it is the banks' position which ranks as the most amazing position of all. The banks were in there at the Business Council arguing furiously for a GSTâ`but not on us' they said. They said, `Not only do we not want a GST to apply to banks, we want the states' financial institutions taxes abolished as well.' So the position of the banks is the most hypocritical of all.</para><para>The GST almost always rises. In 21 out of 23 OECD countries which have a GST, the rate has risen since the introduction of that tax. The rate rises are inevitable. In New Zealand the GST was introduced at a rate of 10 per cent; it is now 12.5 per cent. In Britain it has risen from 10 per cent to 17.5 per cent. In Denmark it has risen from 10 per cent to 25 per cent. Interestingly, Japan started off with a GST of three per cent and of course there was the usual pledgeâlike Prime Minister Howard'sâthat it would never, ever go up.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZS6</name.id><name role="metadata">QUIRKE</name><name role="display">Senator Quirke</name></talker><para>âIs this the same bloke who said it was never going to come in?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name></talker><para>âThat is right. It was never, ever going to come in, and it is never, ever going to go up. What is interesting about 
 Japan is that they increased the GST to five per cent in April last year. I would not sweepingly argue that the current economic problems of Japan have been caused by the introduction of a GST or the increase in the GST from three per cent to five per cent. Some might argue that, but I would not. But it certainly has not helped the Japanese economy one bit to have introduced a GST and then to have increased it. It certainly harmed it in some respects.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The issue of compensation is widely discussed, but compensation does not work. There is no way to adequately compensate low- and middle-income earners and those on fixed incomes, and what is more important is that there is no way to guarantee that compensation package stays in place. Future government can take away elements of the compensation package. In fact, that is what has happened in most countries that have introduced a goods and services tax. It is inevitably weighted further and further in favour of higher income earners. The compensation package is stripped back, the GST is increased and the biggest beneficiaries of the cuts to income tax are higher income earners.</para><para>Another great myth about a GST is that it boosts national savings. The argument is: you tax consumption, therefore the price of goods goes up, people are forced to save money, they spend less on consumption because it costs more to live and that is a boost to national savings. There is no better authority than Ted Evans, the head of the Australian Treasury, who said, `Every economic text that you read or that I know of will tell you in principle that shifting the tax burden towards further reliance on indirect taxes will significantly aid national savings.' But he then said, `You won't find that argument convincingly demonstrated in studies of international tax reform experience.'</para><para>What is interesting about countries that have introduced a GSTâand this is true of Europe, the United States, which does not have a GST, and Japanâis that their savings rates are going down. At the same time as the GST is ratcheted up and up, the savings rates have been going down. That issue of national savings is fundamental to the performance of 
 the Australian economy, but I will not go into that issue today.</para><para>A GST does not get rid of the cash or the black economy. Tax avoiders find new ways around the black economy. There was an interesting study of Canada, which introduced a GST in 1992, I think it was. It is estimated that the cash economy doubled in the seven years since the GST was brought in. It is relatively easy to develop strategies to avoid the GST net. Of course a GST will create inflation. Costs will go up. There will be an increase in inflation depending on the size of the GST.</para><para>One of the arguments I find fascinating is that, when we get rid of all these other 10 taxes, including the wholesale sales tax, and replace them with a 10 per cent GST, all of the businesses that currently pay these taxes will drop their prices. Maybe I am just a touch cynical, but I would be surprised if there are not at least some businesses that try to maintain their profit margin by trying to maintain at least some element of the current wholesale sales tax and not pass on the reductions in the wholesale sales tax to the consumer. There is no legal power in this country to force them to do that. So we may end up with an inflationary rate that is greater than is anticipated as a result of a GST because there will be many businesses that will not reduce prices as a result of the abolition of these taxes, particularly the wholesale sales tax.</para><para>This final point relates to a GST and small business. There are 1.3 million small business operators in Australia and they are all turned into tax collectors. People can have arguments about the wholesale sales tax, but it is a very efficient tax to collect because the number of tax collectors is quite small. For small businesses this means an increase in compliance costs and small business operators will need to devote hundreds of hours to the necessary paperwork. I do not think they will be particularly thrilled when the army of new tax inspectorsâthe VAT man as he is known in the UK, the GST man or woman in Australiaâfronts up and wants to check all their paperwork to make sure they are paying their tax. </para><para> So that is a very brief overview of why Labor has continued to oppose a GST. Despite the election result, we will be maintaining our opposition to a GST. There is nothing contradictory in arguing and maintaining that position. There is nothing contradictory in the approach we put forward that there should be a thorough Senate committee investigation into a whole range of aspects of a GST. There is nothing contradictory in that position whatsoever. We will be endeavouring to obtain much of the information that the current Treasurer, Mr Costello, and the government refused to release before the election campaign.</para><para>One interesting aspect of yesterday's speech was the words and themes that emerged. We continually heard words such as `choice', `incentive' and `saving'. We hear this rhetoric time and time again from the government. What is disappointing if we reflect on some of the government's legislation over the past 2Â½ years and reflect on some of the legislation we can anticipate in the next presumably three years is the very lacklustre performance in the area of retirement incomes, not just in respect of superannuation but in respect of retirement incomes generally, of which superannuation is a major part.</para><para>Why is this issue so critical to the future of Australia? The current proportion of the Australian population who are 65 and over is about 12.2 per cent. That will increase to 19 per cent by the year 2026. In looking around the chamber, I think it is within the reach of most of us to be living at that time. By the year 2046âI expect that is not within the reach of most us in the chamberâ23 per cent of Australians will be over the age of 65. Sorry, Mr Acting Deputy President McKiernan, you are more optimistic than I if you think you will make it to 2046.</para><para>What is very fundamental about this shift in the ageing population is the cost to government. The current cost of aged pensions and allowances is $14.1 billion, which will increase in the year 2001-02 to $16.5 billion. It is an increase of 23 per cent over a five-year period. That is not because the current government has been any more generous to pensionersâfar from itâit is because of the 
 ageing population, the increasing number of people who are retiring. Many are retiring, unfortunately, before 65 for a whole range of other economic and social reasons. Every year the cost of pensions on the budget goes up by between half a billion dollars and one billion dollars.</para><para>Let us look at residential care subsidies. They totalled $694 million in 1997-98 and will increase to $845 million in the year 2001-02; an increase of 22 per cent. Home and community care and aged care cost $456 million in 1997-98 and will rise to $706 million in the year 2001-02; an increase of 54 per cent. Again, this is not because this government is any more generousâin fact, far from it. It is continually trying to cut back expenditure on the aged as a total in our community. It is because of the ageing population. This is going to lead to very, very serious economic and social consequences.</para><para>One of the most perverse arguments I find this government advancing in favour of a GST is that we need a GST to broaden the tax base in order to pay for the increasing cost of social security. Yet the record of this government in its 2Â½ years in office has been to cut assistance in the area of social security. We all remember the debacle over aged care homes. One of the disappointing things to me is that, unfortunately, a body like ACOSS has been at least partially convinced by this line that you need a GST to broaden the tax base and to secure social security expenditure, particularly assistance to the aged. But this government has no intention of increasing expenditure on the aged in our community. It is the most rapidly growing cost of government, and it is a cost that needs to be met. We cannot say to Australians who are turning 65 in ever increasing numbers, `You can't have an age pension and associated allowances. You can't have residential care, and you can't have home and community care.' This cost needs to be met.</para><para>If we look briefly at the area of retirement incomes, we had the introduction of a new taxâit was called a surcharge by this governmentâon superannuation for higher income earners. I am not going to go into all of the difficulties that this new tax has caused. There 
 have been great difficulties collecting the money and great inefficiencies in the collection or undercollection of the money. It was a poorly targeted tax. There are a whole range of reasons. This new so-called superannuation surcharge was the largest new revenue measure of the current government during its last term. It was clearly a tax. The government called it a surcharge because it could not call it a tax, even though it was a tax. It did not want to be seen to be breaking its promise. If the outcome of this super tax and all the difficulties that have occurred in its collection are anything to go by, woe betide the Australian community the problems that will result from the implementation of a goods and services tax.</para><para>What was also interesting about the government's tax packageâthe central element of which was the GSTâwas that last year in May or June the government put up an omnibus tax bill which included a number of very important provisions, one being a provision for a savings rebate. The savings rebate was that of the reworked, rebadged superannuation co-contributions that the Labor government had committed itself to. The Treasurer, Mr Costello, and the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp, were triumphantly proclaiming the savings rebate as a great incentive for savings. We need to have incentives to encourage saving and we need to have choiceâwe heard this rhetoric in the speech yesterday. We were told that this savings rebate, which we passed in May or June last year, was urgent and that it would encourage saving. The Assistant Treasurer urged people to go out and save. What happened? Three months later it was scrapped. It took three months to scrap what was hailed by the Treasurer, the Assistant Treasurer and the Prime Minister as one of the Australia's greatest saving initiatives. This government has a very poor record and has taken a mixed approach to encouraging savings in this country.</para><para>There were a number of other initiatives, some of which have been announced and some of which have not been enacted yet but which I am sure we will see come before the Senate over the next three years. There was 
 a proposal by this governmentâit is not one I agreed with, franklyâto allow people to draw down on their superannuation for a housing deposit. It must have been a non-core promise, because the Treasurer has quietly dropped that proposal. We do have the proposal for choice of superannuationâso-called choice. It is effectively deregulation of the superannuation market. There are some horrendous implications for Australians in that. I suspect that will come before us in the next few months. We have the removal of superannuation as an industrial matter. Again, there are some very serious implications for that. What concerns me is that this government's approach is to undermine saving, to decrease saving, and to undermine the confidence in the retirement income system that we had in this countryâa system which is so necessary to ensure that, when people reach the age of 65, they are receiving a decent level of income and a decent level of community support.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>94</page.no><name role="metadata">Quirke, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator QUIRKE</name><name.id>ZS6</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI would firstly like to make the remark that I thought His Excellency's speech yesterday was an interesting speech. I want to congratulate His Excellency: he is one of our finest governor-generals and I think he has done a great job. The remarks that I am going to make about his speech are not directed at all at Sir William whom I have the utmost of respect for but at the government that wrote it for him.</para></talk.start><para>Sir William has occupied an interesting place in Australian history. He is carrying out his role with great distinction and integrity. He has an empathy for the Australian community that has been well and truly picked up by the community out there who have a very high regard for him personally and for the office he represents. He represents a very important office in our democracy.</para><para> I, like many other people, will no doubt vote for a republic when the referendum is held next year. I will be voting for a minimalist option in that future republic. The sort of role that I want to see a future president of Australia play is very similar to the role played by the current Governor-General 
 of this country who is a very decent, honest and sincere man.</para><para>I have listened to many governors give speeches about what his or her government was going to do. They are usually just lists of legislative atrocities of one form or another that are about to be committed against my constituents. Yesterday's speech was a little more subtle than thatâalthough not much more. The government has clearly put down the broad parameters of what it is intending to do. No doubt it will not be very much longer before we get the fine details here in the Senate.</para><para>I want to have a look at the word `mandate'. I have generally been a mandate man. I think governments are elected to govern. I well remember what happened on this day some 23 years ago to a government that was elected to govern in this country. I was in my office at the time. Somebody came running down and told me that, despite that mandate, the Whitlam government had been turfed out, tossed out, by the activities of the then Governor-General and the then Leader of the Opposition, Malcolm Fraser, whom I have less respect for than the gentleman I mentioned a moment ago. However, I later came to regard Malcolm Fraser as not being too bad a prime minister because there were a few things he did which I thought were much better than what we are currently being blessed with.</para><para>At the end of the day, I think the activities of the then Governor-General and those people who gave him advice did serious damage to the political fabric of this country and, some 23 years later, are still worthy of being reflected upon by people in this place and in the broader community. The Whitlam government had a mandateâthere was no argument about that. They faced the people in 1974 and they were elected to govern. The term of their commission was some three years. It was cut shortâdramatically by about 18 monthsâby the Senate at that time. It decided, despite all of the conventionsâconventions which had been rigorously kept to in Westminster systems around the globeâto starve the Australian government of supply.</para><para>Much has been written of this particular period. There are a couple of salient points that I want to bring out in my address here today. The first one is the concept that a government has a commission. That commission, that mandate to govern, which should not be interfered with by the Senate, was, I believe, seriously undermined in 1975. I was enraged in 1975, as were a number of other people, because that very important principle not only was called into question but also, in many respects, was slaughtered on that particular day.</para><para> We all know what happened. The election was held some five weeks later; the Labor Party did not win that election. That became the other point of 1975, that the end justifies the means. I remember seeing some of the characters involved in that 1975 assassination of the Whitlam government cheeringâand, if I remember rightly, I think the now Prime Minister was one of those who had a glass of champagne in his hand and was cheering when he heard that the Whitlam government had been sacked and dismissed.</para><para>I now find myself in a position where the same people are lecturing us here on mandates. It is a bit rich to have people like the Prime Minister suddenly say that he has a mandate and Whitlam never had a mandate. For that matter, when we had a whole pile of other reforms that we wanted to get through here in the 13 years under Labor, we did not have a mandate for them either for whatever reason. The people back in 1974 and 1975 who brought down the Whitlam government did not believe in mandates then but, suddenly, when the role is reversed they believe in them now.</para><para>Let us have a look at this concept of a mandate. What does it really involve? One of the most important things about a mandate is if you offer a plan to the public of Australia and give them a chance to vote on that particular proposalâif you are up-front about it and say, `This is what we are proposing. We are not going to do it at midnight and enact it at 9 o'clock the next morning. We want you to vote on it; we want you to deliberate on it; we want you to make your mind up on it. When you go into the polling 
 box, we want to make sure that you are clear about the implications of what you are voting for.' Before my colleagues on this side think I am making out a case for the enemy on this, I hasten to add that I will come back to that point in just a moment.</para><para>On 3 October this year the government clearly had a large number of people go and vote under no illusion whatsoever that they would be voting for what was supposedly called tax reformâwhat we all know is really a cover for the goods and services tax, the GST. There is no doubt that a large number of people went in there and voted for this particular tax. But, sadly, a much larger number went into the polling box and did not vote for the GST at all. They were under no illusion either. As I understand it, 52 per cent of people went in and voted against this government's GST.</para><para>Back in 1989 in South Australia, we had a government that was elected with 48 per cent of the vote. We never heard the end of it from the Liberal Party: we had no authority to govern, no right to govern and should not sit in the Treasury benches; and the mugs in my show agreed with them. But what happened then was that the Liberal Party said, `You have no mandate for anything.' The same people who said that then are now saying, `No, we've got a mandate. We only got 48 per cent of the vote. We just managed to trick a few key electorates and we did a pretty good job of that.' When you have $50 million worth of taxpayers' funds and a few smart alecs that know how to run manipulative campaigns in a number of marginal seats, it is not hard at all to exercise those sorts of things. That is no mandate whatsoever, and I will elaborate further on that. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para><para>Leave granted; debate adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST</title><type>Matters of Public Interest</type><page.no>95</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Alice Springs Desert Park</title><title>Masters Games</title><page.no>95</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>95</page.no><name role="metadata">Tambling, Sen Grant</name><name role="display">Senator TAMBLING</name><name.id>6E4</name.id><electorate>NT</electorate><party>CLP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI would like to take this opportunity to describe 
 yet another Northern Territory Country-Liberal Party government initiative that has been a resounding success story. On Sunday 22 March the Alice Springs Desert Park celebrated its first year of operation. The 1,300 hectare Alice Springs Desert Park is a world-class tourist attraction that also plays a vital role in research into and conservation of Australia's desert flora and fauna. During its first year, almost 86,000 visitors enjoyed the park's attractions, and this number is sure to grow significantly in a very short time. One of those 86,000 visitors was a man who is synonymous with nature and conservation throughout the world, Sir David Attenborough. His description of the park as `unsurpassable' in the visitors' book and subsequent comment in the local newspaper the <inline font-style="italic">Centralian Advocate</inline>  that `there is no museum or wildlife park in the world that can match it' is high praise indeed and well deserved. Sir David's comments are a ringing endorsement of the efforts that the Northern Territory government and the Parks and Wildlife Commission of the Northern Territory have put into ensuring that the park is a unique and very significant facility.</para></talk.start><para>The $20 million park is located just out of Alice Springs and is nestled at the base of the spectacular MacDonell Ranges. This location, amidst such beautiful scenery, adds to the experience of the park and reflects the careful and long-term planning that has gone into all aspects of the park. Ken Johnson, Regional Director South of the Parks and Wildlife Commission, had a vision for the park. He foresaw that `the park will be the premier facility in the nation for displaying and interpreting plants and animals and landscapes of the vast arid zone as well as their traditional use by Aboriginal people'. To see that vision achieved so spectacularly must be very satisfying and gratifying, and I congratulate him and his staff on this achievement.</para><para>The 40 staff of the Alice Springs Desert Park look after over 350 plant species and more than 120 animal species in three major Australian desert habitatsâthe desert rivers, sand country and woodlands. Of the animal species represented, 22 are mammals, 11 of which are threatened or endangered. They 
 include species such as the Greater Bilby, the Mala and the Central Rock-rat, which are several of the more endangered species involved in successful captive breeding programs. These animals represent part of the park's role as a vital research centre, actively involved in the conservation of rare and threatened desert species.</para><para>The Alice Springs Desert Park is an excellent tourist facility and plays an important educational, research and conservation role that makes it a model for and sets a very high benchmark for similar facilities worldwide to aspire to. It is particularly remarkable that the park has achieved all that it has in the short time that it has been operating. The park celebrated its first birthday in March this year and only last month won a major national tourism award. But before I move on to this most recent tourism award, let me list some of the other awards that this marvellous attraction has received, such as the Territory and National categories for a Case Earth Award. The master plan of the park received awards before the park was even open, winning an occasional special award from the Royal Australian Institute's National Awards for Planning Excellence in 1995 and 1996. The master plan also received a Judges Special Acknowledgment Award from the Australian Institute of Landscape Architects Queensland group in 1997.</para><para>The park has received national recognition from the Australian Institute of Landscape Architects, winning a National Project Award of Merit. At the recent Tourism Council of Australia 1998 Australian Tourism Awards, the Alice Springs Desert Park won the National Award for Tourism Development Projects. This prestigious award is well deserved and was only one of several that Northern Territory tourist operators received. I congratulate them on this excellent result, which is a good indication of the strength and competitive nature of the tourist industry in the territory.</para><para>Northern Territory Adventure Tours won in the category of Tour and Transport OperationsâMajor, and two operations located at what is arguably the most recognisable tourist attraction in Australia, Uluru, or Ayers Rock, 
 also received recognition. In the category of Tourism Restaurants, the Sounds of Silence restaurant had its uniqueness and popularity acknowledged and Ayers Rock Resort Management Pty Ltd won the highly competitive Meetings Industry category.</para><para>In the year 2000 Uluru will be the focus of world attention when it is the starting point for the Olympic flames journey around Australia, with territory athlete Nova Peris- Kneebone having the honour of carrying the torch first. Nova will no doubt visit the Sails in the Sunset restaurant, dining under the stars in the desert overlooking the rock. She may also visit the Alice Springs Desert Park, which will also undoubtedly be a focus of world attention in 2000, when the spotlight is on Central Australia and the beginning of the torch relay.</para><para>The park has great plans for the future, with three new core habitat displays: Mulga, Range and Gorge, costing $7 million and already well advanced. The Gorge habitat display should be especially interesting and spectacular, replicating the environment and habitat areas such as Stanley Chasm, with its water, rock wallabies and sheer walls. A free picnic area will also be a feature of the park. The new exhibits and picnic area will enhance what is already a world class facility and provide yet another world-class attraction in Alice Springs to add to the many attractions and natural wonders that already draw so many interstate and international visitors to Central Australia.</para><para>I would also like to make mention of something else that is unique to Alice Springs. This is not an actual attraction but an eventâthe Honda Masters Games, which is held in Alice every two years. Over 4,500 people participated in the most recent games, from 17 to 24 October. As in past years, the event was a spectacular success, enjoyed by all involved.</para><para>The inaugural masters games were held in Alice Springs in 1986 and were the first multi-sport event for mature aged athletes in Australia. The games have gone from strength to strength since that first event, and their phenomenal growth is evidence of the continuing popularity and support for the event.</para><para>The Honda Masters Games are known as `the friendly games' and it is very refreshing to see the event live up to its title. The games are played in the true spirit of sport with all participants competing fiercely and to the highest possible level, but not to the detriment of fair play and sportsmanship. Each year, records are broken in the 30 sports that make up the games but it is the emphasis on participating, having a go and attempting to beat a personal best that I admire most.</para><para>The games attract competitors from all over Australia and an increasing contingent from overseas. Ages vary greatly, but it is not uncommon to see sprightly 80-year-old competitors showing their stuff. A recent star of the games was 75-year-old Stan Stankovic, who won 15 gold medals in the 75 to 79 age group and broke the previous track and field record of 13 gold medals.</para><para>This most recent Honda Masters Games had the added attraction of a couple of other Australian legends of the sporting arena. Ian Chappell, the former great Australian Test cricket captain, proved he is as fiercely competitive as ever by competing in the baseball with the extremely successful Interport baseball team. Evonne Goolagong-Cawley, the tennis legend, also visited Alice Springs for the games, attended a wide variety of events and was reported as being moved by the famous masters' spirit and willingness to have a go. Another great who has previously attended the games is Dawn Fraser.</para><para>The games bring many benefits to the town apart from the opportunity to mix with legends such as Stan Stankovic, Ian Chappell, Evonne Goolagong-Cawley and Dawn Fraser. It is estimated that the Alice Springs economy receives an injection of $8 million from the influx of competitors and others related to the games. This is a huge boost for the town.</para><para>But the games also provide many other benefits that may not be measured in dollars and cents. The visitors to the games invariably leave with many happy memories and pass on their experiences to friends and relatives in other states and countries. This word of mouth advertising is the best possible form of endorsement and results in the games' 
 growing popularity and in them becoming a fixture on many masters calendars.</para><para>The local residents of Alice Springs love the event and support it strongly. The best example of this support is the fact that almost 1,000 residents act as volunteers and assist with all facets of the games' operations. It is an incredible show of community spirit with approximately one in 25 locals being involved in the games as a volunteer. If the Sydney Olympics manage to generate such enthusiasm and drive, then they will be without doubt the most successful Olympics ever.</para><para>The masters games are organised by the Northern Territory Department of Sport and Recreation. I applaud the hard work and dedication that are shown by all those involved, particularly that of the games General Manager, Shane O'Leary. An event of this kind is a huge logistical exercise and organisation for the next masters games must begin the day the event finishes. There is no rest for the workers involved.</para><para>The eighth Honda Masters Games will be held in Alice Springs from 21 to 28 October in the year 2000. I urge all Territorians and those eligible in the rest of Australia to attend this event as it will be the experience of a lifetime that everyone will absolutely love. It provides the chance for some high-level masters competition, a chance to sample the Territory hospitality and the ideal opportunity to take in the wonders of Central Australia such as Uluru and the Alice Springs Desert Wildlife Park.</para><para>It is important on this day, the 11th day of the 11th month, to make mention of the 80th anniversary since the World War I armistice was signed and the guns fell silent in that terrible war. The bravery, suffering and dedication of all Australian troops who fought is well remembered, and should be remembered for generations to come. The armistice has been marked by ceremonies throughout the Northern Territory.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tasmania: Federal Representation</title><page.no>98</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>98</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI want to talk about an article which was published in the <inline font-style="italic">Launceston Examiner</inline>  shortly after the recently held federal election 
 entitled `Senators, Liberals: Wake up!' The author was Mr Rod Scott of that newspaper. He gave the impression that he was disappointed with the election result that saw a Liberal cabinet minister and the Liberal parliamentary secretary lose their seats in Tasmania. I think everyone now knows that Labor holds all five House of Representatives seats in the state of Tasmania.</para></talk.start><para>In the article, Mr Scott was particularly harsh on the worth of Tasmania's 12 senators, suggesting that they did not contribute much to the state. He described this chamber as a chamber of privilege and he implied that senators were basically a waste of time. He said that they were `highly paid' and `remote from the electorate'. I must say: as I understand it, all Labor senators in Tasmania have shopfront offices and receive a great deal of contact from the public, as is the case with many of the other senators in Tasmania.</para><para>I must say that Mr Scott's comments do Tasmanian voters a disservice. Firstly, you should be aware that a significant number of voters in Tasmania did not simply vote above the lineâthat is, the nominated party distribution of preferences ticketâbut chose to vote for individual Senate candidates whom they wanted to represent them; that is, they voted below the line. Over 67,000 voters, or 22 per cent of total votes cast, chose to vote in this way in Tasmania. That is in sharp contrast to most of the other states. In New South Wales, only four per cent of voters voted below the line; in Queensland, four per cent; in Victoria, three per cent; South Australia, seven per cent; Western Australia, six per cent; Northern Territory, 14 per cent; and in the ACT, 22 per cent.</para><para>In fact, the national average for below-the-line voting at the 1998 federal election in the Senate was five per cent. So Tasmanian voters made, one would argue, an even more deliberate choice in their selection of the members of this chamber who would take their place from 1 July 1999. In that sense I think Mr Scott does a disservice to Tasmanian voters who did make a very deliberate choice and who, I think, well understand the role of this place in relation to representing the interests of Tasmania.</para><para>I would have to say this also: the Senate is not a chamber of privilege, as Mr Scott would have us believe. It is the watchdog of the Australian federal system; it is a house of review. It is a source of considered second opinion on a variety of contentious legislation. The fact of the matter is that normally the Senate considers every piece of legislation clause by clause. This is the forumâin which an extensive and efficient committee system operatesâthrough which members of the Australian public can have direct input into the form of legislation, the detail of specific government programs and matters of public policy. Importantly for Tasmania and for the other smaller states, it is the Senate that scrutinises in great detail every Commonwealth budget. So I really think that it is more than, as Mr Scott describes it, `a chamber of privilege'. He also says this in relation to Tasmania and the Senate:</para><para>Tasmania is in deep political trouble and the Government Senators are the ones who are going to have to get us out of it.</para><para>Tasmania is represented in this parliament by 17 politiciansâfive members and 12 senators. Of those, there are five senators who are members of the Liberal Party, and there are no senators or members from the National Party.</para><para>So I would suggest that it is not simply the five government senators upon whom Tasmania relies in relation to its future and representation in this place. The future prosperity of the state depends upon the hard work and the effective representation by all senators and all members, not only federal parliamentarians but also members of the state parliament and representatives at a local government level. Representation must start at a local community level. Obviously, in terms of the established parties, it finds its way through the party system and it needs to carry through to the floor of this parliamentâthe House of Representatives and the Senateâas well as the state parliament.</para><para>In the end, the voters must consider the merits of the respective policies presented to them by the parties and vote accordingly as they feel at election time. That happened in Tasmania twice in the last few monthsâ 
firstly, at the state election on 29 August. In that election the then government, the Liberal government, the government of Mr Rundle, was soundly defeated. If you look at the federal election result in Tasmania, this government was defeated in the state of Tasmania; that is, it lost its only two House of Representatives seats and it performed poorly in the Senate.</para><para>Both of the major parties took special Tasmanian policies into the federal election. Labor included, amongst other things, a proposal to write off, with no strings attached, $150 million in Commonwealth debt which was held against the state. The coalition had previously said that that would occur if the Tasmanian people would support a proposal to privatise the Hydro-Electric Commission. That was rejected at the state election.</para><para>Another important issue that Labor took to the people was the institution of a single untimed local call zone for the state of Tasmania, which would be one of the more important initiatives for both domestic and business users to have been put to the people of Tasmania for some time. Labor also gave a commitment, if elected, to secure the Tasmanian Freight Equalisation Scheme and the Wheat Freight Subsidy Scheme in legislation. I found it curious that Liberal senators opposed these proposals on what appeared to me to be spurious grounds, stating that somehow that would cause some constitutional problem. The inquiries that I undertook revealed that no such problem really did exist. The government's package was put to the people on the basis of the goods and services tax being introduced and at least another 16 per cent of Telstra being privatised and, subject to an inquiry, the balance of Telstra. So, in essence, the government's position was to introduce a GST and to privatise Telstra.</para><para>In terms of the two-party preferred vote at a federal level, in Tasmania the outcome was that Labor received somewhere between 55 and 56 per cent of the two-party preferred vote. In Bass, the voters threw out a cabinet minister and elected Michelle O'Byrne, with a swing of just over 4Â½ per cent. In Lyons, Dick Adams was returned with a swing of over nine per cent. In Braddon, Sid 
 Sidebottom was elected with a swing of a little over 10 per centâand that was to replace a member of the Liberal Party who was a parliamentary secretary. Harry Quick was returned with an increased majority, as was Duncan Kerr.</para><para>Labor attracted 41.6 per cent of the formal primary vote, compared with the Liberal Party's 33.8 per cent. On a two-party preferred basis, Labor achieved somewhere between 55 and 54 per cent of the vote in Tasmania.</para><para>Going back to Mr Scott's article, he would also have all 12 senators from Tasmania band together to vote as a block. He argues that on the basis that this is a states house. It is a states house because it guarantees that we have equal representation with other states and, importantly, without the Senate, the smaller states would clearly be swamped by the larger states. For example, the House of Representatives has 50 members representing New South Wales and five from Tasmania. But with increasing integration of economic power, communications systems and transport networks, the work of the Senate is now far more national than state oriented.</para><para>Further, given the election results, Mr Scott's block voting proposal would require Tasmanian government senators to vote against the plans to introduce a goods and services tax and to vote against the further sale of Telstra. They would also be required to pressure Senator Alston to implement the Labor plan to have Tasmania operate as a single untimed local call zone.</para><para>Tasmania would be a much better place if government senators supported Labor's platform which was put to the people of Tasmania at the last election, but we all know that they will not do that. If one wants to know why, one only has to look at the treatment Senator Watson received earlier in the week.</para><para>Senator Watson is an astute politician with considerable expertise in tax matters. He continues to make an important contribution to debate on matters of tax and superannuation in this place. Last Sunday he expressed a view that there were problems with the 
 government's tax plan. He was quoted in the <inline font-style="italic">Launceston Examiner</inline> as saying:</para><para>On the GST, it may be necessary to have the concessions lifting the compensation for those most affected by it, because a large percentage of low income earners' costs go on the cost of living.</para><para>On Telstra he was quoted as saying:</para><para>Telstra is regarded as an icon, and the bush is concerned about the ability of Telstra in private hands to deliver its service obligations.</para><para>He said there was sufficient support in the Liberal Party to change the policy from full privatisation to the sale of only 49 per cent. He said on the ABC <inline font-style="italic">AM</inline>  program on Monday:</para><para>A wide spectrum of people, low income earners, have expressed concerns about their ability to cope and I have taken note of that.</para><para>He said the government must be seen to have a heart and a social conscience and make some adjustments. He had heard the view of Tasmanian voters about how badly the GST would affect them. In my view, he was responding to that view.</para><para>However, by lunchtime on that day he was forced to contradict his earlier remarks. He released a statementâwhich I suggest might have been released for himâstating that he had changed his mind. His revised position stated that the compensation offered by the Howard government to offset the impact of the GST was `adequate'ânote that, `adequate'; not `fair'.</para><para>Senator's Watson's <inline font-style="italic">AM</inline> position was the correct one. The GST is not fairâin fact, it is not adequateâfor low and middle income families in Australia. It is certainly not fair for families living in Tasmania. And in the interests of Tasmanian families, Labor's five representatives in the other place and five senators here plan to oppose it all the way.</para><para>Despite Mr Scott's apparent disappointment with the results in the last federal election in Tasmania, I can assure Tasmanian voters that their overwhelming endorsement of the Australian Labor Party has not been misplaced. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Federal Election</title><title>Ault, Mr Mark</title><page.no>101</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>101</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âOne year ago today I rose in this place to give my first speech and now one year later I am rising to give my first speech in the new parliament. It is good to hear a Labor senator in particular highlighting the value and importance of the upper house and the crucial role it does play in ensuring that the parliament can act as some balance against the executive and the government. I hope Senator O'Brien can convince a few more of his colleagues at state level as well as federal level of the importance of upper houses in playing that important role.</para></talk.start><para>I start by offering my congratulations to everyone involved in the recent election, particularly my own party and its leadership team, Senator Meg Lees and Senator Natasha Stott Despoja, for their efforts. The result was that we succeeded in obtaining the highest ever number of Democrat senators in this place, whom we will all gladly welcome on 1 July next year.</para><para>Congratulations are also due to all successful candidates from all parties, as well as the Independent member in the other place, and those who have subsequently gained promotion to the ministry or shadow spokesperson roles. Commiserations go to those who were unsuccessful, especially those who suffered the extra blow of losing their seats.</para><para>The main purpose of my speech today is to pay a brief tribute to a member of the Democrats who was tragically killed in July this year. It is the first opportunity I have had since that time to pay a tribute to him in this place because this is the first time we have met since that time.</para><para>I speak of the death of one of the more promising members of the Democrats in Queensland, a person called Mark Ault who was only 24 years of age. He was actually in Canberra at the conclusion of the sittings of the last parliament in early July. He was down here with many other young Democrats from around Australia attending a conference and seminar. He was among a number of young people who were creating a disturbance 
 in the gallery by applauding when the Telstra bill was surprisingly voted down at the end of that sittings.</para><para>He had participated in the conference down here and was heading back to Brisbane to take up the position of president of the Queensland Young Democrats when he was tragically killed in a car accident on the highway. Twenty-four years of age is a very young age at which to die with so many aims and hopes yet to fulfil. As with the death of any young person, losing Mark means losing the great potential he had to further enrich our lives and make the world a better place.</para><para>However, Mark's 24 years of life highlight to all of us that we do not need to be around for a very long time to make a very positive impact, because he certainly managed to do it. This is emphasised by the fact that he was around the Democrats and a part of our party for only a relatively short time, yet he had such a positive impact on all of us who had dealings with him.</para><para>As well as his involvement in the Young Australian Democrats and the position that he was about to take up as the president of that body in Queensland, he was also a candidate for us in the June state election and was employed on my staff in a relief capacity a number of times.

 The article appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline>  and is the opinion column written by Andrew Robb. For those who are not aware, Andrew Robb regularly writes for the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> . It is an opinion column. He is obviously entitled to express a view and Mr Robb was the former director of the Liberal Party.</para></talk.start><para>The basic theme of the article, which appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> on 6 October 1998, was a commentary on what he regarded as the significant amount of the money that the Labor Party was spending at that time on the election campaign and the allegation he makes about where that money was coming from.</para><para>Mr Robb claims that the amount of money being spent by the Labor Party could well hit $11 million above-the-line expenditure. He states:</para><para>Add in $3 million for research and administration costs and the Labor Party is running an unprecedented $25 million campaign, outspending the Liberal Party two-to-one.</para><para>I am sure that is not correct. I do not know the actual figures, but I am sure it is not correct. He asks the question, `Where is the money coming from?' He goes on to say:</para><para>It will be interesting to see the level of union contribution this time around. Union superannuation funds, which cornered a big part of the fledging super market under the previous Labor government, are still smarting from Coalition legislation which guaranteed a fund-of-choice option, under which employees are offered a choice of three or four funds. This competition has severely curtailed the union super funds' business prospects.</para><para>If this Coalition legislation was rolled back by a Beazley Labor government, the union funds would stand to have monopoly control over hundreds of millions more dollars of members' funds, with the union receiving, by law, a very healthy management fee.</para><para>Mr Robb was alleging that the Labor Party's campaign to a significant extent was underwritten by what he refers to as `union' superannuation funds.</para><para>Unfortunately, like a great number of members of the Liberal Party, Mr Robb has very little knowledge of superannuation and particularly the way in which superannuation law operates in this country. Mr Robb is either ill-informed, totally ignorant or deliber 
 ately misleading in this article. He cannot get the facts straight. He refers to `union' superannuation funds; there is no such thing as a union superannuation fund, despite the persistent tag put on what are called industry superannuation funds by Mr Robb and some others from the Liberal Party.</para><para>Industry superannuation funds are set up under trustee law in this country and they are required by law to have what is known as joint trusteesâan equal number of trustees from employee representatives and an equal number of trustees from employer representatives. Sometimes the employee trustees are union officials; sometimes the employer representatives are nominees of employer organisations. Quite often they are elected by the employee and employer members of the funds. We do not have union superannuation funds; we have industry superannuation funds where there are an equal number of trustees from employers and employees.</para><para>The other important aspect of superannuation that is relevant is that there has to be a majority vote. If the trustees of a superannuation fund decide to spend money, because of the equal number of trustees from employees and employers, there has to be a majority to authorise any expenditure. Mr Robb is either totally ignorant or deliberately misleading in his claim about these superannuation funds. If, in fact, any money is given from an industry superannuation fund to the Labor Party, it would require at least one employer trustee to vote with the employee trustees to authorise such expenditure.</para><para>Of course, Mr Robb's ignorance is further exemplified by his comment that I referred to earlier where he said:</para><para>Union superannuation funds . . . are still smarting from Coalition legislation which guaranteed a fund-of-choice option . . . </para><para>I will not go into the arguments for and against so-called fund-of-choice, which is effectively deregulation with a number of horrific consequences. But the fact is that the legislation he is referring to has not passed into law yet. Mr Robb is claiming that these so-called `union' funds were upset at this legislation and it has not passed into law. He goes on to say:</para><para>If this Coalition legislation was rolled back by a Beazley Labor government . . . </para><para>It is not even law yet, so he obviously did not know what he was talking about.</para><para>Mr Robb goes on to say that the union funds would stand to have monopoly control over hundreds of millions more dollars of members' funds, with the union receiving, by law, a very healthy management fee. That is just totally untrue. We cannot use the word `lie' in this chamber. Under superannuation law in this country, the joint trusteesâthe employer and unionâare required by law to tender out the contracts for the management and investment of the funds. To my knowledge there are very few complaints, if any, about this processâits probity, its correctness. You do not have monies passing from members' superannuation accounts back to the union, yet here he is alleging that that is the system that exists in this country.</para><para>So the three central issues that I have dealt with in my contribution today were untrue claims by Mr Robb. As I said when I began, he is entitled to editorialiseâit is an opinion columnâbut he should at least get his facts correct. He is like a significant number of members and senators of this government who simply do not know a great deal about superannuation. What little they do know is based on some sort of ideological objection to superannuation and Australians having decent retirement incomes.</para><para>This article is grossly misleading. I will be interested to have a look at the election expenditure returns for respective political parties. I would be surprised if any money came from industry superannuation funds to the Labor Party. There may be some, but I would be surprised if there was any. Certainly I would be very confident that it would not add up to anywhere near $25 million or even one per cent of that.</para><para>The irony of this article is that Mr Robb allegesâwith no facts to support his claimâthat monies were going from superannuation funds to the Labor Party to finance the election campaign. In fact, the Liberal Party had just received $15.7 million, I thinkâand it is going to go higherâof taxpayers' money to fund the advertising campaign associated with 
 its tax reform program. We had a debate about that in the Senate yesterday. That was the most blatant misuse of an advertising campaign that Australia has ever seen, with funds coming from the taxpayer. That would have been a more appropriate issue for Mr Robb to deal with in his column. Of course, I suppose he has got such a tinge of bias: he was the national director of the Liberal Party.</para><para>Mr Robb may have an excuse about his claims in respect of superannuation. I can only assume that Mr Robb was somewhat confused, taken aback, bemused and worried. He probably had just received his superannuation tax assessment or superannuation surcharge. I think that is probably Mr Robb's only excuse for such an appalling lack of knowledge of superannuation. Certainly those who have received the superannuation tax assessment notices have been struck by this new 15 per cent superannuation tax.</para><para>The new 15 per cent superannuation taxâmuch has been said about it in the last few years and much more will be said about it over the next few yearsâthat Mr Costello introduced was in direct contravention of the guarantee not to increase existing taxes that Mr Costello or Mr Howard gave to the Australian people in 1996. What did they do? They introduced an increase in the superannuation tax. As I have said, much has been said about this superannuation tax and much more will be said about it over the coming months and years. I think that can be Mr Robb's only excuse for why he has such a befuddled, ignorant attitude towards superannuation and the way it operates in this country. He must have been shocked and horrified by that superannuation tax assessment notice he would have received. It has somewhat thrown him off the track.</para><para>In conclusion, Mr Robb's three central arguments do not have basis in fact. They are grossly incorrect, untrue and misleading. I noticed that in his last paragraph he said he spent a few days on business in London. I understand that Mr Robb does some consultancy work. I have to urge the financial sector of this country to never consider Mr Robb as a consultant to your industry. Given his abysmal lack of knowledge of the operation 
 of superannuation in this country, you could never have any confidence that Mr Robb, as a consultant, would have any idea what he is talking about in representing financial institutions in regard to superannuation issues in this country.</para><para>It was very disappointing to see this article from Mr Robb. He really does owe an apology to the industry superannuation funds which were very unfairly besmirched in this way. It will be interesting to see the financial returns for contributions to political parties and how much, if any, was contributed by industry superannuation funds to the Labor Party's election campaign.</para><para>Industry superannuation funds in this country are cost effective and have given a very good return to their members. To my knowledge there is little, if any, difficulty with those funds, and I think they serve the interests of Australian's future retirement incomes very well indeed.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Armistice Day</title><page.no>104</page.no></subdebateinfo></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Education: Teaching of History</title><page.no>104</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>104</page.no><name role="metadata">Quirke, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator QUIRKE</name><name.id>ZS6</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âToday is 11 NovemberâArmistice Dayâand some 2Â½ hours ago in here we recognised that fact, as indeed we should. I think it is appropriate to make a few remarks with respect to this very important occasion.</para></talk.start><para>I note with a great deal of interest that Premier Carr and other leaders in Australia have all welcomed the fact that today we are starting to recognise the past and the part played by our armed forces, particularly in the 1914-18 war. I find that somewhat of a contradiction, however, because state education authorities around Australia have just about wiped out the teaching of history as a discipline. Indeed, most of the state high schools and a large number of private high schools now teach hybrid subjects. I can clearly explain the reasons for that. They were put to me by my deputy in a high school some 25 years ago. He told me it was easier to get hold of X number of teachers and X number of classes and tell them to teach whatever they want. So the idea that history as a discipline in particular would be taught with some cognitive levels at every stage 
 from primary school through to senior high school was a casualty of that particular concept of bureaucratic organisation.</para><para>I never took that threat all that seriously because I never thought anyone would seriously do that. But, sadly, I stand here today and say that that in fact is now the norm. That unfortunately is what has happened in almost every state. As a consequence, although events such as the one today that we are recognisingâthe importance of Armistice Dayâare now much more in the community's eye and much more in the eye of the leaders in our community, sadly the most important building block of that is now missingâin our schools.</para><para>I want to speak about this matter because it seems to me that a country such as Australia, that has only a handful of very significant dates in its past, needs to come to grips with these issues in its education system. These events are at least as important as many of the other things that we put in our curriculum. They are important for the future citizens of this country. They are events that need to be recorded. They are events that need to be retold to the students in our schools. They are events that, unless we take up the challenge, will disappear into obscurity.</para><para>This will be particularly so when the last of the diggers from the 1914-18 war are gone. From media reports today, I note that there are something of the order of 66 veterans left. During the course of the estimates hearings last year I asked the Department of Veterans' Affairs what the number in Australia was at that point. That was in Novemberâaround this timeâlast year. The answer was 133. So 1997-98 has been a particularly unkind year to the veterans of the 1914-18 war. I also note the passing earlier this year of the last of the veterans who landed at Gallipoli on 25 April. Sadly, what will happen over the next few years is that our direct connection with these events will disappear.</para><para>The purpose of my address here today is not to say that there ought to be more history taught in schools, that it ought to be consequential history or that we need to look at our school curriculumsâI think that is very important and significantâbut to honour 
 Armistice Day itself. On 11 November, the armistice came very much as a surprise not only in Australia but also in all the belligerent countries. The events of the preceding five or six weeks indicated that the war would end soon. Indeed, the war in many theatresâthe war in Mesopotamia, the war in the Middle East, the war against Austriaâended before 11 November.</para><para>The significance of 11 November cannot, in my view, be overstated. Not all of the guns fell silent on the Western Front at 11 a.m. on 11 November. In the American sector the fighting continued for well over two hours. In fact, the last man killed was Phillip Adams, a corporal in the American Army. He was killed some two hours and 11 minutes after the armistice. There was news of other casualties coming in as the church bells in England and in other countries were ringing to announce the armistice. What came to an end on 11 November was something that for a generation, and indeed probably for several generations, would be remembered as the Great War.</para><para>It would also be remembered as the foulest war that Australian soldiers had ever gone into. In fact, of the 330,000 Australian soldiers who went to this warâout of a population of only 4Â½ million at that timeâsome 58,000 would never come back. Of those who did come back, about 120,000 suffered injuries, to varying degrees. All of the soldiers who went overseas during that particular period carried other scars that we today recognise.</para><para>We are, as a community, much more sympathetic now to things such as battle fatigue. We are much more sympathetic to the horrors that these peopleâmen and womenâwent through. One group that is quite often forgotten in this whole exercise is the many women who served, particularly in the 1914-18 war. They served in different capacitiesâusually in medical capacities, but they served nonetheless. These people saw sights that none of us in our lifetime will ever see. These people worked under the most horrific of conditionsâthroughout the whole of the 1914-18 conflict in particularâand they 
 carried the scars literally all the way to their graves.</para><para>Now, as a community, we look back on some of the events that have taken place. In the media during this week we have had comments about VC recipients who were charged. One person was charged with desertion after a particularly horrible period of battle when he apparently snapped. He was sentenced to a period of imprisonment. I think it is appropriate for us to say, as a community, that we need to remember today the suffering of these men and women who fought in the 1914-18 war and, indeed, in other wars.</para><para>We need to make a clear statement that we, as a country, owe them a great deal. We recognise what they went through. We also recognise what their families went through when these people came home. I think that quite often is forgotten. These men and, in many instances, women, came home to what was a normal life in societies in Australia, Britain, the United States and the other countries that were involved in these conflicts. When they came home their family life was resumed. Some of them resumed duties as fathers and some as mothers; some of them went on to have more children. They carried with them the scars of events they could never talk about. I think it is good that our communityâand in particular my generation, which has not had to suffer this level of terrible conflictâis now recognising this.</para><para>It is beyond the scope of my address here today to go to the various events in the 1914-18 war that Australian soldiers participated in. But I think it is sufficient to say that, apart from Gallipoli, which is the focal point of our 25 April celebrations every year, the Australian Army participated in all of the major onslaughts on the Western Front, and it played a pivotal role in the Middle East in the Palestine campaign.</para><para>Certainly, the five Australian divisions that were present in Western Europe were used as the shock troops, and starting in the middle of July 1916 that was the role that they would play all the way up to Armistice Day. The battle of Passchendaele, the battles on the Somme and the great offensives of the Ger 
 man Army in 1918 all saw the Australian soldiers, with their determined will, hold the enemy or advance against tremendous odds. It saw the Australian soldiers whittled down in numbers and those five divisions run down considerably.</para><para>By the end of the war, the Australian Army had suffered, per head of population, enormous casualtiesâcasualties much greater than any of the other combatants in the Commonwealth forces. They did not suffer more casualties than the British, but they did suffer more per head of population. One of the reasons for the level of casualties is that the soldiers themselves fought so well that they were used time and time again as shock troops.</para><para>I think, after 80 years now, it is important for us to look back with a fresh vision on these days. I think it is important to raise some of the questions that have been raised this week. I commend the various media outlets that have given so much of their time today in the various newspapers around this country to recognise the enormous contributions that these men and women made, and to point out to the community the importance of 11 November.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Sitting suspended from 1.42 p.m. to 2.00 p.m.</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS</title><type>Ministerial Arrangements</type><page.no>106</page.no></debateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>106</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âby leaveâI inform the Senate that Senator Robert Hill, Minister for Environment and Heritage, will be absent from the Senate chamber for question time today and tomorrow, 11 and 12 November.

One party, the coalition, was out there selling policies that were in Australia's best interests; the Labor Party was out there selling a scare campaign, which failed monumentally. As Senator Boswell very rightly points out, not only did the approach that we took to economic management stand us in very good stead; it has shielded us from the Asian crisis. Every country in the region, outside of Australia and China, is in recession. As a result of our commitment to sensible economic management, we continue to enjoy strong economic growth, low inflation, record low interest rates and strong employment growth. Indeed, preliminary figures released today by the Australian Bureau of Statistics show that the economy grew by a revised 4.4 per cent in 1997-98, up from the four per cent rate previously reported.

The government went to the election with a proposal for a bold tax reform program that is in the interests of the Australian economy and the Australian community. It is really the biggest tax plan that has been put forward in this country certainly since the 1950s. It changes the whole structure of personal taxation, indirect taxation, business taxation and tax administration in this country.</para></talk.start><para>The polls showed that the Australian people agreed that tax reform was necessary, that it was good for the nation and that it was good for them individually. The Australian people embraced tax reform and gave the government a mandate to deliver a new tax system for the new century. This was achieved despite Labor's very dishonest campaign against the tax reform plan.</para><para>Our plan will create much stronger incentives to work by cutting marginal tax rates and by reducing taper rates at which social security and family benefits are withdrawn. The GST will allow the abolition of the wholesale sales tax system, which we do not support but which the Labor Party apparently does, and a range of other state taxes and charges. It will allow fuel costs for business to be significantly reduced. It will recognise the costs of raising a family and provide substantial encouragement for people to take out private health cover. It will provide a sure 
 footing for state governments, which deliver critical infrastructure to our community.</para><para>The Australian community voted in favour of tax reform to be delivered by 1 July 2000.

What we are seeing is an attempt by the Labor Party to defeat in this chamber tax reform which it could not defeat in the election. As I said, tax reform was the central issue.

Thank God for Mark Latham!</para><para>We have a situation where the current tax system has become one of Labor's great sacred cows. It was not always the case, of course. When Emperor Keating was in charge of the Treasury, he did agree and understand that the tax system was a sacred cow that had to be blown away. I seem to recall that the current leader, Mr Beazley, agreed with him. But now they are in opposition, and now they retreat to defending the old economy and the old welfare state. When Labor went to the election, their idea of tax reform that they put to the Australian people was, `Let's have a retrospective tax on capital gains.' Terrific! `Let's put a new tax on four-wheel drives.' What a brilliant policy! Who was the political genius who dreamed that up? I understand the New South Wales Right has a hunting party out to find them. I wish you luck, because we were staggered when you came out with that policy.</para><para>We have a Labor Party that is defendingâand a coalition party that is going to overturnâa tax system that resulted in the recent completion of a court case in the Federal Court that took 2Â½ years to work out whether frozen yoghurt for the purposes of the tax system should be classified as yoghurt, which is tax free, or ice-cream, which has a tax on it. They took 2Â½ years to work out what to do with frozen yoghurt. In the end I think they 
 said, `Well, if the frozen yoghurt tastes like ice-cream, it should be taxed as ice-cream. But, if it doesn't, then it is tax free and it will be counted as yoghurt.' That is what the Labor Party is defending. That is what we want to get rid of.</para><para>The people on 3 October rejected your position on tax.

There is only one real answer to lowering unemployment, and that is getting an internationally competitive business sector in Australia. That is how you create sustainable jobs. The way you do that is by reducing the tax burden on business, and that is what our plan does.</para><para>Labor ran around during the election campaign saying, `We have a target of five per cent unemployment.' Where was the substance? They did not have one policy that would have resulted in a reduction in unemployment. We do. We have a tax plan which will take the burden off business and enable business to create jobs. Our plan will take $10 billion off the cost of doing business in this country, and that must lead to the capacity to create more jobs. It will also take $4Â½ billion off the cost of Australian exports.</para><para>You run around saying that you are all for helping business, helping manufacturing and helping exports. But, when it comes to the crunch, you are going to come in here and vote against a tax plan that will take $10 billion off the cost of doing business in this country.

But it has to mean that business will have a capacity to create more jobs, particularly in the context of our plans for further economic reform and further liberalisation of industrial relations.

It means that Australia will be well and truly pulling its weight at an international level. It is the case that achieving an eight per cent targetâgetting it down to just eight per cent above 1990 levelsâis a big challenge for Australia, and one that will require a commitment and action by all levels of government and the community. We are committed to meeting that target. We have 
 recognised our responsibility to translate international efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions into domestic policy.

If there is one clear divide in social policy in this country it is the silence, effectively, from the ALP on good policy for Australia's families and the big focus on good social policy for Australia's families from the government, including the tax reform policyâbut not only the tax reform policy. It is important that Australians are reminded, in the light of the misinformation that has been put about by the opposition, and particularly by Jenny Macklin, as I recall, that families will benefit from tax reform in a number of ways, including a reduction in marginal tax rates and an increase in the tax-free threshold from $5,400 to $6,000. Every family under $50,000 will have a top marginal tax rate of no more than 30 per centâa huge improvement on existing rates. Eighty-one per cent of the taxpayers of Australia will have a top marginal tax of no more than 30 per cent. That is a huge improvement on existing rates.</para></talk.start><para>The existing $1 billion family tax initiative which the government introduced after the 1996 election is going to be expanded uponâand remember, there will be $13 billion worth of tax cuts and $2.4 billion worth of increases in family payments, all that money largely focused on people with families. The family tax initiative will be doubled, with an increase in the tax-free threshold for families with children under the age of five up to $13,000. In fact, they will not be paying tax until their 
 income exceeds $13,000. That is at a  cost of more than $2 billion in the year 2000-2001. It means that families will receive an increase in assistance of at least $140 a year, a 70 per cent increase, for each dependent child. Single income families, including sole parents, with a youngest child aged under five will receive an additional $350 a year, also a 70 per cent increase. A family with a youngest child aged between five and 16 will receive an additional $61 a year.</para><para>There will be a substantial easing of the income test for family assistance, and an increase in the amount of assistance directed at families with children through an increase in the level of income at which assistance begins to be income tested from the current $24,350 a year for one child to $28,200 a year. There will be a reduction in the income test taper from 50 per cent to 30 per cent for families, and the transition for women to go from home to work will be considerably eased because of that relaxation of the taper. Anybody who understands these mattersâACOSS particularly soârecognises that that change to the family payments system and the taper rate will make that transition very much easier.</para><para>In addition, there will be a 30 per cent rebate from private health insurance contributions, once again very important for Australia's families. Just the very establishment of a department of state for family and community services, with the bringing together of programs across several portfolios, demonstrates this government's serious efforts to develop good policy for Australia's families. When you think back to the debacle of Senator Crowley and her International Year of the Family, which did not get going until halfway through the year, you realise that there is a big contrast between the focus of this government and the entire forgetfulness of the previous government.

He also would have delivered bipartisan support to a review of the rules surrounding the use of government advertising, and that is something that the Auditor-General has called for. He also would have rejected the tainted vote of Senator Colston. Why? Because Mr Howard and his government desperately need to reassert some standards in the conduct of this soiled and sorry government he leads.</para><para>Think of the breach of standards, Madam Deputy President. In 1995 Mr Howard as then opposition leader promised to review the rules surrounding government advertising as soon as he got into government. Of course political amnesia set in for Mr Howard. He and Senator Minchin proceeded to bend the rules so massively with their $17 million advertising rort just before the last election that the Auditor-General is now calling for new rules in this area. That was an unprecedented abuse by Mr Howard and his government and an unprecedented misuse of public money to promote an election policy, not an operating program of government, in that way.</para><para>In 1996 Mr Howard tabled a code of conduct allegedly to keep his ministers honest. From that time onwards it was flagrantly disregarded to the point that Senator Parer had to be retrospectively scalped in the beginning of this parliament. The rules, according to Mr Howard, became guidelines, not a death 
 sentence. It was a code that was never enforced. So much for his standards.</para><para>Another breach of standards was the decision that Mr Howard made in 1997 to reject the vote of Senator Colston. That was not because of the fraud investigation, according to Mr Howard, but because `he had to assert standards'âstandards of government, standards of parliament. But when he saw the GST looking endangered because of the proper decision he was forced to take back in 1997, he ditched that decision, he ditched that approach, in the interests of political expediency. There was no mention of it before or during the election campaign we have just had. That in itself was a most underhand and deceitful way for Mr Howard to deal with this issue.</para><para>In the recent election campaign, the Howard government showed the same disregard for principle and convention, this time with regard to caretaker conventions. It was okay to observe them, as we know from question time today, in relation to somewhat more trivial issues, but as soon as the government decided to milk the Victorian gas crisis for political advantage the caretaker conventions were thrown out the windowâanother very serious breach of standards by this government and this Prime Minister. That is the pattern of John Howard. He is forever espousing standards to all who will listen, always espousing principle and the high moral ground but yielding to political expediency whenever he can, whenever the pressure mountsârort the system, throw the rule book out the window, breach the conventions standards.</para><para>But what does he do it for? His own cheap political gain. This government is a moral vacuum and it is because of Mr Howard and his approach to parliamentary and ministerial standards. The centre of that moral and political vacuum is the Prime Minister himself, Mr Howard. He stands condemned for his continued breach of parliamentary and ministerial standards. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>121</page.no><name role="metadata">Crane, Sen Winston</name><name role="display">Senator CRANE</name><name.id>UW4</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise, too, to speak on this issue.

In relation to the Auditor-General's report, the opposition claimed that the government had breached the guidelines. The report makes it clear that the opposition's claims are absolutely false. The government notes that the guidelines were in place under the former Labor government, which had ample opportunity to change them if they considered them inadequate. Why didn't you change them if you now come in here bleating that they are inadequate and not doing the job?</para><para>You have to look very closely at yourselves, your own particular performances and how you have conducted yourselves. The Department of Finance and Administration considers that the current arrangements are adequate and appropriate. The government will carefully consider the ANAO report and respond if necessary. How different to the Labor Party's position and approach in New South Wales. If we talk about expenditure in terms of promoting good policyâand I do not believe that a lot of the policy of the previous government was good policy; in fact, it failed, it collapsedâwe find that the Keating government spent $315.5 million on advertising and market research over a five-year period from 1991 to 1996.</para><para>Contrast that figure with the small amount of money that this government spent on informing the Australian public about the importance of tax reformâtax reform that will deliver enormous benefits to the Australian economy, tax reform that will give us an internationally competitive tax system, tax reform that will take the shackles off export industries in this country.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>RF4</name.id><name role="metadata">COOK</name><name role="display">Senator Cook</name></talker><para>âLiberal Party policy.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>UW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Crane, Sen Winston</name><name role="display">Senator CRANE</name></talker><para>âI note the interjection from Senator Cook, a West Australian.

One of the pillars of the Westminster system is the caretaker provisionsâthat is, when a government calls an election the government of the country is put in caretaker mode. From then on, the government makes no more decisions to govern the country, and the Public Service manages the show until the people decide who the incoming government will be. If issues arise during a caretaker period that require government decision making, then the government consults with the alternative government and makes a joint decision about what will be done. That is a fundamental pillar of the Westminster system in order to ensure that things are done fairly and properly. It is a tradition of our democracy. It is guaranteed by the Public Service, which is neutral and oversees the operations of the Westminster system.</para></talk.start><para>During the last election period, the caretaker provisions were given real purpose.

He took specific government action in the case of the Victorian gas crisis on the eve of the election in order to buy votes.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Why do the caretaker provisions exist? To prevent governments using the exchequer to buy votes during an election campaign. That is what Mr Howard did.

Because it would have meant that both he and the Leader of the Opposition would have announced relief to Victorians in the gas crisis. He wanted to best the opposition, make a shallow political point, and nothing would stand between him and trying to win a few extra votesâcertainly not the traditions of democracy in the Westminster system, certainly not the traditions of democracy in this country.</para><para>This underscores a profound point. When it comes to traditions and conventions that make our democracy effective, the Liberals will break them every time.

He has sought to present himself as a person of greater moral integrity, a man of great compassion; a man who, once again, would provide this country with a higher level of ethical standards.</para><para>What we have noticed, however, is that all of those claims were made against a backdrop of an election campaign which highlighted the very opposite in this government's behaviour. We saw the calling of that election in an attempt to prevent proper parliamentary scrutiny of one of the most major changes to the taxation system that a government has ever proposed. We saw the calling of that election after the government had committed $17 million of public funding to an advertising campaign which was clearly partisan in its 
 intent and aimed at supporting the government's claims in that election campaign itself.</para><para>We saw the announcement of the blatant bribes to Tasmania: $150 million in support of the Tasmanian branch of the Liberal Party in its election campaign. We saw the commitment of $48 millionâa total of $48 millionâin public advertising in a whole range of departments, from employment to the environment, across the government. We saw a massive breach of privacy as a result of the government's use of agencies such as Centrelink to send out what was clearly government propaganda in support of its tax measures and in seeking to use the pensioners of this country in such a way as to garner political support for this government.</para><para>We saw clear breaches of the conventions of the caretaker period that has been in operation in this country since the Second World Warâand, with the exception of 1975, those conventions have been very largely uncontroversial. These are measures that, of course, under Menzies would have been seen as established political practiceâand we have seen them go without comment. Although they had no legal standing, they had been accepted by all sides. But under this government, questions on these measures have been raised in such a way as to bring them into political dispute.</para><para>We do not see the same sorts of standards as were exercised by Menzies being exercised by this government. Just as we have seen this government turn its back on the great ideological traditions of Deakin and of liberalism in this country, we see now the moral standards of Menzies being abandoned by this Prime Minister. I can understand, therefore, that while there would be many Australians who do feel that this government has abused its political authority, has brought into question its political integrity, has used Public Servants for narrow political purposesâ<inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>125</page.no><name role="metadata">Eggleston, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">Senator EGGLESTON</name><name.id>4L6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âSitting here listening to the opposition speakers this afternoon, I am struck by the total hypocrisy of the opposition in the Senate, and particularly of its leader,

What Senator Faulkner raised earlier, and has now raised again, is the question of the government using Senator Colston's vote.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I would like to just cast the minds of senators back to the last day of the last sitting when the sale of Telstra was under discussion. Many members of the ALP on the opposite sideâespecially Senator Quirke, as I recallâspent the afternoon in vicious and vindictive attacks on Senator Colston. But then, when it came to the vote and Senator Colston voted with them, they did not reject his vote; they quite happily accepted it and saw the legislation defeated.</para><para>Then we go to the Parer affair, so-called, which has been referred to by Senator Faulkner this afternoon. For week upon week the ALP, under Senator Faulkner's leadership, muckraked and sought to find something wrong with what Senator Parer had done with his family financial affairs. They had abso 
 lutely no luck in finding anything at all there. But the ALP mercilessly attacked Senator Parer and his family, even though, as I have said, there was no substance at all found in any allegations of impropriety about Senator Parer and his family. But was there an apology? No, there was not. If that is not a matter which concerns standards, I wonder what is.</para><para>Lastly, we have the question of the Baillieu family of Melbourne. Senator Faulkner will remember this, I am sure. When the Natural Heritage Trust Fund issue was raised, Senator Faulkner spent a lot of time viciously attacking the Baillieu family of Melbourneâand one of its members in particular. But, when it was pointed out to Senator Faulkner that the individual concerned had been deceased for 20 or 30 years and could not possibly have held an interest in the company that he was going on about, there was never an apologyânever an apology to the Baillieu family of Melbourne, in spite of one of the most disgusting episodes, I am sure, that this Senate has ever witnessed of an attack on an individual. So how Senator Faulkner can possibly talk about standards, I do not know. He certainly is not an example that I would want to quote or follow, having mentioned these three cases.</para><para>I would like to turn to the comments of Senators Cook and Carr who talked about the use of government advertising by the Howard government in relation to the taxation package before the election was called. I think the use of government advertising to explain government policy is quite legitimate; and it would seem that the Keating government thought so too, because the Keating government spent $315.5 million on advertising and market research over a five-year period, from 1991 to 1996âand that was government money.</para><para>Altogether over their 13-year period the Hawke and Keating governments spent more than $675 million of government money on so-called political advertising for the government, if that is what explaining government policy is. I will give some details of it. There was $9 million spent to promote Working Nation. The campaign ran until the 1996 election was called. There was $7 million spent between 1992 and 1993 on the superan 
 nuation guarantee campaign. There was $10 million spent in 1995 on the superannuation community education campaign. If that does not demonstrate hypocrisy, what does? <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Eggleston, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>âOrder!

Furthermore the Government has 
 failed to provide pork producers with an adequate restructuring and funding support package, without which the local industry is stranded.

The major provisions in the Bill will be to:</para><para>.	 include a wider range of income when assessing how much child support should be paid and also using, wherever possible, more up to date income information in assessments;</para><para>.	 allow parents to move from the Child Support Agency collection to private collection by agreement at any time and also require parents to undertake private collection where there is a consistent payment record, but providing a safety net if the private payment arrangements subsequently fail;</para><para>.	 allow carers in receipt of social security payments to end a child support assessment where there is a threat of family violence;</para><para>.	 change the assessment process to improve client perceptions of flexibility and equity, by modifying the exempted income and disregarded income figures used in the child support formula, allowing liable parents to apply for a child support assessment, providing for internal review of decisions by the Registrar, allowing parents to verbally notify changes which affect assessments and enhancing the procedures in relation to applications for departure from administrative assessment;</para><para>.	 protect client's right to privacy, by limiting information about dependent children in assessment notices;</para><para>.	 enhance collection arrangements by allowing more flexibility in payments, offsetting debts between parents, and allowing deductions to be made from a payer's social security pension or benefit;</para><para>.	 provide greater certainty in payments of child support by giving effect to a change in circumstances only from the date notified, allowing payments to be held temporarily in trust if court action is pending over acceptance of application, and providing that the start date of liability for child support is the date of application;</para><para>.	 make arrangements for direct payments in lieu of child support more flexible, allowing payers more choice in the form in which child support is paid by them while protecting payees and meeting the basic needs for children;</para><para>.	 ensure all parents contribute to the financial support of their children by introducing a minimum annual payment of $260 and recognise 
 the cost of second families by changing the family payment income test for payers with subsequent families;</para><para>.	 change the effect of care arrangements or assessments by extending the major substantial care provisions in assessments where parents agree, basing assessments on both factual and lawful care of the child, treating a step child as a relevant dependent child if a court has ordered a duty to maintain, extending child support to the end of the school year for a child who turns 18; and</para><para>.	 allow the Registrar to reject an income estimate which he considers inaccurate and extend the latest date an income estimate can be lodged from 30 June to 31 July.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Reasons for the urgency requiring introduction and passage of the Bill</inline></para><para>The Bill will give effect to major reforms which the Government announced on 30 September 1997 to improve the Child Support Scheme's flexibility, to provide greater equity and to ensure more regular financial support for children.</para><para>Delays in introduction of the proposed amendments may mean the loss of some of the benefits to be gained from the reforms. All but three of the amendments were initially to have a commencement day of 1 July 1998. The remaining amendments were to commence from 1 January 1999 or 1 July 1999. The Child Support Agency will begin issuing assessments for the 1999-2000 child support year from March-April 1999. Many of the reforms impact significantly on the assessments that will issue. It is essential, therefore, that the Bill receives early passage to ensure that, if Parliament amends any of its provisions, the Child Support Agency is able to give adequate notice to all affected clients of possible changes to amounts payable prior to the commencement date of the legislation.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Result if the proposed Bills are not dealt with in the Autumn Sittings:</inline></para><para>Delay in introduction of the Bill is likely to attract criticism of the Government. Delays in issuing assessments to clients cause anxiety and uncertainty for clients and will mean that different legislative requirements apply to different parts of the child support year. This will mean considerable confusion to clients every time there is a change in their circumstances causing a variation to their assessment.</para><para>STATES GRANTS (PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOL EDUCATION ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL</para><para>The purpose of the proposed bill is to seek changes to the State Grants (Primary and Secondary Educa 
 tion Assistance) Act 1996 (the Act) to provide funding for the introduction of Full Service Schools and the extension of funding for the National Asian Languages and Studies in Australian Schools (NALSAS) strategy, both of which were announced in the Budget.</para><para>It is also necessary to include funding amounts for the Capital Grants Programme for 2001 to 2003. Capital funding is approved up to 2 years ahead of the current programme year. The Act contains a footnote stating that the amounts for the years after 2000 will be inserted by later amending Acts as these figures become available. The figures for the Capital Grants Programme for 2001 to 2003 are now available. Insertion of these figures into the Act is essential to finalise schools' planning of capital projects in 2001.</para><para>There are also a number of non-controversial amendments to the Act which have been consolidated in this Bill. The first is an amendment which will allow the Minister to vary funding allocations provided to State and Territory government and non-government education authorities under the Commonwealth's Literacy and Country Areas programmes so that 1996 Census data can be taken into account when allocating 1999 funding on a needs basis. Education authorities are expecting this change to occur.</para><para>A further amendment will allow for the updating of all funding amounts shown in the Act from 1997 initial prices to 1998 final prices. Unless this is done, funding amounts for Full Service Schools, NALSAS, and the Capital Grants Programme for 2001 will be on a different cost basis. It will also incorporate the effect of 1997 and 1998 supplementation and will mean that all funding amounts in the Act have been calculated on a consistent basis and are comparable.</para><para>Finally, there is a technical amendment to section 72(1)(a) of the Act to add the words "or in connection with" in regard to special education funding of non-government centres to allow the full range of special education services to be provided under the legislation. These words were inadvertently omitted in the drafting of the Act.</para><para>If the Bill is not dealt with in the Spring sitting the implementation of Full Service Schools will be seriously delayed, expenditure on the NALSAS strategy will be disrupted and the Capital Grants Programme will be unable to commit funding to approved projects with building stages in 2001.</para><para>The Full Service Schools initiative will provide additional support to schools to develop innovative programmes and services which address the specific needs of young people returning to school following changes to the Youth Allowance and of current students who are at risk of not completing Year 12 
 or not making a successful transition from school to work. Delay in passage of the amendment could have an adverse impact on eligible young people.</para><para>It is highly desirable that the NALSAS strategy continue with minimal disruption. The delay in the passing of the Bill has meant that additional funding included for 1998 in the original Bill will instead be allocated to 1999 in the current Bill. Hence 1998 funding has decreased by 40 per cent rather than being maintained at 1997 levels.

The Government intended that the legislation take effect from 1 July 1998 to enable appropriate regulation of significant radiation and nuclear activity. The Bills were passed by the House of Representatives.</para><para>There continues to be an urgent need for this legislation to be passed as soon as possible for the following reasons:</para><para>.	 Preliminary work on the new Lucas Heights nuclear reactor is proceeding in the absence of comprehensive regulatory control. This may generate significant community concern (ministers will have to take decisions about aspects of the reactor in the absence of the new regulatory framework) and the tendering process to build the reactor will not reflect the health and safety requirements of the new regime.</para><para>.	 The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has made recommendations about the regulatory processes for a new reactor and stressed the importance of ARPANSA providing comprehensive oversight and having the capacity and sanctions to enforce its decisions.</para><para>.	 The Government decision concerning the siting of Australia's low level radioactive waste repository is scheduled to be made by end 1998, by which time the community and the construction contractors must be assured of independent regulatory oversight.</para><para>.	 Australia is due to sign the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management in November 1998, by which time we need a 
 regulatory process in place which would deliver on our commitments under this convention.</para><para>The effect if the Bills are not dealt with in one sitting:</para><para>.	 Signing the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management will be delayed.</para><para>.	 If passage and implementation of the Bills are effectively delayed until mid 1999:</para><para>	 decisions about proceeding with the replacement reactor and the waste repository will have to be taken in the absence of a legislatively established safety framework.</para><para>(Circulated with the authority of the Minister for Health and Family Services)</para><para>STATEMENT OF REASONS FOR INTRODUCTION AND PASSAGE IN THE 1998 SPRING SITTINGS</para><para>STATES GRANTS (GENERAL PURPOSES) AMENDMENT BILL</para><para>The States Grants (General Purposes) Amendment Bill will give effect to arrangements for the payment of general revenue assistance in 1998-99, in accordance with the Commonwealth's Offer at the 1998 Premiers' Conference, and revenue replacement payments to the States and Territories in 1998-99.</para><para>Commonwealth payments of general revenue assistance and revenue replacement payments are expected to total around $23.5 billion in 1998-99. States and Territories are dependent on these payments to fund essential services so early passage of the Bill will provide greater funding certainty for the States and Territories. If passage is delayed and the Bill is not in operation before December 1998, around $450 million per week would not be paid to the States and Territories.</para><para>(Circulated by authority of the Treasurer)</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Telstra: Sell-down</title><page.no>137</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>137</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator MARK BISHOP</name><name.id>2L6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI give notice that, on the next day of sitting, I shall move:</para></talk.start><para>That the Senateâ</para><para>(a)	 opposes any further sell-down of Telstra because of the grave risks such a sell-down would have on:</para><para>	 (i)	 access to advanced communications services,</para><para>	 (ii)	 service availability, quality and price,</para><para>	 (iii)	 public finances,</para><para>	 (iv)	 foreign ownership,

 5,000 jobs from Centrelink for a number of reasons. This decision impacts on a number of levels. First of all there is the sheer loss of 5,000 jobs from the public sector and what that means for those persons who are leaving and those remaining and, more importantly and more the centre of our focus today, what it means for the service provided by Centrelink to the over six million clients of Centrelink in Australia. We feel that this decision ought to be reversed by the government because it will downgrade further the services provided by Centrelink, the essential services that are required by Australian citizens.</para><para>There is nothing more indicative of the government's approach than that the first major announcement since they came back into power is that another 5,000 jobs are to be lostâ5,000 more jobs lost as a direct result of government policy. This is a decision that means fewer services to those in need in our communityâfewer services for people with disabilities, fewer services for the aged, fewer services for the unemployed and fewer services for families with young children. John Howard said that this would be a new government, but quite clearly it is the same old government with the same old policies.</para><para>At the core of the Centrelink announcement is the government cutting funding for essential services. This is just another budget cut. During the announcement the other day, the government tried to dress it up as part of Centrelink's revamping of its servicing operation. It is absolutely nothing of the sort. There are parallel developments going on in Centrelink about the way they do business and I am happy to debate those on another day. The government has attempted to use Centrelink's announcement of its plans in that regard to hide the fact that the budget cuts introduced in 1997-98 are flowing through to Centrelink now.</para><para>Centrelink has been forced to make decisions about its operation based on the government taking 10 per cent off its revenue. Centrelink has had 10 per cent slashed off its revenue. The announced cutting of about 5,000 jobs in Centrelink is a direct result of those budget cuts. It has nothing to do with 
 new servicing requirements or the new customer service delivery model. That is a parallel development. This is about the 1997-98 budget cuts flowing through.</para><para>Centrelink had agreed with the Department of Finance and Administration that:</para><para>. . . in addition to the 1 percent efficiency dividend applied to all Government agencies, it will improve efficiency by 10 per cent by 1999-2,000. Centrelink will undertake a range of initiatives to enable these efficiencies to be realised.</para><para>It is great Public Service speak. `Efficiency' means job cuts. It means Centrelink gets 10 per cent less to fund its services. It means $149 million less per year to fund services.</para><para>What does Centrelink do? Centrelink provides services to people who receive social security payments in Australia. It is a people organisation. So if you cut its budget by $149 million a year, if you cut its budget by 10 per cent, what is its only alternative? What is the only thing it can do to meet that reduced funding? Cut staff numbers. Sixty-seven per cent of Centrelink's budget is taken up by staff costs. So if you cut its budget by 10 per cent, if you reduce its revenue by $149 million a year, what is Centrelink to do? It is not a question of looking at options. It has only one option and that is to cut staff.</para><para>This announcement is about the realisation of government budget cuts flowing through to Centrelink; it has nothing to do with the new customer service delivery model. It is the government saying they will not pay as much for the delivery of social security services in this country. The Minister for Community Services was in here earlier holding forth about the new Department of Family and Community Services and what a wonderful initiative it is. The first announcement of an initiative within her new portfolio was to reduce the services provided to the clients of that portfolio. Centrelink provides the services to the clients of that portfolioâthe unemployed, the pensioners, the aged and all the other groups that rely on Centrelink for its services and the payment of their benefits. The government slashed the staff because they have reduced Centrelink's funding.</para><para>As I say, this is the heart of the politics of the matter. It is a very serious matter for this 
 parliament and it is one the parliament must take to the government. We must try to apply pressure to the government to reverse this decision. This is not a decision made by the independent board that runs Centrelink; it is a decision made by the government to provide less funding. There is no other alternative for Centrelink but to cut staff and, as we have seen from the announcement, over the next couple of years they will cut in total 5,000 staff from this government agency.</para><para>The government would have us believe that all these job cuts are going to come from head office and that they will be backroom bureaucrats who go. It is a nonsense. Centrelink is a service delivery agency. They are the people who answer the phones or answer your queries when you call at a Centrelink office. At least 10 per cent of the staff reductions will come from the coalface. They will come from the service delivery officers. There is no way that these massive staff cuts cannot affect the service delivery at the coalface, and that is revealed by the government's own figures.</para><para>I would have thought the government's most likely response would be to say, `Centrelink can afford these efficiency cuts. It runs an overblown bureaucracy.' That would also be nonsense. There is no defence in that. We have seen in the last year the chaos and massive problems that have occurred in Centrelink as it has tried to deal with the jobs that the government has given it. In June 1998 there were 1,200,000 unanswered calls. You cannot get through to Centrelink in the busy periods if you want to, let alone get service from Centrelink to deal with your particular inquiries. It is massively overstretched currently. As an exercise, I tried to call Centrelink this morning. I spent an hour and a quarter trying to get through on the family payments line. I was unable to get through between 11 and 12.15 this morning on the family payments line. I did get through on the Newstart line, and I did get through on the pensions line. It took me four goes on the Newstart line, and it took me three goes on the pension line.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>N26</name.id><name role="metadata">ABETZ</name><name role="display">Senator Abetz</name></talker><para>âDid you dial the wrong numbers? </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>AX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator CHRIS EVANS</name></talker><para>âI dialled the right numbers, Senator, and I got through on two of them. If you ask the minister, I am sure she will tell you that there are enormous problems in getting through to Centrelink. If you did any constituency work, Senator, you would know of complaints from constituents about the failure to get through.</para></talk.start></continue><para>As I say, there were 1,200,000 unanswered calls. At one stage 97 per cent of the calls made by people to Centrelink numbers got the busy signal. You cannot even get through to get in the queue or hear the musak or the messages about how they will have someone listening to your call, vetting the customer deliveryânot to mention then asking you to wait an average of five minutes before you get put through to someone who will actually speak to you. You are dealing with a machine until then.</para><para>There are enormous problems already. I am not trying to attack Centrelink staff, but what is clear is that they are underresourced and overstretched. The problems encountered in June-July this year caused chaos. We have seen that in the Ombudsman's report. There were over 10,000 complaints investigated last year by the Ombudsman in Centrelink alone. That is just the tip of the iceberg. These are the complaints that actually get to the Ombudsman. How many people take their complaints to the Ombudsman? What percentage of those who are concerned or upset about the treatment received or the failure to get through actually go to the Ombudsman? Clearly, the numbers that go through are the tip of the iceberg. A lot of them see their local members of parliament. A lot of them just go away defeated. A lot of them basically give up on being able to get satisfactory service.</para><para>What we are faced with today is cuts which will directly hurt people most in need in our community: the old aged pensioners and the disability pensioners. We have seen what has happened to job seekers with the new Job Network scheme. What an absolute success the Job Network scheme has been! Together with parents with child-care inquiries, young people with inquiries about youth allowance and students inquiring about Austudy, there 
 are six million Australians seeking services from Centrelink every year. They are entitled, in my view, to courteous personal assistance, to be able to talk to somebody about accessing their entitlements. If they are lucky enough to get through on the phone now, they might get some assistance. There are going to be 5,000 fewer people to answer the phones at the end of the government's cutbacksâ5,000 fewer people to service the six million people who are making contact.</para><para>I will be interested to see what the minister has to say about the regional impacts of these decisions. The government ran in the last election expressing concern about the impact on regional Australia of the loss of banks and other services from regional areas. You cannot tell me that 5,000 jobs are going to go from Centrelink and there are not going to be any jobs lost in regional Australia. Not only will there be jobs lost; the standard of service will invariably drop. Centrelink has been forced to survive on less money. I do not know whether the government is going to ask the banks to be the local Centrelink offices, but they have already closed in most regional towns. It is a major problem for regional Australia. It is a major problem in terms of employment, and it is a major problem in terms of the services provided to Australians.</para><para>It is interesting that there was no mention of these cuts prior to the election, but another 5,000 jobs are to be cut. I do not know what the government's view of the future is, but Centrelink is supposed to be providing a community service. It is meant to be a people based organisation. People like to be able to speak to a person when they want to be taken through complex financial matters relating to their entitlements. I do not know whether we will have to change the name of Centrelink to `Computerlink', because all the government talks about is the Internet, computers, et cetera and nothing about personal service. There are going to be 5,000 fewer persons there to provide service.</para><para>Machines are cheaper, and maybe IT can help in terms of making the organisation more efficient, but it does not replace the personal service needs that the clients of Centrelink deserve and have a right to expect. I know 
 this is going to mean more recorded messages, more time spent hanging on the phone and more attempts to get through unsuccessfully, but the government ought to be about providing better service for the clients of Centrelink. It should not be about gutting Centrelink and making the service even more unsatisfactory than it currently is. There will be 5,000 fewer people servicing the pensioners, the unemployed and the families of this country as a result of government budget decisions. Make no mistake: this is all about a government budget decision to cut the money they will pay through what used to be the Department of Social Security to Centrelink. It is a cut in government funds resulting in job losses and loss of service.</para><para>I know the Prime Minister in his ACOSS speech the other day said that business ought to rediscover the spirit of 19th century philanthropy. I am not sure whether he intends that we rediscover some of the other 19th century factors that were at play, one of which was the absence of a decent social security service run by government. I thought we had long gone past the day of having a debate in this country about the need to provide a properly serviced social security system in this country.</para><para>The government's cutbacks in this area will put Centrelink under great strain and will reduce the sorts of services that they provide. I do not know whether it is intended that Centrelink ought to be having a sort of poppy day and be out there shaking the cans to raise money to finance their services because the government is clearly unwilling to provide them. It is a government's decision to cut their budget by $149 million each year because they will not provide the services.</para><para> It is important that the Senate does condemn the government's funding cuts to Centrelink. It is important that we put on the record our support for humane and adequately funded income support for the needy. We must assist in building pressure on the government to meet its obligations to its citizens. Nice words are not enough. This is a direct policy initiative of the government. I encourage you to deny that $140-odd million has not been removed from Centrelink's budget. Your own budget papers prove the 
 point that this is about budget measure cuts to Centrelinkâless funding and less service. The pensioners, the unemployed and the families of Australia will get less assistance and less service as a direct result of this government decision.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>143</page.no><name role="metadata">Newman, Sen Jocelyn</name><name role="display">Senator NEWMAN</name><name.id>BE4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Family and Community Services; Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI thank Senator Chris Evans for his contribution.

Centrelink is a statutory organisation that was announced and set up by the government in 1996-97.

Other older women find it convenient, if they are married to a man who is about to retire, to take a redundancy payment to pay off the family home before they go into retirement. Perhaps the ALP do not know much about the way people live. That is pretty clear in their lack of support.</para></talk.start></continue><para>All the rearrangements of service delivery in Centrelink are focused on improved service delivery. That is because some offices are grossly inefficient compared with the best in the system. There is a great deal of room in the system for improved productivity. Some offices are showing the way in a marvellous way.</para><para>One of the things that Centrelink management has discovered, which I would not have thought would come as a surprise to those opposite, is that very large offices are less productive than the smaller ones. Centrelink is planning not to close any offices but to increase the number of offices by 50. That is because there will be more smaller offices being able to reach out further into regional and rural Australia. There are 400 offices already. The number will be increased by about 50.</para><para>In addition, we are increasing the ways that customers can do business with Centrelink. That is a direct result of the consultation process that has taken place in the last year with 8,000 customers in value creation workshops. I have attended one of those workshops. They are very valuable to the organisation to learn what the customers are thinking, what they want to be done better and what they want to be done differently.</para><para>As a result of those 8,000 customers voluntarily taking part in these exercises they know that more and more people want to do business with them at arm's length through telephone calls, through the Internet, through fax, and through electronic service delivery.

We are already piloting projects in Tasmania, whereby we share facilities and provide services in country areas and rural towns, sharing with local government and state government. In Georgetown in Tasmania we share a site with both levels of government, so there are three all together. These are very important ways of getting services to people who did not have adequate services in past years. We are establishing a rural telecentre network to be dedicated to rural people and the special issues that they face. We are establishing ways that, when the call centre network is overcrowdedâcurrently it can now all be linked together and does overflowâwhen there is a particularly heavy load, the calls will be able to overflow to the customer service centres.</para><para>I have said that there will be no office closures. I have said that it will be by natural attrition and voluntary redundancies. It is important to recognise that the changes that are to be made are minimally, in proportionate terms, going to be at the service end of the organisation. The savings are to be very much more marked in the middle to senior levels of management. I cannot imagine that 
 anybody would quibble with that because, if we are talking about a service delivery agency, it is the overheads that make it a costly organisation. As Ms Vardon made very clear in her press conference the other day, they want to stay in business. They are a statutory authority. They have to bid for their business. They have to be cost effective. They do not want the private sector taking business away from them when they tender for new projects. So they have to be very efficient at doing the job. They have a board of management, which is a mixed board of the private and the public sector, who are enthusiastically endorsing the changes that management has recommended to them.</para><para>I cannot understand why the ALP would want us to spend more money unnecessarily when we already have a budget in this portfolio of something approaching $60 billion, approximately half the national budget. That is a lot of money to look after people and provide a safety net and services for those in need in one way or another. Surely you do not waste money by being unproductive or not putting in measures that allow you to look after your customers in a more efficient and caring way. One of the most important things that Centrelink will be providing is a single officer point of contact for a group of customers so they do not have to keep repeating their story; so they do not have to keep proving who they are. That is really practical in terms of what the customers want. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>145</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise on behalf of the Australian Democrats to support the urgency motion that is before us.

This has serious implications for the kind of society we live in. We will have a questionable society by the end of this government's term of office if we do not pay attention to the needs of these people. It 
 is a stark example of the prioritisation of economic efficiency over service.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The business plan of Centrelink identifies three stages of development for Centrelink. The first of these relates to the current year of Centrelink's existence, stating that in the first stage `we created a new identity with a strong emphasis on customer service'. In the past year Centrelink has experienced a number of problems, some of which Senator Evans referred to. They have affected the level of service delivery, resulting in the highest number of complaints to the Commonwealth Ombudsman of all government agencies. These problems have been directly attributed to inadequate staffing, inadequate resources and poor management, not to mention being compounded by the introduction of Job Network, the common youth allowance, Work for the Dole and other programs. Specifically Job Network, I suppose, is the faultiest program of them all. The introduction of these programs has made it impossible for Centrelink to achieve its service objectives on current staff levels.  </para><para>The second stage of Centrelink's existence, as detailed in the planâand I note that it has an economic objective in this planâis a period of consolidation from now until the year 2001. Contrary to what might be expected and what certainly would be desirable, this period of consolidation does not envisage an assessment of the problems of inadequate staffing and resourcing and poor management and a means of addressing them. Instead, it relates to a period of increasing efficiency through service rationalisation and cost cutting, in a direction which would only further compromise standards and efficiency in terms of serving the needs of those in our community who are less well off. The aim of the agency for the coming years is not primarily to improve service delivery and better service its clients, but it is expressed as:</para><para>In the second stage of its development, Centrelink must keep its promise of becoming a more efficient and competitive organisation.</para><para>One might ask: who has the promise been made to? Who is it competing with? Presumably it is not a promise that has been made to 
 the eight million Australians who rely on Centrelink to service their needs.</para><para>This plan also, as one of its two financial challenges, says:</para><para>To stay in business we need to reduce our overheads and costs.</para><para>Consider the implications of that phrase. What are the chances that Centrelink could go out of business? Does this mean that, if Centrelink does not fulfil its efficiency dividends, it will be forced to close down? This has never been canvassed by the government, and certainly it raises serious questions about letting the government's economic rationalist agenda dictate the delivery of vital services and the implementation of policy.</para><para>The funding of Centrelink is not guaranteed. Centrelink relies on its client departments for its funding. It does not receive funding directly from the government. This relationship is currently under a three-year agreement, but the enabling legislation only provides for a contract term of 12 months. While it would seem unlikely that the government would allow competitive tendering for the delivery of Centrelink's current functionsâdue to the amount spent on the establishment of the agencyâthis government has never allowed good judgment to stand in the way of a cost-cutting measure. The government must make clearâand I hope that Senator Jocelyn Newman's comments today are categoricalâthat it will not privatise Centrelink. The delivery of welfare services to millions of Australians must remain in government control.</para><para>The second financial challenge described in the document says:</para><para>to deliver an ongoing efficiency dividend to Government, based on promulgating best practice, improving our efficiency and reducing our administrative overheads.</para><para>You can bet that `best practice' does not refer to service levels but to the amount which can be cut from operational costs and staffing. The business plan envisages that service obligations will be met by two radical changes to the delivery of services. These comprise, of courseâas Senator Evans has outlinedâa move to electronic delivery of services with the establishment of public 
 Internet kiosks accessible perhaps in the same way as ATMs. This is not acceptable. The minister can talk about smaller versus larger offices, but there is no point in having larger offices that have no staff.</para><para>The organisation is currently underresourced.

They are the figures that the minister provided half an hour ago, and I just 
 want to get the message across that there are no office closures and there are no forced redundancies. The model was developed following extensive customer feedback, involving over 8,000 customers directly, and Centrelink is moving towards case management to give customers more personal service and quicker decisions.

But I think that one of the interesting and most significant things is that Centrelink has also been trialling the personalised service initiatives, and these have taken the form of a one main contact model where customers are able to deal with the same Centrelink customer service officer for all their business. Surely that is an advantage. Why are the minor parties in the parliament deciding that that is not advantageous to the customer concerned?</para><para>It has been very favourably received by both the customers and the staff alike. Surely 
 that is what matters, not what someone wants to manufacture and just comes in here and completely and utterly distorts. A new service delivery model has been developed based on a life events approach so that people can understand the problems that that person has. An example of that might include looking for a job, needing help after someone has died or other personal matters that can relate only to that particular person such as their planning for retirement.</para><para>I cannot understand why the minor parties believe that that one-to-one approachâgetting to know the person, understanding their particular problemsâis such a bad thing. I cannot understand why they believe that opening a further 50 offices is also a bad thing. Surely that would be something that would be applauded but, no, that too, like everything else the government puts up, is rejected by minor parties.</para><para>Knowing a customer's needs clearly cuts out a lot of the red tape. The red tape has been all enveloping in terms of these people who are in a disadvantageous position, and here the Labor Party and the Democrats want to continue with that red tape that they can clearly cut out. For instance, currently customers have to prove their identity each and every time they present to a different customer service officer. Surely dealing on a one-to-one basis and removing that need for proof of identity is advantageous. Surely one would say that taking advantage of the emerging technologies is advantageous but, no, not the opposition.</para><para> This whole process is designed to improve what is happening out there in the real world, and the Ombudsman's report reveals that the number of complaints about Centrelink programs fell by 11 per cent over the last year and complaints about student assistance fell by 12 per cent.

In Western Australia 180 staff have already gone from Centrelink in this financial year between July and October. Voluntary redundancies for the 180 cost around $3.5 million, plus whatever it will cost for their superannuation. Amongst those were some of the most experienced staff, some with 20 or 25 years experience. That is often the way it goes with these kinds of redundancy programs. Amongst authorised review officers, at least six officers with over 100 years of service between them left, and that is about half of the authorised review officers.</para></talk.start><para>Ron MacLeod, the Commonwealth Ombudsman, reported 10,582 complaints about Centrelink last financial year, and that is four times the rate for the Child Support Agency. Staff are not going by natural attrition, though conditions are now so bad that many committed people will take redundancy.</para><para>The computer system, as we have heard on a number of occasions, is a disgrace. The move to a common platform earlier this year caused enormous difficulties for staff, and the introduction of new systems will place additional strain on reduced numbers of staff. Note that the staff numbers are being reduced before the introduction of new technologies, so the promises about the extra accessibility do not coincide when the staff are going.</para><para>The government promised a `much better standard of service delivery to community and to individuals'. Instead, we are getting long delays, especially on the phoneâanecdotal evidence of waiting times of 40 minutes not being unusual and other callers not being able to get onto a line at all. It may be that some people waiting on the line hang up because 
 all they get is another mechanical voice when there is really nobody to explain what the specific needs of that person are. It is not a matter of being a customer or client. That is nonsense. It is a matter of being an insect on the end of somebody's pin, and the government just makes it harder and harder for those insects on the end of the pin.</para><para>The CPSU refers to the ACOSS report of 4 November which highlights a disturbing rise in the demand for welfare services due to high unemployment. We have to remember that this is the government which is actually taking legal action on employment service providers for speaking about what the problems are. So there is a lot of pressure that these issues do not come out by workers and by those providers. The report also highlights funding cuts to welfare agencies and changes in government policies. This will be exacerbated by further cuts to Centrelink. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>149</page.no><name role="metadata">Collins, Sen Jacinta</name><name role="display">Senator JACINTA COLLINS</name><name.id>GB6</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âWell, excuse our scepticism, but we have been through the Job Network process.

Your performance in today's debate was appalling. You say you have had no complaints because shadow ministers or other members of the opposition have not spoken to you. Are you in the real world? Please! It is incredible.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Let us get to the crux of what this issue really is about. What the government has done is increase a one per cent efficiency dividend by an additional six per cent. This is about budget cuts. That is what this is about. This is not about better service measures, which the opposition would support. If this were about better service measures and increasing and improving technology to provide better services, those initiatives would be supported. But this is about gutting an agency. This is about reducing services to those six million to seven million Australians, 
 and the experience of the unemployed can only highlight that.</para><para>Not only is the government adding to its current problems with this initiative with respect to the unemployed, it is indicating that it has learnt absolutely nothing from the Job Network debacle. There have already been 4,000 jobs removed from the CES and that has left Centrelink understaffed. That is why around 50 per cent of the offices have long queues. The other problem is that, in this proposal, the highlight is the lack of any testbedding of the proposed service delivery model. Again, it is the same problem that occurred with the Job Networkâexactly the same problem.</para><para>If we look at what occurred in relation to the Job Network, we will see that the basic facilities available at Centrelink in no way adequately replace the full services previously provided by the CES. Centrelink was not given the resources to make up for the drastic cuts in the CES. Furthermore, funding has not been spent where it should be. Many of the most experienced and successful employment service providers will not be able to continue. Instead, money has been given to individuals and organisations, some of whom have no facilities or are in financial turmoil or have breached proper practices in tendering application processesâall due to a lack of testbedding. It seems like the government is going to make the same mistakes here. But $7.6 million saved has been spent on an advertising campaign telling us that the future starts in May and pretending how good it will be. Further money is also being spent on changing the colour scheme of the remaining offices. Tell that to the redundant employees.</para><para>We talk about technology and making the most of new technology for better service delivery. If that is what this were about, we could applaud it, but of course it is not. Computers, phones, the Internet and one-to-one non-direct contact may generate better service delivery if that was its purpose, but the purpose here is cuts. We found with the referral process in the Job Network that technology, because it was not properly testbedded, was the problem. It was not the 
 solution, as suggested, to reducing the staff. It was not a solution at all.</para><para>I refer to an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> which highlighted many points. This is today's editorial. I want to refer to the conclusion, because we are being accused of exaggerating. I should correct the record. Senator Natasha Stott Despoja actually said that we were being accused of exaggerating.

There is nothing here at all about better service delivery. But the amusing component in all of this is that Ms Vardon seems to have made a complete ideological backflip.

The public statement made by Ms Vardon in this episode about women being a good avenue through which to make your redundancies is absolutely outrageous. The ideological backflip that this woman has made is incredible. We might as well argue that the minister should stand down because her

It is an extraordinary situation. During the election campaign there was one issue after anotherâwe saw it in the paper every day once we got past the pages where the opposition leader was kissing fish or eating humble pie in gross amounts. There they were beating up something new to frighten somebody, some group in the community. This week their target is the six million clients of Centrelink.</para></talk.start><para>The contributions of opposition members this afternoon have just demonstrated very clearly to me that this is the latest scare 
 campaign, and it truly does plunge the depths of dishonesty. I am sorry that Senator Collins is leaving the chamber because I would like to draw to her attention a couple of quite extraordinary statements that she made in her contribution this afternoon. She first talked about the government making mistakes. I ask you: how could Senator Collins talk about government mistakes when she belonged to a government that made so many mistakes that all of the taxpayers of this country are still paying the price for them, still repairing the economic damage which was caused by those mistakes. She talked about cutting services. We are about making service delivery betterâsomething that she actually denied all together in her contribution. She overlooked the facts for the sake of frightening someone else in the community.</para><para>Centrelink is the biggest government agency. It has 24,000 staff, and it very clearly was not working to the capacity that it could have been. Who said so? Who told the government that Centrelink could be improved? It was not a consultant; it was the clients of Centrelink themselves. They were asked for their views and they generously gave them. We are now implementing the results of the feedback that they so generously gave, and thank goodness for that.</para><para>All of us who have spoken to our constituents over a period of yearsâback in 1994 and 1995 I took calls from constituents who were simply a number in the social security logjamâhave heard stories about the hours they spent being a number in a government office, sitting there day after day, and about the confusing array of programs they tried to unravel. We are trying to offer a service that will enable people to work with the same person all the time. They do not have to go in there and say, `This is me. Let me tell you my life history so, once again, you can tell me what I need to know.' What we are about is making that service more efficient. We are taking a new approach to delivering government servicesâan approach which works more from the customer's perspective, rather than from the bureaucrat's perspective.</para><para>These latest changes have been announced as part of an ongoing process which will 
 reform the system and improve the overall quality of service. Centrelink is overcoming some of the bureaucratic red tape, which the clients themselves were able to identify. Clients will not have to face the confusion of dealing with multiple staff and multiple programsâthey will see the same face. The minister was able to implement some of these innovations as a result of a visit to New Zealand where this system is working very well. It has also been successfully trialled in some of our most busy Centrelink offices.</para><para>What are we going to deliver? We are going to deliver services that the clients themselves have said they want. We know these reforms will work because the extensive customer feedback has told us so. Clients will, I am sure, appreciate the elimination of duplication and the simplification of quite frustrating and cumbersome administrative procedures that previously operated as a result of the old, pre 1996 bureaucratic red tape that operated in those offices. When we talk about the number of bureaucrats in the old Department of Social Security system, let us not forget that they did not actually deliver a better service. Those of us who have dealt with our constituents over the years would be able to tell you that.</para><para>Unlike the previous government, we do not consider that it is appropriate or fair or good enough to provide a mediocre service to government agency customers. We are not complacent. We recognise that Centrelink is a dynamic agency, and as improvements come forward we will implement them. We are not locked in the Dark Ages, as the previous administration was, in dealing with this very difficult service delivery agency.</para><para>Labor's absolutely disgraceful scare campaign over the last week is particularly opportunistic when you look at their record in government of service delivery for job seekers and social security recipients. The former CES cumbersome administrative processes let down young people and job seekers who were at their most vulnerable. The previous administration failed to do anything about it; they sat there and twiddled their thumbs and they employed more bureaucrats. Their record in 
 delivering social security services was marked by failure.</para><para>Those of us who can recall our constituency work in 1993 can tell you about the failure of the families integration project. It was a disaster for eight long months. It produced huge numbers of incorrect and duplicate payments. In 1995, new arrangements for parenting allowances also led to a number of payment mistakes, particularly to low income families. It was a disgrace having to try to unravel that in dealing with those very stressed out and quite desperate constituents. These problems were far worse than anything that we have encountered with the teething problems of Centrelink, which we have worked very hard to try to fix up.

The act created a mechanism for the detection 
 of inconsistent payments being made to a person by two or more agencies and the detection of possible tax evasion. The act defined the method of data matching and placed a limit on the number of data matching cycles. It gave force to data matching guidelines that had been issued by the Privacy Commissioner. The act permitted the use of tax file numbers to assist with the verification with the tax office of income information provided by social security recipients. It also increased data matching between a number of government departments including Social Security; Veteran Affairs; Health, Housing and Community Services; Employment, Education and Training; and the tax office.</para><para>The date in the original sunset clause in the act was January 1993. The act was then amended in 1992 to extend the period of that sunset clause. It was further extended subsequently twice more. This bill before us today completely removes the sunset clause. There is, I think, a recognition now that the data matching program is a very effective part of maintaining the integrity of the social security system.</para><para>I wish to make no further remarks today, other than to say that obviously social security is about a lot more than just fraud prevention. Also, there are a range of other issues in this area that we think the government ought to be tackling very seriously, but those issues are for another day. I commend the bill to the Senate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>153</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe <inline ref="r524">Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Amendment Bill 1998</inline>  amends the Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Act 1990 by repealing section 21.

The effect of the repeal will be to remove the sunset clause applying to parts 1 and 2 of the act; so these provisions will continue to apply after 22 January next year.</para></talk.start><para>The government in its second reading speech talks about keeping personal financial assistance schemes free from abuse and fraud and points to the substantial savings that have occurred over the last two years. The govern 
 ment also claims that data matching encourages voluntary compliance. The government also claims that this measure will continue to bring savingsâand I believe those savings have been estimated at $560 million over the next four years.</para><para>However, the history of this measure is significant and accounts for the Democrats' opposition to this bill on a number of occasions. There have been several debates on this bill by current Democrat colleagues. Senator John Woodley and Senator Meg Lees have been involved in this debate in the past. Former leader Senator Janine Haines was very keen in the past to participate in debates about privacy and the implications of legislation of this type.</para><para>The issue has its origins in the Australia card debate and the expanding use of tax file numbers as a de facto personal identity scheme. The Labor government, as Senator Chris Evans has acknowledged, announced the introduction of this scheme. It was also responsible for the introduction of legislation relating to the Australia card in September 1985. This was ostensibly to `combat tax evasion and reduce health and welfare fraud'.</para><para>The Australia card concept was referred to a joint parliamentary committee, which reported in May 1986. A five-three majority of the committee, which included Democrat senator Janine Haines, favoured an upgraded tax file number system in preference to the government's Australia card proposal. The proposed high integrity tax file number was to be used in a wide range of financial transactions and in the reporting of information to the Australian Taxation Office. Senator Haines said at the time:</para><para>Social security fraud and overpayment and tax fraud, as all the evidence before the Committee indicated, come mainly from the understatement of incomesâfor example, from not declaring income in the cash economy and from the non-declaration of interest. Aside from that, the only major component was outright criminal defrauding . . . </para><para>Despite the committee's rejection of the Australia Card Bill, it was introduced into the Senate in November 1986 and defeated in December that year.</para><para>On that occasion, former senator Janine Haines said in the second reading debate:</para><para>It is important that we make it quite clear from the beginning that this is not a debate, nor should it be turned into a debate, about whether people are opposed to or are supporters of tax and social security fraud. The debate on the legislation before us today and the alternative proposals ought to be about how best we combat the tax and social security fraud that is costing this country billions of dollars annually and how we do it without excessive imposts on the rest of the community.</para><para>I suggest that this is relevant to these debates about privacy and compliance and data matching devices today. I continue to use former Senator Haines's words:</para><para>It seems to me, however, that from time to time there are some double standards in that some of the most frequent calls for attacks on social security cheats seem to come from those people who have turned tax minimisation into an art form and that more people in the community seem to be concerned about the $30m or whatever it is we lose each year to social security defrauders than they are about the $3 billion that we lose annually to tax defrauders. But I guess that that is a matter of their perspective and a question of double standards.</para><para>They are quite appropriate words today.</para><para>The Labor government's reintroduction of the Australia Card Bill in a number of forms was pretty unsuccessful. It eventually withdrew the proposal due to a lack of support. However, along the way, the Legal and Constitutional Committee, considering Australia Card Bill (No. 3), focused on tax file numbers. The significant issue in that report was that between 1985 and 1987, when the Australia card was claimed to be the only measure for reducing tax evasion and fraud worth $1 billion annually, the Labor government was able to recover $800 million annually through other means, such as amending taxation legislation. About that report former Senator Haines said:</para><para>Let me say categorically that neither I nor any of my colleagues in the Australian Democrats support tax cheats or social security defrauders. However, I do question the Government's sincerity about recouping revenue when it has inserted in various pieces of tax law measures that allow some companies in this country to legally pay less than one cent in the dollar in tax year after year after year. When the Government comes to terms with that, I will accept that it is far more sincere in its attitude to raising revenue than it has demonstrated to date. 
</para><para>I suggest that those words are still relevant today regardless of which government we are talking about.</para><para>After the failure of the Australia card, the Labor government introduced tax file number legislation, Taxation Laws Amendment (Tax File Numbers) Bill 1988. The Privacy Bill 1988 was introduced at the same time to ensure that any fears about intrusion or breaches of privacy were taken into account. This legislation arguably enabled the use of tax file numbers as a de facto identity card for a number of dealings with the government, including employment and Medicare et cetera.</para><para>At that time, the Australian Democrats expressed their concerns. We moved a number of amendments. We attempted to increase the strength of the Privacy Bill, including, of course, extending it to the private sector. That is another debate that is relevant today. The Democrats have argued long and hard in this place, certainly in the last parliament and before, for the extension of the Privacy Act to the private sector. Indeed, the government promised during the election campaign in 1996 that it would extend the Privacy Act to the private sector. But we have seen a reversal in that promise by no less than the Prime Minister himself. There has been an absolute contradiction in the move to extend the Privacy Act to the private sector, despite the fact that many in our community would like to see that happen.</para><para>Senator Coulter, my predecessor, then expressed a concern that I believe is particularly valid today:</para><para>Once one has a number with a very high integrity, which is linked to an individual and which links that individual with a number of financial transactions, the provision of that number leaves that individual open, through the great capacity which is now available in computers . . . to the possibility that that information could be abused and misused. It could be to the detriment of individuals if that high integrity number should fall into the hands of those who have no business to have it. The Democrats are proposing that that number should be known only to the individual and to the Australian Taxation Office . . .</para><para>Sensitive to the electorate's attitude to the Australia card when introducing this legislation, the government gave assurances that the 
 tax file number system would not be extended to other government departments and agencies. I quote as an example the Treasurer, who on 3 June 1988 said:</para><para>We have no intention now or in the future of extending the basis of the tax file number to do anything like some of the Australia card tasks.</para><para>And:</para><para>No other government or non-government and agency will have access to the Tax Office file number registration system.</para><para>As a backflip, the Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Bill 1990 was introduced on 6 December 1990 to give effect to wide-ranging data-matching measures, using the tax file number, between the departments of social security, veterans' affairs, community services and health and employment, education and training and the Australian Taxation Office. The Labor government claimed that this measure was necessary to counter the potential abuse of the assistance and taxation systems. It was to cover the potential abuse of income support and assistance payments. The bill lapsed, and a similar bill was introduced taking into account committee findings.</para><para>The Democrats at that stage were concerned that data-matching legislation should not be extended to do anything like the intention behind the Australia Card. The 1990 bill was an extension of the use of tax file numbers, and had far-reaching effects when combined with a range of subsequent bills. The scheme now extends to most tax, employment, education and training, health, immigration and ethnic affairs payments. This is a direct repudiation of the Labor government's promise to restrict the use of tax file numbers to tax related matters only.</para><para>In 1990, the Democrats opposed that bill because there was not an examinationâcertainly not an adequate examinationâof the far-reaching effects of data-matching, and of course there were inadequate privacy protections. The principal reason for this view was that individual autonomy outweighs government control in this instance, as the tax file number system becomes a de facto multipurpose identification system. It is effectively the Australia Card by another name.</para><para>The 1990 bill was only passed because of the sunset clauseâsomething that the government seeks to get rid of. Senator Alstonâwho was in opposition at the timeâset out the reasons for this amendment. He said:</para><para>. . . we are also very anxious to ensure that the Parliament retains control of the process, and that is why we will be introducing a sunset clause.</para><para>The Democrats also supported the sunset clause. I quote another former leader, Senator Powell. She stated:</para><para>If the Australian Democrats had had their way this legislation would have ridden off into the sunset at the end of the second reading. However, as a compromise we are prepared to support this sunset clause, although we will have to wait two years. We regret that the privacy of many Australian citizens is likely to be impinged upon in that two years. Nevertheless, the Opposition has been able to bring itself to this position, in spite of its earlier opposition to the Australia Card and so on, and so we welcome the amendment and support it.</para><para>The sunset clause returned to the Senate for reconsideration in 1992 in the Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Bill 1992. The Democrats again supported a sunset clause to maintain parliamentary scrutiny on the basis the Labor government promised not to extend the tax file number scheme and that as a society we are not prepared to increase intrusion into personal lives for the sort of efficiency that the government claims are possible. The sunset clause was again extended in 1995. The nub of the issue here was nicely stated by Senator Powell on 18 December 1990 when the Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Bill 1990 was being considered. She said:</para><para>Before turning to the specifics of the legislation before us and the history leading up to it, I want to make some brief remarks about privacy. Sometimes, regrettably, the privacy issue is lost in the general point scoring and dubious claims associated with this kind of debate, but we must not lose sight of the central point or of its overwhelming importance. The issue of privacy is necessarily one of competing principles. It is concerned with the role of governments in the private lives of its citizens. It is directly relevant to the balance between citizens' autonomy and control over them. It always emerges in the ongoing competition between efficiency and the price society is prepared to pay for that efficiency. 
</para><para>The Democrats still oppose this bill. However, we recognise the urgency with which this matter must be dealt because of the sunset clause. We will support a sunset clause for a period of another three years. We are also concerned about privacy of information held by the Commonwealth which is outsourced and which is dealt with by the government in dealings outside the scope of the present Privacy Act. On many occasions we have talked about the inadequacy of the Privacy Act.</para><para>The recent Telecommunications Act illustrates some of our concerns. This act was dealt with by the Senate with the understanding that the government would be introducing a comprehensive privacy schemeâa national, uniform, comprehensive privacy scheme. The government changed its mind, and that comprehensive privacy scheme is not in existence. We cannot now rely on the government's Privacy Amendment Bill to extend the Privacy Act to outsourced information and self-regulation in the private sector.</para><para>Now, more than ever beforeâit is extraordinaryâwith technological advances, computers do have the power to match unique identifiers like tax file numbers to a range of other information, and of course there is the potential to misuse that information. This was the objection to the Australia Card. This was the objection not only from the Australian Democrats but from a broad range of people in the community, and it is our objection now. It was our objection then, and it remains today.</para><para>We do not advocate tax and social security fraud. Just as Senator Janine Haines was claiming in the mid to late 1980s, there is no way that we support social security fraud. But we do think that this debate involves broader concepts and we do think that this issue of fraud must be balanced against the integrity of all those honest Australians, which should not be compromised.</para><para>Finally, we have a double standard which attacks those people getting benefits as defrauders, yet we have a system that ignores the huge sums of tax and other revenue that is lost, that is forgone, from tax fraud and dodgy minimisation schemes. Penny pinching 
 from those who are most needy in our community is not a happy balance when tax avoidance and dodgy minimisation schemes are left untouched. When the government enters into this debate and tackles this kind of minimisation and fraud sincerely, as Janine Haines would say, then we believe there will be more sincerity to this debate as a whole.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>157</page.no><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name><name.id>SF4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI agree with much of what Senator Stott Despoja says. What is aimed at here is a very worthy objectiveâthat is, that there be tools to enable the Commonwealth to ensure that public revenue is not misspent. I think that is an object that everybody would be dedicated to. The minister has often spoken about that in this chamber. The problem always is that in a free and democratic society there are limits that ought to be put, and in fact are put, on the investigative tools with which we equip those people whose duty it is to look after the public revenue.</para></talk.start><para>The question always isâand this question arises in this caseâhave we put enough monitors on the tools that the</para><para>	 Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Act 1990</para><para>allows? The answer to that might best be given in this way. There ought to be an ability for those who are being investigated to preserve their integrity as a human being. There ought to be some protection for that person's reputation or for that person's finances if he or she were to be fined for some breach of some act. Finally, we ought to be conscious of the liberty of that person if that person is likely to suffer a term of imprisonment for what he or she does against the law.</para><para>So there are big issues in this legislation. It is a very short bill, but it does bring into operation a very useful and necessary tool but a tool that ought to be tempered so that it acts as it ought to in a true society in which we respect human rights and in which we respect the proper community entitlements that anybody is entitled to have.</para><para>There are some quite stringent provisions in the data-matching program act to protect privacy in so far as that may be affected by people within the Public Service. The difficulty is that that same protection seems not to be brought into operation against any private 
 agency that may be brought into the provision of services to which the data-matching program act might apply. For example, page 11 of yesterday's <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline> says:</para><para>Labor's community services spokesman, Mr Wayne Swan, last night described the Centrelink restructure as a "prelude to privatisation".</para><para>The Minister for Community Services, Mr Warren Truss, while ruling out privatisation, failed to rule out future government plans to usher in greater competition in the delivery of welfare services, telling reporters "the future is a very, very long time".</para><para>It seems to me that there is a significant risk that matters will be privatised and that those matters are to do with the provision of data of individuals.

On 21 March last year the government said it would not implement privacy legislation for the private sector. I am counselling in this context that that intention expressed on 21 March last year by the Prime Minister that the government would not implement privacy legislation should perhaps be revisited. I notice that the government in my home state of Victoria under Mr Kennett is intent on bringing in legislation for the private sector. 
 I note too that the Prime Minister at the time said that the Commonwealth would not be introducing privacy legislation and said he would be asking the states and territories not to bring in such legislation. I am saying now that it is perhaps time for us to reconsider that issue because privacy is under threat. I have had the assurance from the government that privacy, whether it is within the ability of the government or within the ability of private enterprise to compromise, will be protected by laws that punish people who breach that privacy.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>BE4</name.id><name role="metadata">NEWMAN</name><name role="display">Senator Newman</name></talker><para>âYes, they are subject to the Social Security Act as if they were an officer, as if they were a contractor to the department.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>SF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name></talker><para>âThank you very much for that, Minister. I accept that. Does that therefore not indicate that it would be a good thing for privacy to be protected right across the board? By that I mean not only the matters covered by the bill before us and the act that it will amend but extending those provisions that apply to the private sector to the private sector as a whole. I understand that that is not within the minister's particular portfolio, but this does seem to be an occasion to raise that issue.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In this context I would like to talk about the Freedom of Information Act, because in my view this whole issue of privacy deals with the possession of information. One of the problems in this whole field of privacy is that the privacy of some people is protected while the privacy of others is not. The Freedom of Information Act gives great exceptions within its provisions as to what can be discovered. It seems to me that, if we are going down the field of gathering more information, it should be information that is first of all protected. But, if the information is to be gained from some people, then it should be gained from others as well so that there is some parity of power in the possession of information. Because information is power. With some people being able to preserve the secrecy of things and being able to preserve privacyâfor example, with commercial in confidence provisionsâand with others not being able to 
 preserve privacy, there is an inequality in the power that is available to many people.</para><para>To return to what I was talking about earlier, when we talk about provisions that help those who have the duty to detect overpayments, to detect fraud and to ensure that the integrity of the system is preserved, when we give them powers we should ensure that those powers are used and used advisedly. I think these days there are a lot of problems with people being affected adversely by media accounts of arrests, media accounts of investigations and media accounts of what is preliminary to arrests. That is unfair on all occasions, because people are entitled to have their reputation preserved until some court, properly constituted, says that they should not. There is a difficulty these days when a lot of the information that becomes available is revealed. People's reputations are being damaged, and that is a very bad thing.</para><para>I conclude by saying that the aim of this act is a good one. The removal of the sunset clause has been undertaken. I  am glad to find out that privacy is protected, as it ought to be. The main concern is that still too often there is damage to reputations because of information being released at too early a stage. What I mean by `too early a stage' is a stage before proper process has been undertaken.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>158</page.no><name role="metadata">Lundy, Sen Kate</name><name role="display">Senator LUNDY</name><name.id>7G6</name.id><electorate>ACT</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI too rise to make a contribution to this debate in the context of the privacy implications. Senators opposite will know of my keen interest in the program of the government of outsourcing information technology services. I believe the <inline ref="r524">Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Amendment Bill 1998</inline>  provides an opportunity to comment on these matters in a reasonably comprehensive way, given that privacy is something that I have continually expressed concern about in the context of the IT outsourcing program.</para></talk.start><para>The issue of substance is this: if information about Australian citizens is in the hands of the government, it is currently protected by the Privacy Act. When that information is transferred to the private sector, it is no longer covered by that act. At this stage, despite very early and very strong statements 
 by Minister Fahey and members of the government stating that they intended to extend the application of the Privacy Act to the private sector in this context, that position has been systematically wound back to the point where the minister has indicated that it is not the intention of the government to extend that legislation in the way I have described. Instead, the government offers the notion that privacy of citizens' information in the hands of the private sector through an outsourced contract will be dealt with within very stringent contractual clauses. That is, the substance of how they intend to protect the privacy of citizens information in an outsourcing context will be contained within the confidential clause of the contract.</para><para>In terms of public accountability and public scrutiny of the privacy regime that would apply to that information, there is none. Consistently when we have approached the government through estimates and other processes to find out details of those clausesâindeed, the intention of the government with regard to this matterâwe are continually greeted with the claim of commercial in confidence. Whilst I understand that on matters of competitive advantage there may be an issue, I do not accept that the protection of citizens' privacy bears any relationship to a matter that requires the claim of commercial in confidence on behalf of a given vendor who is successful in the outsourcing program.</para><para>The concern with that information being in the hands of private vendorsâwe do not know anything about those contractsâis that, if that data is not stored in Australia and is stored physically on servers and on computer mainframes in other countries, does the Australian jurisdiction apply in terms of that privacy or does the privacy regime of the country in which that data is stored apply or is it specifically only governed by the confidential terms of the contract? Although these questions might appear quite esoteric in their nature, when it comes down to it, unless they are answered I believe there are serious gaps in the government's credibility when they state that somehow the privacy of citizens will be protected through social security or other legislation. It relates to the way in which the 
 information technology is managed by the contractor as opposed to the way in which that data is applied through the purposes and intent of the act. There is a different structural issue at play.</para><para> In the international context, these matters take on even greater complexity. For example, the European Union have recently established their own scope and guidelines with respect to the management and exchange of information. They have indicated they will not be prepared to exchange information with companies from countries without full legislative privacy protection. In the context of the current IT outsourcing program and the privatisations that were referred to by Senator Cooney, these issues can take on a trade imperative.</para><para>Some companies have expressed some concern about this. An article published early last year in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> reported the director of the Australian Privacy Foundation, Mr Tim Dixon, saying that the new move by the government would not protect citizens' privacy because most big computer-data companies did their computer processing offshore. I think the EU guidelines in this area will start to impact directly on how these IT contracts are going to be managed.</para><para>Another issue is the progress in the state of Victoria. Whilst the federal government has been reticent to legislate in this area, citing issues such as not wanting to create further red tape for companies, Victoria has seen it as being appropriate to start to legislate in this area to afford the level of privacy protection that is claimed within the community to be desirable and necessary.</para><para>The other issue concerns consumers' and citizens' confidence in the ability of the government to manage their information effectively. It is one thing to provide a mechanism through a contract, which in turn is subject to all sorts of variation and change over time, and not have access to the actual provisions of that contract; it is another to legislate, to put into the public domain not only the criteria but also the sanctions if those criteria are breached so that the citizens are 
 left in an undesirable position with regard to their privacy.</para><para>The last point I would like to mention in the context of this debate is the forthcoming IT outsourcing contract in the Australian Taxation Office. This particular request for tender was released five days before the election was announced and is currently in process. It would be interesting if the government could provide us with the types of provisions in the application of the data-matching process and in the requirements placed on the potential vendors within that request for tender. Indeed, it would also be interesting to backtrack over the contracts that have already been put in place with respect to the IT outsourcing program to see the relative privacy measures that have been put in place. But, as I have said, none of this information is available to the public because of the commercial-in-confidence shroud that descends across the contracts once they are in place.</para><para>As I said at the beginning of this contribution, this bill provides an opportunity to raise these serious concerns about privacy. Recently, the Internet Industry Association sent a letter to the Prime Minister outlining what they believeâand I certainly support itâis a very sound case for enhancing the legislative privacy regime to cover these new arrangements with respect to information technology and its management by government not only in the context of that particular program but also in the best interests of the public in protecting their privacy and therefore having confidence in the government's program.</para><para>My position is clear on the matter of IT outsourcing: in my view, privacy is one of the very good reasons why the IT outsourcing program is currently flawed. Obviously, the best case scenario in a very damaging outcome for citizens' privacy is that there be legislation. But I believe that a change in the way that program is applied and the retention of the strategic control of information technology services within government agencies is the best case scenario and that that strategic control and ownership of the data be held in the public hands.</para><para>To conclude, ownership of the data is often cited by the government as being something still in public hands and not affected by the IT outsourcing contracts. I refute this position put forward by the government in that if you relinquish the strategic control of information or data held by Commonwealth departments then you also relinquish ownership and control of that dataâalbeit technically the ownership of that data may still reside in government hands. As far as I can see, if you lose strategic control of that data it may as well be in the technical possession of the IT outsourcing vendor; in other words, in private hands and not covered in any way, shape or form by any Australian legislation relating to privacy.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>160</page.no><name role="metadata">Newman, Sen Jocelyn</name><name role="display">Senator NEWMAN</name><name.id>BE4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Family and Community Services; Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI thank honourable senators for their contributions. I share, as I think any senator would share, the opposition's concerns to see that the privacy issues are adequately addressed across the whole of government. I cannot speak for other portfolios, of course, but I can speak for the social security portfolio. It is important that I confirm, as I said by way of interjection to Senator Cooney, that a contractor with the former Department of Social Security, now the Department of Family and Community Services, is an officer for the purposes of the Social Security Act. We have a great deal of outsourcing of one kind or another.</para></talk.start><para>I draw Senator Lundy's and Senator Cooney's attention to a fairly recent example where it was very important that we made sure that every `I' was dotted and every `T' was crossed on privacy matters, and that is the optical surveillance pilot. You will recall that we were trying to do better in obtaining evidence that we would be able to take to court on people who were systematically and deliberately defrauding the social security portfolio of substantial amounts of moneyâvery clever people, if you like, who were breaking the law. The normal procedures that we used in the department made it hard to obtain the evidence. That was a case where we recognised the need to protect privacy. We 
 needed to protect the information that was held in the department and that was going to potentially end up in courts. It was vitally important as to how it was all conducted.</para><para>So if I give you that as an example, although you are not privy to the commercial-in-confidence nature of the contract, you have been assured on the public record that the Privacy Commissioner has been involved at every step of the way in devising the protection of people's privacy and the information held by the department through that process. So we effectively used the Privacy Commissioner as a consultant in trying to establish what sort of processes and what sort of contract needed to be put in place, and then requiring not just the successful tenderer but also each member of staff who would have any kind of access to the information to sign a confidentiality agreementâ</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>7G6</name.id><name role="metadata">LUNDY</name><name role="display">Senator Lundy</name></talker><para>âWhat about redress?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>BE4</name.id><name role="metadata">Newman, Sen Jocelyn</name><name role="display">Senator NEWMAN</name></talker><para>âI was just trying to get the information on that when it was my turn to get up to speak, so I cannot give you that, but I could give it to you later perhaps. I want you to understand that in this department we do focus vitally importantly on confidentiality and privacy matters, as you can imagine. We are very heavily dependent upon IT, which we heard people talking about earlier today. Also, the records of six million-odd Australians are in our care and we have to be focused. Perhaps more than almost any other department of state we have a very real understanding of the need. My experience in the 2Â½ years I have held this portfolio has been that the department and Centrelink itself have been meticulous in seeing that privacy issues are addressed.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In conclusion, while we are agreeingâand I appreciate the opposition's support hereâto repeal the sunset clause, that does not mean that the Privacy Commissioner's scrutiny is in any way diminished. The reporting to parliament, the reporting to the Privacy Commissioner and the scrutiny by the parliament and the Privacy commissioner all are maintained as they were before.

This seems to be an issue that a lot of people are putting a great deal of time and energy into. In essence, the case I made out this morning when I was dealing with this matter was that if anyone can claim a mandate it is the Labor Party, which received 52 per cent of the vote.</para></talk.start><para>I understand, particularly on 11 November, that we can look very closely at the experience of 1975. Those people who are now preaching about mandates and saying they have one on the basis of seats won were exactly the sort of people who were saying back in 1975 that it was quite legitimate to rip up the fabric of democracy in this country without any problems whatsoever and that a mandate did not mean anything at that point. Indeed, as I said before, the Liberal Party in South Australia made much of the fact that they won a majority of the votes but not a majority of the seats in 1989.

Mr Reith's behaviour in the last parliament and what he has said since the election demonstrate very clearly that the Liberals are intending to pursue what can only be described as a highly divisive and partisan policy with regard to the working people of this country.</para></talk.start><para>In a recent speech, Mr Reith spelt out the government's agenda even more clearly than was explained to us in the remarks of the Governor-General. He identified four industriesânamely, coalmining, building construction, meat processing and the maritimeâwhere he claimed there existed blockages `of a structural, attitudinal or behavioural kind that prevent optimum workplace change from being achieved'. Fresh from his defeat and his self-aggrandising war with the MUA, Mr Reith has signalled that he now wishes to turn his attention to meatworkers and their families. Some time in the future one expects that he will also be giving his attention to the CFMEU and their families.</para><para>In October of this year, after the election, the Productivity Commission released a report under its Labour Market Research Division entitled <inline font-style="italic">Work arrangements in the Australian meat processing industry</inline>. The issue of this report fits very neatly with the government's campaign to reduce the wages and conditions 
 of Australian meatworkers. Immediately after the federal election, Peter Reith made some statements to the meat employers' conference. He indicated the government would be supporting attempts by employers to strip awards that meatworkers had enjoyed in the first instance by participating in the AIRC hearings in support of an application by some companies, including the American ConAgra, in the meat industry to remove the tally provisions from industry awards. The minister said that he was prepared to legislate if necessary if the AIRC did not support the application of these firms.</para><para>In a speech to the Country Meat Works Association of New South Wales, Mr Reith launched his assault on the meatworkers by praising the Productivity Commission report. Some firms such as Australian Meat Holdings Ltd have used the National Meat Association, which covers only 30 per cent of employers, in its bid to reduce the wages of meatworkers by as much as $150 a week. They have attempted to change the basis on which the Industrial Relations Commission is able to assess the so-called no disadvantage test in certifying enterprise agreements. The Productivity Commission's report may well be used as a propaganda weapon by this government to suggest that the incentive payments scheme, known as the tally, should be removed. Clearly, that is what Mr Reith spelt out in his speech of last month.</para><para>The tally is a team based piece rate system which allows for payment based upon the production quotas for the number of head processed in a meatworks. The key recommendation of the Productivity Commission report is that the tally system be removed. This is despite the fact that, as the report itself acknowledged, the tally system as prescribed in industry awards is not widely used in the industry but rather variations of the tally have become important components of various enterprise agreements. Nor have the report's authors been deterred by the fact that tallies are one of only 20 allowable matters under this government's current legislation. The real intent of this campaign is to change the federal meat industry award so that certified agreements can be struck by 
 reductions in the relevant base award according to the so-called no disadvantage test, thereby reducing workers' wages.</para><para>I read with amazement in the overview of the report that the commission was not able to quantify precisely the benefits of changed work arrangements at the firm level. That is on page XVIII. Yet it is abundantly clear from the reading of the report that wage costs in the meat processing industry contributed only about 12 per cent to 15 per cent of the cost of production of meat to the consumer. Yet this government is attempting to support employers' claims to force down industry costs by minimising returns to workers.</para><para>The industry's own figures highlight that the cost of production is made up primarily as follows: 60 per cent for the purchase of stock; 13 per cent for transport; 27 per cent for the actual processing of meat which includes a range of charges such as meat inspection, management fees, various government charges including workers compensation and payroll tax; and training and recruitment costs. The direct return to workersâthat is, wagesâcould be estimated at between a mere 12 per cent to 15 per cent of the total cost. On this basis, and even if a worker was prepared to work for nothingâthat is, if slavery was re-introducedâthe cost reductions to consumers for a kilo of beef would be some 12c to 15c in the dollar. That is a assuming you do not actually feed your workers.</para><para>If this government and certain meat companies are successful in achieving their proposed changes, and assuming that all the cost savings were passed onto the consumer, a kilo of beef would be some 30c cheaper. If a meatworker's pay was slashed under these proposals, one meal of steak and chips would probably be less than 5c cheaper. Add on a GST that this government is so keen on and, bingo, dinner becomes an expensive proposition certainly for you and so much more so for the suddenly impoverished meatworker.</para><para>One container load of beef heading for any of our major markets under this proposal would see a minimal reduction in the cost of that beef but to the individual worker such changes would be catastrophic. Yet, if one listens to the government, one can almost be 
 convinced that all the problems faced by the meat industry can be laid at the door of meatworkers. This government, straining under the dual ambitions of Minister Reith and Minister Costello, has allowed the Productivity Commission Labour Market Research Bureau to be used in the production of a report which is fundamentally flawed both in terms of its methodology and its conclusions.</para><para>In the first instance, the report seeks to draw upon what is presented as the experiences of five companies in an industry which variously has been described as containing some 209 to 315 companies producing some $4.5 billion of red meat per annum. This is an assertion that the Productivity Commission itself acknowledged when it said on page 9 of the report:</para><para>It is not claimed that these five firms are a complete or representative sample of the whole industry.</para><para>Further, claims made in the report are drawn upon observations largely of a select group of employers. There has been no consultation with the industry union, the Australian Meat Industry Employees Union. The report similarly states that it is not possible to visit all plants and `no strong conclusions are drawn regarding the impact of changed work arrangements on employees'. It is stated that this was beyond the scope of the study to conduct an industry wide study of plants and workers.</para><para>Further, the report identifies that the study has no obvious point of international reference and that comparative studies of the operation of meat processors in Australian competitors are beyond the scope of the study. It does not identify, for instance, that, in terms of the productivity differences between Australian meatworkers and American meatworkers, American livestock is, on average, substantially larger than Australian livestock.</para><para>The report identifies a range of cost pressures on the Australian meat industry, including the costs associated with the maintenance of quality and hygiene and important questions such as industrial safety. However, it fails to address a major area of concern in the 
 industryâthat is, the issue of management practices and, in particular, the operations of a minority of dishonest and greedy employers, who have so often endangered Australian international markets by their unscrupulous and illegal behaviour.</para><para>The Productivity Commission study dismisses in an offhand manner the simple but stark fact that the live export of stock has significantly increased the cost of purchasing livestock to slaughter in Australian abattoirsâthat is, the strong growth in live export has reduced the amount of live animals available for slaughter in Australia, with an effect on price arguably as significant as any other individual factor in the meat production chain. Yet this is the report that the government relies on so heavily to defend its case for the reduction in workers' wages within this industry.</para><para>It is so often the case that, when this government talks about the need to improve productivity and flexibility in response to international competitive pressures, it sees the problem almost entirely in terms of the demands of employers to reduce wages and conditions of workers. Modern, reputable, mainstream employers such as SBA Foods in Altona, Victoria, will attest to the fact that the meat processing industry is an industry that has undergone substantive change. I recently had the opportunity to visit the abattoir at Altona, and I can attest to this simple proposition that there have been massive changes engaged in this industry. Workers have been prepared to engage in significant reorganisation of the production process.</para><para>In the fine print of the report, we see that the overwhelming number of enterprises now operate with enterprise agreements which, while using a tally system, do not rely upon a rigid interpretation of the federal Meat Industry Processing) Award 1996. That these changes have been achieved is more remarkable for the fact that they have occurred in an industry which has been characterised, in the words of the Productivity Commission itself on page 37 of the report, by `open distrust and hostility between employers and workers'. Those words clearly identify the longstanding 
 problems in regard to the relationship between workers and employers in this industry.</para><para>The report identifies the culture which was built upon `the unpleasant nature of the work environment in abattoirs; management exploitation of unfair and unsafe work arrangements; the social and geographical isolation of abattoirs; and seasonal employment'. Historically, the export industry was `notorious for its poor wages, bad conditions and strong anti-union stance by employers'. The report quotes studies which emphasise hard physical labour, brutalising and unhealthiness. For workers, this is an industry in which there are widespread occupational health and safety problems, `particularly infections from animal disease, back strain and knife wounds'. It is against this backdrop that the changes in industrial practice have been achieved, particularly where employers have been prepared to enter into genuine consultative processes with workers and their unions.</para><para>All senators who take up the claims that there need to be significant changes in meatworkers' practices should spend some time in an abattoir. They might get a better view of what it is actually like to work in this industry. They might get a better understanding of why workers are only too happy to go home.</para><para>The report acknowledges that the average earnings in the meat processing industry are not high by all industry standards and that, like many manufacturing workers, meatworkers' real wages have in fact declined over the 1980s and 1990s. It is employers who have retained a strong commitment to the tally system because it provides them with the flexibility to employ workers on a daily hire basis and reduces their costs when they stand down workers with little notice. This is something that happens on a regular basis, given that the reliability of quality stock remains the industry's most profound problem. It is easy then to understand why, contrary to the assertions of the Productivity Commission's report, the tally system is so widely used within the meat processing industry.</para><para>As I have already noted, the meat processing industry has undergone considerable 
 change over the last 20 years. The number of jobs in the industry has fallen by 30 per cent. Instead of attempting to reduce the wages and conditions of meatworkers, this government should acknowledge the real problems of the industry, which include the availability of stock, the quality and price of stock, and the changing nature of industry structure.</para><para>In particular, the government should turn its attention to the issue of increasing concentration of foreign ownership of Australian production, with the stated industry strategy of some new investors to remove competition from domestic abattoirs. Other factors that need to be considered include the quality of management, the levels of technology, the age of equipment, the quality assurance and hygiene practicesâall of which have a dramatic impact on the performance of individual enterprises and, ultimately, have a dramatic impact on the performance of Australian export markets.</para><para>I see that Senator Boswell is here. I understand that he has a keen interest in meatworks. He is an owner of one himself. I am sure he will support the remarks I am making and he will support workers who work in his abattoir. I am sure he would be opposed to cutting their wages and support American companies, such as AMA, in their bid to wipe out domestic competition.</para><para>In short, the Productivity Commission report is a shoddy piece of work. I have no doubt it will be greatly misused by this governmentâI trust not by Senator Boswellâwhich, as we saw during the MUA dispute last year, is not fussy about being careless with the truth. A more balanced inquiry into work arrangements in the meat processing industry would have given far greater attention to management practices. It would have identified the inappropriate actions of a government that not only advances the industrial claims of disreputable employers but also offers them financial incentives and other protections to continue the pursuit of their outrageous claims.</para><para>Let me cite one example of the impact of management practices in this industry. In 1997, R.J. Gilbertson's abattoir at Grafton, New South Wales, closed, leaving 245 work 
 ers not only without work or income but also owed $1.9 million in unpaid holiday leave, long service leave, redundancies and other entitlements. Recently, the meatworkers were forced to accept promises of partial payment to be received in the year 2000. We have seen similar circumstances in a number of meatworks from Wodonga to Mt Gambier, often with companies closing down, leaving behind massive debts, usually to the workers themselves, only to reopen under another guise. It is a pity we did not hear in the Governor-General's speech more about this and the actions this government intends to take to protect workers from this sort of abuse by unscrupulous employers. It is such management practices that those serious about reform in this industry need to confront.</para><para>If this government were as serious about genuine reform as it claims it is, it would be taking steps to ensure that workers were not treated so badly. Instead of finding sneaky, pseudo-intellectual and pseudo-academic ways to implement its anti-worker agenda the government could, in one single move, do an enormous amount to improve the industrial relations climate in the meat industry, and indeed in all industries throughout Australia.</para><para>Mr Reith has made for himself a reputation for attacking Australian workers. He failed dismally in the MUA dispute. He has made it perfectly clear, through use of documents such as the Productivity Commission report and other means, that he now intends to pursue the meatworkers of this country. He has also made it clear that he intends to pursue the CFMEU and its members, who are dependent upon the mining and construction industries.</para><para>This is a measure which I expect this parliament will debate at length. I make it perfectly clear that I intend to present these arguments to the parliament, to at least put another view. It is all too easy for this government to attempt to demonise people, to attempt to abuse the processes of government and to attempt to reduce the wages and conditions of workers in such a manner that actually lowers living standards. These are not well paid workers, these are not privileged workers; these are people who work in a 
 highly dangerous industry, an extremely unpleasant industry in many regards. They are proud of their work and they are highly skilled at their work. They ought to be treated with respect, they ought to be treated in a manner which recognises the important role they play in this society in making sure this country is fed. We ought to understand that this government's proposals would do little more than reduce the price of a steak by 5c a meal.</para><para>Rather than attempting to reduce the wages and conditions of workers, we ought to be making sure that there is a process that allows workers to engage in effective consultative mechanisms that do see genuine reform in industry and which make sure that the rewards put into industry are returned on a fair and reasonable basis. Unfortunately, from what I have heard in the Governor-General's speech, according to this government there is not much to be said for that way of dealing with issues.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Work arrangements in the Australian meat processing industry</inline>, the report by the Productivity Commission's Labour Market Research Bureau, is a disgrace. It is unfortunate that this group of public servants have been used in the way that they have been. A careful reading of this report demonstrates just how flawed it is. I trust the government does not seek to use it. Given the speech that the minister has already made, I am not confident that the government will not try to abuse the work that has been undertaken by this group of people. It is unfortunate that this is the way in which public servants are being used by this government. It is a measure that we should oppose and expose at every possible opportunity.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:25:00</time.stamp><page.no>167</page.no><name role="metadata">Boswell, Sen Ronald</name><name role="display">Senator BOSWELL</name><name.id>YE4</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise on this occasion of the debate on the address-in-reply to the Governor-General's speech to speak on several matters of importance. I will firstly put Senator Carr right: I do not own an abattoir; I have a shareholding in an abattoir. I think 57 per cent of Kilcoy are directly or indirectly employed by the abattoir. They are 
 great bunch of workers, a number of whom we have had for many years.</para></talk.start><para>I would like to commend the government for implementing a Productivity Commission inquiry into the impact of competition policy reforms on rural and regional Australia. While there is a lot that can be said on the effects on rural and regional Australia flowing from competition policy, it must be acknowledged that competition policy must be considered in the context of its social effects as well as its economic effects.</para><para>I would like to point out that our regional areas are supported by having viable primary industries, by having associated viable processors in country townsâsuch as occurs with the dairy industry and the horticultural industryâand that the job losses that flow from reform demands and lower prices are severe blows to rural towns.</para><para>What has to be looked at is who benefits from the lower prices leading from the reforms. In New South Wales recently when the dairy industry was deregulated, prices went down by 3.3c to the farmers and by 2c to the processors, and the retailers did not move their prices at all. With no cost reductions to the consumers, the premise behind competition reform was thwarted.</para><para>Rural Australia looks forward to the appointment on this inquiry of a commissioner from rural and regional Australia and to such a commissioner's input into the inquiry. The Treasurer, Mr Costello, put out a press release saying that there would be an assistant commissioner appointed to the Productivity Commission. Up until this time, I do not believe that that has occurred. I asked the Treasurer to look into that matter today, and I look forward to getting a result, to getting someone with a knowledge of rural Australia appointed to the inquiry.</para><para>I wish to highlight one example of a situation that could eventuate from competition policy which has the potential to decimate remote and smaller communities; that is, the effect on road building operations run by many rural local government councils. These road contractors are the main source of outside income into these communities. In fact, the local councils are oftenâalways in 
 the smaller townsâthe biggest providers of jobs in these communities. The local councils provide good secure work for their road work teams. This supports the stability of the local schools, services, the local hotel, local shops and businesses. The road building teams are certainly professional, with years of skill and experience.</para><para>Under competition policy, once a large contract is lost, the team cannot be maintained. The highly skilled team breaks up, families leave, services decrease and we see the decline of many rural communities. The Queensland state government, under Premier Borbidge, saw fit under competition policy to have an agreed price contract system, and the Commonwealth could do the same for the federal highway system. I stress that tenders are still competitive under this scheme, but communities now feel under a real threat because of the tender on the open market system.</para><para>Secondly, I take this opportunity to refer to the promised referendum on the republic proposal, which was decided at this year's Constitutional Convention. The National Party went to the convention as an united force in favour of the present systemâits workability and stability for continued good government and democracy in Australia. The National Party will be taking this position to the referendum. The National Party assures its members of this position and will make this matter clear when the relevant legislation comes before this parliament.</para><para>Speaking of the historic Constitutional Convention, which was held this year, leads naturally to my final point: to honour on this occasion a remarkable Australian, the Rt Hon. Ian Sinclair, and his eminent parliamentary career.</para><para>The Rt Hon. Ian Sinclair retires from parliament after a most valuable contribution of 35 years of parliamentary service both to the people of Australia and to his electorate of New England. In 1963, after two years in the New South Wales Legislative Council, Ian Sinclair was elected to federal parliament as the member for New England. His achievements have been immense and cover a whole range of parliamentary service.</para><para>As a politician, he successfully contested 14 elections in New England. Even in the last election campaign after his announced retirement, I was very proud to have him accompany me through parts of Queensland where he received immediate recognition and respect from the most extraordinary number of Australians.</para><para>As minister, Ian Sinclair encompassed a vast range of portfolios. Two years after entering federal parliament, he was appointed Minister for Social Services in the Menzies government. In the ensuing years, he served as Minister Assisting the Minister for Trade and Industry, Minister for Shipping and Transport, Minister for Primary Industry, Minister for Agriculture, Minister for Northern Territory, Minister for Primary Industry again, Minister for Special Trade Representations, Minister for Communications and Minister for Defence. His contributions to executive government and to these portfolios were considerable, and his many contributions are no doubt still felt today.</para><para>In opposition, he went on to hold shadow ministry positions for primary industry, defence, trade and resources, and special minister of state. He also led many parliamentary delegations for Australia with great dignity and has chaired many committees.</para><para>Ian Sinclair, as well as being an outstanding minister, is also known for his pre-eminent capacity in the parliamentary arena. His knowledge of standing orders and his conduct in parliamentary proceedings is an inspiration to all parliamentarians.</para><para>Many of us can remember the dayâI think it was in the early seventiesâwhen Speaker Cope ruled that one of the Labor government members be dismissed from the parliament. We were all listening to the wireless at that stage because it was the time of the Whitlam dismissal. That motion was not moved by the Leader of the House. Instead, it was Ian Sinclair from the opposition benches who got up and moved that the question be put that the services of that particular member be dispensed with. Even members of the Labor Party acknowledged that that was the best piece of tactics they had ever seen on the floor of parliament.</para><para>As Leader of the House from 1975 to 1979 and again from 1980 to 1982, and as opposition leader in the House from 1983 to 1997, he was an example and a lesson to us all with his knowledge and his skill. Nowadays much is written, mainly critical, of parliamentary standards and behaviour. Ian Sinclair knew and practised the protocols and procedure of the parliament, and he reinforced them by his fine example. He enhanced the reputation of the parliament by his astute use of parliamentary tactics and procedure, ensuring that the parliament functioned in its rightful way so that the high standards of parliament could be maintained and observed.</para><para>Ian Sinclair's wonderful capacity in this area and his control and command of parliamentary procedure came to the attention of all Australians when, with the Labor Party's elder statesman Barry Jones, he jointly chaired this year's historic Constitutional Convention; they both conducted themselves in an exemplary manner. It seemed a fitting conclusion to a distinguished parliamentary career that he should become the Speaker of the House of Representatives.</para><para>With his being a member of the National Party, tribute must also be paid to the contribution he made as a grassroots rural politicianâas the member for New England for over three decadesâand to the genuine representation he gave to the constituents of his electorate. It has been to the National Party, the junior member of the coalition and the party that has both an important and hard role to play in representing rural and regional Australia, that Ian has made such an enormous contribution.</para><para>Ian Sinclair was deputy parliamentary leader of the National Party for 13 years: from 1971 to 1984. As our parliamentary leader from 1984 to 1989, he was never able to occupy the position of Deputy Prime Ministerâwhich is accorded to National Party leaders in governmentâbut was responsible for steering the party with great strength through difficult periods in opposition occurring after years in government. Throughout unique and testing times, such as the `Joh for Canberra' campaign and a short period out of coalition, Ian Sinclair has been known for his 
 great dignity, strength and immense capacity. His strength of character enabled him to continue as a valuable contributor to the National Party after being succeeded as parliamentary leader.</para><para>Ian Sinclair's political career has seen its down periods, such as his intense personal scrutiny in the late 1970s and his replacement as party leader. The calibre of the man is tested in adversity. Ian Sinclair, who could have walked away after losing the leadership, chose to stay to contribute in policy areas as a shadow minister. He became in turn not only the father of our party but the father of the House of Representatives. Ian Sinclair has spanned the period from Menzies to the Howard government. That is a remarkable journey through Australian history and one he has conducted in an outstanding way.</para><para>This is such a significant occasion that I would not like it to pass without acknowledgment of the outstanding contribution that Ian Sinclair has made to our party, the National Party, this parliament and our country. I also acknowledge the contribution and fine presence during his career of his wife, Rosemary, and his family.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>170</page.no><name role="metadata">West, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator WEST</name><name.id>1X4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIn rising tonight to join in this debate, I will be critical of what we heard yesterday.

It is well worth remembering that in the upper house the majority of votes were easily won by those partiesâthe Labor Party and othersâthat either totally opposed the GST or opposed significant portions of it and wanted inquiries. That is something this government needs to remember. It is very apparent from moving around the country and listening to people in rural areas that there are grave concerns about the impact of the GST on people.</para></talk.start><para>We were told by the Prime Minister when the tax package was announced that there would be all these opportunities for consultation. There would be a committee that would decide the finer details of the GST package. 
 People went to the polls to vote on a GST after being told by the government that the finer details about the impact of the GST on health would be decided by this committee. That included issues such as what medication was exempted from GST payments and what was not. The catch-all phrase used in the initial government documentation was that prescriptions would be exempted from a GST. There was no mention of over-the-counter medication. So the aspirin, Panadol, cold and flu tablets and the cough mixtures are an unknown quantity. I suspect from my interpretation of the government's material that they are subject to a GST. One way of avoiding that will be for some people to go to the doctor and get a prescription. However, that just adds to the health costs in another area.</para><para>I had a woman ring my office late last week because she has a hearing problem. She wants to know whether the batteries for hearing aids are going to be GST exempt. The batteries used in her hearing aid are also used in electronic toys, cameras and other types of equipment. Such equipment is not considered essential in the same way that a hearing aid is. But how do you differentiate at law to make a battery for a hearing aid GST neutral or free, or whatever term they will use, and a battery for a kid's toy subject to a GST? That is a very interesting conundrum that those drawing up this legislation will have to work out. The same battery can be used in two different items. I would contend that one is essential for enabling people's daily living to be as normal as possible while the other is for pleasure. That does not strike me as very fair.</para><para>These are not minor issues. They are major issues when you consider every item that will have to be looked at for this GST. These questions should be asked in this inquiry. How long is the inquiry going to last? It will last three weeks. The government has allowed Mr Vos three weeks to come up with all the answers to all the questions arising fromâI was going to say the <inline font-style="italic">Fightback!</inline> document, but that is historyâthe document the government went to the people with. People were not told how they could make a submission. Submissions were not called for. People were 
 just told that there was going to be an inquiry and that submissions would be welcome. They were not told how they would make a submission or to whom or what contacts they should be using to make that submission. It is grossly unfair, but they are the sort of shenanigans this government is obviously going to get up.</para><para>We should have known the inquiry would be short-lived because the Prime Minister promised us before we rose in late July that there would be plenty of time for people to scrutinise the tax reform package before he called an election. Given that there were about three weeks for that to happen, we should not be surprised that he considers three weeks a lengthy period for a full-blown inquiry into something that will answer all the fine details of the GST. But it is not adequate time for people to understand and comprehend. People looking at the issue are suddenly raising questions as to what is in and what is out. The general public as well as organisations need to know what is in and what is out. This government is in obscene haste to get this legislation through so that its mates at the big end of town can have huge tax cuts while the average poor worker will receive much lower tax cuts. It is in obscene haste to help its mates.</para><para>I find it absolutely disgusting that someone on my income of around $100,000 a year is going to get an additional $63 a week under this government's tax cuts, while somebody on $20,000 to $25,000 a year, raising a family, is going to get $2 or $3, in that sort of range. That is an obscenity. I and people on incomes of $100,000 do not need an additional $63 a week when you compare it with the assistance that has been given to pensioners and to people with very low incomes. As I said, I think it is an obscenity that this government can say that this is tax reform and tax progress. This is reform for the rich; it is not reform for the people for whom life is hard, who have to scratch and eke and save every penny that they get. But this is what this government does.</para><para>They will not allow anybody any time to scrutinise the package, to look at the finer detail and to ask questions about the finer 
 detail. There are certainly some very good questions being asked. The St Vincent de Paul Society in a press release of Sunday of this week deplores the lack of compassion for the poor in the GST, and asks: where is the compassion and concern for the welfare of low income earners in this country? That is the sort of question that this government has got to answer.</para><para>It is also interesting that the Bathurst Anglican synod held in the middle of September this year, during the election campaign, passed a resolution about churches and the GST. It said:</para><para>That this synod:</para><para>1. encourages Anglicans to responsibly engage in community debate,</para><para>2. recognises that the churches, along with other community organisations, may have to share the cost of delivering a more just taxation system,</para><para>3. while stating its aim to engage all sides of politics equally, acknowledges the extent of the change implied in the Coalition Parties' Tax Reform Package, and therefore encourages western New South Wales Anglicans to seek opportunities to ask the following questions of coalition candidates before the October Federal Election,</para><para>4. requests Bishop-in-Council to arrange means of monitoring the introduction of the Government's tax reforms and authorises the Bishop-in-Council to be involved in appropriate representations to the government.</para><para>The questions are:</para><para>A. 1. For the purposes of the GST, is the fundamental unit of the church, the Parish or the Diocese? If the latter then,</para><para>2. Is the church fete considered to be a `commercial activity' for the purposes of the GST?</para><para>3. Is an on-going church `Op Shop' considered to be a commercial activity?</para><para>4. Is a church bookshop considered to be a commercial activity?</para><para>B. 5. If however, the parish is the fundamental unit and the parish opts NOT to register as an entity for GST purposes (i.e. so that any commercial activity will not be required to charge GST) how will it then reclaim any GST paid on inputs, for example when it purchases stock for its bookshop?</para><para>6. It is quite common in parishes for people in rural areas to make produce (e.g. wheat at the silos, cattle at saleyards, fruit or vegetables) available to the parish for fund-raising purposes. Is this commercial activity? 
</para><para>C. 7. If the parish is not subject to GST on materials purchased for worship (e.g. for communion supplies, stationary for pew sheets, etc.) and is not registered as an entity for GST, how will it reclaim the GST it pays on such inputs?</para><para>8. What assistance will be given to the church to assist with its compliance costs associated with the GST?</para><para>That is just one synod's questions that they want to have answered. I would suggest though that we know that if they do not register as an entity for the purposes of the GST, they pay the GST and they cop it sweet. They cannot claim any of it back. That answers that question for them. But that is not the sort of thing that they want to hear because they, with the op shops and those organisations, run a significant social assistance and charitable organisation and provide support within that framework, and this would impact very markedly upon that charitable framework and on the charitable work that they do.</para><para>If they are going to be charged the GST, it is going to impact upon the poor people and the low income people of this community and the communities in Australia even more. This is a government that does not care about the battlers. Its definition of a battler is `somebody on average weekly earnings,' which means people that are at least earning 75 per cent more than the average Australian.</para><para>Debate interrupted.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>172</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Murphy)</name></talker><para>âOrder!

The report points out:</para><para>Discrimination and vilification on the basis on religion and belief discourage participation in the community and may infringe the right to freedom of religion and belief.</para><para>At the 1996 census, 74 per cent of Australians indicated a religious belief and some 70 per cent said they were Christians. The census also highlighted the breadth of beliefs and systems of belief, with over 100 identifiable religions and beliefs. As a multicultural society, Australia welcomes this richness and diversity, respecting these religions and beliefs.</para><para>This report recommends the development of a religious freedom act which would prevent discrimination on the basis of religion or belief, except in certain specified circumstances. The report also addresses a number of other matters, including indigenous heritage, indigenous burials, autopsies, medical procedures and female genital mutilation. The report also recommends the states and the territories should repeal their laws which make witchcraft, fortune telling, sorcery and enchantment a crime.</para><para>I certainly believe this is a timely and welcome debate for the Senate because we need to work towards recognising this diversity and including a recognition of these rights in our laws. However, tonight I would like to commend the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission for addressing these issues and suggest the Senate should recognise this good work. I also want to provide the Senate with a concrete example of why our present laws need to be revisited.</para><para>Australia is home to some 200,000 Buddhists. This is one of Australia's fastest growing religions and reflects over 70 different ethnic groups in our community. Another group of increasing importance in Australia is those who have been influenced by Buddhism. The same may be said of many other religions such as Islam. This means we have a significant group of non-Christian believers in Australia and these numbers are increasing. This group of people in Australia find our existing laws are set out to meet the needs of the historical Christian beliefs and values. We need to review our laws to make sure that these different beliefs and religions are re 
 spected and that we all welcome this richness and diversity.</para><para>Buddhists' beliefs about death and dying are different to traditional Western attitudes which form the basis of our present laws. Buddhists believe that the state of mind at the moment of death is all important. This requires the maintenance of a peaceful and calm atmosphere during and after the moment of death and leaving the body undisturbed for some time after death. In contrast, our present laws assume that a person has ceased to exist or to have any particular rights as soon as clinical death takes place. This is significant in our present dealings with people and should be taken into account when drafting, for example, our autopsy laws.</para><para>This is an important issue because we seek to have freedom of religion and belief in our society. To achieve this we need to make sure that our laws are inclusive. I would welcome further debate and review of this in Australia. These are matters for the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General. The Democrats look forward to its consideration of these matters.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>173</page.no><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name><name.id>SF4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âFor the second time today I follow Senator Stott Despoja. Again I accept the sorts of things she has said. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission report entitled <inline font-style="italic">Article 18: freedom of religion and belief</inline>  is a good and timely report from Chris Sidoti, the Human Rights Commissioner, sent to the Attorney-General in July of this year. It is an interesting report because it touches on section 116 of the constitution, which says that no religion shall be established in Australia. That means that, in contrast with the situation in England, there will be no religion that is identified with the establishmentâthat is why the word `establishment' is usedâwith the system of government, that operates in this country and it prohibits the free exercise of any religion.</para></talk.start><para>In so far as there is a bill of rights in Australia, I suppose this could be an example of where we have a particular right set out in the constitution. This matter does not apply to the states and it raises the question whether or not we should have a bill of rights. This question is raised again and againâit certain 
 ly has been on a number of occasions since I have been in parliament. I think it is worth while looking at whether or not we should have a bill of rights.</para><para>I notice Mr Sidoti, the Human Rights Commissioner of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, recommends that there be an act introduced called the Religious Freedom Act which `amongst other things, recognises and gives effect to the right to freedom of religion and belief'. So he says there should be legislation. We have already got legislation against discrimination on the grounds of disability, race and sex, so there is a growing pattern of legislation which replaces, if you like, or sits in substitution for a bill of rights.</para><para>The issue of a bill of rights is not a simple one. The legislature itself can be a powerful tool to make sure that legislation respects freedoms. In that regard, the Scrutiny of Bills Committee is very good at identifying breaches of civil liberties, those sorts of things that are set out in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and bringing them to the attention of the Senate. The Senate at times does things about it. Ministers certainly do things about it. That is to be praised. So the issue of a bill of rights should be discussed again and again and should be discussed in the context of how the legislature itself and the executive too can ensure those rights which we regard as fundamental and which are set out in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.</para><para>The issue arises: is there any sort of religious oppression or religious prejudice in Australia? When I picked up this report, the first thing that came to mind is we have not got the sort of thing here that you may have in the Middle East or in Northern Ireland and it is really not an issue. But there are matters that this report raises which should give us concern as Australians. There is, for example, a matter in relation to Muslims. The Islamic Council of Victoria had much to say about the situation there. It said that particularly during the 1990 Gulf crisis there was prejudice against people simply because they were Muslims. That is a very bad matter and it is 
 something that we should take up and discuss further.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>174</page.no><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name><name.id>LI4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI wish to make a couple of comments on this Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission report. In an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline>  regarding a barn contractor, under the headline `Complaints to Ombudsman down eight percent', it is reported that complaints were down to the Ombudsman. Similarly, in this report complaints are down. There is a report that complaints under the Racial Discrimination Act have fallen by more than a third over the past year.</para></talk.start><para>Andrew Bolt, in an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Herald-Sun</inline>, says that in the report the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission comments that the figures are incongruent with the anecdotal evidence and feelings on race issues, which have seemed more heated than ever. He regrets that the commission talks of anecdotal evidence, because the number of complaints are down. In some ways I would have to agree with Andrew Bolt. I think it is important that those figures are down, given the heated climate we had during the last 12 months and given the debate that we had in the community. I was very proud that One Nation's vote in Victoria was so low. One Nation was a party that really fired things up. It used racial issues and immigration issues in debates in a way that most of us here in this chamberâalmost to a personâdid not approve or agree with. Yet those complaints have gone down.</para><para>It may be that anecdotally some people may say there was an increase in some acts of discrimination but they were not reflected in that annual report, and I think that is something which we can celebrate. Hopefully it is a reflection of the fact that, despite the issue being raised so publicly, despite what seemed to be a heated debate, people were not discriminated against and this is a true reflection of the tolerance that we in Australia take pride in towards people in our multicultural community.</para><para>It is important that we look at this report. There have been two proven cases of racial 
 discrimination, but this decrease in the number of complaints reflects that it is important for us as Australians to continue to debunk the sorts of myths that were around during the past 12 months. I am very pleased to say that I think the results of the election were a true reflection, especially in Victoria, of the very tolerant society that Australia has. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para><para>Leave granted; debate adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation</title><page.no>174</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>174</page.no><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name><name.id>656</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI move:</para></talk.start><para>That the Senate take note of the document.</para><para>This report is significant because this is the last report of the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation. The reason it is their final report is that, under the new arrangements that were approved in the sessions of the last parliament, the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation will cease to exist and will be replaced by a new industry structureânamely, three new companies. Those companies will be owned by the industryâthat is, the producers, the processors and the live exporters. It represents the culmination of a process of change put in place by the previous Labor governments as far back as the early 1980s. Indeed, the report in its overview reflects upon the achievements of the industry and the major difficulties faced by the industry over the last 10 to 15 years. Those of us who have watched developments in the industryâno doubt people like Senator Macdonald in a broader capacity in terms of the commodity sector generallyâcan recall the difficulties that have confronted the rural sector  all those years. That has been the case particularly in our beef and sheep meat industries.</para><para>We have battled and we continue to battle against unfair subsidies, subsidy regimes and market lockouts that occur by some of our trading partners. It has been a constant battle over the years. The report notes that back in 1985âand my recollection is that it was under the then minister, John Kerinâthe new direction for the beef and sheep meat industry commenced. That new direction sought to 
 pursue goals of improving and protecting access to our export markets, of improving the marketing systems of the industry, of supporting the industry's meat and livestock products through promotional and advertising activity, and of improving our market intelligence.</para><para>Any fair assessment of the industry would recogniseâas indeed this report recognisesâthat some tremendous achievements were made. I have to say that all of those achievements were made under the previous Labor governments. This report notes the great work that was done leading to liberalisation of beef imports into Japan in 1988. It also notes the agreement reachedâknown as the Kerin-Anderson accordâwhich related to access into Asia and the European Union markets. These were achievements of the then Labor government under great primary industry ministers such as John Kerin and his successor, Bob Collins. This is the record. It is there in this report.</para><para> But when you hear members of the government speak on the subject, you would think that nothing had ever been achieved. The reason the beef and sheepmeat industries stand in a position today that culminates in the establishment of these new bodies with industry support and with government support is because of the groundwork done under the Labor government at that time: the great work that was done in the Uruguay Round and the work that was done in pursuing actions through GATT in order to get liberalised trade arrangements with our second most important Asian marketâKorea. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>175</page.no><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name><name.id>SF4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI want to say a few words on the annual report of the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation after being inspired by Senator Forshaw, who has been an outstanding contributor to this chamber over the years, particularly in this area.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>656</name.id><name role="metadata">FORSHAW</name><name role="display">Senator Forshaw</name></talker><para>âAnd will continue to be.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>SF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name></talker><para>âAnd he will continue to be.

I do not want to anticipate anything that will go on there, nor do I want to interfere in any way with what may presently be being discussed before the commission. But I know there is a willingness on the union's part to be very cooperative in this field. It would be a pity if people were to attempt to create in the meat industry what was created in the Maritime Union earlier this year. There are at times signs that that might happen as people demand more and more of the workers in the meat industry and expect to pay a little less. That is a bad thing.</para><para>What must happen not only in the meat industry but also through industry as a whole is the development of a culture of cooperation, and people must listen to each other.

I want to take one example, which is the Northern Prawn Fishery. The Northern Prawn Fishery spans an area from the Torres Strait to the top of Western Australia. It is a very substantial area of Australia's waters. In a given year, there is a reasonableâbut not a hugeâquantity of prawns taken out of those waters. The prawns 
 that are taken out are invariably banana prawns, tiger prawns and Endeavour prawns.</para><para> The Australian Fisheries Management Authority is proposing that the catch in the Northern Prawn Fishery be quite substantially reduced. Honourable senators such as Senator McKiernan who have been here for some time will well recollect that about eight years ago we went through a process of reducing the Northern Prawn Fishery, and it was done by agreement with all parties.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>1I4</name.id><name role="metadata">McKIERNAN</name><name role="display">Senator McKiernan</name></talker><para>âA buyback.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>EU4</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Chee, Sen Bill</name><name role="display">Senator O'CHEE</name></talker><para>âYes, it was a buyback. But everybody agreed to it because it was necessary at that time to reduce the effort. AFMA is now saying it is required that we reduce the effort even further, because it believes that the stock of prawn in the Northern Prawn Fishery is being fished out.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Unfortunately for AFMA, in each of the last three years the catch of prawn has increased. I know that with an increase in catch it does not necessarily automatically follow that there are sufficient reserves there. But what you have to remember with prawns is that the life cycle is usually no more than 14 months. So if the stocks of prawn were being fished out, it is unlikely that you would manage to increase the catch for each year over three years. Allowing for increases in technology, it still would not be possible if, in fact, there was too much effort going into the fishery. So it stands to reason that we should query the effort that is being put into AFMA to reduce the total catch out of this fishery.</para><para>It is my belief that the increase in catch in each of the last three years compels us to say that maybe AFMA is wrong in saying that the prawn fishery is being fished out. Maybe it is the case that AFMA needs to do more research. But it is certainly the case that if a government authority is going to recommend to a minister that legislation be brought forward to take away people's right to fish in a fishery, a right for which they have paid, then AFMA should have its science refined to such an extent that it is irrefutable. I do not believe that is the case. There is a very substantial portion of the prawn fishing industry which does not agree with AFMA on the simple issue of whether effort in the 
 fishery should be reduced, let alone agreeing with AFMA on the mechanism by which that effort should be reduced. That, too, is highly contentious.</para><para>This is not the first time in recent years that AFMA has been found to be wrong. It would not be the first time that AFMA has been forced to change its position because the industry or the public or other people have challenged AFMA's so-called science. It is my belief that it is appropriate that AFMA go back and re-examine their research and take additional time to look at issues such as what are the spawning and recruiting areas for these species of prawn before they come to a rash decision to buy back people's entitlements to fish. Because if people's entitlements are brought back they will never be replaced and you will invariably drive good people out of an industry which at the moment is continuing on a sustainable basis.

With the coalition back in government, the opening of parliament yesterday marks a significant period of reform in Australia's history. On 3 October Australians voted for a continuation of the Howard government's sound economic managementâmanagement which has kept at bay the Asian economic crisis.</para></talk.start><para>During the five-week election campaign I visited 42 seats in New South Wales and the thing that struck me most there was the general recognition of the need for tax reform. Australians voted for tax reform to end the unfair tax burden on middle Australia. They rejected Labor's bandaid approach to tax reform, particularly their retrospective capital gains tax slug, which would have especially penalised Australian family farms.</para><para>As a government and as individuals we know the commitments made to our electorates and we are here to honour them to ensure a bold future into the 21st century for all Australians. Despite the knowledge that tax reform is crucial for the future funding of essential social services, the opposition and the Democrats will no doubt attempt to scuttle the government's commitments for no other reason than opposition's sake. Nothing illustrates this clearer than Gareth Evans's letter to Professor Garnett of ANSTO on 11 May of this year, 1998. He wrote:</para><para>I am afraid that the realities of politics in an election year, and in particular our need to win Hughes, have led us to a position of opposing a new reactor at the Lucas Heights siteâas difficult as that may be to justify in objective safety-focused terms.</para><para>And I have to say that he would have to be a dope to write the letter. Just as Labor were prepared to ignore sound advice for political expedience, they will put the nation's economy and the government's ability to provide essential services at risk.</para><para>The Democrats will come in here and claim their own mandate. The Democrats' election 
 campaign was arrogant. The inference in their campaign that they or One Nation should control the Senate was arrogant. The Democrats say they could now claim a mandate on the GST with only 8.46 per cent of the vote. That is a misguided conception, particularly in light of a major polling study conducted by the Liberal Party on 3 October which showed that only 13 per cent of people who voted for the Democrats cited the GST as a reason for voting Democrat. I ask the Democrats not to be deceived by their hallucination of a mandate nor use the 1.1 per cent of the voting population to hold the country and its people to ransom.</para><para>It is well known that Labor will do whatever it takes to win government. But it did not quite work this time. Over coffee and soft candlelight, Labor promised Cheryl Kernot a sure bet. Too bad if the local electorate did not want her imposed upon them. The Labor Party were lucky with this one, but a fat lot of good it will do them. If her advice as leader of the Democrats to Senator Woodley is any guideâthat is, to `stay out of the bush because there are no votes there'âher commitment and understanding of the bush is nil. Labor has written off the bush with the appointment of Cheryl Kernot to her portfolio.</para><para>Unlike Labor and their self-confessed uninterested regional spokesperson, our commitment to rural and regional Australia is reflected in a wide range of initiatives, including rural transaction centres, a $3.5 billion initiative in our tax reform plan to slash the cost of fuel and a $70 million boost to the $250 million Regional Telecommunications Infrastructure Fund. The coalition is well aware of the difficulties of the bush and pledges itself to assist the bush through these difficult times.</para><para>Labor were not so lucky in New South Wales with their big names. David Hill was doing so poorly in the seat of Hughes against our local Danna Vale that Labor even had to do a deal with One Nation. On polling day I visited the Oyster Bay Primary School to vote and found a man who claimed to represent One Nation handing out material on how to vote for One Nation. Attached to that material was a preference card for David Hill, bearing 
 the name of the New South Wales ALP Secretary, John Della Bosca. When questioned, the One Nation person explained that the two pieces of material were delivered to the booth prepackaged together. Labor professed to take the high moral ground in relation to One Nation and then did dirty deals to get their man over the line. I seek leave to table evidence of Labor's hypocrisyâthe material that was prepackaged in a deal with One Nation in strategic booths.</para><para>Leave granted.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>C16</name.id><name role="metadata">Heffernan, Sen Bill</name><name role="display">Senator HEFFERNAN</name></talker><para>âOn the Central Coast, former senator Belinda Neal thought she would try her hand in Robertson. There is no harm in trying, but she need not have bothered. No matter how many maritime unionists poured in there and no matter how much money and time John Della Bosca poured in there, contrary to sound political judgment and much to the distress of the Left in New South Wales, nothing worked. Residents know that Jim Lloyd had delivered many social benefits to the families on the Central Coast and would continue to represent their interests in Canberra.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In a similar fashion, Maggie Deahm was a reminder to voters in Macquarie why they voted for Kerry Bartlett in 1996. She was part of the Keating crew who increased their cost of living by increasing taxes when it had promised it would not. They knew what we knew: you cannot trust Labor. Kerry has worked hard for the people of Macquarie and they wanted him to keep on doing it.</para><para>The hard work of Jackie Kelly, Ross Cameron, John Fahey, Joanna Gash and Garry Nairnâin conjunction with good local campaigns and a well-managed state campaignâmeant that New South Wales held the line.</para><para>On behalf of my New South Wales colleagues, I wish to welcome to parliament Bruce Baird, the member for Cook and Alby Schultz, the member for Hume. Both members have an outstanding record of public service and I look forward to working with them to achieve greater things for their electorates and the people of New South Wales.</para><para>Unfortunately, some of our Liberal candidates were unsuccessful at the ballot box. The 
 most disappointing results for me personally were the defeats of Bob Baldwin and Robert Lee. Bob, a tireless electorate worker, was always in a difficult position. I wish Bob all the best in his future directions. Robert Lee's fate in Lowe was unfortunately sealed by the ultimate preference betrayal by Paul Zammit.</para><para>On behalf of the New South Wales division, I wish to thank the following candidates for their extraordinary campaign efforts: Alan Akhurst, Nahid Aziz, John Coles, Peter Craig, Mathew Cross, Lorna Doona, Tio Faulkner, Alma Freame, Bruce Gatgens, Stephen Iacono, Clive Jensen, James Jordan, David Kibbey, Robert Lee, Scott MacDougall, Cherrilyn McLean, Michael Armani, Charlie Mifsudâand I have to say that Charlie has done a great job since the election down in WollongongâPeter Monley, Bruce Morrow, David Parker, Joe Rafferty, Maureen Shelley, Gary Sloane and Andrew Thorn. Without them and their small band of loyal workers, the party would not have been able to fly the Liberal flag across the state. The job at times is very difficult and, as a senator and a Liberal, I appreciate immensely the work they put in and the sacrifices they made.</para><para>As Chairman of the New South Wales Marginal Seat Committee, I wish to congratulate Michael Osborne, Remo Nogarotto, Mark Connell and their small professional team for their successful campaign. Despite the barrage of Labor campaign funds, the unconditional support of the union movement and Labor's bag of dirty backyard tricks, the division held the Liberal line in New South Wales. On behalf of my parliamentary colleagues and candidates, I wish to express my thanks for their sound strategy, support and patience. I also wish to express my thanks to Lynton Crosby and all at national campaign headquarters.</para><para>The New South Wales division is a great team. Thanks must also go to the information unit for providing policy and election information to the public and to the party members who letterboxed, ran street stalls, stood on polling booths and scrutineered. A special thanks must also go to those workers who travelled great distances to support the cause 
 and those who gave up their time in the days following the poll to scrutineer.</para><para>Madam President, I look forward to the election of a Collins-led New South Wales government in March.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Federal Election</title><title>Pork Industry: Imports</title><title>Wool Industry</title><page.no>179</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>179</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI wanted to also reflect on the recent election campaign. It was during that campaign that the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Fischer, wrote in response to a letter which, curiously, was sent to Senator Brownhill, the parliamentary secretary. Apparently Mr Fischer said that he was responding because he had been asked to respond on Senator Brownhill's behalf, which seems somewhat unusual. The response was to a Mr Mazzanti, a member of the South Queensland Pork Action Group. I suppose it is unusual that the Deputy Prime Minister would respond on behalf of a parliamentary secretary, but he is noted for doing unusual things.</para></talk.start><para>The letter ran through the usual lines about getting macro-economic settings right and the importance of a free trade regime to the overall wellbeing of the rural community. It also suggested that there are now effective anti-dumping and safeguard procedures to deal with instances where Australian producers for the domestic market are being injured by unfair competition from imports.</para><para>He did claim quite inaccurately, I might say, that the opposition's call for action to protect the interests of the pork industry by limiting imports was in contravention of the World Trade Organisation rules. That is not true. He referred to the alleged transport cost savings to rural and regional Australia in the Howard tax plan, but he did not mention the imposition of a $30 billion goods and services tax.</para><para>At the bottom of that letter, the Deputy Prime Minister added a postscript. He said:</para><para>The pork industry's continuing advertising campaign is very carefully noted, including those elements of the industry pushing it. 
</para><para>Despite the denial from the Deputy Prime Minister's office, this postscript is nothing less than a threat. The impact of One Nation on the Australian political scene and the failure of the Prime Minister to deal with the former member for Oxley at the appropriate time when he had the opportunity has shown up a number of forms.</para><para>Firstly, the One Nation Party has brought with it increased racial tension, and there is now increased insecurity in the community. We have also seen the fact that the National Party seems to be in terminal decline. Senator O'Chee and Senator Macdonald will cease to be senators on 1 July next year, leaving the National Party without formal party status in this place.</para><para>The presence of One Nation has also driven a number of simplistic policy responses from the governmentâthe most obvious being the decision by the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, to ignore the advice of his minister for primary industries, which was Mr Anderson at the time, and the vast majority of the Australian wool industry to freeze the wool stockpile. Mr Howard has subsequently found that his decision, which was based on Mr Tuckey's and Senator Crane's intervention, was not in fact legally based. Since that decision, we can only describe the current situation as a fiasco.</para><para>There is total confusion in the market, which has resulted from Mr Howard's actions, leaving the responsible minister, the industry and the Public Service to try to sort out the mess. In this case, Mr Howard has not acted in the interests of the wool industry but in the interests of a small number of members of the coalition who were terrified of One Nation. He chose not to develop a comprehensive policy response to increasingly difficult industry problems because he preferred a quick political fix. The former primary industries minister, Mr Anderson, tried to get it right, but he was pushed aside in this political exercise.</para><para>The pork industry suffered a similar fate. The government did not properly consult, considering the considerable difficulties and circumstances that that industry faced and 
 continues to face. The government did not look at all the possible policy remedies available.</para><para>It appears to me that, although there had been a massive surge in imports, although the importers had targeted the peak season for product on the domestic market, although importers had focused on the premium cuts of the product and although there had been a collapse in the price received by Australian producersâa price well below the cost of productionâthe government dismissed any short-term assistance through the provision of exceptional circumstances. The government also, unfortunately, ignored possible trade remedies, legal remedies, available through the World Trade Organisation.</para><para>It was a resolution of this Senate in April this year that pointed the government in the direction of World Trade Organisation safeguard measuresâmeasures the government could draw on to provide some relief for an industry that was clearly under siege, measures that a number of our trading partners, I might add, regularly use. However, the government merely was content to give the industry some money to develop exports. It is my view that, again, it was the threat of One Nation that caused the government to belatedly respond to the pork industry. But, as with the wool stockpile, the government did not respond in an open and comprehensive way. It was not the way you would expect a government to operate.</para><para>In a special gazette dated 25 June, the government detailed the general procedures to be followed by the Productivity Commission when investigating possible safeguard action under the World Trade Organisation. Section 16 on page 4 of the gazette states:</para><para>A reference can also be made to the Commission for an accelerated report to determine whether critical circumstances exist where delay in applying measures would cause damage which might be difficult to repair.</para><para>The Commission will report to the Minister on whether there is clear evidence that increased imports have caused or are threatening to cause serious injury.</para><para>This provision is designed clearly to provide immediate but short-term relief to enable a more comprehensive inquiry to proceed, and 
 the industry quite reasonably expects the government to make such an assessment. One would have expected the government to look at all policy options available to deal with the particular issue. There was clearly a crisis, and there was an independent report from the University of Queensland that did identify imports as the major cause of the industry's problem. However, it has become clear that the government has no intention of looking at that option at all.</para><para>As required, the Treasurer formally advised the World Trade Organisation of the government's intention to investigate the impact of pig meat imports and the reasons for the inquiry. However, section 3(iii) of that advice stated:</para><para>The current investigation is not examining the need for provisional measures.</para><para>In other words, we are going to investigate, but we do not think there is a case. The World Trade Organisation's rules say we can investigate the need for short-term help, but we will not apply those rules. We will take up to 140 days to look at this and then we will have our nominee run the process. We will not have the industry nominate a commissioner to sit alongside our nominee, or we will not have an independent chair. That is what the government is saying. The government is saying that we are not prepared to ensure that justice is not only done but also seen to be done, and, I might say, that is the view of the industry. The Australian pork industry at this time feels well and truly dudded by this government process. It feels that the government has failed to respond to genuine industry concerns in a timely manner. When the government finally did act, it acted in a way which was designed to take the pork industry's concerns off the agenda in time for the election.</para><para>I am concerned that the results of the Productivity Commission report will reflect, in the end, the government's free trade at all cost bias which has been deliberately built into this process. This industry is not seeking a One Nation style response. It is looking for a comprehensive and legal response to a personal and financial crisis confronting many producers. To date, it has not got that. It quite 
 reasonably took its case to the public during the election campaign. Clearly, the government was very upset with that response.</para><para>The postscript on the bottom of Mr Fischer's letter makes it clear that this government intends to make the Australian pork industry pay a political price for its actions. The Australian pork producers are committed to the development of a sustainable, export oriented and jobs generating industry. Unlike the government generally, and the Deputy Prime Minister in particular, we on this side of the chamber are committed to work constructively with them to achieve that goal.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Liquefied Petroleum Gas: Prices</title><title>Diesel</title><page.no>181</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>181</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise tonight to speak to a submission I have made to the inquiry by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission on LPG cylinder prices in Western Australia and LPG auto gas prices in Western Australia. At the beginning, I seek leave to table my submission to this inquiry.</para></talk.start><para>Leave granted.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>DX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name></talker><para>âI thank the Senate. In relation to my submission to the ACCC inquiry into LPG gas prices in Western Australia, I am concerned about the role the Western Australian government has played in the prices that Western Australian consumers pay for LPG gas and bottled gas. Under the Trade Practices Act, it is now possible to prosecute state governments if there is evidence of collusion and, in this case, if there is evidence found of collusion with Wesfarmers Kleenheat in keeping LPG prices unnecessarily high in Western Australia.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I am concerned if the Western Australian government has either deliberately colluded with or tacitly approved of Wesfarmers Kleenheat's substantial monopoly market power over the supply and sale of LPG in Western Australia. There was a trust given to the West Australian government and to the people of Western Australia to look at the price of the gas as produced by Wesfarmers Kleenheat and the other market players and the ability of Wesfarmers Kleenheat to domi 
 nate WA's LPG market at the expense of Western Australian consumers causing LPG prices for both cylinder and auto gas to be, in some cases, two to three times higher than in Victoria.</para><para>I believe the West Australian government has failed to honour an agreement made in 1994 where the Prices Surveillance Authority agreed to lift the mandating of prices if the West Australian government and producers increased the supply of LPG auto gas and cylinder gas. The Prices Surveillance Authority lifted the mandate, but the government sat on its hands and now they could, under the law, be taken to court and prosecuted because of that. This inaction by the West Australian energy minister and the West Australian government has not been warranted and has been clearly against the public interest. There is no capital barrier to enter the LPG market.</para><para>There have been six different partners in the North West Shelf to chose from. LPG could be shipped to Fremantle from any of these six partners or from LPG suppliers overseas. These North West Shelf partners will shortly decide to almost double the volume of LPG produced after the year 2000 to almost two million tonnes per year. Woodside Petroleum actually told me that they would be prepared to sell and ship LPG to wholesalers in Perth and into Western Australia's domestic markets.</para><para>Not only has the West Australian government failed to look after consumers, but they failed to provide environmental leadership for the whole community. By increasing suppliers and keeping the prices down, the West Australian government could create an economic incentive for heavier diesel powered vehicle owners to change to gas. Heavier vehicles produce 70 per cent of the total vehicle pollution and alternative fuels like LPG and CNG could cut these emissions by over 50 per cent.</para><para>There is now growing scientific evidence of increased cancer risks, asthma, respiratory ailments and an increased death rate from diesel fumes. Perth already suffers from haze alerts and temperature inversion of the atmosphere between the hills and the coast. The example that has been given from Kyoto 
 University in Japan has found diesel has one of the most carcinogenic compounds ever detected, a substance called nitrobenzathrone. A study of diesel bus drivers in Copenhagen has found 60 per cent higher lung and 40 per cent higher bladder cancer rates amongst those drivers.</para><para>I believe the West Australian energy minister has turned his back on the people of Western Australia when he could have made a real difference to the quality of the air they breathe. I believe these issues are important. I believe it is very important that the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has the full information it needs for this inquiry. I will be keeping a very close eye on the outcome and making sure that we can get better outcomes for consumers, for the environment and for small business in a win-win situation in Western Australia.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Pork Industry: Competitiveness</title><page.no>182</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>182</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Sandy</name><name role="display">Senator SANDY MACDONALD</name><name.id>CX5</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI want to make some comments tonight about the pork industry and correct some of the views expressed by Senator O'Brien earlier. The pig meat industry is very important to all of us who live in regional Australia. The government is very aware of the pain that is being felt by many producer families. The government and the pork industry are working in partnership to improve the pork industry's international competitiveness.</para></talk.start><para>The government Pork Industry Restructure Strategy is based on outcomes from a number of strategic studies. It includes a $19 million integrated package of grant programs to assist individual enterprises and groups to achieve a strong market focus and improve their international competitiveness in the global food market. The $19 million pork industry adjustment package comprises the $10 million National Pork Industry Development Program, which can fund projects ranging from market research to skills acquisition, the $8 million Pigmeat Processing Grants Program, which aims to stimulate investment in the processing sector, and the $1 million that has been provided under FarmBis for a national skills enhancement training initiative for pork producers. Funding approvals under the $10 
 million National Pork Industry Development Program commenced in July 1998 and to date some $2.8 million has been approved by the government for projects in production, processing and retailing sectors.</para><para>There is much more to be done for the pork industry. Some examples of the projects that have been approved include a major domestic market development promotion for fresh pork and baconâmanaged by the Australian Pork Corporation and financially supported by the retail industryâand other projects are in the areas of risk management, market development, production and training.</para><para>The national pork industry development group is working in close consultation with industry on several initiatives, including driving forward the key elements of their business plan such as export development, the formation of networks alliances and managing a benchmarking study of the pork industry chain. The $8 million Pigmeat Processing Grants Program provides investment grants to eligible specialist pig meat processors to improve the competitiveness of this important sector. The program will stimulate investment in the processing sector by funding up to 10 per cent of the costs associated with new plant and equipment with a cap of half a million dollars per company per year over the three-year life of the program.</para><para>In addition, Senator O'Brien referred to the referral of the problems of the importation of pig meat to the Productivity Commission. The government announced in June that it would introduce a general safeguard mechanism as part of the recent pig industry assistance program. The Productivity Commission was designated as the appropriate domestic agency to conduct inquiries and report on whether safeguard action, in accordance with the World Trade Organisation agreement on safeguards, is warranted against imports of certain frozen pig meat, predominantly that from Canada.</para><para>This is the first safeguards inquiry undertaken by Australia under the new rules that came into operation in 1995. Safeguard measures provide temporary assistance and an opportunity to adjust for an industry suffering serious injury or threatened by serious injury 
 as a result of increased imports. The Productivity Commission will also report on factors affecting the profitability and competitiveness of domestic pig farming and pork processing industries.</para><para>Professor Richard Snape, the inquiry's commissioner, has implemented a transparent process with regular updates on progress being available to interested people. The reporting deadline is this Friday, 13 November 1998. That date was set by the Treasurer. The report will be published and made available in due course.</para><para>The Productivity Commission will determine whether there has been serious injury and the remedy that is appropriate. The remedy also has to be in the public interest before a recommendation as to what safeguard can be applied. The inquiry process and remedy is governed, as I said, by the World Trade Organisation rules, and the Canadian pork industry has taken a keen interest in the inquiry, as well they might.</para><para>Staff from the department met with Professor Snape on 4 August 1998, and the department outlined the flexibility on variables impacting on the industry's current situationâthe government's $19 million integrated package of business assistance programs, RASAC's decision and the range of welfare assistance measures presently available and those also available under the AAA package. During these meetings, Professor Snape indicated an appreciation of the government's interest in releasing the inquiry's findings quickly. I look forward to the commissioner's ruling on whether safeguard action is warranted and the commissioner's finding in relation to the factors affecting the profitability of this very important Australian industry.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><adjournment><adjournmentinfo><time.stamp>19:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>183</page.no></adjournmentinfo><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senate adjourned at 7.51 p.m.</inline></para></adjournment><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>183</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tabling</title><page.no>183</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following government documents were tabled:</para><para>Administrative Review CouncilâReport to the Attorney-General and Minister for JusticeâNo. 42âThe contracting out of government services, August 1998.

All factions involved in the conflict have claimed responsibility for employing these weapons. Thus, a degree of threat to the civilian population remains.</para><para>(2) There are presently no ADF personnel on Bougainville who are trained in Explosive Ordnance Disposal. Consideration was given by the Peace Monitoring Group (PMG) to deploy such personnel. However, it was assessed that the presence of explosives did not present a sufficiently serious threat to PMG personnel. No member of the PMG has been injured by a mine or booby trap on Bougainville. Further, the PMG's medical team has neither seen nor treated any local person injured by a mine or booby trap.</para><para>(3) During the last eight years, a quantity of smoke or training (non-operational) grenades, practice grenades and practice grenade fuses have been exported to Papua New Guinea (PNG) by Australian industry. However, there is no record of operational grenades, or firing devices demolition, being exported to the PNG Defence Forces (PNGDF) by Australian industry during this time. Given the nature of these items, it is highly unlikely that Australian grenades have been used as 
 booby traps on Bougainville. In 1992, an Australian company did demonstrate its operational grenades to the PNGDF in PNG. However, no sales resulted.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Medicare: Alternative Medicine</title><page.no>201</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 1318)</subtitle><id.no>1318</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>201</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator Margetts</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Family Services, upon notice, on 19 August 1998:</para></talk.start><para>(1) When provided by a registered medical practitioner, does Medicare refund for (a) ozone therapy; (b) remedial massage; (c) herbal medicine; (d) naturopathy; (e) homoeopathy, (f) chiropractic/osteopathy; (g) acupuncture; and (h) iridology.</para><para>(2) Given that (a) various countries set the education gold standard for manipulation via registration of chiropractors and osteopaths; (b) the Federal Government finds tertiary education at that standard; and (c) the State and Territory Governments license graduates of those courses: does the undergraduate education in medicine provide equivalent education and clinical experience in the following non-medical procedures to equip general practitioners to practice: (a) iridology; (b) ozone therapy; (c) remedial massage; (d) herbal medicine; (e) naturopathy; (f) homoeopathy; (g) chiropractic/osteopathy; and (h) acupuncture; if not, what post graduate education and clinical experience is needed to equate general practitioners with the unique competency in these areas.</para><para>(3) Do medical registration boards require a distinct equivalent qualification prior to medical practitioners being permitted to hold themselves out to practice and charge for: (a) iridology; (b) ozone therapy; (c) remedial massage; (d) herbal medicine; (e) naturopathy; (f) homoeopathy; (g) chiropractic/osteopathy; and (h) acupuncture; if not, where did the medical profession acquire its educational and research background in these areas.</para><para>(4) What government body sets the prerequisite educational and clinical experience requirements for Medicare reimbursements, if any) in: (a) iridology; (b) ozone therapy; (c) remedial massage; (d) herbal medicine; (e) naturopathy; (f) homoeopathy; (g) chiropractic/osteopathy; and (h) acupuncture.</para><para>(5) How does Medicare differentiate between general practitioners who have no training in each of these modalities and those who have attained equivalent standards.</para><para>(6) What is the minimum post-graduate education and clinical experience in spinal manipulation required by Medicare prior to reimbursing that service by a general practitioner.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>201</page.no><name role="metadata">Herron, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator Herron</name><name.id>VW4</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe Minister for Health and Family Services has provided the follow

A clinically relevant service is one which is generally accepted in the medical profession as being necessary for the appropriate treatment of the patient to whom it is rendered.</para><para>Ozone therapy, remedial massage, herbal medicine, naturopathy, homoeopathy, chiropractic/osteopathy, acupuncture and iridology are not specifically listed as services in the MBS. Medicare benefits would be payable for the consultation by a medical practitioner at which these services were performed, if all the requirements of the relevant consultation item descriptor were met and the services were considered to be clinically relevant.</para><para>(2) The regulation of health care, including the regulation of medical practice and registration of medical practitioners, is a State matter.</para><para>It is understood that States do not currently require providers of iridology, ozone therapy, remedial massage, herbal medicine, naturopathy, homoeopathy or acupuncture to be registered. In the absence of any agreed standard within these areas of practice, it is impossible to speculate what level of education or experience a medical practitioner would require to obtain an equivalent level of competency in these areas.</para><para>In relation to chiropractic/osteopathy it is understood that State Chiropractors Boards are responsible for registering all practitioners, including medical practitioners who wish to call themselves chiropractors. The issue of what level of training a medical practitioner must meet in order to call themselves a chiropractor is therefore a matter for the State Chiropractors Boards.</para><para>(3) The requirements of registration with State medical boards is a State matter. However, it is understood that medical boards (State Chiropractors Boards are not medical boards) do not require a medical practitioner to provide them with details of qualifications in relation to iridology, ozone therapy, remedial massage, herbal medicine, naturopathy, homoeopathy, chiropractic/osteopathy or acupuncture before the medical practitioner can provide such services.</para><para>It is not possible to state how the medical profession as a whole acquired its educational and research background into the areas of iridology, ozone therapy, remedial massage, herbal medicine, naturopathy, homoeopathy, chiropractic/osteopathy or acupuncture.</para><para>In the absence of any regulation or recognised training options, it is generally expected that it is 
 the professional responsibility of individual medical practitioners to ensure that they are appropriately qualified to provide any particular service. This general principle would apply equally to services relating to iridology, ozone therapy, remedial massage, herbal medicine, naturopathy, homoeopathy, chiropractic/osteopathy and acupuncture.</para><para>It is also understood that training specifically targeted at medical practitioners in some areas, such as acupuncture, is available through the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP). In the case of acupuncture there is also a body, the Australian Medical Acupuncture Society (AMAS), which represents medical acupuncturists and is working with the RACGP to develop appropriate training and standards for medical acupuncturists.</para><para>(4) There is no government body that sets prerequisite educational and clinical experience requirements for Medicare reimbursements in relation to iridology, ozone therapy, remedial massage, herbal medicine, naturopathy, homoeopathy, chiropractic/osteopathy or acupuncture.</para><para>(5) The Commonwealth does not discriminate between general practitioners that have n training in iridology, ozone therapy, remedial massage, herbal medicine, naturopathy, homoeopathy or acupuncture, and those who have not for the purposes of paying Medicare benefits.</para><para>As mentioned above, Medicare benefits are only payable for services which are generally accepted by the medical profession as being necessary for the appropriate treatment of the patient. Where the Health Insurance Commission suspects that a doctor is involved in inappropriate medical practice, provisions exist through the Professional Services Review Scheme for the practitioner's activities to be assessed by their peers.</para><para>(6) There is no minimum post graduate education of clinical experience in spina] manipulation required prior to Medicare benefits being paid to a patient for spinal manipulation performed by a medical practitioner.
