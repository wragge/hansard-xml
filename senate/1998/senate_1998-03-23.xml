It is important for two distinct and clear reasons. Firstly, it is important because the measures that it contains are necessary to improve the equity of the tax system—however, I acknowledge that they are vehemently opposed by many in the tax and legal professions—and, secondly, it is especially important because the process leading to this debate today is indicative of the approach of the government in dealing with tax avoidance.</para></talk.start><para>On the subject of tax avoidance, the government has squibbed the challenge. The government has chosen not to come down as heavily on tax avoidance as Labor had originally proposed. This is despite the fact that the Treasurer has repeatedly told the parliament that he is tough on tax avoidance. It is my intention to move at the conclusion of my remarks an amendment to the second reading motion on the  Taxation Laws Amendment (Trust Loss and Other Deductions) Bill 1997 
 which has been distributed in the chamber and deals specifically with this point: that the government has caved in to its trust-owning backbenchers on the issue of these bills. On 20 June 1996, on page 2423 of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>, when promising to be tough on tax avoidance, the Treasurer said:</para><para>I make it clear on behalf of this government that where anomalies and exemptions are being unfairly exploited they will be addressed.</para><para>On 2 September last year he stated:</para><para>The government takes such measures as are required to prevent legitimate taxation liabilities being avoided.</para><para>Furthermore, the rhetorical charade continued with Mr Costello saying on 2 October last year:</para><para>This government is serious about making sure that corporations—and, indeed, individuals—pay their fair share of tax.</para><para>Despite these brave words and many others of the Treasurer, the legislation before us has an extraordinary, possibly unprecedented gestation period for tax avoidance legislation. Labor recognised a significant problem and announced a wide-ranging package to deal with the abuse of trust losses in the 1995 budget. This announcement was made on 9 May 1995, almost three years ago. We duly announced legislation and introduced it into the parliament in 1995. The opposition—now the government—sent the legislation to a Senate committee and achieved its objective of delaying consideration of the legislation by the Senate until the election intervened. No doubt there were some in the coalition who hoped that the issue would be dropped after the election.</para><para>The issue has not been dropped completely but it has been fumbled repeatedly over the last 22 months. After a deafening silence for the first five months of the government on the issue, we saw an announcement in the 1996 budget which affirmed that the government would pursue the issue but with modifications—beware the modifications. Six months later, draft legislation was released. Then a further three months later, a subsequent announcement was made in the 1997 budget which contained further changes from the draft legislation released in February. It then 
 took a further five months for this legislation to be presented to the House. Now here we are, a further five months later, finally debating what is essentially a non-controversial measure between the government and the opposition.</para><para>Ironically, it was introduced in the House at the end of the last two-week sitting period and the government immediately said that they wished to have quick passage into the Senate. The opposition obliged with swift passage through the House and this legislation has sat in the Senate for an unnecessary further three months because the government refused to put it through last year, even though we indicated that this could be achieved.</para><para>The process leading up to this debate has been ridiculously delayed. The opposition sympathises with the business community's anger at this delay. There is only one reason for it—that is, the procrastination of the government.</para><para>I speak today in the context of the broader agenda of tax reform. The government is currently undertaking a secret bureaucratic exercise, crunching the numbers to develop various options for tax reform. It has repeatedly refused our invitation to make the information public so that the people of Australia can be truly informed as to what the options are. Yet the government pretends that Labor is against reform. Nothing could be further from the truth.</para><para>The only basic matter of principle that Labor has ruled out is the adoption of a GST. This has infuriated the government because, as we have always known, the implementation of a goods and services tax is the only real objective of the tax reform exercise which they are undertaking.</para><para>We have heard the Treasurer repeatedly in the parliament and in public debate carefully saying that all tax options are on the table and that everything will be considered by the government. Whilst this rhetoric is obviously designed to appease interested stakeholders such as ACOSS, we know that the government has already decided what it wants to do and is simply stringing along welfare sector participants to try to get some chimera of 
 consensus in the proposals it will release. We know as well that all of the options that it has committed its task force to come up with involve a GST—none of them does not.</para><para>The time has now come for the government to release the various options that have been generated by the tax reform task force. This would enable a truly informed debate on the full range of options that have been presented to the government. Instead, we are getting a constant stonewalling from the government on even the most basic details of what they propose. They will not even admit that they are planning a GST as the centrepiece of their package.</para><para>It is important that the full options generated by the bureaucrats be released, because that will mean that the public will be able to evaluate the policies announced by the government in the context of which options were possible. The strategy of the government is obviously to present its own package as late as possible in the electoral cycle to not allow more than rudimentary scrutiny—in other words, to ambush the electors of Australia with a predigested package on a take it or leave it basis.</para><para>Why would any government pursue such a strategy unless it was concerned that debate and analysis of its policies would show them to be seriously flawed? Exactly what is the government afraid of? I wonder what the welfare sector thinks about this type of approach. I wonder what the churches think about this type of approach.</para><para>We are constantly being told that the tax system is broken, that it is in crisis and that it must be remade. The opposition has taken the responsible position of agreeing that the tax system needs constant repair and some occasional renovation. It is not fundamentally broken, but all sensible options outside of a GST can be looked at. Accordingly, we have not attempted to derail the reform task force procedure at all. We have not availed ourselves of the many opportunities that could have been taken to beat up taxation related issues, nor have we sought to use the procedures of the parliament to delay or frustrate important tax matters which have arisen. By contrast, the government has been delaying 
 important reforms like the trust loss measure before us today, because it cannot control its backbench.</para><para>I provide some examples to buttress the point that I have just made. Firstly, the resolution of the half-decade-long problem concerning the impact of the petroleum resource rent tax on Victoria was dealt with by the shadow Treasurer in conjunction with the Treasurer as it should have been—on a completely apolitical basis. The necessary legislation was dealt with swiftly in the national interest and no attempt was made to derail the settlement nor to misinform the public. The result was a successful outcome to a difficult public policy dilemma.</para><para>Secondly, in the aftermath of the Ha &amp; Lim and Walter Hammond judgments an immediate fiscal crisis arose for the states and territories. Around one-sixth of the revenue base of these governments was eliminated, and the prospect of gigantic repayments of past tax collections loomed. Quite literally, the financial solvency of the states was on the line. Here, surely, was a heaven-sent opportunity for politics to override good governance and for the opposition to wreak havoc. A huge tax rescue package—of around one per cent of GDP—was needed quickly to shore up confidence in the financial position of the states and territories. The opposition gave the legislation immediate passage through both houses of this parliament—because it was indisputably in the national interest to do so.</para><para>Indeed, I note in passing that the government so badly bungled the compensation payments issue arising from new safety net arrangements that the Queensland situation was solved only months after the original announcement. Again, federal Labor did not in any way undermine that process—even though there were significant opportunities for us to do so.</para><para>Furthermore, all of the other tax bills which have come before this parliament in the term of this government dealing with tax avoidance have been passed by the opposition. Unlike the coalition, Labor has been a constructive and honourable opposition in the area of taxation. Our record, I submit, is about as good a record on supporting clamping down 
 on tax avoidance as any opposition has had in recent decades at least. Contrast this with the various coalition oppositions over the past 13 years. These people opposed every decent taxation measure—capital gains tax, fringe benefits tax, proper taxation of foreign source income, improving the equity of retirement benefit taxation et cetera. Those opposite are the wreckers of decent tax reform, not Labor. We come to the tax reform debate with clean hands.</para><para>Having dealt with the history of these bills I turn now to the substance of the measures before us today. These bills will insert rules into the income tax law to limit the circumstances under which trusts can deduct current year and prior year losses and debt deductions. Labor supports such an approach without any reservations.</para><para>The reason for introducing these limitations is to ensure that the persons who bore the economic effect of the tax losses are the persons who obtain the tax benefits associated with recouping of those losses against other income. The public policy behind this approach is simple: people should not be able to avoid their proper tax liabilities by sheltering their income through the use of tax losses incurred by other taxpayers. This has long been accepted in the context of losses incurred by companies. In the case of companies,  losses can only be recouped if the company passes a majority underlying shareholding test or if the company passes the same business test. Bearing this in mind, the introduction of a regime to regulate the claiming of losses incurred by trusts is an important and overdue step in securing the direct tax base in Australia.</para><para>Obviously, the proposed rules that are to apply to trusts differ somewhat from the regime which applies to companies. However, this generally reflects the differing legal relationships which apply in the case of trusts rather than a fundamentally different approach to the question of the legitimacy of recoupment of losses.</para><para>However, the key issue now for these bills is not the differences between the treatment of companies and trusts but the treatment of family trusts under the Labor legislation and 
 the treatment in this legislative package. I borrow from the Treasurer's press release of 13 May this year. Press release No. 42 opens with the words:</para><para>On 10 February 1997, the Government released an exposure draft legislation on trust loss measures. After receiving comments and submissions, <inline font-weight="bold">the Government has decided to modify the draft legislation to restrict its application. </inline> The income injection test will not apply where entities and individuals within a family group inject income into a family trust with losses. This modification will have effect from 7.30 pm AEST 9 May 1995 . . .</para><para>These words sound innocent enough to someone not familiar with the very complex legislation before us today—but they represent a huge change in the effect of this legislation.</para><para>Under the original Labor legislation, the income injection rule did not apply to family trusts where a beneficiary of a loss trust introduced income into the trust to be offset against the losses. This concession was allowed because the beneficiary actually bore the economic effect of the loss as he or she was a beneficiary at the time when the losses were incurred. This is a perfectly appropriate concession.</para><para>However, where a family member—for example, a brother—who was not a beneficiary of the trust injected income into the trust to derive the tax benefit of the losses within the trust and then got the income tax back free, then these anti-avoidance provisions would apply to that scheme. For examples of these two separate situations I draw members' attention to page 171 of the explanatory memorandum for Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) of 1995, examples 3 and 4.</para><para>The rules under this legislation propose that any member of the family group as defined—which includes spouses, children, grandparents, nephews, nieces and their spouses—can inject income into any other family member's trust and thereby gain the benefits of the losses.</para><para>Clearly this is a huge change and is not one that the opposition is happy about. Senators could just imagine that the wealthy families of Australia, where many members of the broader family have significant assets, will be 
 able to traffic in trust losses between themselves, and hence be largely, if not completely, exempt from these new provisions.</para><para>Now that is not fair by any reasonable analysis. This change is simply dressed up as being a family friendly change but it is really a tax avoidance friendly change. That is one of the key reasons why we are moving the amendment to the second reading motion. There is no doubt Liberal Party backbench pressure has forced the Treasurer down this course.</para><para>The Prime Minister, speaking to Alan Jones on 14 August 1997, summed it up rather well when he said:</para><para>I mean, it is aggravating in the extreme if you are a PAYE tax battler, you're having your money taken out each week when you hear of people through all sorts of dodges, the cash economy as well as some people at the big end of town not paying their fair share.</para><para>I doubt that many PAYE tax battlers will be very happy to learn about this brand new tax dodge now available to the big end of town. Most families, of course, will not benefit from these new rorts for family trusts—because they do not have any connection with a family trust.</para><para>The Treasurer was asked about this matter on several occasions in the other place. He consistently dodged the questions, and refused to acknowledge that his changes had quite deliberately weakened the legislation and that this would be reflected in lower collections of tax.</para><para>When the Senate Economics Legislation Committee examined this legislation last year, naturally some of the committee members were interested to find out what the officials thought would have been the effect of the family trust loophole inserted by Mr Costello.</para><para>Evidence from very senior Taxation Office officials confirmed that this policy change will cost revenue, although it cannot be precisely quantified. So the pious position of the Treasurer has been proven to be completely bogus. He has deliberately weakened his own anti-avoidance proposals in the full knowledge that it will cost revenue. This leaves the opposition in a difficult position. Given the delay in this legislation, if we were 
 to try to amend the bills back to the previous position, it would involve a significantly retrospective measure which would be unreasonable on taxpayers. Accordingly, we consider on balance that it is better to support the legislation as it is and that is what we will be doing here today.</para><para>Some of this legislation has been delayed in an unprecedented fashion and has been watered down in some key respects for family trusts. The delay shows a lack of political will on behalf of the government. The watering-down shows a lack of fairness and commitment to treating all taxpayers equally. When both of these events occur, the opposition is entitled to ask why.</para><para>A cursory examination of the pecuniary interest register of ministers and parliamentary secretaries is very instructive in this regard. These publicly available documents show that 12 of the 30 ministers and six of the 11 parliamentary secretaries in the coalition government have family trusts. Suddenly the delay and the watering-down become readily understandable. The interests of almost half of the executive government are directly affected by the legislation. Clearly, the question of conflict of interest screams in this context.</para><para>I wish to place on record that the Treasurer does not have a family trust, nor is it illegal or wrong to have a family trust. But it is undoubtedly a conflict of interest for members of the government to consider such legislation in cabinet or in other processes of approval where they have such a clear conflict of interest. Did the relevant members of cabinet with family trusts exclude themselves from the consideration of these issues? With such a level of conflict of interest, how can this government fairly and properly evaluate revenue issues?</para><para>Was this the same reason why the Prime Minister promised, last year, to members of the government in the party room that trusts would be okay in the context of the tax reform process? He then took the extraordinary step of coming into the House to pretend that he really did have an open mind on the issue of trusts and tax reform. Nobody believed him because there was no evidence of 
 such commitment. In relation to the  Taxation Laws Amendment (Trust Loss and Other Deductions) Bill 1997  I move:</para><para>At the end of the motion, add ", but, while strongly supporting the passage of this bill, the Senate deplores the fact that, due to pressure from trust-owning members of the Coalition, it has been significantly watered down compared to the bill presented to the Senate by the then Labor government in 1995."</para><para><inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>QD4</name.id><name role="metadata">BROWN</name><name role="display">Senator Brown</name></talker><para>—I raise a point of order, Madam Acting Deputy President.

I also declare that the family trust has no trust losses and is therefore not affected by this bill.</para></talk.start><para>Trusts are an extensively used legal mechanism for conducting family and business affairs and have long been so used in Australia. There are varying kinds of trusts. All trusts have characteristics which make them less transparent and often more complex than corporations. Tax benefits are derived from the use of trusts. These tax benefits have less transparency than corporations and make trusts a legitimate target for reformers. For some, trusts have a reputation that they can be used in a manner which is not conducive to good social conduct. However there is no proof that the majority of families and businesses that use trusts operate in this way or that they operate outside the law.</para><para>Successive federal and state governments have continued to support the use of trusts by Australians. There are those who take a very dim view of trusts. The eminent economist Professor John Quiggin, in an article in the 
<inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline>, 16 April 1997, said:</para><para>There are almost no trusts in Australia established for legitimate purposes . . . The vast majority of trusts are set up with the primary purpose of avoiding tax that should be paid by high-income earners, thereby transferring the burden onto the rest of us. It is these trusts that are typically referred to as `legitimate family trusts'.</para><para>In the article, Professor Quiggin does not indicate what research informs him on the vast majority of trusts.</para><para>Those characteristics of trusts which distinguish trusts from corporate entities may be summarised as follows: that the beneficial and ultimate control of the trust is shielded from public disclosure; that the distribution of income in a trust is generally discretionary and can vary between the beneficiaries year by year; that the beneficiaries of trusts are shielded from the public eye, and that trusts may be used to maximise tax effectiveness and tax planning in ways which are not available to incorporated bodies.</para><para>In a trust arrangement there is a separation of the management powers of the trustee and the beneficial interests of the beneficiaries. The trustee holds the legal interest in the trust property and has a fiduciary obligation to the beneficiaries. Interestingly, legislation for the control of trustees is a matter for the states and territories and not for the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth largely derives its control over trusts from its taxation power. Depending on the trust concerned, however, the corporations power, the pensions power and the marriages power may also come into play. Nearly 28 per cent of small business proprietors surveyed use trusts. The executive editor of the <inline font-style="italic">Business Review Weekly</inline>, Robert Gottliebsen, described income splitting trusts as `the cornerstone of the structure of a large number of the country's very small businesses'.</para><para>I have had sight of the 1994-95 taxation statistics. The Treasurer would have relied on such statistics in making his trust losses announcement of 9 May 1995. Those statistics do not identify the number of family trusts or other trust types and do not distinguish between trust types. Partnerships and trusts are analysed together. Consequently, it is 
 difficult to draw conclusions on the nature of trustees, beneficiaries, income, losses and taxation from those statistics, not only on trusts generally but specifically by type of trust.</para><para>In 1997 the Australian Taxation Office still, somewhat surprisingly, did not have complete analytical data concerning trusts. They knew that in the 1995-96 tax year there were 372,000-odd trusts that lodged tax returns. On this number, it would be safe to assume that one million to two million Australians are therefore involved in trusts, which is a substantial number of Australians. In May 1997 I asked the ATO  a question concerning family trusts. As a result of my question, the ATO randomly selected 224 trusts out of 16,000 trusts in Sydney and Melbourne which used `family' in their title. They reported that there was an average of 2.49 beneficiaries per trust; 87 per cent of individual beneficiaries were adults; 87 per cent of beneficiaries were individuals; eight per cent were companies and five per cent were trusts. Of the 224 trusts, 109—or about half—had business income. The total average business income was less than $1 million.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3L6</name.id><name role="metadata">CONROY</name><name role="display">Senator Conroy</name></talker><para>—Stop justifying trusts and start talking about the bill.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3M6</name.id><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name></talker><para>—The average net business income was $103,000.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3L6</name.id><name role="metadata">CONROY</name><name role="display">Senator Conroy</name></talker><para>—Talk about the bill.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3M6</name.id><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name></talker><para>—Average assets were $1.2 million and average liabilities were $966,000.

Of the 115 trusts that were investment trusts and did not have business income, average assets were $542,000 and average liabilities were $211,000. While better off than the average, these trust statistics do not seem to reflect the high wealth individuals and trusts 
 on which publicity has focused. Practitioners in the field do not have analytical data available on trusts either.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I believe that neither the ATO nor the practitioners and representative organisations have a clear analytical picture by type of trust, of trustees, beneficiaries, assets, liabilities, income, taxation, and so on. Neither does the coalition, neither does the ALP and neither do the Democrats. That, surely, must make it difficult to develop appropriate policy responses, and it makes it problematic for government or parliament to reach firm conclusions to substantiate some trust policy legislative intentions.</para><para>Significant legislative change has been initiated since 1980 under the Labor government to curb the legal minimisation or legal avoidance of tax by the use of trusts and discretionary trusts in particular. Illegal tax evasion is subject to the full force of the law. Trusts gained particular attention in recent years as a result of Treasurers' Willis and Costello both rightly highlighting tax avoidance by high wealth individuals.</para><para>A proposal to tax trusts as companies was made in a Treasury submission to the Tax Summit of 1985. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration in its report <inline font-style="italic">Follow the yellow brick road</inline> in March 1991 recommended that the government should examine the feasibility of taxing all trusts in the same way as companies. Regrettably, the Labor government of the time did not pursue that. The Australian Democrats believe that these are sound reasons to favourably consider a common taxation structure for all entities engaged in business activity. That means individuals, trusts, partnerships and companies that participate in business activity should be taxed on an equivalent basis.</para><para>The Treasurer and the ATO are presently conducting a review of trusts, but do not intend to make it public. I will move a second reading amendment, which I have already circulated and it is No. 868, to oblige them to do so. There is undoubtedly a momentum for tax reform of trusts. In fact, all parties in this Senate, as I understand it, support that position. </para><para>These bills are complex and lengthy. One of the witnesses at the hearing was quite rude to us all by describing how ignorant we were about the bill, how stupid we were and how complex the bill was. In respect of this bill he was probably right because very few of us could get to the bottom of it and neither could most of the witnesses.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3L6</name.id><name role="metadata">CONROY</name><name role="display">Senator Conroy</name></talker><para>—Speak for yourself.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3M6</name.id><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name></talker><para>—And I do include myself, Senator Conroy.

This lot is not simple. It seems to me that it would have been best if the government had evaluated these bills against three criteria: its current review of trusts, analysis by the ATO and practitioners, and the place this legislation should have in overall tax reform. I believe that significant changes to trust taxation should have been made in conjunction with overall tax reform.</para><para>Trafficking in trust losses means that a person or entity who did not bear the economic loss gains a tax benefit by buying a trust loss from another unconnected person or entity who did bear the economic loss. The ATO identified for us two types of trust loss trafficking. One is where a trust with a loss is bought and the new owner injects otherwise taxable income into it to set the income against the loss and to produce a tax benefit. The other is where a fee is paid to a trust so that otherwise taxable income can be injected into it by an unrelated party, it is set against the loss and then extracted tax free. The ATO did not provide the committee with empirical evidence or hard data to outline either the prevalence or extent of these types of trust loss trafficking.</para><para>It is apparent from the public debate and from the evidence to the committee that there was no disagreement between the political 
 parties, the government, the ATO, accountants, lawyers and the private sector on trafficking in trust losses. All are in agreement that trafficking in trust losses must be outlawed, and you heard Senator Cook strongly emphasise that. In the public hearing, evidence was led that in this respect trafficking in trust losses had been outlawed by Mr Willis as Treasurer and that the legislation was largely unnecessary. I do not agree, but I think a few pages would probably have resolved that particular problem.</para><para>The witnesses to the hearing were all in agreement that trafficking in trust losses had ended as a result of Treasurer Willis's announcement on 9 May 1995. All anyway were of the opinion that the anti-avoidance provisions of part IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 already gave the ATO ample powers to prevent trafficking in trust losses. The ATO was of a contrary opinion.</para><para>What was surprising at the hearing was that only one witness seemed to have any real knowledge of how the market for trafficking in trust losses operated. Every other witness claimed that they did not know anyone who was or had been trafficking in trust losses and none had or would advise their clients to engage in the practice. That being so, it is irrelevant because we are all agreed that it must go and, in fact, it has gone.</para><para>When questioned as to the size of the market in trust losses there was again no hard data available. The evidence was that trafficking in trust losses had largely been achieved by advertising. It emerged that the extent of advertising was actually very small. This implies that trafficking in trust losses might not have been significant in terms of the number of trusts affected. It is possible, of course, that it could have been significant in terms of the quantum of loss trafficked in just a few trusts.</para><para>Once again hard data from the ATO would have been useful. I am always suspicious when there is no hard data and there is just a bit of head kicking going on. Most telling of all, the ATO has not identified any improvement in its revenue as a result of trafficking in trust losses ending on 9 May 1995. All witnesses agreed that trafficking in trust losses 
 did cease on 9 May 1995. If there was significant trust loss trafficking prior to that date, then there should have been a revenue improvement after that date.</para><para>The witnesses to the committee did believe that the $550 million gain to revenue projected by the ATO to accrue in the six tax years from 1995-96 to 2000-01 as a result of these bills arises from attacking trust losses, not from attacking trafficking in trust losses. As you know, the setting off of losses against income is a standard business technique used by private individuals, companies, trusts and partnerships. For the record it should be noted that the Australian Democrats support legislation that outlaws trafficking in trust losses.</para><para>It is a worth repeating the majority report's summation of evidence. The majority report said: `Each witness held similar views that the legislation is flawed, manifestly unfair and that it focuses on the loss rather than the trafficking.' I have seldom experienced a committee where the evidence offered in submissions and by witnesses was so opposed in content and conclusions from that of the ATO and the government. The submissions of witnesses universally were that the legislation targets trusts and trust losses rather than trafficking in trust losses and that the net effect was similar to extensive tax penalties being wrongly imposed.</para><para>Further, evidence was offered that this legislation treats trusts detrimentally, relative to companies. The evidence was persuasive that the government has moved from the consideration of tighter anti-avoidance measures to regulatory measures designed to change tax policy and the tax regime for trusts. We have got no quarrel with that. It is just disguised in something else.</para><para>The nub of the non-ATO evidence is that some categories of trust losses legitimately incurred, which should be capable of being set off against future profits, with legitimate connection between persons and entities will now lose that tax benefit because of this legislation. These bills are seen as aimed at legitimate non-traffickers and as using the excuse of trafficking legislation to attack trusts at large.</para><para>In passing it is worth noting that the ATO cannot necessarily be relied on to get its revenue estimates right. That is quite understandable. Sometimes the ATO's miscalculations are spectacular, such as with the introduction of FBT and CGT, and the precedent for ATO error in this difficult area of revenue forecasting does require us to be cautious.</para><para>Critics contend that the ATO figures are unsubstantiated and are derived from limited sample and field audits. To go through the figures: a $550 million gain to revenue is projected by the ATO to accrue in the six tax years from 1995-96 to 2000-01 as a result of these bills. It is not known how many trusts will fund this revenue gain and how many will be spared. The gain to revenue for 1995-96 is projected by the ATO at $90 million. Since the evidence was that trafficking in trust losses ceased as a result of the Treasurer's announcement on 9 May 1995, these revenue gains must presumably be as a result of other measures now introduced.</para><para>We are advised by the ATO that, out of over 372,000 trusts, the number of trusts with prior year losses in 1995-96 was 54,802. The total amount of prior year losses in 1995-96 per the tax returns is computed by the ATO at $5,160 million. Dividing the one into the other gives us an average of nearly $100,000 trust losses per trust. If we revert back to the analysis that I provided earlier, that loss per average trust seems unlikely. It appears that most trusts do not carry forward losses, and most trusts with losses are at the lower end of the scale. It may therefore be that high losses are accumulated in a few trusts only, which have been the target of the activities of the treasurers of both Labor and coalition governments.</para><para>We have no way of knowing whether the ATO has underestimated the revenue effects of these measures. The ATO advises that it expects to raise $550 million out of $5.2 billion trust losses, and out of 55,000 trusts. That money raising represents about $10,000 additional revenue, based on the average from each of those 55,000 trusts.</para><para>Other issues raised in evidence to the committee included compliance costs, family 
 definitions, family trust elections, interposed entity elections, the distribution test, the income injection test, the definition of benefit, the continuity of ownership test and the effects on joint unit trusts. Discontent was strongly expressed in terms of cost, complexity, unfairness and bad policy. With regard to unit trusts, evidence was led that, with regard to the business test, it was inequitable for publicly listed unit trusts to receive a tax concession not available to unlisted unit trusts.</para><para>The Australian Democrats recognise that, with our limited resources, it is impossible for us to deal with all these problems. Consequently, I will only be moving amendments in the committee stage that affect retrospectivity and definitions. Retrospectivity is something which has always attracted the ire of parliament.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>DX5</name.id><name role="metadata">MARGETTS</name><name role="display">Senator Margetts</name></talker><para>—And of the coalition, too.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3M6</name.id><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name></talker><para>—Usually of the coalition too. The majority report correctly summarised the fact that the legislation before the Senate differs considerably from the original announcement of 9 May 1995 and, as Senator Cook clearly outlined, differs considerably from the intentions of the Labor bill. In submissions and evidence to the committee, witnesses showed that they universally believe that the bills before us are far different in intent and consequence from what was foreshadowed by Treasurer Willis on 9 May 1995. They felt that the bill was so materially different from the original announcement that people would be unfairly prejudiced if the legislation were effective retrospectively. The ATO does not agree with those views, and that makes for a very difficult analysis for us to determine between the two contending views.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The claimed consequences of this legislation are as complex as the legislation itself. Evidence was offered that the retrospective effects could extend back to the late 1980s and forward for a number of years. It is claimed that losses legitimately incurred prior to 9 May 1995 that were not as a result of trafficking in trust losses will be detrimentally affected by this legislation. Making the 
 legislation retrospective from 9 May 1995 could mean that many trusts would be unable to claim a deduction for losses legitimately incurred during the years from 1995 onwards as well, when there was no trafficking in these losses.</para><para>In conclusion, I doubt whether any party within this parliament or the ATO can clearly forecast the consequences of this bill. Its complexity and difficulties are such that we are left to deal with some legislation which is very difficult indeed. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Knowles)</name></talker><para>—Senator Murray, the Senate notes that you have foreshadowed an amendment in the second reading stage.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>1024</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The trust loss issue has returned. Unfortunately, the new legislation raises more issues than it resolves. In the previous incarnation of the <inline ref="r354">Taxation Laws Amendment (Trust Loss and Other Deductions) Bill 1997</inline> , the issue that was supposed to be motivating the change in legislation was the beginning of trafficking in trust losses. This was something that a small group of wealthy individuals could take advantage of. It was something normally done by small businesses, which were set up as trusts, often under advice from government agencies, in order to isolate possible losses from family businesses so that business losses would not mean the loss of, for example, the family home.</para></talk.start><para>It was also not something that was normally done by unit trusts and other superannuation type vehicles where a large number of people may have been involved and moved in and out of unit trusts. The problem with the former legislation was that, in attempting to prevent slick operators from manipulating the law, a great many trusts were penalised and treated as though their primary objective was to run trust loss scams. The target of the legislation seemed to be any trust trying to carry a loss forward, rather than trusts involved in loss trading schemes. The solution therefore seemed to penalise many legitimate schemes.</para><para>Unfortunately, while there are improvements in this incarnation of the legislation, it still seems to be an approach which penalises 
 trusts for claiming deductions on losses, rather than targeting the loss trading schemes. The onus seems to be on the wrong thing: it is on the trust to prove that it is not involved in a loss trading scheme rather than simply making such loss trading schemes illegal, and leaving the work and onus of proof on the Australian Taxation Office to make a case against trusts suspected of this.</para><para>A further issue appears here, which I hoped the committee would have come to grips with. What is the basis of trading trust losses? It is a justified concern that losses in one area are being used to offset profits in another, thereby benefiting both the loss making investment and the profit making investment, at the expense of public revenue. This had certainly not been done much until a few years ago as an explicit deal in terms of trading trust losses by the clever buying or selling of trusts, or by injecting funds—that is, profits—into loss making trusts. But it is hardly a new concept or practice.</para><para>The essence of the ethical argument by government and the tax office is that the purpose of carrying forward losses is to allow for a single business, engaged in a real, productive activity, to take account of the fact that there are good years and bad years, and that investing in a business, especially in establishing a business, may involve some period of expenditure and investment in excess of income. In other words, a business may either when being established or when going through a period of re-tooling or expansion, make a loss, perhaps for two to five years, before the investment begins to pay off as a profit.</para><para>That loss would be seen as part of the process of establishing a business and should be able to be carried forward and used to balance the profits made in later years. This is before things like the multilateral agreement on investment and other aspects of the international free market. I guess things are changing somewhat. Real businesses may take several years to establish but should then exist for decades, run conservatively for the long haul. This was certainly the traditional economic model, though it sounds dreadfully old fashioned today. Losses were also intended to 
 be carried forward in situations where the economy went into recession and sales may have fallen off drastically while overheads had not.</para><para>The principle in either of those cases was that a business had a natural life cycle and process of maturation that was not bound by the financial year. Businesses were there to make long-term profits, to provide at least a slight profit most of the time, and should be run cautiously enough in good times to assure that it could survive through hard times. Running a business in that context could be seen as a commercial investment but often was seen as investing in a vision of production of a certain type of product or service. The idea of carrying losses was built on the idea of evening out annual taxation over the life of a single business. Modern businesses do not fit that model quite so well.</para><para>Since financial deregulation in the early eighties, businesses begin to work more intensively in a global economy and global speculation took off in a massive way. Until then, the globalisation process had been proceeding slowly since the sixties, bound by national regulation of economies. But with the rapid opening up of national economic borders, the race was suddenly on for market share in the global big pond. One way for a company to finance rapid expansion was to turn its productive assets into financial assets, negative gear and debt finance expansion. Everyone was doing it and not to take that jump meant not to have that global presence.</para><para>Suddenly older monopolistic practices, such as vertical or horizontal integration, took on new meaning and companies began swallowing overseas companies in takeovers and leveraged buy-outs, and the whole thing being used as assets for further loans to finance another round of expansion. It was the era of the entrepreneur shark, the snake-oil flash businessman with attitude, here in Australia and various other figures in the bigger realms overseas.</para><para>We loved them. We praised them. They engaged in their ruthless expansion game and we did not look too hard if some of that cash stream went off in odd directions. It all went swimmingly until around 1987 when we saw 
 the bubble burst and the first major period of `shake-out'. The card houses of debt financed expansion collapsed and the trick was to see whether you were big enough to ride out the collapse, gobbling up fire-sale assets and divesting of peripherals, and whether there would be enough real income and assets to survive by the time the tsunami of financial collapse reached your conglomerate empire.</para><para>Unfortunately, a lot of Aussie businesses, famous old businesses, with nothing wrong with their core structures did not make it. The entrepreneurs all developed memory problems or vanished to Spain for health reasons, leaving the husks of the companies they had violated. But the heritage of those times is still with us. The speculative boom did not stop after 1987; it just developed. It developed into ways of diversifying speculative investment for risk management. It developed devious derivatives and business remains as something pretty fluid.</para><para>A real business making widgets, good high-tech widgets, may also have a significant investment portfolio. It gets reported in the annual reports. In fact the investment section which might engage in a bit of currency speculation, hold various stocks and various derivatives may still be more lucrative than the business of making widgets, which, after all, requires a real plan to enter markets and sell product competitively. There are high-tech companies which seem to primarily survive on their speculative investments while they try to interest someone in their admittedly good innovative technology.</para><para>The problem is: business has become very clever, too clever by half. They are, with their diversified portfolios, quite good at playing losses in one sector of their investments against profits in another. Of course this also translates down to the personal, with financial advisers advocating negative gearing and property investments to reduce tax liability. The use of losses in one field of investment to reduce tax liabilities in areas of more profitable investment are not new at all. The only new wrinkle in the last few years is that someone twigged to using loss making trusts as a new means of reducing tax while maintaining or requiring assets—assets which may 
 appreciate in value. Some financial advisers figured out this was a good scam and sold it openly as such.</para><para>I wonder why, after the long committee hearing and several years of thought, there has not been more fundamental consideration of this issue of losses. I think the principle that the Australian Taxation Office, through both this government and the last, is trying to get on to is to say that a loss on investment really should only be allowed to reduce tax on subsequent profits on the same investment. Really, who cares who owns the investment?</para><para>Why should we say that someone who owned the loss making investment can use it to reduce tax on their other profit making investments but someone else cannot buy that loss making investment to use against their profit making investments? I think no-one should be able to use the losses on one investment against the profits on another investment. I think if someone buys a loss making investment, say, a loss making business, they should be entirely able to carry those losses and deduct them against future profits on the same investment.</para><para>In other words, in terms of this bill, I think the government has basically got it wrong. I am glad it has taken some measures to address some of the worst aspects of the earlier legislation. I do not really see why it thinks exempting family trusts, which are just as liable to be on the Dallhold model as on the model of a small family trust set up to run a small business, will solve anything. I believe it is more likely that it will simply mean that anyone with enough money to see value in playing at trading trust losses will simply assure that they have a family trust with which to do so. I hope people are taking note of the mention made by Senator Brown in terms of the conflict of interest when this bill comes to a vote.</para><para>I believe that whatever the Greens or Democrats do at this point the bill will pass in essentially its current form. I think it is highly likely because it is fundamentally legislation introduced by the ALP and now reintroduced by the coalition. They will have the numbers, and I am not going to bother 
 with a lot of amendments because it is quite clear what will happen.</para><para>I will, however, push for one particular amendment. In the section on family trusts, `members of the family group' is a defined term. It is set as the siblings, parents, children, children of children and children of siblings for both the elected person and their spouse. It states that by spouse it means either a married or de facto spouse. This brings us to a point where it seems once again we are going to create a discriminatory situation. If we are going to give people the ability to create trusts that allow benefits to be paid out of their de facto's mother's adopted son's ex-nuptial daughter, why on earth can we not include somebody's same sex domestic partner—the person they live with and who may have spent years with them, bought a house with them, established a business with them and so on?</para><para>They cannot legally marry according to the Marriage Act. It does not matter how committed they are, how loving they are and how much they may have tried to provide for each other in their wills. It does not matter that they may have had a ceremony blessed by religious clergy. They cannot legally be married.</para><para>Why should this mean that they are also excluded from consideration of each other in a family trust? That is what this particular section, in defining what a family member of a family trust is, does to everyone in a same sex relationship. It says, yet again, that they will be excluded from a legal form which may actually work, in the absence of the action of any section of the Family Law Act, to recognise and formalise some financial obligation between partners and possibly to provide for their children and parents.</para><para>Why should we prevent same sex couples from a legal means of making such provisions for their families? This does not prevent them from trading in trust losses. Each could set up independent family trusts, if trading trust losses were the main purpose. This law does not prevent them from trading. It prevents them from having a family trust together as a family. Consequently, I am following my general course of action and foreshadowing an 
 amendment to change the definition of de facto spouse to include same sex spouses.</para><para>Since the last time that I moved such an amendment, we have seen the report of the committee looking into the Sexuality Discriminatory Bill finally tabled in the Senate. It was tabled on the second to last day of last session in the middle of the Wik debate and with virtually no real comment. Aside from Senator Brown's comments, we got to read the views of everyone else in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> a day or more later when there was no chance it would actually generate any more notice or discussion. Nonetheless, the majority report of the committee absolutely not dominated by the Democrats or the Greens recommended:</para><para>That a consistent and gender neutral definition of . . . domestic partnership or relationship be established and used . . .</para><para>That all couples and personal partnerships achieve legal recognition at Commonwealth level . . .</para><para>As I have indicated in the past, the broad spectra of submissions to the inquiry included that of the Catholic Bishops Conference and other major Christian churches. While often opposing same sex marriage, they supported the idea of treating same sex couples at least in the same way as de facto couples.</para><para>I understand that the ALP has been considering its position on the issue of the recognition of same sex couples. Since they participated in this report one would like to see them acting consistently with the report they signed. Hopefully, Labor senators will be able to clarify their position on this issue and say whether or not they actually support such recognition, or whether it is only for report on anti-discrimination, and, if so, what they intend to do to ensure that there is such recognition and when they intend to do something about this inequity.</para><para>I would like to speak briefly to the second reading amendment moved by Senator Cook on behalf of the ALP. It is on record the severe flaws the Greens (WA) found in the legislation when it was presented by the previous government. It would be hypercritical of me to support an amendment which says, `while strongly supporting the passage of this bill'. As I have mentioned, many of the flaws that existed still exist now or have 
 not really been dealt with. I would not be able to support the second reading amendment moved by Senator Cook unless we deleted the words `while strongly supporting the passage of this bill'. I will be moving an amendment to that amendment which would read:</para><para>"but while strongly supporting the passage of this bill, the Senate deplores the fact that, due to pressure from trust-owning members of the Coalition, it has been significantly watered down compared to the bill presented to the Senate by the then Labor Government in 1995".</para><para>This, I believe, does not indicate that the Greens were supportive of the Labor government's 1995 bill because we quite clearly saw huge flaws in that bill. Many people in the small business sector in Australia agreed with us. The issue in relation to deleting the specific section of family trusts is bizarre, to say the least. I would consider supporting the opposition's second reading amendment with that deletion. Therefore, I move:</para><para>Omit, "while strongly supporting the passage of this bill,".</para><para>I also indicate that the second reading amendment to be moved by Senator Murray is acceptable the Greens (WA). I think it is reasonable. The Greens (WA) were certainly pushing to make sure that these issues were looked at carefully by the bodies that could look at them, whether in the Senate or the Australian Taxation Office, at the time of the original debate and we, therefore, think it is not unreasonable for the community and the Senate to have access to those reports on revenue from such issues as tax trust losses. I will be making further contributions during the committee stage of the debate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>1027</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator BISHOP</name><name.id>2L6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—From the outset it is important that I acknowledge the support of the Labor Party for the principle inherent in this package of bills. The stated intent of cracking down on tax avoidance is worthy of support and any legislation that takes a step towards the same is both important and valuable. However, while we will be supporting the crackdown on tax avoidance, there are a number of concerns with this package of bills that the government would be wise to address.</para></talk.start><para>The government and, in particular, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer have had much to say about their commitment to cutting down on tax avoidance. The government's much spoken of commitment to reducing tax avoidance has been central to their cynical campaign at wooing Australia's battlers. The government has made plenty of noise on this issue to ensure that they present themselves as defenders of equity within the tax system.</para><para>Nothing could be further from the truth. This package of bills, while acceptable in principle, provide an illustration of the deception this government is placing over the Australian community. The Prime Minister said on 14 August:</para><para>. . . it is aggravating in the extreme if you are a PAYE tax battler, you're having your money taken out each week when you hear of people through all sorts of dodges, the cash economy as well as some people at the big end of town not paying their fair share.</para><para>The Treasurer has made many comments regarding his commitment to cracking down on tax avoidance. It is worth repeating his comments, as was done during this debate in the House of Representatives. On 20 June the Treasurer said:</para><para>I make it clear on behalf of this government that where anomalies and exemptions are being unfairly exploited they will be addressed.</para><para>On 2 September he said:</para><para>The government takes such measures as are required to prevent legitimate taxation liabilities being avoided.</para><para>Again, on 2 October he said:</para><para>This government is serious about making sure that corporations and indeed individuals pay their fair share of tax.</para><para>However, this package and the way it was introduced fails to meet the commitment of both the Prime Minister and the Treasurer. This lack of follow through on commitment by the government is disappointing but not unexpected. The coalition has been ducking and weaving around the issue of tax avoidance for many years.</para><para>While the issue is clearly an urgent and important one, it would appear there are significant pecuniary interest reasons why the 
 coalition has backtracked and avoided this issue for so long. It is worth discussing the history of attempts to cut down on tax avoidance. The challenge to cut back on tax avoidance, particularly through the tightening of regulations on family trusts, was instigated by the previous Labor government and in particular the former Treasurer, Mr Willis. This resulted in legislation proposed and introduced by the former Treasurer in the 1995 budget. That legislation was introduced two years ago. While the legislation passed through the House of Representatives with the support of Labor Party numbers, the legislation was blocked in the Senate by the coalition and other non-government parties.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZS6</name.id><name role="metadata">QUIRKE</name><name role="display">Senator Quirke</name></talker><para>—What other non-government parties didn't support it, Senator Bishop?

The then non-government senators sent the legislation to a Senate committee which succeeded in delaying the Senate dealing with the legislation before the calling of the 1996 election. That is why comments made by the coalition regarding a crackdown on tax avoidance during the 1996 campaign were such a farce. The now government was promising during the campaign to introduce the same kind of legislation they had just blocked in the Senate. This reveals the true hypocrisy of the coalition when it comes to tax reform.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Upon winning the 1996 election, the now government took five months to introduce legislation they had claimed during the campaign was so vitally important and equitable for all. Another six months later draft legislation was produced for consideration and comment, with significant modifications to that of the previous government's legislation. Further modifications to that draft were announced in the 1997 budget. It has now taken another five months for this piece of legislation to be brought before the parliament. Then after all of this, particularly prime ministerial procrastination, the government called on the House of Representatives to immediately pass the legislation without appropriate review and comment.</para><para>This scenario illustrates the true commitment of this government to a crackdown on tax avoidance. This delay, however, could have been overlooked if the end product had been one that met the promises of the Prime Minister and Treasurer with regard to tax avoidance and led to a significant shift towards greater equity in the taxation system. Unfortunately, the much awaited legislation has not achieved this. This is most obvious in the application of the legislation to family trusts.</para><para>Before discussing this government's lack of commitment to cracking down on avoidance through these trusts, I will briefly explain the history and purpose of this legislation. This legislation will bring about a situation whereby rules will come into force that limit the circumstances under which family trusts can deduct current year and former year losses and debt deductions. This type of legislation means that only those people who bore the consequences of a loss are able to receive any tax benefits in recouping those losses. Such a piece of legislation will ensure that those who do not bear the burden of a loss are not able to benefit financially from any avoidance. This is the same approach applied to company tax law and, in that sense, it is a welcome reform.</para><para>However, in tightening up the variation between company tax law and trust tax law the government has avoided the real issue—that is, the difference between general trusts and family trusts. In this regard, there is a significant variation between the former Labor government's proposals and the current proposals in this legislation. The difference is centred around the application of an income injection test and this government's unwillingness to make it apply equally to all trusts. The Treasurer outlined the coalition's position in a press release on 13 May. The press release stated:</para><para>On 10 February 1997, the Government released an exposure draft legislation on trust loss measures. After receiving comments and submissions, the Government has decided to modify the draft legislation to restrict its application.</para><para>The income injection test will not apply where entities and individuals within a family group inject income into a family trust with losses. 
</para><para>The impact of this decision is to allow family members who are not directly bearing the cost of losses in the trust to inject income into the trust to offset against losses, thus receiving the benefit of the losses incurred by the trust.</para><para>There are two ways in which this trust trafficking occurs. The first option is where an individual purchases a trust with a loss and then injects income into that trust that would have been taxable under current taxation laws. The result is to offset the previously taxable income against the loss of the purchase trust. This results in a tax windfall for the purchaser. The second option is the use of a fee system to inject previously taxable income into a trust that has made a loss, have that income offset against the loss and then retrieve the money without paying tax. By failing to close this loophole, the government is allowing family members not incurring a loss in a trust to receive a tax benefit from a family member's trust that has incurred such a loss.</para><para>This is the type of tax avoidance that the coalition pledged to stop during the last election campaign. This will mean that, while PAYE families continue to pay high levels of income tax, wealthy Australian families will be able to avoid paying their tax share by injecting income into trusts of other family members purely so they can financially benefit from the trust losses even though they do not bear the burden of those losses themselves. This is hardly fair to ordinary battling Australians who do not have access generally to family trusts.</para><para>To add insult to injury, the government claims this to be a family friendly change rather than straight out tax avoidance. This shift in policy by the coalition is a significant watering down of the original legislation and the rhetoric offered in the election campaign. Equally, it will cost the government a significant amount of money through revenue losses. The willingness of the Labor Party to cut down this type of tax avoidance should not be confused with the ALP's policy on family trust concessions. The Labor Party accepts that family trusts should be treated as a separate category. Additionally, as our minority report outlines, we also support the 
 system of the trustee making an election for the family trust provisions to apply. As the minority report stated:</para><para>This simple system will avoid the need for costs to be incurred in amending trust deeds to comply with the definition of a family trust.</para><para>This concessional nature should also apply to family trusts in the situation of income being injected into the trust by the beneficiaries of the trust. The coalition's legislation, however, goes well beyond this criteria and allows family members not benefiting from the trust to inject income and receive a benefit. Use of this loophole is illustrated by the ATO's admission that tax revenue is reduced as a result of such a law. For these reasons, the issue of an inquiry was always worth considering. While the legislation in broad principle is supportable, there is a wide range of amendments to be considered, and all need to be examined fully.</para><para>I would now like to specifically address some other concerns with this package as they arise in the committee's report with particular focus on the minority reports. Firstly, retrospectivity is a significant concern. A vast majority of submissions to the inquiry called on the Senate to amend the legislation so that the proposed commencement of the legislation would be delayed. Retrospective legislation is not uncommon when dealing with tax.</para><para>This accepted and commonly practised rule ensures that tax loopholes are closed immediately upon being identified and announced by the Treasurer, rather than waiting for the legislation to be passed by the parliament, often at some considerably later time. This practice has the effect of protecting government revenue by solving problems identified as against policy objectives. If retrospectivity did not apply, the parliament would have been in a position of allowing trafficking in family trusts and other avoidance measures to have continued well beyond that which is necessary. This would have cost the government $435 million in revenue from trusts alone.</para><para>While the government prolonged the problem by procrastinating on this legislation, the Labor Party sees no reason to further aggravate the problem. Indeed, any procrastination would only establish a precedent that would 
 allow future, and as yet unidentified, tax loopholes to avoid immediate closure by affected peoples arguing for government inattention. This is not in the best interest of reducing the tax burden for PAYE earners.</para><para>However, while the opposition cannot support attempts to have the commencement date of the legislation delayed, we do recognise the confusion that exists within the community as a result of the government's poor management and lack of commitment to meaningful tax reform. The government has unnecessarily delayed the passage of this legislation. Rather than making it a priority, as its rhetoric would have us believe, the government has waited over two years to address the issue of tax avoidance.</para><para>Senator Murray in his minority comments has alluded to the lack of detailed information on family trusts in Australia. The lack of such information makes it very difficult for policy makers to accurately form assumptions on the impact of particular policy changes. It is agreeable that this deficiency should be rectified.</para><para>It is worth noting that, while the government is performing a backflip on tough sanctioning of tax avoidance that is exercised by some wealthy people in our community, it is pursuing vigorously other tax reforms that will hit at the family budget for the battlers of Australia. This is most noticeable, of course, with the attempt to introduce a GST.</para><para>As I mentioned at the outset, any legislation that heads down the path of reducing tax avoidance is worthy of support. For this reason, the opposition supports the intent of this package of bills. However, we note that the legislation is significantly less tough on tax avoidance than the rhetoric the government would have us believe. The consequence of this is to deprive the Commonwealth of revenue that could have been used to offset government cutbacks. More importantly, though, this backflip by the government in cracking down on tax avoidance is another reason why the Australian community is becoming so distrustful of Mr Howard and the coalition government.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator McKiernan)</name></talker><para>—I call Senator McGauran.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3L6</name.id><name role="metadata">CONROY</name><name role="display">Senator Conroy</name></talker><para>—Senator McGauran is not on the list.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>XH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGAURAN</name><name role="display">Senator McGauran</name></talker><para>—I will yield to Senator Conroy.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>1031</page.no><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name><name.id>3L6</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I have to make a declaration at the beginning that I do not have a family trust, but that actually magically does not mean I do not know anything about them.

But it does not alter the facts: Senator Parer can table any document in this chamber he cares to table, but he cannot escape the fact that, since he has been a minister in the Howard government, he has not complied with the Prime Minister's own requirements in relation to ministerial conduct.

Therefore, Minister, is one of the processes that you are going to review the entire ABARE modelling exercise?

Let me say that I do support the proposition that the ABC and SBS should be treated separately. Indeed it was the Labor Party, as you will recall, under the current failed shadow treasurer, that was very keen to actually merge the 
 ABC and SBS. We are not proposing to go down that path. Therefore, they each have their business plans. They have each made separate submissions. I think they each stand on their individual merits.</para></talk.start><para>I also think it is fair to say that there is no basis in principle for denying them access to the same quantity of spectrum that would be made available to the free to air networks. Similarly, I think it is also fair to say that if you go down the US and the UK paths then you proceed on the basis that spectrum is not charged for as long as it is used for the purpose of digital television. On that basis, the ABC and SBS are entitled to expect that they will have an equivalent treatment to the free to air networks.</para><para>As far as the cost of digitisation is concerned, we have had an independent survey commissioned by Arthur Anderson. I have only recently had a look at that document. I have had discussions with ABC management about its contents. I think I have made it clear to them and I think they agree that more work needs to be done to flesh out precisely what might be involved in the cost of digitisation. Certainly, if you want to take a global view you have to include not only the cost of digitising cameras, edit suites and post production facilities but also the cost of transmission. I do not believe we are in a position to make a judgment about the true cost of digitisation for the ABC in that regard.</para><para>Ultimately, the amount of money that might be made available by the government would depend to a significant extent on efforts that the ABC itself has made to minimise the cost that might be necessary. That is of course tied up with questions of outsourcing. I noted from what was said by one of the directors the other night that the ABC has reached close to 50 per cent of outsourcing for non news and current affairs. If that figure is accurate, then it suggests they are in the process of reducing the amount that might be required in-house because the cost of digitisation will be borne by the independent production houses and therefore built into the leasing or other arrangements that might be entered into by the national broadcasters.</para><para>There is still a way to go in looking at precisely what costs are involved. We accept that there will inevitably be additional costs flowing to all free to air networks from the conversion to digital. It is, I think, going to be a very exciting experience even though in some respects it is not possible to anticipate precisely what the ultimate business case might be, but certainly there will be plenty of opportunities there for all the free to air networks.</para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>1044</page.no><name role="metadata">Bourne, Sen Vicki</name><name role="display">Senator BOURNE</name><name.id>TW4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Madam President, I ask a supplementary question.

We obtained that mandate and we proceeded to provide Australians with an opportunity to buy shares, which I am sure none of them regret for a moment.</para></talk.start><para>We have now sought the opportunity to seek to be in the same position after the next election. What is the Labor Party's position? They will say one thing and do another. What did they do in relation to the Commonwealth Bank? Before the 1990 election they said they would not sell it at all. They swore blind that they would keep it 100 per cent government owned. What did they do after that? They started to sell down. Before the 1993 election 
 they swore blind that they would not sell any more. What did they do after the election? They sold even more.</para><para>What is particularly significant about this whole debate is the fact that there were a couple of stories written about what a former senior Labor minister told Mr Frank Blunt about Telstra being privatised in the early 1990s. Mr Blunt went on to say that he was still a very active person. You do not have to be too smart to work out who that was. The minister for communications at that time was Mr Beazley.</para><para>Mr Beazley was invited to go into the House and deny that proposition, but he has not. Never for a moment has he done that.

He said, `I have had a discussion with Mr Blunt and his recollection of events has confirmed mine.' If Mr Beazley is really saying that it was not him that talked about privatising Telstra let him have the courage to go into the parliament and say in front of the Speaker that, in fact, it was not him.

Mrs Kernot has said a few things about Mr Beazley and the Labor Party on this very issue. They are very pertinent remarks. She said, `I think Labor in opposition won't sell Telstra, but I'm more worried about Labor in government.'</para></talk.start></continue><para>In other words, she knows that this mob lie their heads off.

If your own person nominated to get out there and argue your case does not believe the case what hope have you got? The fact is that this is utterly opportunistic. We are the ones who will apply the overwhelming proceeds of sale to retire debt.

Funny you should mention that, because it is precisely Mr Beazley's debt. He was the finance minister at the time. He has no interest in actually bringing down any of that debt. They would simply use the proceeds for any expedient purposes that they saw fit. I will give you a classic example of how far off the mark they are. In arguing that Telstra should not be sold, the current shadow minister for communications said: `In daily life, every Australian relies on Telstra and therefore the government should retain control of it.' This is the ultimate in communist nonsense I would have thought. We rely on fresh air, we rely on clean water and we rely on roofs over our heads. The government should own all these things? It is a nonsense. They know it. They do not have a leg to stand on. They are not interested in doing anything other than trying to gain a few bits of support from the people who might be otherwise misled, by pretending that they do not understand why this is happening.

But you have to read Senator Parer's letter to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). That letter is dated today, 23 March 1998. You have to flick through the first few pages. You have to get to page 9 before you find out what Senator Parer is up to. It comes under the subheading `Revised arrangements'. Senator Parer's letter says this:</para><para>Accordingly arrangements were made last Friday by Brisbane lawyers, Corrs Chambers Westgarth and our accountants Howarths, for my wife and I to renounce any interest as beneficiaries in both family trusts, to resign all offices and directorships, and to vest complete authority in our seven adult children under an amended trust arrangement.</para><para>What that says is that Senator Parer's decision to divest means he is guilty as charged by the opposition of a conflict of interest. He is guilty as charged. What he has done is make a final admission that his shareholdings place him in an impossible position—a flagrant conflict of interest, a conflict between his public duty and his personal interests. Because of that, he has made a decision to divest through this mechanism. But look at the mechanism he uses. Let me quote it again. It says:</para><para>. . . vest complete authority in our seven adult children under an amended trust arrangement.</para><para>That is what Senator Parer's letter to the Prime Minister says today. But what do the Prime Minister's own requirements say about this particular matter? Let us not forget from 
 day one—not when Senator Parer failed to disclose these shareholdings and his interests in his family trust but since the opposition has exposed his deceit in this matter and exposed the fact that he did have interests, very substantial interests, in a mining company in the same area where he has ministerial responsibilities—we have always pointed to the Prime Minister's discredited guide on key elements of ministerial responsibility. We have always pointed to that clause that says this:</para><para>Ministers are required to divest themselves of all shares and similar interests in any company or business involved in the area of their portfolio responsibilities.</para><para>That is what Senator Parer is supposed to have done. He has failed to do that. He has failed to declare those interests to the Senate register of pecuniary interests. He has failed to comply with the Prime Minister's own guide. Now he tries to slime and sneak and snivel his way out of this by proposing this form of divestment of his company to his adult children. He now says that he will vest authority in his seven adult children under an amended trust arrangement. The problem is that that is a clear breach of the Prime Minister's own guide. That is a clear breach of what the Prime Minister said he must do. The same clause of the Prime Minister's guide to ministerial responsibility that says that a minister who has business interests in the area of their portfolio responsibilities must divest them also goes on to say this:</para><para>The transfer of interests to a family member or to a nominee or trust is not an acceptable form of divestment.</para><para>What Senator Parer has done is propose a form of divestment that is disallowed under the Prime Minister's own guidelines. That is what the minister here has done.</para><para>We now have a brief opportunity to have a look at the material that Senator Parer tabled prior to question time today. He does not come clean at all. We do not know what all the details are in relation to his interests and his shareholdings. We have never believed that Senator Parer has been telling us all of the details before the Senate. What we say now is that this proves that Senator Parer is guilty as charged. The only issue remaining is the sentence, and there is only one appro

They have no policies, no solutions and no alternatives, so what do they do to try to create an atmosphere of activity? They engage in muckraking.

 it is beyond them, because there is no sense of decency about their attacks on this government. As former Senator Richardson said about the Labor Party's modus operandi, they do `whatever it takes'.

In all that time, he asked one question on the economy and one on employment.</para><para>But what about all the sleazy allegations that have been made against Senator Parer and others? Mr Beazley is in there fighting thick and hard but, when it comes to alternative policies for this country, he is nowhere to be seen. Of course, the situation is no different in this place. As the article stated:</para><para>Of 583 questions asked in 1997, only 79 dealt with jobs, debt, inflation, budget issues, small business and the general economy.</para><para>And guess what it said about Senator Faulkner?</para><para>The Senate Leader, John Faulkner, asked three questions on unemployment.</para><para>That was what he asked for the whole year.

Senator Parer has earned export dollars for this country—something Senator Faulkner and Mr Beazley have never done. 
 Indeed, Mr Beazley's record is creating the huge foreign debt that the Commonwealth faces and that we, in a very appropriate manner, are seeking to repay.</para><para>So if the Labor Party wants to talk about standards, let it just reflect on who would be the Attorney-General under its regime.

Since Senator Parer became the minister for resources, it has been, much to the Democrats' annoyance, really a ministry focused on the coal industry, a ministry focused on the past. Yes, it is focused on an industry that is very important, but in emphasising this one particular part of his portfolio he has deliberately ignored—indeed, I would go so far as to say he has not just ignored but has undermined, de-funded and actually worked against—alternative energy sources.</para></talk.start><para>If we look at his answers to questions asked today, again he seems to wish to completely avoid and indeed pretend, I suspect, that he does not really understand the link between our stance at Kyoto and the interests in his industry. Let us just look at the position that the Australian government took. We were the only country to go over there and argue for an increase. That was certainly an embarrassment to those people in Australia who care about these issues, to the conservation movement, to indeed the many scientists who have worked for many years and I believe have shown this government very clearly where our future should lie.</para><para>Senator Parer suggests today that he does not understand the link between coal exports 
 and the fact that we went to Kyoto trying to destabilise the world agreement, trying to pull the world back from the 10 per cent or eight per cent reductions. We then went down even below that to the point where we have managed to get it to where we can actually increase ours, and the rest of the world got away with a lot less, particularly Europe, than those of us who care about the environment had hoped for.</para><para>Let us look at the link. If the world is not pushed to do something about alternative energy—in other words, people are going to be allowed to rely on coal into the future year after year—if people are going to be allowed to continue using coal, then our coal exports, which are the minister's priority, will flourish.	It is no good, Senator, to stand up in this place and say it is all about jobs. Firstly, the ABARE model has been debunked. It has been shown to be the nonsense that it really is. No-one else in the world believes it. It has never been substantiated by any other modelling exercise anywhere. We see very clearly that this government's emphasis on coal has detracted from the adoption of a range of alternatives. For every percentage point we managed to pull back at Kyoto—away from that 10 per cent reduction which was I believe the minimum—we see the benefits to Australia of coal exports and not the benefits in jobs. The coal industry is rapidly shedding jobs. I suggest that if this minister does not understand that he should read the daily papers for a few weeks as we see coalmine after coalmine closing down and many of those that are staying in business shedding workers.</para><para>I also suggest that this minister does some reading on alternative energy; that he looks to Europe, particularly to Denmark and the new jobs being created there in wind energy; that he looks at the papers that have been prepared on what Australia could be doing in the solar industry area, particularly the fact that we are leaders in a range of different facets in this field at the moment and that we should now be exporting this technology far more than we are doing. Part of the reason that we are not able to have the strong base here in this country on which to build and to export is because this government is simply not encour 
 aging that industry, amongst others. Just look at the penetration of solar hot water services in this country. We see an appalling rate of somewhere around four per cent for a country where 65 to 70 per cent of our landmass is suitable for solar technology.</para><para>If we can see the direct link between this minister's mind-set on the coal industry, how it has to be protected to the detriment of all other industries, and we now understand what his personal links are to the coal industry, I have to ask him: what is a conflict of interest, if this is not? I look forward to the opportunity later on in the MPI to go through other areas, other decisions of this government, that are directly linked to the support for the coal industry and against alternative energy sources.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>1052</page.no><name role="metadata">Calvert, Sen Paul</name><name role="display">Senator CALVERT</name><name.id>5F4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thought that was a very interesting contribution from the Leader of the Australian Democrats. Senator Lees talked about solar energy and all the rest of it. The fact is that when Senator Parer has been attacked for his so-called conflict of interest, no-one has accused him of a direct conflict of interest. I say that sincerely because there is no direct conflict of interest. One thing I know about Warwick Parer, and I have known him for 10 years, is that he is not a dreamer like the Democrats—he is a realist.</para></talk.start><para>The realism in this case is that if Senator Robert Hill had gone to Kyoto and succumbed to the world pressure, with the Democrats and Duncan Kerr running around and working against the national interests of Australia, the couple of mine closures that we have seen with the loss of a few thousand or a few hundred jobs in Australia would have been something like 90,000 to 100,000 jobs. If the Democrats are serious about being interested in jobs, they would have taken a different view and proposed different criteria to what they are pushing now. The only alternative they can come up with to the reality of coal power is solar power. We all know how expensive that is. Sure, there have been a lot of investigations and the like into solar power, but the realistic view is that, at this point in time, if we had not got those concessions in Kyoto 100,000, Australian jobs 
 would have been lost in Australia. That is the reality of the whole thing.</para><para>I was most disturbed to hear the word `deceit' being used about Senator Parer. There is one thing about Senator Parer: he is not deceitful and he is an honest man. There is no question about that. Senators opposite should take the time to look at the documents that he tabled today. In the letter to Prime Minister, he establishes where he is coming from when he says:</para><para>Starting with no special privileges I worked hard to establish and develop business interests and I make no apology for my success.</para><para>And neither should he. Neither should anybody who is a successful businessman. It seems to me, all that ever happens in this place, if you are a successful businessman, is that the minute you put your head up it is the old tall poppy syndrome—knock them down! I think the taxpayers out there who are subsidising politicians to act on their behalf should look at the value they are getting from Senator Parer who has that business acumen. He is a self-made man who has shown his ability to make a dollar, which is more than we can say for senators opposite. All they know is how to spend money.</para><para>When they come in here and start talking about conflict of interest, I start thinking about some of the people on their side over the years. Alan Griffiths owned a sandwich shop while he was the minister for industry. Was that a conflict of interest? They would probably say no. Graham Richardson: remember him? He was a director of radio station 2HD while he was a minister. He did not declare his interest. I do not suppose he thought it was necessary. He used his position as minister to try to influence the President of the Marshall Islands on behalf of his cousin. Do you remember that? Talk about conflict of interests!</para><para>We all knew that former Prime Minister Bob Hawke was a great personal friend of Sir Peter Abels. What happened when the pilot strike was on? Who put the defence forces in to help Ansett and Qantas? Really and truly, these people on the other side are criticising someone who is a self-made man, who has come in here and tabled all the documents 
 and has not been proven to have any conflict of interest whatsoever. As some of these documents from his sharebrokers show, he gave instructions when he was appointed as minister, without any question at all, concerning Kathi Parer. I says here:</para><para>Upon Senator Parer's appointment as Minister in 1996, she instructed us to review the share portfolio held . . . where there may be an appearance of conflict of interests—</para><para>They have gone ahead to do that in good faith and I believe that Senator Parer did exactly that. He is a man of honour and trust and, as the Minister for Resources and Energy, he would want there not to be any doubt at all that he had any conflict of interest. I do not believe that has been proven, nor will it be proven. I am sure he will continue to be a very good Minister for Resources and Energy for this country.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—Order!

Public debate on federal politics over the past couple of weeks has been dominated by the imbroglio that surrounds Senator Parer. But what the opposition would like to do this afternoon in this debate on a matter of public importance is to focus on the role of Mr Moore-Wilton, who is the Secretary to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and the Prime Minister's right-hand man. He is the nation's most senior public servant, and it appears that he has committed either a massive sin of commission or a massive sin of omission in his scrutiny of Senator Parer's investment arrangements.</para></talk.start><para>As you know, 30,000-odd Australian public servants who have become unemployed as a result of the decisions of the Howard government describe Mr Moore-Wilton as `Max the Axe'. But I think we have to say that, when it comes to checking out Mr Howard's millionaire row of ministers and the process of scrutiny that Mr Moore-Wilton has engaged in, you really would have to describe Mr Moore-Wilton as, `Max the Lax', because he has been closely involved in the Parer shares affair from the outset. From the start, Mr Moore-Wilton was appointed as the gatekeeper for the Prime Minister on ministerial pecuniary interests.</para><para>In April 1996, the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, circulated his now completely discredited document <inline font-style="italic">A Guide to Key Elements of Ministerial Responsibility</inline>. In the very puffed up foreword to this particular document, he gave a warning to ministers and staff. He said, `The emphasis in the guide is on the necessity of adherence to high standards by people occupying positions of public trust.'</para><para>Mr Howard tabled this guide on 30 April 1996. He announced at that time that ministers would be required to make declarations to him by 27 May 1996. What occurred was that later in that same year Mr Howard's own guide and his failure to properly police and implement it led to the careers of Assistant Treasurer Short and Parliamentary Secretary Gibson being claimed. Following that, Mr Moore-Wilton was required to scrutinise all ministers' declarations for compliance with the Prime Minister's much touted new ministerial standards.</para><para>In a press conference on 16 October of that year, Mr Howard stated that Mr Max Moore-Wilton had carried out certain examinations of trust holdings and had had further discussions on the matter. It is worth recalling that, at that press conference, Mr Howard put the onus on his own ministers to be `above reproach'. He said that he had `forcibly reminded'—could you imagine Mr Howard forcibly reminding anyone to do anything?—his ministers, who, of course, included Senator Parer, of their obligations under these ministerial guidelines.</para><para>It was in that same month that Mr Howard in fact commissioned a report on blind trusts to see whether that particular device might make it easier for the coalition frontbenchers, ministers and parliamentary secretaries to meet what seemed to be increasingly impossibly high standards. That report on blind trusts was, of course, authored by the same Mr Moore-Wilton, with the assistance of a couple of other departmental secretaries. It was released for public comment early in February last year. Of course, it has not been heard of since.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>7L6</name.id><name role="metadata">HOGG</name><name role="display">Senator Hogg</name></talker><para>—They have got a search party out.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name></talker><para>—I think you have to conclude, Senator Hogg, that blind trusts are obviously not a favoured option for millionaires row over there, the government front bench. On 20 March last year, the Senate Standing Committee on Senators' Interests clarified again the rules for disclosure of shareholdings in trusts, and that followed a similar clarification that occurred in the House of Representatives.</para></talk.start></continue><para>We ask the question: how could the Secretary to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, Mr Moore-Wilton, possibly have been oblivious to that process taking place? We know that a letter clarifying the disclosure guidelines was hand-delivered by a senior parliamentary officer to Senator Parer's office on 20 March. A further letter was sent on 26 March, together with a copy of the revised guidelines. All that followed a statement in the Senate by Senator Denman as chairman of the committee.</para><para>We must say that some coalition frontbenchers, some ministers and some parliamentary secretaries did respond. We know that Senator Alston responded to the correspondence. We know that Senator Newman responded to the correspondence. Even poor old Senator Ian Macdonald responded to the letter that was hand-delivered and which bore Mr O'Keefe's signature. They amended their declarations of interest accordingly. But, in May last year, Mr Howard again asked his probity gatekeeper, if you like, to check his ministers' confidential disclosures, presumably in the context of some sort of annual updating. These disclosures, including Senator Parer's, were passed to Mr Moore-Wilton on 7 May 1997. Mr Howard tells us that Mr Moore-Wilton reported back on 9 May—two days later.</para><para>Mr Moore-Wilton had just devoted two days to this very complex task of working through the mire, the myriad, the web of financial arrangements that much of the Howard government frontbench seemed to have, at a time when the trust shareholding rules had been tightened in both chambers. Mr Moore-Wilton took only two days to examine the investments of 36 ministers and parliamentary secretaries in the Howard government, but he 
 was able to very confidently provide Mr Howard with an assurance that `Senator Parer's statement was in accordance with the guidelines'. We assume that is the same confidence that he expressed in relation to other frontbenchers from the coalition.</para><para>On 10 March this year what do we find? Senator Parer has not conformed with the guidelines and certainly has not conformed with the ministerial code of conduct that Mr Howard brought down with such fanfare in the early days of his government. It was left to the opposition to reveal that Senator Parer controls an investment company which runs his family trust. He has got 16 shares worth over $2 million in a coalmine which sells to Japan. We know he visited Japan in an official capacity in June last year. He met executives from both the Marubeni Corporation and Nissho Iwai, which were both his business partners, joint venturers, and coal customers. Senator Parer also has direct shareholding in Queensland Coal Mine Management (ESP), which in turn has 706,000 share interests in Pan Australian Resources—this was exposed in question time today—which is a company that has numerous and diverse mining interests in Queensland and Western Australia.</para><para>This is not just a perception of a conflict of interest; this is an open and shut case of a conflict of interest and a vertically integrated conflict of interest from Senator Parer. Yet on 10 March, again the Prime Minister referred the matter to whom? Whom do you reckon? Mr Max Moore-Wilton. Again Max Moore-Wilton gave Senator Parer the big tick. He advised in early March—on 11 or 12 March—that he had taken into account the following issues: first, the Parer family trust vehicle, IMPL, has been in operation for a considerable time predating Senator Parer's appointment to the ministry; second, that the shares held are non-voting shares; third, the company QCMM Pty Ltd is a private company whose shares are neither listed nor traded; and, four, that Senator Parer and his wife have not received income from the trust holdings in either 1995-96 or 1996-97.</para><para>That is just nonsense, absolute nonsense. The shares were worth well over $2 million. 
 They provided the family trust with an income stream of over $800,000 over the past three years. There was income derived from the trust in 1995. The shares are tradeable. Senator Parer mused aloud on television last week that he might sell them. But Mr Moore-Wilton certified this whitewash. He has certified it in writing and he has sent it off to the Prime Minister.</para><para>Senator Parer said on <inline font-style="italic">A Current Affair</inline> on 12 March: `I have in all the time I have been in parliament made full disclosure for years. Everyone knew we had a family trust for years on the Senate records and this is why full disclosure was given to the Prime Minister and was ticked off.' It was ticked off by Mr Moore-Wilton. That is the truth. On the television news on the morning of 14 March, Mr Moore-Wilton was there saying that Senator Parer had complied with the guidelines.</para><para>Mr Moore-Wilton must have examined Senator Parer's affairs at least three times: in October 1996 when Senators Short and Gibson lost their jobs; in May 1997 when ministerial declarations were updated; and on 10 or 11 March this year when Senator Parer's own shares became public. Mr Moore-Wilton was formerly a senior director of the Australian Stock Exchange. He had an intimate knowledge of investment structures. But he could have missed the significance of the minister for coal having such interests in a coalmine through an investment company in which the minister has eight out of the nine shares! That just beggars belief. He either missed it—in that case we are dealing with monumental incompetence on the part of Mr Moore-Wilton—or he was fully aware of it—and in that case how on earth could he have approved it?</para><para>We have to say that even Senator Parer now has come to the conclusion that he should divest himself of these interests. He is proposing to divest complete authority in seven adult children under an amended trust agreement. He wrote to that effect to the Prime Minister, even though the Prime Minister's own guide says that the transfer of interests to a family member or to a nominee 
 or trust is not an acceptable form of divestment.</para><para>What is Mr Moore-Wilton up to? He is up to knocking out the walls of bus shelters, redeveloping the departmental foyer, approving substantial allowances for himself, getting the taxpayer to pay for a cleaning lady in his Canberra flat, and chasing departmental officers about why he found out about a Public Service commission inquiry into himself only recently. That is what he is up to. He is not doing his job. The opposition say that not only should Senator Parer go but Mr Max Moore-Wilton should resign.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>1064</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Environment</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—That was an extraordinary contribution. When I was advised this morning of this matter of public importance as alleged by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, I was puzzled that it was directed against Mr Max Moore-Wilton, the Secretary to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. I understand that the opposition has been trying to establish a case against Senator Parer. That is within the nature of politics. The opposition has clearly alleged and is attempting to prove that he was conducting the business of a minister subject to some conflict of interest.</para></talk.start><para>However, today, the opposition has headed out into left field, lashing out at the head of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. It was not until the last few seconds of Senator Faulkner's speech that he said that the objective was not only to get the resignation of Senator Parer, but also to make Mr Max Moore-Wilton resign—to bring them all in the net and make everyone resign.</para><para>One thing you learn pretty quickly about Senator Faulkner is that, firstly, when he is a bit short on evidence he starts to shout. When he is shouting you know that he does not have a strong case. Secondly, instead of making allegations, he always states the allegations as fact. For example, he shouts that Senator Parer is the owner of $2 million worth of shares. He repeats it—and, of course, Senator Parer is not. Most of the questions asked in question time today were falsely premised, but it does not matter to the members of the Labor Party. They will make 
 the allegation and they will repeat it often. They will shout it as if to demonstrate its accuracy when, if you explore the matter, you will see that their case is wanting.</para><para>Similarly, Madam Acting Deputy President, you might have noticed that the Labor Party is interchanging the two sets of rules to suit its circumstances. The Senate has applied a set of rules to senators in relation to potential conflicts of interest, and they are different from the set of rules that the Prime Minister has applied to his ministers. If you were listening to Senator Faulkner, Madam Acting Deputy President, you would have noticed that he was attacking Mr Max Moore-Wilton for not applying the Senate's set of rules in his analysis—not the Prime Minister's set of rules.</para><para>I will remind you of the detail. Senator Faulkner referred to Senator Parer failing to meet the extra terms of the latest explanatory memorandum. Some little time ago, the chairman of the committee sent around a new explanatory memorandum. Some senators got it and, apparently, some did not. Senator Parer did not get it, and therefore he failed to act upon it.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">FAULKNER </name><name role="display">Senator Faulkner</name></talker><para>—It was hand delivered to his office.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>BH4</name.id><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name></talker><para>—Senator Faulkner said that Mr Max Moore-Wilton failed to keep Senator Parer to that explanatory memorandum.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">FAULKNER </name><name role="display">Senator Faulkner</name></talker><para>—What was he doing?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>BH4</name.id><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name></talker><para>—The next thing Senator Faulkner will be suggesting is that it was hand delivered to Mr Max Moore-Wilton as well. I did not pick that up, so he must have missed that in his address. Mr Max Moore-Wilton was asked by the Prime Minister to check off ministers' returns against the ministerial guidelines. He did that in relation to all ministers and parliamentary secretaries. He reported that, in relation to Senator Parer, he had met the terms of the guidelines—job done, and job done correctly. The Prime Minister has said exactly the same thing: Senator Parer has met the requirements of his guidelines.</para></talk.start></continue><para>We have been at this for over a week now, and we still have not had any allegations of 
 any specific conflict of interest. There has been no allegation that Senator Parer has in any way abused his position for personal advantage. Some of those on the other side have even had the decency to say that they see Senator Parer as an honourable man. He is not only an honourable man, but I must say that he is doing his job very well as a minister.</para><para>Therefore, one wonders what is behind this attack. What is the real motive of the attack? Senator Faulkner hinted at it today when he talked about the `millionaire row of ministers on the other side'. A little while later he talked about the `web of arrangements on the other side'.

 Prime Minister in the other place has challenged us to demonstrate where Senator Parer has had a conflict of interest and in particular where he has failed in his job as a minister. This means that we have to show where the minister has failed to objectively consider any issue because his judgment was compromised by the need to protect his own private or personal interests.</para></talk.start><para>Before question time Senator Parer tabled a number of documents. I think the way in which they were tabled was designed to make sure that none of us actually managed to read them before we got to our feet during the MPI today. But in skimming through them I have managed to find that on page 7 of this document he makes the assessment that, `An examination of all the decisions I have taken as Minister demonstrates no conflict of interest.' There is an 11-page attachment from his department to that letter. That outlines all of the executive decisions taken by the minister to support this claim. That attachment is basically only relating to his role as minister for coal. It does not refer at all to his real job, and that is minister for energy.</para><para>The approach is an incredibly narrow view of what this minister does, and this has been the Democrats' complaint all along. If the duties of a minister consist merely of exercising administrative functions, then we should pension the whole cabinet off, I would argue, and replace them with just a few administrative officers. I would argue very strongly that the real job of a minister is policy work—the development of policy. Despite all the paperwork that Senator Parer tabled today, his extensive policy work to prop up and protect interests in the coal industry is not documented at all. The whole area is ignored. This is the key failing of Senator Parer, the Prime Minister and the head of the Prime Minister's department in defining what is a conflict of interest.</para><para>If the minister directly owns a large share of a large coalmine and he deliberately sets out, as Minister for Resources and Energy, to ruthlessly reduce government support for energy conservation and promotion of renewable energies that would directly affect the demand for coal, then surely this is a conflict 
 of interest. The minister's private interest basically is to sell more coal, prop up the coal industry, promote other industries, promote anything that will actually help to sell more coal. Yet the public interest—indeed the public interest that the minister swore to uphold—is to cut greenhouse gas emissions, reduce global warming, improve energy conservation and promote low cost renewable energy sources. What way did this minister go? I will let his actions speak. I will list five of them.</para><para>Firstly, the move to lift the export controls on coal was one of his first acts as the Minister for Resources and Energy. This basically means that the Commonwealth no longer has any lever to protect the environment where a coalmine is concerned. We cannot ask now for a federal assessment. Secondly, there was the abolition of the ethanol fuel bounty. This renewable energy resource would have been a boom in rural Australia. So along with the abolition of the fuel bounty went the abolition of the jobs that were there waiting to be done depending on the waste that industry was going to use—whether it was from the sugarcane industry in Queensland, or from growing wheat in western New South Wales or from growing rice in the Riverina. The small local facilities that would have been developed are gone.</para><para>Thirdly, there was the abolition of the Energy Research and Development Corporation which was at the forefront of developing renewable energy sources and had enormous support. Within Australia and overseas it was highly successful but it was in direct conflict with the coal industry. Fourthly, he refused conservationists a position in his round table working group on sustainable energy. He stacked 10 of the 11 places—and I repeat that this group was working on sustainable energy—with representatives of the fossil fuel industry.</para><para>Fifthly, we had the abolition of the white paper on sustainable energy. This was an election commitment. But it turns out that it was not a core commitment. It was a document that this parliament had been waiting on and was promised several times in this chamber. All of these decisions were made by 
 Senator Parer or promoted by Senator Parer as a minister. All had the direct effect of helping to maintain the value of his mining interests.</para><para>Senator Parer has been somewhat disingenuous in his approach to dealing with conflicts of interest. Today he told us that as Minister for Resources and Energy he had little role in developing the government's greenhouse gas position. This will come as news to his department which trumpeted in its 1997 annual report that it has been `very active in developing policy for and negotiating support for an approach to climate change that protects Australia's interests'. Those interests were defended very strongly by Senator Parer as minister.</para><para>Australia's position on greenhouse gases, coordinated by Senator Parer and his department, was criticised by every other western country. President Clinton, on his visit last year, directly criticised our stand, as did Chancellor Kohl and the British Prime Minister, Mr Blair. It was, and still is, an embarrassment.</para><para>What did industry stand to lose most from a stronger position on greenhouse gas emissions? In response to a question in question time on 29 October last year, Senator Parer said that there was no doubt that the majority of job losses talked about by ABARE would relate either directly to the portfolio he represented or to the downstream processing that comes from energy and minerals. He identified three areas of Australia that would be most adversely affected by any concentrated effort to cut greenhouse gas emissions in this country—Yallourn, the Hunter Valley and the Bowen Basin. We now understand that the Bowen Basin is the home of the Jellinbah mine which is partly owned by him.</para><para>It now emerges that the Prime Minister and his department chief knew all the time that Senator Parer had a personal interest in the coal industry and, therefore, a personal interest in not seeing a strong decision on greenhouse gas emissions. Was he removed from this area of policy making? No.</para><para>Let us look back in history. We saw Geoff Prosser removed from the portfolio dealing with retail leases as he was a shopping centre 
 owner. That was okay for Mr Prosser. He was removed from an area where he stood to benefit. It now seems that there are very different rules for Senator Parer.</para><para>At this time, was this interest made public? No, it was not. Senator Parer continued through 1997 to take a direct interest in energy matters and in the greenhouse gas question in particular. I wish it were true that the environment department won out. If the advice from the environment department had won out, Australia would have gone to Kyoto with a different position.</para><para>Last year the Democrats called for conflicts of interests to be regulated by an independent commissioner of ethics. The fact that we have gone so far on this issue and that this issue continues to rumble on shows us that it cannot be policed by ministers and policed by the Prime Minister and there must be an independent body out there that looks at this once and for all. We have been calling for that for many years. We called for that right through the list of scandals that went on at the time the Labor Party was in government. We will continue to insist on this and we believe it is the only way that the public interest, as opposed to any private interest, however we define them, can come to the fore.</para><para>The public must have confidence in this chamber and in parliament generally. I think that confidence is being undermined by what is happening now. We must make sure that there is an independent body to oversee this whole area and that an independent commissioner for ethics steps back away from parliament so that we do not spend hours in this chamber or the other place debating these issues. Once matters are raised there needs to be somewhere they can be taken and the public can be confident that their interests are at the top of the list as an independent body is dealing with them.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>1068</page.no><name role="metadata">Knowles, Sen Susan</name><name role="display">Senator KNOWLES</name><name.id>TH4</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I find the selective memory of the Labor Party purely and simply breathtaking.

The problem the Labor Party and, unfortunately, the Australian Democrats have is that they believe that every minister in a coalition government should be a failure like their own—a person who has never employed people, a person who has never had to pay the rent, a person who has never had to pay the wages of other people, a person who has never had to pay other people before they pay themselves. To have self-made successful people in a coalition government is somehow a sin.</para><para>The other standards that they failed to comply with are also the standards that they are now asking our government to comply with. I want to run through a couple of things. In 1992 Senator Richardson was censured by the Senate. But let me start before then: 1973, Senator Murphy; 1974, Senator Gair; 1974, Senator Willessee; 1984, Senator Walsh; 1989, Senator Cook; 1989, Senator Richardson; 1989, Senator McKiernan, who at that stage was the Government Deputy Whip; 1990, Senator Tate; 1991, Senator Richardson again; 1992, Senator Richardson again; 1992, the Prime Minister; 1993, the then Senator Gareth Evans; 1994, Senator McMullan; 1994, Mr Brereton, the then Minister for Transport; 1995, the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Gareth Evans, and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Senator Collins, were all censured; 1995, Mr Lee and then Senator McMullan; 1995, Senator Bolkus; 1995, again Senator Gareth Evans; and of course most recently—only last sitting week—Senator Bolkus for giving out the Skase material.</para><para>These are all Labor Party senators and members who have been censured by the parliament who did not walk the plank.

You don't need a GST. We'll give you the tax cuts that the coalition's offering, but you don't have to have a GST.' He got elected and then said, `Whoops, sorry, you're not 
 going to have the l-a-w tax cuts.' What is Mr Beazley doing today? He is saying, `We'll give you the tax cuts but we won't give you a GST.' Here we go again.</para><para>Former Treasurer Dawkins refused to resign after covering up the Victorian and South Australian loan affairs deal. Senator Beahan refused to resign from the parliament after his involvement in the Brian Burke affair. Minister Baldwin did not resign after a $2 million fraud in the Department of Social Security. Prime Minister Hawke refused to resign after misleading the parliament over gold tax. In 1992 Carmen Lawrence refused to resign after the Notre Dame scandal in Western Australia. She still refused to resign even after the royal commission in Western Australia said she was untruthful.

When you read Senator Parer's declaration to the Prime Minister today, there is an admission of guilt.

That is an absolute admission of guilt by Senator Parer that these shares that he owned involved a conflict of interest.</para></talk.start><para>However, it is not just Mr Max Moore-Wilton that should have picked this up. What about the Prime Minister? Senator Hill came into this chamber on 15 October 1996 and said in addition to an answer that the Prime Minister required that all ministers provide their returns—disclosure of interest—to him by 27 May 1996 and that the Prime Minister had indicated that he had looked at those 
 returns when they came in. Here we have the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, back in May 1996 saying that he examined all the forms of his ministers. So he knew 21 months ago.

So John Howard knew 21 months ago.</para><para>It is not as though Senator Parer did not get the hint. When he was pinged on <inline font-style="italic">Meet the Press</inline> on 26 May 1996, he proudly said, `There'll be no conflict of interest. I've got rid of my BHP and Santos shares.' He did not let us in on the secret that he had coal shares, just that he had got rid of those in public companies, those which have a register that we could discover his shareholdings on. So he gets rid of those—not great performers at the time—but he keeps the key performance ones.</para><para>For whatever transparency that might exist in this system, the one way that we are entitled to know whether a conflict of interest exists or not is on the Senate register. He has failed to declare his coalmining interests on the Senate register. This was revealed 12 days ago, so what does he do when he comes in here today and is asked? He has not even bothered to update it in the last 12 days. He has had 12 days to get his affairs in order. What is he eventually going to do? Having divested himself of all this, is he then going to virtually put in a nil return to the registrar of pecuniary interests or not? Is he going to go back and detail what he should have done in the last two years so everyone can have a look at what he has been up to for the last two years? I think not.</para><para>The Secretary to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet had all this material. He did not have all the testimonials that have flooded in today. Why did he not ask for them? Why over that critical period 7 May and 9 May did he not query Senator Parer's holdings and challenge them? After all, he is a former member of the Australian Stock Exchange. That was his last job before he came over to the department. Surely he knew the implications of that. Surely he knew that having a minister for energy and minerals 
 holding coal shares is simply not on in terms of the Prime Minister's guidelines.</para><para>But, to make matters worse, today we have Senator Parer, having admitted guilt in his letter to the Prime Minister and on Friday divested himself of all these interests, again breaking the prime ministerial guidelines which specifically say you cannot divest to family members or a nominee. Having embarrassed the Prime Minister by having shares that involve a conflict of interest, his very disposal of those shares breaches yet another prime ministerial guideline. How long is this to go on? How long is Senator Parer going to be in a position to defy his Prime Minister?</para><para>We have the unseemly timing today of Senator Parer coming into this chamber and tabling certain documents. We knew about this. We knew about this at about half past 12. Why? Because Senator Parer's office had got on to the media and said he was going to do it at 10 minutes to two simply so we could not examine those documents before question time. That did not help him much. None of the stuff covered in those documents reflected on the very questions we were going to ask here today—not one of them reflected—although it gave us material for question No. 7; there is no doubt whatsoever about that.</para><para>So we have a position, but Senator Hill comes in here and says, `This is all class envy. This is all envy of someone who has been successful.' We have the old lines run: this family trust is 28 years old. For heaven's sake, this deal, this issue of 16 shares, was done in 1993 when Senator Parer was a shadow minister. We go back to 1990 when he gets out of Gashbah, the other company, and his spouse says, `He's got out of that.' That was not because they owed East Court $250,000 on call—no, that was not the reason. He got out of that because of increasing pressure of parliamentary duties, but he still has time to chair this company. He still has time to pay $16 for 16 C-class shares. They keep saying these are non-voting shares. For heaven's sake, the dividend on these shares is bigger than the ordinary shares. For Senator Parer to come in here today and say he has been advised that these shares may be worth $2 for the totality, having had an income 
 stream of $850,000 over the last five years, is laughable. The implication of that is, if he disposes of the shares, his mates who have been giving him the $850,000 are no longer going to give their new shareholders anything.</para><para>What has he done to earn this particular amount of money, $850,000 fully franked? What has he done, if he has had no contact with the company? They are non-voting shares and he does not play a role, but he still gets the money. They object to our saying these shares are worth $2 million. Because it is a private company, the only way of establishing the worth of the shares is to take the net asset of the company and divide it by the percentage held; then you get to $2.3 million. But, more importantly, go to the income stream and see what that tells you. If you had to get the same income stream fully franked from BHP, you would have to own $9 million worth of shares to get that money, or you would have to own 4.2 million Telstra shares or 1.2 million Santos shares to get that same dividend stream.</para><para>We have a position. This is not a matter of class envy or anything else; this is a minister who has been given the honour of representing himself in government, and what is involved there is the occasional small sacrifice. One of the sacrifices is you do not own shares directly within your portfolio area. That is a sacrifice you have to make if you come into government. If you are not willing to make it, do not serve on the front bench. The fact is he has survived not because there is not a conflict of interest but because we are told he is a nice guy. I agree with that, but Brian Gibson was a nice guy and Jim Short was a nice guy. What distinguishes Senator Parer from them? They were small time petty offenders. They owned $50,000 or $60,000 worth of shares, not $2 million worth of shares. So the nice guy defence simply does not work in this particular case.</para><para>Senator Parer has not come into this chamber and properly defended himself. He called one press conference last week. He excluded the radio journalists and excluded the print journalists. When the electronic television journalists filmed his press secretary throwing out a photographer, he then turned around and 
 said, `If any of you run that footage, you're barred from now on.' What sort of approach is that to public life? All this has occurred because Mr Max Moore-Wilton has ticked him off. He is a partisan political appointment. He should do the right thing: he should go in the library, write out his letter of resignation and go back to the Stock Exchange because he has been induced in some way to endorse this absolute sham of approach.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>1071</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Chee, Sen Bill</name><name role="display">Senator O'CHEE</name><name.id>EU4</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—If you had paid any attention to the media lead-up to today, you would have thought this was going to be one of the grand show trials of the century.

He had no shareholding, but that did not bother these people opposite. We have seen time and time again that they never bother to get the facts right before they run off with one of these allegations. I understand it was Senator Parer's son, but that has never bothered them.</para><para>We saw the conduct of Senator Faulkner in relation to the Baillieu family. He did not bother who he happened to name. These people just happened to be dead for 53 years, yet that was the basis of another Labor Party allegation. They were going to dump a bucket all over Senator Parer because they said he had not disclosed a company, and it turned out that he did not even have any shares in the company. That is how thorough their research is. Heaven help us! Thank goodness none of those people over there are practising medical doctors. Could you imagine going to Senator Faulkner if he was a GP? If you had bubonic plague, he would probably tell you to take an aspirin and go home because he would not bother to check properly. These 
 people never bothered to check once all of the allegations they went on with.</para><para>I think it is interesting to note the standard that they set in government. That is very interesting. Let us look at the former Prime Minister. These people on the other side want to talk about conflict of interest; let us talk about the former Prime Minister.

Why won't the piggery go away? Because it is a gleaming example of the hypocrisy of the Labor Party and the hypocrisy of the former Prime Minister. What was his declaration of interest in relation to that piggery? He told the parliament via his declaration of interest that he had shares in a company called Euphron Pty Ltd. Of course, he did not mention that that company had interests in other companies and an interest principally in a massive piggery joint venture with a foreign company while he was Prime Minister. He did not make any mention of the fact that, during the period that this was all being planned, the Foreign Investment Review Board guidelines were changed so that this company would not have to apply for permission from the Foreign Investment Review Board to make that investment. That is the standard of disclosure we saw from those people when they were in government.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Isn't it interesting that it has all gone quiet over there? They are shamed by the actions of the people whom they elected to occupy the front benches when they were in government. When we were in opposition, we looked across here and it was like looking at rogues' gallery. Senator Knowles has already outlined to the Senate the number of Labor ministers who were censured by this parliament and who refused to resign. They could be censured for the most blatant misleading of the Senate and they would refuse to resign. They could be censured for the most outrageous conduct and they would refuse to resign. Of course, in every one of those cases, it was not just allegations that were made; 
 cases were built up over a period of time which were irrefutable. That is why censure motions were passed—because the cases were irrefutable. So these people were convicted by the court of the Senate, but they sat in here on the front bench.</para><para>In the Labor days, the front bench was like one long defendants' dock because every one of them had a charge sheet. Importantly, most of them were actually convicted, but they still sat in here on the front bench, they still received the title `The Honourable', they still received the salary and they still received all the perks because they never bothered about proper propriety. And why would you bother about proper propriety when your leader, the Prime Minister, was the biggest rorter of the scheme who ever existed? He was the biggest rorter of the scheme of parliamentary disclosure who ever sat in this parliament.</para><para>We had instances where the Prime Minister would deny that his interest in the joint venture piggery with Danpork had ever been subject to any ministerial discussions. We later unearthed—and Senator Crane was there and he is aware of it—minutes of meetings between Mr Crean, who is now one of the chief accusers of Senator Parer, and the Danish agriculture minister showing they discussed the joint venture piggery in which the Prime Minister of Australia had an interest.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>UW4</name.id><name role="metadata">CRANE</name><name role="display">Senator Crane</name></talker><para>—And remember the Commonwealth Bank?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>EU4</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Chee, Sen Bill</name><name role="display">Senator O'CHEE</name></talker><para>—And the Commonwealth Bank.

Of course, none of the people opposite thought this was a bad thing at the time. They all thought it was rather good because they kept on coming in here and saying what a wonderful Prime Minister he was. His only interest as Prime 
 Minister was in himself and he flagrantly failed to disclose to this parliament at any time the depth of his financial interest in that venture—an interest that ran to millions and millions of dollars. I think it was a $50 million joint venture and he had a substantial interest in it. He did a substantial multimillion dollar deal with a foreign company whilst he was Prime Minister, and then that foreign company used the Danish agriculture minister to lobby this government to try to change the quarantine requirements which exist for the protection of this country—</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>UW4</name.id><name role="metadata">CRANE</name><name role="display">Senator Crane</name></talker><para>—Prepared to put an industry at risk.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>EU4</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Chee, Sen Bill</name><name role="display">Senator O'CHEE</name></talker><para>—Yes, he was prepared to put an industry at risk.

The current site of the Opera House on Bennelong Point was initially a military fort, and military occupancy on Middle Head dates back to 1801. To a large extent, military establishments have contributed heavily to the current shape of the harbour, its foreshores and environs.</para><para>In many instances, that occupation has been beneficial. Military tenancy on North, South and Middle Heads, Georges Heights, and Woolwich has protected those areas from the last century of encroachment by civilian developers. The product of this fortunate occurrence has been the Harbour that residents of Sydney are so fortunate to have—with headlands naturally vegetated, and now 
 undergoing transition in many cases to become part of the Sydney Harbour National Park.</para><para>In addition, military occupation of those sites has also left a legacy of history—a heritage of military construction dating back almost to the time of first settlement. The headlands of both North and Middle Heads are worked with tunnels, and gun emplacements lie half-hidden over the headlands. In several cases, this construction dates back over a century. For a young country, this is an important source of history. In a way, this is almost our `Tower of London'.</para><para>But now the time has arrived when the current strictures on Defence funding has forced the Department of Defence to rationalise its land holdings. The Department does not readily give up prestige, inner-city, harbour-front sites on Middle Head, Garden Island, North Head and Neutral Bay, and treasured heritage mansions such as `Tresco', with their long military history. Defence has been forced to make some hard decisions, and has determined that these sites must be sacrificed in the name of rationalisation. Through the proceeds of sale from these properties, Defence is able to finance relocation of military units to sites in often less salubrious surroundings further north, where they may better contribute to Australian security. In some instances, the proceeds of sale will be used almost entirely to meet the cost of remediating the site, to rid maintenance sites of up to a century of accumulate industrial contamination.</para><para>Many residents of Sydney are currently concerned at this disposal action. This is understandable. The past century or so of benevolent tenancy by the Australian Defence Force has given a number of privileged harbourside residents an undemanding neighbour, allowing special access to the headlands and harbour foreshores.</para><para>The Defence Sub-Committee was also concerned at what might be lost, were the Department of Defence to suddenly abandon this land, which contributes so much to the nature of Sydney Harbour, giving free reign to profit-driven development. This was the reason for the Committee's visit to a number of Defence properties in November last year.</para><para>The Committee sought to determine whether this disposal would cause irreparable damage to one of the most beautiful harbours in the world. This report gives their findings.</para><para>In almost all cases examined by the Committee, Defence has consulted closely with local community groups, and the proposed developments are sensitive to environmental concerns. Where construction is proposed, to provide the funding which makes the disposals economically viable for Defence, that construction is restricted to areas currently occupied by Defence infrastructure. In many cases, Defence also proposes to revegetate 
 large areas, or increase open space provisions beyond what is currently in place. Under Defence's current development plans, unattractive and contaminated industrial sites such as Cockatoo Island and HMAS Platypus at Neutral Bay will be cleaned up, and access will be returned to the public.</para><para>Some local groups have made clear their disapproval of Defence's disposal option. This is also understandable, as some privileged residents may lose the advantage of some views or open space. However, the Committee believes the planned disposals will not result in a blemish to the harbour foreshores, nor cause loss of the character of the harbour. Considered collectively, the planned developments and associated remediation work will improve the appearance of the harbour environs. As some development is necessary to make the disposal viable to Defence, the Committee believes the proposed option offers a generally satisfactory compromise.</para><para>The only area where the Committee was critical of Defence's planning is in its current provisions for protection of some military heritage sites, particularly on Middle Head. The Committee was concerned that some areas of irreplaceable heritage value may be lost through neglect under current Defence planning. Some sites on land already transferred to the Sydney Harbour National Park are already being damaged by overgrowth and vandalism in areas where the State Government has been unable to adequately preserve and maintain them. This is an aspect of the impending disposals where the Committee recommends urgent action, at the Federal level, if this is needed.</para><para>I am also aware that the Prime Minister is considering use of the Federation Fund to purchase a number of these Defence properties as a gift for public use. Should he reach that decision, this would address the interests of the local residents unsatisfied with Defence's development plans. It would also meet the Defence objective of generating the funding which was the original intention of the rationalisation. The Committee believes this would remove the need for the current compromise. Should the Prime Minister decide against that purchase, the Committee believes that the option intended by the Department of Defence's current planning, while less desirable, would offer a satisfactory compromise between the competing interests. I commend the Committee's findings to the House.</para><para>Debate adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (STRENGTHENING OF PROVISIONS RELATING TO CHARACTER AND CONDUCT) BILL 1997</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>1075</page.no><id.no>r365</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Report of Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee</title><page.no>1075</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>1075</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Chee, Sen Bill</name><name role="display">Senator O'CHEE</name><name.id>EU4</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On behalf of Senator Abetz, I present the report of the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee on the provisions of the Migration Legislation Amendment (Strengthening of Provisions relating to Character and Conduct) Bill 1997, together with submissions and <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>  record of proceedings.</para></talk.start><para>Ordered that the report be printed.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>LEGISLATIVE INSTRUMENTS BILL 1996 [No. 2]</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>1075</page.no><id.no>r445</id.no><cognate><cognateinfo><title>COMMONWEALTH PLACES (MIRROR TAXES) BILL 1998</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>r440</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate><cognate><cognateinfo><title>COMMONWEALTH PLACES WINDFALL TAX (COLLECTION) BILL 1998</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>r442</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate><cognate><cognateinfo><title>COMMONWEALTH PLACES WINDFALL TAX (IMPOSITION) BILL 1998</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>r443</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate><cognate><cognateinfo><title>COMMONWEALTH PLACES (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 1998</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>r438</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate><cognate><cognateinfo><title>CHILD CARE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>r436</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>1075</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bills received from the House of Representatives.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>1075</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Schools, Vocational Education and Training</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I indicate to the Senate that those bills which have just been announced are being introduced together.

The Opposition did not debate the issues or suggest solutions. Rather, they merely indicated that the bill was not acceptable without attempting to identify ways of achieving an acceptable bill.</para><para>This bill is a major reform of the processes for the making, publication, scrutiny and sunsetting of Commonwealth delegated legislation.</para><para>As part of its Law and Justice and New Deal for Small Business policies, the Government undertook to introduce a Legislative Instruments Bill, with limited exemptions and specific provision for five-year sunsetting of regulations.</para><para>This bill implements those policies. In addition, the bill performs a gatekeeper role in relation to legislative instruments, by preventing the unchecked proliferation of delegated legislation.</para><para>The previous Government had introduced the Legislative Instruments Bill 1994. That bill was considered by several Parliamentary Committees, including the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, and many suggestions for change were made. The bill was awaiting passage in the Senate when Parliament was prorogued prior to the 1996 election.</para><para>The extent of scrutiny to which the 1994 bill was subjected is indicative of the importance of this legislative reform.</para><para>The Legislative Instruments Bill 1996 drew on that earlier work. In particular, this bill overcame the deficiencies of the 1994 bill by the introduction of a structured sunsetting regime, more structured consultation principles and processes that had been developed in the Council of Australian Governments, and the reduction of the exemptions from the operation of the bill. The bill represents the best achievable package of reforms. It represents a significant shift in control over delegated legislation back towards the Parliament, and increases Government accountability through improved access and consultation mechanisms.</para><para>This is the same bill that was introduced into the House of Representatives on 24 June 1996 and passed by that House on 11 September 1996 . The bill was introduced into the Senate on 8 October 1996 and, notwithstanding the strong general support of the Senate for the bill, finally passed on 
 25 September 1997 with 18 government and 35 other amendments. A large number of the non government amendments emasculated the stringent consultation principles and processes and removed the sunsetting regime.</para><para>On 17 November 1997 the House of Representatives considered the Senate amendments and returned the bill to the Senate. he House accepted the government amendments but rejected the other Senate amendments. The House accepted that many of the non government amendments were unnecessary and the major amendments made aspects of the bill unworkable. Further, the House also passed some additional government amendments.</para><para>On 5 December 1997, after the Senate had again considered the bill and amendments and insisted on its previous amendments, the House finally laid the bill aside.</para><para>The government is reintroducing this bill because it has a mandate to enact it and has a clear commitment to it . The government believes that the people of Australia have an expectation of a right of access to all legislation applying to them and that they have a right to participate in the development of all delegated legislation being made which will or might affect them.</para><para>The Government's Law and Justice Policy statement commits the government to ensuring that the consultation process under the bill would include the preparation of a regulatory impact statement which would clearly indicate the objectives of the proposed regulation, the alternatives for achieving those objectives, the costs and benefits of each alternative and the reason for the adoption of the measure advanced. This bill gives effect to that commitment and is welcomed by the business community and, no doubt , the broader community. The regulatory burden on business, and small business in particular, has been a major impediment to business efficiency and the creation of more jobs and should be significantly diminished as a result of this bill</para><para>The government will not accept amendment of the bill which would alter the principles of the bill or reduce the compliance requirements that rule-makers will need to follow. The Parliament expects no less accountability and information for legislation made pursuant to delegated powers than is available for primary legislation.</para><para>As I have said there is broad support for this legislation. What is disturbing in this matter is that both Houses have considered and passed each of the provisions of this bill and yet were unable to agree on passage of the bill as a whole. It is the classic case of playing politics to try and get concessions from government which restricts the government's capacity to control its important programs. This was evident in the delay in passage of the provisions relating to non-disallowance of 
 certain migration instruments and the exemption from the regime of a limited range of public sector terms and conditions instruments.</para><para>The Chair of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances has sought to remove exemptions from disallowance for instruments made under national schemes of legislation and Proclamations under the Quarantine Act.</para><para>I met with the Chair on these matters on a number of occasions and explained why I could not accede to his proposals . I have also written to the Chair setting out the reasons for my position and those letters have been tabled in the Senate.</para><para>The views on national schemes of legislation are founded on the R&amp; O Committee's Position Paper about Scrutiny of National Scheme Legislation which canvasses the desirability of Uniform Scrutiny Principles for national schemes. My Department made a substantial submission on an earlier Issues Paper on this subject drawing attention to a range of difficulties that needed to be considered. I understand that the Committee is currently considering a draft of its Report in the matter. To remove the exemption for national scheme legislation at this time would be premature without knowing the Committee's approach, the rationale for it and whether implementation of the Committee's Report is desirable, as it has major significance for both the Commonwealth and the states. Knowing the present uncertainty about final arrangements for a uniform scrutiny regime, clause 72 of the bill provides specifically for issues arising from national schemes of legislation to be considered in the course of the review of the operation of the legislative instruments legislation. That is the only appropriate way to approach the issue at this time.</para><para>The exemptions for quarantine proclamations are necessary because they are the only way to provide specific control mechanisms to prevent the entry and spread of disease and pests affecting humans, animals and plants in Australia.</para><para>Typically the detailed conditions under which importation of a particular commodity from a particular country or region may be allowed are set out in protocols developed by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service within the scope of the relevant quarantine proclamation. Each set of protocol conditions is developed on the basis of consideration of relevant scientific information and risk analysis.</para><para>Quarantine proclamations have never been subject to disallowance by the Parliament. This approach is being continued in the bill, on the basis that it is not appropriate to task the legislature to consider whether to disallow such highly technical instruments. Remedies on alleged procedural defects in the making of these instruments are available under 
 the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977.</para><para>Sunsetting of delegated legislation is an important component of the Government's policy on regulation review. It will ensure that business regulation is reduced to the minimum necessary for effective accountability and control and that remaining delegated legislation is regularly considered for appropriateness, currency, effectiveness and necessity.</para><para>The Administrative Review Council's report "Rule Making by Commonwealth Agencies" which led to this legislation recommended that all existing principal instruments of a legislative character and all instruments subject to the Legislative Instruments Act should be sunsetted. The House Committee in its report on the 1994 bill, which did not provide for sunsetting, recognised the resources issues associated with sunsetting and recommended that a sunsetting regime be introduced in relation to all existing and future legislative instruments as soon as possible . The House Committee's report on<inline font-style="italic"> Clearer Commonwealth Law</inline> , and the Access to Justice Advisory Committee's report <inline font-style="italic">Access to Justice</inline>  also supported the early introduction of a sunsetting program.</para><para>This bill gives effect to the Government's policy of ensuring that all new regulations are subject to a 5 year sunset clause. This is an important policy that the government can not, and will not, back away from. It is part of a range of policies that remove unnecessary burdens from the business community and benefits the whole community.</para><para>I commend the bill to the Senate.</para><para><inline ref="r440">COMMONWEALTH PLACES (MIRROR TAXES) BILL 1998</inline></para><para>The mirror tax provisions will ensure that stamp duties, payroll taxes, financial institutions duties and debits taxes can be applied in respect of Commonwealth places within each state.

As a result I announced on 23 January that the Government has decided to defer the implementation of the changed payments arrangements aspects of the bill until a child care card or similar technology is available. This technology will allow us to introduce a system which is more efficient for all parties.</para><para>To implement this decision, this bill seeks to defer implementation of the Child Care Payments Act 1997, and to amend the Child Care Act 1972 and the Childcare Rebate Act 1993 to allow the implementation of the other decisions taken in the 1997 Budget and reflected in the Child Care Payments Act 1997. 
</para><para>The bill introduces a head of power to allow the work related circumstances of a family to be taken into account when determining the amount of Childcare Assistance payable. Using this power, a limit of 20 hour of Childcare Assistance per week will be introduced for children of non working families. This measure ensures Commonwealth funds are more efficiently targeted to the primary objective of the program, that is, work related care.</para><para>The limit will be applied following the same policy parameters would have been used under the Child Care Payments Act 1997. Work related care is defined by reference to the Childcare Rebate Act 1993 and includes care required by families where both parents are or the single parent is working, looking for work, studying or training. It includes families where one parent is working and the other, because of a disability is unable to have work-related commitments or care for their child or children.</para><para>The bill also provides for exemptions from the 20 hour limit. Families in receipt of Child Disability Allowance for any child will be able to access more that 20 hours of Childcare Assistance in respect of all their children in care. Children at risk of neglect or abuse will also be able to access as much Childcare Assistance as they need as will children of families in crisis and children who have two disabled parents.</para><para>Finally, exemptions will exist for operators where they are the sole provider of care in an area. Guidelines setting out these exemptions will be in the form of a disallowable instrument presented to the Parliament.</para><para>A disallowable instrument will be made available to the Parliament which sets out the full detail of how the 20 hour limit will be applied.</para><para>In many areas of Australia there are too many child care centres while families in other areas have little or no access. The Child Care Payments Act 1997 sought to rectify this situation by imposing an effective limit of 7000 new places per year over the next two years. With the deferral of the Child Care Payments Act 1997 it is necessary to amend the Child Care Act 1972 to provide for this limit. Guidelines setting out the requirements for approval of places will be presented to the Parliament in the form of a disallowable instrument.</para><para>The government has also indicated its strong commitment to measures which encourage parents to properly immunise their children. The Child Care Payments Act 1997 contained provisions which required that children be immunised to qualify for child care subsidies. This bill replicates the immunisation requirements contained in that act and ensures that there is no further delay in implementing this important health initiative. Appropriate exemptions will be made to ensure that children at risk of abuse of neglect are not subject to these re 
 quirements. Guidelines for this purpose will be in the form of a disallowable instrument and will be presented to the Parliament.</para><para>Finally, the bill introduces for the first time confidentiality provisions into the Child Care Act 1972. These provisions follow very closely the provisions of the Child Care Payments Act 1997 and are necessary to ensure that families' information is secure.</para><para>Ordered that the second reading of these bills be adjourned until the first day of the winter sittings, in accordance with standing order 111.</para><para>Ordered that the  Legislative Instruments Bill 1996 [No. 2]  and the  Child Care Legislation Amendment Bill 1998  be listed on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline> as separate orders of the day.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>NOTICES OF MOTION</title><type>Notices</type><page.no>1078</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Regulations and Ordinances Committee</title><page.no>1078</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>1078</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Chee, Sen Bill</name><name role="display">Senator O'CHEE</name><name.id>EU4</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Pursuant to notice given at the giving of notices today, on behalf of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee, I now withdraw Business of the Senate notice of motion No. 1 standing in my name, for the disallowance of Public Interest Determination No. 7 made under part VI of the Privacy Act 1988.</para></talk.start></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT (TRUST LOSS AND OTHER DEDUCTIONS) BILL 1997</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>1078</page.no><id.no>r354</id.no><cognate><cognateinfo><title>FAMILY TRUST DISTRIBUTION TAX (PRIMARY LIABILITY) BILL 1997</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>r322</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate><cognate><cognateinfo><title>FAMILY TRUST DISTRIBUTION TAX (SECONDARY LIABILITY) BILL 1997</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>r323</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate><cognate><cognateinfo><title>MEDICARE LEVY CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENT (TRUST LOSS) BILL 1997</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>r335</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>1078</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>1078</page.no><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name><name.id>3L6</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am disappointed that Senator Murray has not rejoined us yet for the debate.

 about both this legislation and trusts in general.</para></talk.start><para>If I can re-cap where I was before. We were discussing how much tax a company, a PAYE individual and a trust with two beneficiaries was paying. The comparisons for $50,000 were: $18,000 for the company; $14,000 for the PAYE individual; and for the two beneficiaries of the trust, a grand total of $9,044. That is half the tax of a company and about a third of the tax less than a PAYE individual. And they say, `Why do we want to have trusts? Why is it such a big issue that anybody has got trusts? What is the problem?' As John Moore said in that other chamber, `If you have not got a unit trust, you are just a public sector bludger.' We will tell you who the bludgers are. That is what involved here.</para><para>The bigger the number of beneficiaries, the bigger the tax avoidance. That is why Senator Murray and the Democrats are reprehensible for the amendments which they are moving here. If a company earns $100,000, it pays $36,000 in tax.

But if you have four beneficiaries—and Senator Murray stood up earlier today and said, `No, mine is just two beneficiaries; two children, me and my wife'—with an income of $100,000, the total tax paid is $18,000 compared to $37,000 for the same PAYE earner.

Assuming there is no other income and that there are four beneficiaries—two children, the breadwinner and the spouse—each beneficiary pays $14,000 in tax, plus $750 for the Medicare levy. The total family tax bill comes to $59,408, or an effective tax rate of just under 30 per cent. So the trust with four beneficiaries—Senator Murray—pays tax, if earning $200,000, of just under 30 per cent. If that $200,000 were assessed in the hands of the chief breadwinner, the tax bill would come to $84,000, plus the Medicare levy of $3,000, that is, an effective tax rate of almost 44 per cent. That is right: you have a choice between a 30 per cent tax rate, if you are in a trust, and 44 per cent, if you are a poor mug PAYE earner.</para></talk.start></continue><para>What the government and the Democrats are doing today is opening the loophole further. They will tell you that the Taxation Laws Amendment (Trust Loss and Other Deductions) Bill 1997 is about being tough on family trusts. I say to ACOSS and those other welfare groups which are involved in discussions with the government and business over the GST and a tax package that this govern 
 ment is not serious about taxing trusts. The loopholes in this bill are a disgrace.</para><para>The government have already ruled out negative gearing—they will not touch it. They are opening the gap for families to traffic in trust losses in this bill. They say, `Trafficking in trust losses is a terrible thing. We'll stop it. but if you are a family, that's okay, you can turn around and open up all sorts of extra provisions under this legislation,' which was not our legislation. That is what is going on with trusts in this bill. And Senator Murray is making it worse. The Democrats' position is to open up further holes for families to traffic in trust losses—quite extraordinary.</para><para>The evidence given before the Senate committee contradicted the Treasurer who stood up and said, `We had the Labor bill and this is what the gains were going to be.

 talk about introducing a GST—lumping that on the battlers of this country; but you are not prepared in any way, shape or form to address this question of tax avoidance through trafficking in trust losses. It is simply not acceptable. When this legislation does finally go to the vote I will be voting for it; but I wish that I was voting for something much stronger. I will not be supporting the Democrats' amendment. Hopefully, one day, we will see decent legislation brought into this parliament that will actually deal with the type of tax avoidance problems that do occur as a result of trafficking in trust losses.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>1082</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I will respond briefly to the comments which have been raised on this legislation. First of all, let me make a couple of points in relation to Senator Conroy's speech. It occurred to me that there should be a standing order against overacting and, if there had been, Senator Conroy would have been warned, at least once or twice—and then thrown out. I have never heard such a lot of nonsense in all my life. I had to remind Senator Conroy that he was supporting the bill. He seemed to have forgotten that until I reminded him about two-thirds of the way through his speech, and a look of surprise came over his face. But Senator Conroy, that is your party's position on this.</para></talk.start><para>And then Senator Conroy got into an absolute lather about tax avoidance. It occurred to me, as I thought back, Mr Acting Deputy President, that when we brought in, for example, the measures on R&amp;D syndicates—which of course was a major hole and being exploited in the taxation system—the Labor Party, led by Senator Cook, fought us tooth and nail. When we brought in the measure on the superannuation surcharge—which was to bring greater equity to the superannuation system—we looked in vain for support from the Labor Party. This was a surcharge on higher income earners, and the Labor Party went missing in action. Then I remembered the debate on the infrastructure bonds: boy, were you blokes woolly on that one, too.</para><para>So, Senator Conroy, it is all very well to run these lines. It is good class war stuff, and 
 it might excite the troops back home when you post a copy of your speech to the local branches. But the local branches should be aware that when the Labor Party is tested on tax avoidance, it has always been my experience that they go missing in action. When we seek, as we did with the superannuation surcharge, to bring greater equity to the system, you guys are nowhere to be seen; in fact, you fought it tooth and nail.

You are so opposed to trusts. The Labor Party, apparently, was so opposed to the use of trusts. It did occur to me to wonder how long it took the Labor Party—13 years in government—to bring in its legislation on trusts. Thirteen years—so there is this massive concern that Senator Conroy evinced, and how long did it take the Labor Party to do anything about it? Well, of course, they did not. By the time they had brought it in, the Labor Party was history as a government—as it should have been. We indicated, when that bill came in, that we would accept the starting date, but we wanted to make sure there was 
 proper consultation in the wider community, and that certainly occurred.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Senator Conroy, what I have to say about all this rhetoric and all this passion is that when you examine the history, when you examine the taxation system which you left to us—which we are now trying to repair—I would have thought a modicum of modesty would have prevented you from getting up and carrying on like a goose. It is not as though I have done much research on my response to your speech but, as you spoke, the lines were so desperately obvious.</para><para>It was an extraordinary speech. It struck me that it completely lacked any understanding of the history of his party on issues to do with trusts and issues to do with tax avoidance. Let me quote one further example. How dead serious is the Labor Party on tax avoidance? After 13 years in office, what did they discover during the election campaign? Remember all that? They discovered high wealth individuals. After 13 years in office, this was suddenly raised by the then Prime Minister.</para><para>The truth of the matter is the Labor Party is not serious on tax. The Labor Party has not got a clue where to go on tax. That is why you get yourself into such trouble. You have not got a clue what to do. It would be a good thing, rather than making these sorts of speeches, Senator Conroy, if you and your colleagues sat down and did some jolly hard work on taxation because the community is noting that, every time the contributions are made by your leaders and your senior people, they last for a brief period of time before they are reversed by Mr Beazley or reversed by the heavyweights in the party.</para><para>I listened to Senator Cook's remarks very carefully, as I always do, because he is the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in this chamber.

I wondered if you were going to provide further enlightenment on the tax policy of the Labor Party, but you did not. Again, Senator Cook did not make it crystal clear to people listening that the Labor Party was supporting this bill before the chamber—as it should. I think a lot 
 of people will look with great interest at the remarks on trusts which a number of Labor senators have made in the course of debating this bill.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3L6</name.id><name role="metadata">CONROY</name><name role="display">Senator Conroy</name></talker><para>—Deny they are not true; come on.

The purpose of the trust loss measures is to restrict the recruitment of losses and other deductions of trusts in order to prevent the transfer of the tax benefit to the losses. This occurs when a person who did not bear the economic effect of a loss when it was incurred by the trust obtains the benefit as a result of the trust's ability to deduct the loss. The proposed measures which are before this chamber will prevent a significant erosion of the tax base that would otherwise arise from the transfer of tax benefit of trust losses. There are no provisions in the income tax law similar to those which apply to companies which effec 
 tively regulate the deductibility of trust losses against current and future income.</para></talk.start></continue><para>`During the debate some non-government speakers raised concerns about the time taken to introduce this legislation into the parliament. I think that it is important to recall that the delay has largely been a result of the government's desire to consult widely on this important item of legislation, which the government did. The consultation has resulted in legislation that takes account of the legitimate concerns of taxpayers while preserving and, in some respects, improving the integrity of the measures.</para><para>In the debate, some non-government senators raised concerns about the government's decision to change the application of the income injection test to family trusts. People will look very closely to see what the Labor Party's policy is on family trusts as we go to the next election. I think that people will be reading very closely what was said. In making the change in relation to family trusts, the government has recognised a concern raised by small business—that not allowing family members to inject their income into their own family trusts was unfair.</para><para>We consulted very widely on this bill. It was a great pity that Senator Conroy was not better informed before he gave us that earlier performance this afternoon, which may well come back and haunt him, I suspect. The changes made to the income injection test fully implement the policy that the tax benefit of trust losses should be able to be transferred only within a family group. This policy was recognised in part in the previous government's legislation which allowed individual family members to inject their income into their family trust.</para><para>Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, normally one likes to thank senators for their contribution in the second reading debate.

In accordance with comments in the majority report, the government has also considered submissions and evidence given to the committee in order to determine whether any amendments to the legislation are warranted. Many of the government's amendments arise from this examination and from other comments made since the introduction of the legislation.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The amendments essentially deal with technical issues designed to clarify the intended operation of the proposed provisions. The amendments also include a change to the transitional rules dealing with the making and revocation of family trust and interposed entity elections. Requests 1 and 2 will ensure that a unit trust held by a discretionary trust is not treated as a widely held unit trust. Amendments 1 and 2 will ensure that the measures do not operate in relation to excepted trusts. Amendments 3 and 9 will ensure that entities owned by one or more family trusts can be members of a family group.</para><para>Amendments 7 and 8 will ensure that a family trust or other family entity will pass the family control test if it is owned by one or more family trusts of the family concerned. Amendment 7 will also ensure that one or more legal or financial advisers can control a trust, along with the family, for the purposes of the family control test.</para><para>Amendments 11 to 16 will ensure that the transitional provision dealing with the pattern of distributions test applies to all relevant distributions that need to be taken into account. Amendments 17, 18, 20 and 21 and amendment 10—new item 11A—will implement the new transitional arrangements for the making of family trust and interposed entity elections.</para><para>In broad terms, the arrangements are as follows: taxpayers wishing to make the election for the 1997-98 or earlier years will be required to do so by the term of lodging their 1997-98 tax returns. The election will need to be in a form approved by the commissioner but will not need to be lodged with the commissioner. Rather, the taxpayer will be required to keep the election. A taxpayer who made the election by the time of lodging their 1997-98 return will be required to lodge details of the election as part of their 1998-99 tax return.</para><para>Amendment 19 will implement a new transitional arrangement for the revocation of family trust elections. In broad terms, this arrangement provides for revocations in respect of the 1994-95, 1995-96, 1996-97 and 1997-98 income years to be made in tax returns for the 1998-99 income year.

Those questions were: on what are the figures based; is there a list of previously lodged claims; are we prepared to target this revenue; have these estimates been adjusted since 1995; and what impact did the family amendments announced on budget night this year have on these estimates?

</para><para>These amendments relate to the definition of spouse. This is not about tax evasion. My amendment seeks to change the basic definition of de facto spouse through the Income Tax Assessment Act. It changes the definition to remove the implication that living as the husband or wife of the person refers to the specifics of the Marriage Act rather than the common usage where a lesbian might say, `This is my wife', or a gay man might say, `This is my husband', in order to explain the relationship. In practice, of course, society has moved to the point where either same or opposite sex couples who are not actually married, or even some who are, are likely to introduce the person they have a life bond with by saying, `This is my partner.' In fact, there is really no conceivable argument for denying same sex partners the same recognition that opposite sex de factos are given.</para><para>We are not talking here about marriage. Even the Catholic bishops have stated that, in the interest of simple human decency and justice, committed same sex couples should at least get the recognition given to unmarried heterosexual couples, particularly since we persist in denying same sex partners any legal recognition, even when they make their bonds formal through public and/or religious ceremonies. Note that we deny them the right of legal recognition of a formal bond, but we go much further in denying them the right of recognition granted to every unmarried same sex couple. As with opposite sex couples, sometimes one is dependent or relatively dependent and sometimes both have jobs. The point is that what is granted by right to any unmarried opposite sex couple, almost regardless of their circumstance is denied to all same sex couples regardless of their commitment.</para><para>These are real things—not just simple public recognition and acceptance. They are things like being recognised as next of kin in hospital decisions about a partner who has been in an accident; sometimes surprising things like the impact of proposed aged care measures; things like having wills overridden by family on the basis that there was no real recognised legal relationship; things like custody of children who may have grown up 
 with the couple in the case where one dies, or the treatment of partners under superannuation where a devoted life partner of decades gets no recognition because they are a same sex partner, while someone of the opposite sex with a loose association for a couple of years is granted automatic de facto status.</para><para>I understand the Democrats will support these amendments, as they have done in the past. The indication that we have got from the ALP so far is that this time their objection will be based on the fact that this is a bill about tax minimisation. That may be so, but this is not an issue about tax minimisation. Our first amendment is to section 6 of the definition of spouse through the Income Tax Assessment Act of 1936. Our second amendment is to 159TC where the definition is replicated to prevent same sex couples from contributing to a spouse's superannuation, a right granted to any de facto opposite sex couple. The issue is central and one of human rights and blatant discrimination.</para><para>The definition of family members for the purposes of a family trust, which is the definition, whether or not there is any reference to trust losses, is a basic definition of who is in a family trust, even though it is in a new schedule having to do with trust losses. Even on this issue, I am unclear on what basis, other than blatant discrimination, anybody could possibly object. If granting family trusts the ability to trade losses is something other than simply handing people a tax rort on a platter, then whatever justification there is for doing so with heterosexuals applies equally to homosexuals or bisexuals. If, for example, the ability to trade trust losses if seen as important for family trusts because they may have been established to manage a family business, then what justification is there for excluding people who establish a trust to manage a completely similar trust with no grounds other than that they are a same sex couple.</para><para>This is actually a very good example of the inequity and complexity of discrimination. The government, in 27295, seeks to define family for the purposes of distributing benefits within family trusts as an individual and their spouse and any of their parents, siblings, 
 nephews and nieces, children and children's children, and the spouse of any mentioned family member. Child is defined liberally to include ex-nuptial, adoptive and other kinds of children which may not be biological children. If there is any benefit to the treatment of trust losses for family trusts, those benefits can be passed to an ex-nuptial child of a spouse of an adopted child or a de facto spouse. These people are allowed to benefit. Paradoxically, they are allowed to benefit regardless of their sexual orientation. A same sex partner who has been living with the test individual, and therefore all their family regardless of sexual orientation, would however be excluded, in spite of having lived as the partner of that person for decades or having been married in any one of the churches like the Metropolitan Community Church.</para><para>Let me reiterate: we will give benefits from a family business run through a trust to the gay adopted grandchild of a short-term de facto partner but deny it to the straight child of the same sex partner in a long-term committed relationship. This is absurd. Of course, we extend our discrimination to the same sex partners of any family member, although we recognise all opposite sex partners. I could imagine arguing that no-one in a family trust should get an exemption on this trust loss legislation. Nobody has put out such an amendment. I therefore cannot see why any party here should tolerate or promote discrimination in tax treatment based only on sexual orientation. That is what is being done here and what my amendment seeks to reverse</para><para>My first amendment, to section 6 of the 1936 act, would eliminate the discrimination against same sex couples through the Income Tax Assessment Act—the primary change that needs to be made. There are two contingent changes that should be made at the same time. My second amendment would change the 159TC definition of de facto spouse, which was replicated from section 6, for the purpose of superannuation contributions to a spouse, which was passed last year.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Sitting suspended from 6.30 p.m. to 7.30 p.m. </inline></para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>DX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name></talker><para>—I was in full flood at the time the dinner break was called and I was getting to the point of explaining the final part of my three amendments.

They are saying the problem is that we are now suggesting, if we make this amendment, that it could be more generally applied.</para></talk.start><para>The irony is that we have had complaints when we have mentioned these various bills and the opposition has said, `Oh no, we can't do this piecemeal because we want to deal with it in a general sense'. `We can't deal with it because it has a revenue implication.' `We can't deal with it this time because it has implications for other bills.' There is always an excuse. There will be a time at some stage when the Labor Party will actually have to deal with its own policies, and there will be a time when the Labor Party will have to explain to the gay and lesbian community in Australia exactly why they are acting in this way.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>1097</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I totally support the amendments put forward by Senator Margetts. I think the argument put forward by the opposition is bereft. What it says serially, in response to the amendments that are consistently brought forward by Senator Margetts, is that this needs to be dealt with in some other way. But the opposition never comes up with that other way, despite its ability to do so and despite its so-called 
 commitment to the end of discrimination against gay and lesbian people. It always says, `Another day, in some other form.' I am not only sick of that but I brand it as nothing other than discriminatory.</para></talk.start><para>Let me declare an interest: I have a male partner. I understand the situation that people who feel strongly about this take. I take umbrage on their behalf at the fact that we have not only the government not accepting the logic of Senator Margetts's amendment but the opposition saying, `This is not important enough for us to deal with tonight. Indeed, it has beneficial flow-on effects for those people who are discriminated against. Therefore, we have to be wary of it.'</para><para>I would have thought that the argument Senator Cook put forward is an excellent one for voting for this. The process has to start somewhere. Time and again, on social justice legislation, Senator Margetts has said that it is socially unjust to have this constricted definition of spouse which effectively includes a partner but not when it is a same-sex couple. It is effectively restricted to heterosexual couples. That is of itself discriminatory.</para><para>Long ago this parliament passed legislation recognising that to single out people who are homosexual is to be discriminatory. Senator Margetts time and again says, `Here is the opportunity to end this discrimination, to turn it around, at least in so far as the legislation before the Senate is concerned.' The government sets its steely face against the end of such discrimination, and the Labor Party says it is not the time to do it. Well, when is the time? I challenge the Labor Party to come forward with the broad brush legislation it repeatedly says is going to end this discrimination.</para><para>Short of that, I have to say that we are involved in a discriminatory process involving perhaps a million Australians. And that is not what the Labor Party stands for. It may be something we can associate with Liberal Party ideals, although, as I recollect it, it was the Fraser government that led the way in this country in bringing to an end the discrimination against homosexual people as far as relationships are concerned under the law. But it did not go far enough. I challenge the 
 government to make sure that that end to discrimination goes right through the laws of the Commonwealth.</para><para>I challenge the Labor Party to do the same. And I ask the question: when is the time for this? After 13 years of Labor in office, after two years of the coalition in office, there is no sign of adopting, for example, the very strong move by the Democrats to end such discrimination. It is left to the smaller parties to continue to try to pick away at this. It is a challenge to the big parties, the alternative governments. Is the Labor Party going to come up with an election platform which says, `We will act as a matter of priority to end this discrimination'? Is the government going to announce in its election policy that it is going to end this discrimination  and in fact show good faith by doing it before the election or is it going to stand indicted for its continuing discrimination on a whole range of social justice issues such as this? I commend Senator Margetts on her forbearance, her persistence and her stoicism, because it is a very important matter which she raises. I only wish we were getting a more positive response from the major parties in this place.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>1098</page.no><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name><name.id>RF4</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I must say I am rather disappointed in the views that have just been expressed.

It just so happens that we are not in government, we have not introduced this legislation to the chamber and we are not the ones who command a majority here most of the time. I would have thought that if there were sincerity in the points of view being expressed then they would have been expressed to the government whose legislation this is and not to the Labor Party who are manfully trying to improve the legislation. I put that as 
 a first, albeit not very significant, point. But it is a point of demeanour or approach. You people get up and are pleased to slag off at the Labor Party.

I do not appreciate, on behalf of my party, being attacked that the Labor Party is somehow reactionary or recalcitrant in this; we are not. We have a good record on social reform in this country, and I do not expect anyone to criticise it. But I do think that if people are serious, they should not be en

But for the Labor Party to say that this is facade-ism and to accuse me, and in particular Senator Margetts, who has, as she said, raised this issue time and time again, and for it particularly to hide behind the specious argument that there may be other beneficial flow-ons to other pieces of legislation from the disadvantaged and discriminated sector of our community, is to lose itself as far as having any shred of justification for the position it takes is concerned.</para><para>I reiterate: to vote against this amendment by Senator Margetts is to vote for the inherent discrimination of the constrictive definition of spouse, which says that this applies to heterosexual relationships but not to homosexual relationships in this country.

It was also made very clear by the witnesses that they believed that the bill introduced in October 1997 was quite materially different from that foreshadowed by Labor on 9 May 1995 and later prepared. It was that view that things were so materially different which occasioned a great deal of distress. In the remarks made by Senator Cook earlier and confirmed a couple of times, it is Labor's view that this bill is quite different in a number of respects from that that they intended to move.</para><para>The Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills reviewed the question of retrospectivity and came to the view that this bill did infringe the rights and liberties of individuals. The Democrats and, indeed, other political parties in the Senate have a long history of not supporting retrospective activities. The view was expressed by Senator Bishop today—correctly—that at times tax retrospectivity has been approved. However, since this bill was directed originally at trafficking in trust losses and since the belief was that trafficking in trust losses had ended on 9 May 1995 after Treasurer Willis's announcement, our view is that a substantial number of trust losses which have been legitimate to date are put at risk by the dating of the bill.</para><para>We believe that the bill requires amendment to ensure that losses on foot at 9 May 1995, rather than being at risk of extinguishment by the bill, remain available and without taxation penalty. The stated intention of this government is that the bill will apply, effective 9 May 1995, to losses on foot at that time—some two years and 10 months ago and covering some four consecutive tax years. To eliminate its retrospective operations a simple operational clause needs to be inserted or the existing operational references need to be amended so that the bill is only effective from the time of its introduction to parliament—in other words, from the time that the profes 
 sions and their clients understood its operation; that is, 1 October 1997. Its operational effect limited to extinguishing losses on foot at that time is to allow the test and penalty provisions to apply to unused losses from that date only.</para><para>The effect intended by limiting the retrospective operation of the bill is to ensure that losses used between 9 May 1995 and 1 October 1997—that is when the impact and the detail of the bill was unknown to trust users—will attract no penalty from the bill. We have got together, therefore, amendment No. 2. The entire purpose of that is to prevent retrospective application to matters other than trafficking in trust losses. I accordingly look for Senate support for amendment No. 2 on sheet 871.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>1102</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I cannot remember the number of times that I have been in this chamber—especially when we were sitting on those crossbenches rather than on these crossbenches—that we have heard outrage from a range of frontbenchers and backbenchers from the coalition in relation to retrospectivity.

In this particular instance, we are not talking about not backdating a tax rort, but of legitimate practices that have gone on and have been encouraged by government departments in terms of rolling over tax losses.    </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>1103</page.no><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name><name.id>RF4</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Labor Party will not be supporting this amendment. Ralph Willis's last budget as Treasurer announced this legislation in May 1995—or at least it announced the original, virile, muscular version of this legislation, and not the watered-down piece of legislation that we have in front of us now. The then opposition—now the government—referred it to a committee, held it up, and we were not able to legislate it. Back then we said, `Here is an area of tax avoidance that needs to be dealt with promptly. When bills relating to tax are announced, they ought to come into effect immediately. That is the end of the rort period. Bang! This is where the government is going to go. All those who engaged in this sort of behaviour, beware, because anything you do from now on will be taken away from you.' That is a consistent principle on taxation, and it would be wrong for us to depart from that now. We will not and, therefore, we will not be supporting this amendment.</para></talk.start><para>The other reason why we will not be supporting this amendment is the cost of it. One has to have regard to cost. The tax system in Australia is constructed to raise a certain amount of revenue in order to meet the costs of delivering public services and benefits to the community. Quite clearly, if some revenue is not raised in one way, then inevitably it will be raised in another.</para><para>One of the points made by my colleague Senator Conroy in his contribution on the second reading went to this very issue. If tax avoiders—that is, people who are wealthy—have income which enables them to retain legal and accountancy advice to minimise their tax payments and arrange their affairs so as to avoid taxation, and thus escape the tax obligations that ordinary citizens feel and are obliged to meet, it does not mean that there is a gap: someone else meets it. Those people who cannot necessarily afford all the advantages of a well-incomed person—people on low incomes—end up meeting it. Tax avoidance usually favours the wealthy and imposes a penalty on low income people—on the poor.</para><para>I am advised that bringing forward the operational date to 1 October 1997, which is more than two years after it was announced that this measure should be introduced, would mean that the revenue would forgo $400 million. That is a substantial amount. I do not know whether the government will confirm it, but that is my advice. I think it is good advice and I think that that is a reasonable ballpark figure. That is $400 million that people who are wealthy enough to form trusts can avoid, but people on pay-as-you-earn incomes—people who pay tax because it is taken out of their income every week, fortnight or month according to how they are paid—cannot avoid it.</para><para>Those people will pay the end bill of $400 million because the government will end up raising the amount of revenue that it wants. I do not think that is a fair thing to do, and the interests of low paid people have to be considered when the interests of all people are being considered in this. Everyone has been on notice since May 1995, so it is not as though they did not know that this legislation was coming. Certainly, they might be a bit surprised about how slow this government was in bringing it forward, but they did know that it was coming. For that reason, I do not think this amendment should succeed.</para><para>The two issues that I have dealt with do not quite go to one of the points raised by Senator Margetts when, in supporting this amendment, she made an observation about the lack of voices on the government benches opposed to retrospectivity. I have heard that argument too. I know who the advocates of it are. For the record, I just want to say that retrospective application of the law is, as a principle, unjust. People do things which are legal, and to have them subsequently declared illegal and have the law reach back in time and penalise them for what they did is unjust. That is a well-known principle.</para><para>However, there is an exception in the case of tax avoidance, and I think it is an appropriate one. Where people manage to evade tax in such a way that their fellow taxpayers have to bear the burden of that evasion, and they do it in a way that was never intended—they find a loophole, contort the technicalities, 
 manipulate the act to artificially find a way through that you could say was legal but which was never intended and which is against what the popular understanding of appropriate behaviour was—in those circumstances governments should always be ready to legislate retrospectively and to wipe out those gains. That would kill off the tax avoidance industry. If they knew a government was prepared to wipe out the ill-gotten gains of tax avoidance, then there would be no profit in being a tax avoider. In those circumstances, there is a case for retrospective legislation.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>1104</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I ought to correct some of the statements that have just been made by Senator Cook. I clearly stated that the Greens (WA) did not have a problem with retrospectively looking at those people, and we know there have been people—and for some reason the Australian Taxation Office has avoided prosecuting them for trading in tax losses—who have been advised by government departments and entities to structure their businesses as trusts over time, and had done it not as a means of rorting the system but as a means of legitimate carryover of losses for the benefit of utilising at some stage when they do gain an income. I do not think they are the people that Senator Cook was describing.</para></talk.start><para>We have never stood up here on the principle that those people who have rorted the system should be able to get away with it. What we have said all along about this legislation is that it is not designed to particularly target those people who have rorted the system. It seems to be getting at the wrong people. This retrospectivity is likely to cast a wide net and it seems to be a fairly blatant revenue grab. That is what I am saying. It is not about those people who have misused the system; it is about those people who have legitimate reasons. I would think the majority of the people who will be losing money in this particular revenue grab will have done so for legitimate reasons.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>1104</page.no><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name><name.id>3L6</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Senator Kemp has not had a chance yet to confirm the question that Senator Cook asked. 
 I ask whether Senator Murray has any estimate of the revenue that this amendment would forgo. Senator Margetts, I think you have been sold a pup. If there is no change—and this came out in the committee hearings—in the underlying ownership of the trust they can still carry the losses forward. That is the key test. If they incurred the economic loss, they can still carry it forward. The only trick to this is if they try to sell it off or change their structure and be something else, or owned partially or differently, then they cannot carry it forward because the new body in actual fact did not incur the economic loss. So I put it very strongly: you have been sold a pup on the way this legislation will impact upon these arrangements.</para></talk.start><para>I am also concerned about the distress that Senator Murray seemed to find at the committee hearings, the distress from the battlers of Brighton—all those multicultural people that Senator Murray is so concerned about who live in Brighton and put in submissions to the committee. Those same people told us they had never seen anybody or knew of anybody trafficking in trust losses or even noticed any trafficking in trust losses. They had failed to notice the ads in the newspapers that became so blatant that they said, `Here we have some trust losses to sell. Come and buy a trust loss off us.'</para><para>Nobody who appeared before the committee had noticed or knew anybody who noticed or participated in trafficking in trust losses. So those same people want to come forward and talk about the distress, which Senator Murray claims he detected. I have to say that I had some trouble believing that they were suffering significant distress. I understand that they are upset about the possibility of losing $300 million worth of revenue over the last three years that the government will pick up.</para><para>But I want to come back to a couple of points I made earlier. I refer to Senator Murray's minority report where he talks about trusts and launches into quite a lengthy defence of the poor, innocent, much maligned family trust. He quotes from the eminent economist Professor John Quiggin, who says:</para><para>There are almost no trusts in Australia established for legitimate purposes . . . The vast majority of 
 trusts are set up with the primary purpose of avoiding tax that should be paid by high-income earners, thereby transferring the burden onto the rest of us. It is these trusts that are typically referred to as `legitimate family trusts'.</para><para>It worries me that you have this perception of legitimate family trusts. A quote I read earlier and contained in Senator Murray's report is from Robert Gottliebsen where he basically describes `income-splitting trusts' as `the cornerstone of the structure of a large number of the country's very small businesses'. That is what they are for. They are designed to exploit the tax-free threshold. What I mean by `exploit' is that you share around the $5,400 among your two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10 people, and if Senator Murray had his way earlier we would have about 20 people sharing $5,400.</para><para>The way it works is that you are able to pass the income through the different people, lowering everybody's individual rate. I am not sure if you were in the chamber when I spoke earlier, Senator Margetts, but some examples have been in newspapers, freely available, in articles by George Megalogenis and Phillip Hudson.</para><para>For example, a PAYE person who earns $50,000 would pay $14,000 in tax but a two-beneficiary trust would pay $9,000. A $100,000 with four beneficiaries—these are not big amounts of money; these are what you would possibly perceive as legitimate family trusts—would pay only $18,000 in tax compared to a PAYE of $37,000. That is half the legitimate amount of tax. The income that the entity has generated is just split up. I have not heard Senator Murray address this issue at all. If he wants to defend legitimate family trusts then the Democrats' position is to stand up and explain that the cornerstone of a family trust is about effectively tax planning the $5,400 tax-free threshold. That is it.</para><para>It is nothing more exciting than that. It is just the ability to play around with as many tax free thresholds as you can lump into your trust. George Megalogenis says that for a breadwinner and a PAYE taxpayer who earns $200,000, the effective tax rate, with the Medicare levy, is 44 per cent. If he or she is lucky enough to have a legitimate family trust of four—that is, a breadwinner, a spouse of 
 either sex and children—they are able to minimise their effective tax rate to just under 30 per cent.</para><para>That is what it is about. It is not about retrospectivity. It is not about whether or not there was distress at the committee. The cornerstone of this debate is whether the public revenue loss that has been going on and growing is due to more and more people taking advantage of effective tax planning, effective tax minimisation—all of which is completely legal. Senator Murray and the Democrats talk about this in their minority report. At page 20 of the report, the first page of Senator Murray's minority report, it states:</para><para>. . . trusts may be used to maximise tax effectiveness and tax planning in ways which are not available to incorporated bodies.</para><para>Senator Murray states it in black and white. `Maximise tax effectiveness' is accountants' code for tax avoidance. It is perfectly legal but that is what it means.</para><para>I am worried that Senator Margetts has been sold a pup, as I have said a couple of times, and she has the perception that we are bashing legitimate family trusts and that the government is attacking legitimate family trusts. The key point is that if there is no change in the underlying ownership, if the same people are continuing to trade in the same way under this legislation, they can carry forward their loss. It is only if they try to sell off their loss and change their structure that they are going to be caught by this legislation.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:25:00</time.stamp><page.no>1105</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Senator Conroy may remember that during my speech in the second reading debate, or perhaps he was not listening to my speech, I said that we thought it was odd that the family trust should have been picked out by the government as being exempt from this legislation.

As you know, we have worked on a 
 number of committees together and we have been pursuing this matter of trusts for some time. I may have missed it, because I did not read all the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>  from the House of Representatives, but I think it would be helpful for you to say whether you are in fact changing Labor policy to outlaw trusts altogether. Alternatively, which is a legitimate construction put upon the remarks you made earlier, I would have been surprised if you did not move an amendment to excise government exemptions for family trusts. I do not know whether what I am hearing is a personal message or is Labor Party policy. I would have thought that if that is how Labor felt then that is the amendment they should have moved and which we would have considered.</para></talk.start><para>I now turn to the question on which we disagree, Senator Cook. You would be aware that I do the best I can in committee to understand the proceedings and to arrive at a considered conclusion. Quite often we have had the same conclusion and a number of times we have not—it depends on the committee. The problem that the coalition, the Labor Party and the Democrats face is that neither the ATO nor the various professionals who deal with these things or any other person at the hearing could fully outline the consequences of the legislation that is before us.</para><para>If there is one thing we are all in agreement on in this chamber it is that the legislation before us is different to that which was put up by Labor. The point that they made quite clearly and which we have taken up and with which we disagree, concerns the consequence that people who legitimately lay off losses against profits, as is normal in any business activity, are going to be prejudiced. Amongst those people prejudiced are quite a range of people who do not number amongst the  so-called very wealthy.</para><para>Neither I nor, I suspect, anyone else can tell you the extent of that problem because none of the expert witnesses could—and they are more expert in these matters than probably anyone here, possibly with the exception of someone like Senator Watson who is pretty cluey on this stuff.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>DX5</name.id><name role="metadata">MARGETTS</name><name role="display">Senator Margetts</name></talker><para>—He's not here.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3M6</name.id><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name></talker><para>—No, he is not here. That was the problem we faced. We were informed in our opinion by Labor's Senator Cooney who chairs the Scrutiny of Bills Committee and brought down a report saying, `This thing has a retrospective problem.'</para></talk.start></continue><para>We felt this was the correct principle to deal with that. In our report we deliberately drew attention to the problems that exist with trusts. Most fundamentally, under neither the Labor government nor the coalition government has there been a proper analysis of trusts. The very questions I asked elicited for the first time some understanding of their profile.</para><para>Frankly, none of us, Democrats included, know the detail of how trusts look. It is far too easy, far too simple and far too prejudicial to automatically wipe them off. It is the same kind of language if you say that all unions are bad or all trusts are bad. Yes, some are bad, but some others are not. We have to be careful of that. I deliberately quoted Professor John Quiggin because he is very hard on trusts. I did not put that in my report by accident. He said that there are almost no trusts in Australia established for legitimate purposes. What I want to know is what informed him to that opinion. What research has been done? There is none available in a broad, analytical, credible sense. I said in the second reading debate that we are more than happy for the government to change direction—but they should change direction not retrospectively but prospectively because that is how you change policy.</para><para>We then go beyond the question of numbers of trusts to the instances of trafficking in trusts. The report states:</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murray</inline> —If there were 360,000 trusts, how many advertisements would have appeared in the year in Melbourne and Sydney? One per cent would be 3,600. Would there have been 3,600 advertisements?</para><para>Mr Warnock, legal counsel for the National Tax and Accountants Association—I would classify him as an expert witness; I have no reason not to—said:</para><para>Certainly not. At the time there would have been very few advertisements— 
</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murray</inline> —Three hundred and thirty six advertisements? Thirty six?</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Mr Warnock</inline> —No, I would say the advertisements for trust losses would have been under 10 . . . In my experience, when it was around, it was more that everybody heard about it, not many people had an actual involvement in it.</para><para>Either somebody in this Senate is calling this person a liar or is saying that he is mistaken, but that to me means that advertisements were not a major way in which trafficking in trust losses occurred.</para><para>I am quite happy to concede that it may have been done by word of mouth. There may have been other ways of doing it. I am quite happy to concede that the numbers are not known to me and, I suggest, are not known to anyone, including the ATO. But the fact is that the expert witness said that the total number of advertisements was under 10. But every expert witness also said that trafficking in trust losses—and the ATO agreed—ended on 9 May 1995 when Treasurer Willis quite rightly took the steps he did. The Australian Democrats have absolutely no problem with the government seeking to change the direction and nature of tax policy as to how it deals with trusts. That is its prerogative as a government. We have no problem with the ALP wishing to wipe out trusts. That is its prerogative in terms of policy, but we should not confuse it with this issue.</para><para>The issue that we put simply was that, firstly, as Labor has agreed, the law that the government intended is quite different to the law that has arrived. Secondly, the trafficking in trust losses, and I do not know if you agree, ended on 9 May 1995. Thirdly, the Scrutiny of Bills Committee said that there was a retrospective problem. Fourthly, the profession as a whole maintained that they were not aware of the full impact of how the trust loss legislation was to run until 17 October 1997.</para><para>That is what informs our position. I am content, Senator Cook, that you disagree with it. I do not resent that, but I do not wish to have my or my party's motives impugned. As you know, we have pursued retrospectivity as an issue countless times on different matters. Sometimes you agreed with us and sometimes you did not. This is another one of those 
 occasions. I should also indicate that, because this is a sensitive area, in terms of my own declaration, the trust of which I am a trustee has no trust losses. My own personal pocket is not benefited from this. I know that I do not have the numbers here, but I appreciate the opportunity to put my case.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>1107</page.no><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name><name.id>3L6</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am concerned that the Democrats position appears to be to try to muddy the waters as much as they can on this issue. Continuing to talk about what trusts look like is not addressing how they operate. The driving mechanism behind a family trust or most of the other trusts is purely and simply the capacity to minimise tax. One commentator recently suggested that the simplest way to fix family trusts is not to ban them or outlaw them but to take away the tax-free threshold and see how attractive the family tax structure is after you take away the tax-free threshold.</para></talk.start><para>I am not advocating that. I am just reporting that that is what one commentator has suggested. That commentator said that he believed that it would quickly dry up. People would lose interest in the family trust. Let us see if all those other wonderful things that Senator Murray talks about in the minority report—the beneficial and ultimate control of a trust is shielded from public disclosure; the distribution of income in a trust is generally discretionary and can vary between the beneficiaries year by year; and the beneficiaries of trusts are shielded from the public eye—survive if the tax-free threshold of $5,400 is removed as an option across the board. Let us see where the economic incentive to set up a family trust comes. Senator Margetts, these are just these legitimate family trusts that Senator Murray is so fond of describing.</para><para>I do not have the confidence that Senator Murray has in the evidence that was given to the committee about how trust losses ended in 1995. No-one who came before the committee had ever been party to one of them. Given they knew nothing about them before they came before the committee and had not noticed them, how the hell would they know if they had stopped? How on earth could they sit there and say, `It's all stopped. We didn't 
 know it was happening before but it's definitely stopped now'? How on earth can you take that evidence on face value?</para><para>But the really worrying part of your amendment, Senator Murray, is that, even if it did stop in 1995, you are proposing to open it up again for 2½ to three years. Let them go off and sell $400 million worth of trust losses because that is the forgone revenue. Let them go and do it. It was wrong. Everybody who came before the committee was wrong.</para><para>No-one wants to defend trafficking trust losses, but you want those people who are unscrupulous enough to do it to have a window of opportunity to take $400 million out of the public purse, to allow the government to pretend how unfair the tax system is, how we have to have a GST to fix it, and to see all these people avoiding tax. You want to open up that window for them, and that really concerns me on traditional Democrat philosophy. Why on earth would you want to open up that window?

I do not always praise you in this chamber, it has to be said, but I thought it was a good question.

It is no good suddenly getting up in this chamber and lecturing the government of the day when we can look back over 13 years of Labor government. It is simply not good enough to come in and pretend suddenly that the Labor Party is determined to crack down on tax avoidance with very aggressive tax planning arrangements. The truth of the matter is that every time a bill comes before this chamber—with few exceptions—the Labor Party goes missing in action. When we talk in this chamber of Senator R&amp;D syndicates, we all know who we are talking about.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>DX5</name.id><name role="metadata">MARGETTS</name><name role="display">Senator Margetts</name></talker><para>—That was Ron Boswell, wasn't it?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name></talker><para>—No, it was not. In that case, with the exception of Senator Margetts, we all know who we are talking about. Peter Cook unashamedly led a major defence of a major loophole in R&amp;D syndicates. Equally, when we tried to do something in relation to improving the equity of superannuation, Senator Sherry and Senator Cook led a major attack on that measure. So I have to tell you that the Labor Party do not come with clean hands to this debate. If they were so worried about trust losses and trafficking in trust losses, they sure took a long time to bring in the legislation. They had been in government for well over a decade.</para></talk.start></continue><para>As I said, I think we are entitled to judge the Labor Party not only by their words but by their history and it is a history which in my view is very grubby in this area, so I would appreciate it if Labor senators did not get up and pretend to lecture the government. The government moves with great vigour in areas of tax avoidance. Every time you get up and raise these issues, we will respond and we will remind the public of exactly what your miserable record is.</para><para>In response to the question by Senator Cook about the cost of acceding to Senator Murray's amendment, we have not got precise figures, as you would expect, but it could be expected to cost hundreds of millions of dollars. The issue was raised about whether trafficking in trust losses occurred after the announcement on 9 May 1995. The Australian Taxation Office, for example, is aware of one case involving the sale in 1996 of trust losses with millions upon millions of dollars of losses. So trafficking has occurred after the announcement of the commencement date. That is the advice we have received.</para><para>I think Senator Margetts became very confused between grandfathering and retrospectivity. I think the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> will show when we read your remarks that you slid very easily between grandfathering and retrospectivity. The government simply does not accept that this is a retrospective bill. It does not accept that argument. The measures were announced by the former government on 9 May 1995 and this government has consistently advised taxpayers that the measures 
 will apply from 9 May 1995. There is a clear record that the coalition made that commitment after the Labor Party brought in the original bill. It has been well known that we do not accept the argument that Senator Margetts was running that this is retrospectivity. The taxpayers have had the benefit of the draft legislation since September 1995. You raise your eyebrows, Senator Margetts, but they have. Changing the commencement date in our view would allow those involved in tax avoidance to benefit at the expense of those who have heeded the government's announcements about trust losses. I would point out that any changes that have been made to the measures announced in the original bill that are detrimental to taxpayers have a prospective commencement date. I do not think that point has been made in the debate and it is worth recording.</para><para>In relation to the grandfathering of the pre 9 May 1995 losses, I make the following points. The trust loss measures are designed to prevent the transfer of the tax benefit of trust losses to those who did not economically suffer them, and Senator Conroy made that point at least 40 times I think. It was a good point and, if you had avoided repeating it tirelessly, we would have appreciated it even more, but it was a good point. A major purpose of the measures was to stop the transfers of the tax benefit of trust losses that were occurring prior to 9 May 1995.</para><para>I make this point, Madam Temporary Chair, that if the legislation does not apply to losses incurred prior to 9 May 1995, a taxpayer deriving assessable income after 9 May 1995 that should be exposed to tax could shelter that income from tax using a trust loss, even though they did not suffer it. This would be unfair to ordinary taxpayers who do not derive the kind of income that can be sheltered from tax using trust losses. Most of the revenue estimates are based on stopping transfers of the tax benefit of these losses. However, a trust—and I think Senator Conroy made this point many times, not quite 40 but it was a good point and Senator Conroy does like to repeat himself—will only be prevented from deducting losses if something happens after the commencement date that demon 
 strates that the tax benefit of those losses has been transferred. I think that was a point that was well made. I do not use Senator Conroy's exact words; I use the more technical words that have been given to me by my tax advisers, but that is the case and it is essentially the same thing.</para><para>The advice I have received, Senator Murray, is that the amendment is technically deficient for the following reasons: the amendment directly conflicts with other provisions in the bill; it may allow the use of deductions by a trust that would otherwise be disallowed under the existing provisions of the law; it is unclear how the portion of the loss for the 1994-95 income tax year incurred before 9 May 1995 would be calculated given that tax losses are normally worked out on a whole of income year basis; the amendment refers to losses being declared in a trust's taxation return for the 1994-95 income year—until recently trust returns did not provide for losses to be separately listed and losses for income years before 1994-95 would not be declared in the 1994-95 tax return; and, finally, it is unclear whether the amendment would apply to debt deductions and quarantined foreign losses, which were also dealt with by the bill. I conclude my remarks by indicating that the government will not be supporting the amendments which have been moved by Senator Murray.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>1111</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am fascinated by the example given by the minister in relation to millions and millions of dollars rorted through trafficking of trust losses.

In a number of the contributions under this amendment there have been questions about what is Labor Party policy and the minister has made—shall I say, to be fair to him—some snide observations about Labor Party policy.</para></talk.start><para>Labor Party policy on tax, at least on trusts, was last enunciated by Treasurer Ralph Willis when he brought down the changes in this area. That is Labor Party policy. That is where we stand. There is no ambiguity about that and there should be no mystery about that. I can tell you something else for nothing. Labor Party policy on tax is no GST, and we would not support a GST either.</para><para>As far as the rest of our tax package is concerned, we are engaged in a process of actually conducting a reform of the tax system and we will announce quite far reaching tax reform at an appropriate time. I might say, it would help the debate in Australia if the government, which has access to the Treasury and which, at taxpayers' expense, has set up a secret inquiry to examine tax options, at least gave the public the benefit of the work of that inquiry so that Australian citizens could decide for themselves, based on impartial Treasury knowledge, what the best options were. It is a pity as well that the government has directed the affairs of that inquiry so as to require it to study only options which involve a GST.</para><para>What we have as far as so-called tax reform is concerned—and `reform' is the most abused word I have recently heard in English—is a secret process being conducted by the government, none of which will be made available to the community. At the end of the day, the electors of this country will be ambushed at the eleventh hour with a package, on a take it or leave it basis, which will be a marketing package. The implications of it—the details, the hidden nasties—will not be available for public scrutiny until it is too late. That is not a process of government that at all commends itself to the Labor Party.</para><para>What did we do when we were in office? First of all, we inherited a ramshackle tax system. Tonight we have had from Senator Kemp what he regards as some of the `imperfections' of the Labor Party on tax. Let me tell the Senate that, when we came to office in 1983, leading tax academics in this country were saying that with the bottom of the harbour schemes and with the ramshackle tax system that Australia had, for the wealthy the payment of tax was optional. You could drive a coach-and-four through clauses in the tax act. That was what the now Prime Minister, the then Treasurer John Howard, bequeathed to Australia in 1983. That is what we addressed with a national tax summit in 1985. On the question of tax purity, let us get the record clear again.

 1985 were the principles of efficiency, simplicity and equity.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="metadata">KEMP</name><name role="display">Senator Kemp</name></talker><para>—Why did you so comprehensively fail?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>RF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name></talker><para>—I take the interjection, `Why did we so comprehensively fail?' The last major reform of the tax system in Australia was conducted by us. As I said in my speech in the second reading debate, from time to time the tax system needs efficient repair and sometimes renovation. It needs it because every time you divide the law, those in the tax avoidance industry, which is a major industry in this country, spend their best efforts to find a way around the law and occasionally they succeed. Governments should always be adept at blocking off those loopholes. Therefore, you should repair the system and after a while you are required to renovate the system.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I also remind the Senate that a GST is a regressive tax. It applies the same amount of tax irrespective of your income. A pensioner and a millionaire pay the same amount of tax. That is a regressive tax. That is not what the Labor Party supports; that is what the government supports. That is what they call tax reform; that is not what we call tax reform. If you are going to fight an election, as you keep saying to us you will, let us do it fairly.</para><para>In 1985, we published a series of papers—option A, option B and option C. Option C had a GST in it; the other options did not. We engaged in a national debate about tax reform. The country had reference to authoritative Treasury documents, impartially calculated tables and the opinions of leading tax officers in this country. It was all out there in the public for debate. We had a proper debate about it. We won the election, we had a summit, we made a decision at that summit and we reformed the tax act.</para><para>What do we have now? We have a secret committee with no records, no minutes and no outcomes, as far as we know, at this stage. We have a promise that on trusts there would have been a paper presented for the public to look out. That is now a broken promise. We are not going to see that paper. We are going to see the final recommendations that the government makes.</para><para>Are we going to see the options from this committee? No. Are we going to see the calculations of Treasury produced for this committee? No. Are we going to see how it impacts on the lower paid and what the level of the tax is, what the exemptions might be? No we are not. We have a tax debate in secret, and a tax debate by PR—by manipulating headlines. That is not democracy. There is a name for that sort of behaviour. We have seen it in other countries before. It certainly ain't democracy.</para><para>I just say this for the record, Minister, since you are so fond of raising this matter. It may be that you will put your proposals to the people of Australia at a time to suit your convenience—more like at a time to ambush them. It may be that you are able to put a momentary gloss on those proposals to make them interesting and attractive. It may be that you will use the tax system to buy votes by giving tax cuts at particular strategic levels of the tax system to attract votes at that level irrespective of the impact at other levels of income. It may be that you will do all those things.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN (Senator Patterson)</name></talker><para>—You are backsliding, Senator.

You might win it for a small time but you will not win it overall, because Australians in 1985 rejected the idea of a GST and at the election in 1993 they rejected it again. All of the surveys of popular opinion show disapproval for it now in the majority.</para><para>There is no way in which you can compromise between your objectives of a GST and proper and fair remuneration for those at the 
 lower income levels, and there is no way you can bring in a GST which will not increase over time. Every other one has; there is no reason to expect yours will not. And there is no reason to believe that in the end there will be anything like an attack on the black economy, because in the countries of the world where there is a GST the black economy thrives—but only in a different form, not in the form we know it. So when we talk about tax reform let us bear those things in mind.</para><para>My concluding remark on this point is that one of the things you criticise us for is our supporting a process of tax breaks for research and development. Well, all those Australian scientists who stand on the dock and watch their ideas go overseas and be commercialised by someone else thank you. They thank you. And those people who would have had jobs in Australia making sophisticated scientific and technological equipment based on those scientific ideas but are now unemployed also thank you. So let us not have any of this cant about that.</para><para>I do not mind participating in a debate in this chamber in a robust way and I like to deal with people fairly.

The only conclusion that can be drawn is that small businesses using trusts are spending a lot of extra money on lawyers and accountants to get around the tax laws.</para><para>That comes back to the point I made earlier: take away the tax threshold—they are paying more money. They are complaining about red tape and how much it costs to comply, and yet they are willing to spend more money of their own hard-earned income to set up these trusts. I know this is going to be an ongoing debate in the chamber and in the country over the next six months with the tax reform debate, so I say, particularly to the Greens, that it is very important that we analyse what the economic benefit of the legitimate family trust is. The Democrats do not seem to want to enter into that debate today, and that is their position. I look forward to ongoing debate with the Democrats on that issue—and I am sure there will be. But, particularly for the Greens, we are back to that pup, that question of what is legitimate. If you examine the economic benefit received, the fact that they are prepared to pay more to be in them, you have to begin to start worrying about why they are so determined to protect their position at the expense of the ordinary taxpayer who does not have the capacity to get into a family trust.</para><para>I make a final point. Trusts have exploded in the last few years. Trafficking exploded in the last few years in the trust losses. The government wants to make a big thing of asking, `Why didn't you do anything for 13 
 years?' The answer is that in the last few years it became a major drain and it will become an enormous future drain. That was why we moved in 1995 and the government has continued to support those moves through to now, albeit with the reservations I have already expressed.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>1115</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I said it in the second reading debate, I have certainly said it over a number of months, the Democrats have said it consistently over a number of years, and I will put it on the record yet again.

I appreciate your forbearance as we have gone through the debate. This amendment relates to joint venture unit trusts and schemes and refers to transitional arrangements. It extends the transitional provisions to ensure that unrelated unit holders and unit trusts, currently denied the family amendment concessions, are not denied the tax benefits resulting from legitimate carried forward losses at 9 May 1995. Such provisions will restrict the benefit allowed to no greater than the proportion of all losses available for carry forward by the trust as at 9 May 1995, which is equal to the 
 proportion of the units in the unit trust owned by the unit holder. Secondly, it will ensure that only those who are unit holders at the time the loss was incurred are allowed this proportionate benefit.</para><para>A transitional measure relating to unit trusts with trust losses is necessary because the facility for placing trusts within family groups for the purposes of the income injection test, as announced by the Treasurer on budget night, will not cover cases where business activities are conducted by a unit trust which has incurred losses; where the units are held by two or more unrelated parties except in very limited circumstances; and where all those parties and the unit trust can be constituted as one family group for the purposes of the income injection test.</para><para>The proposed transitional measure is designed to overcome this unfair and inequitable state of affairs as follows: each unit holder will be entitled to elect that the unit trust with carry forward losses be exempted from the income injection test to the extent that it would otherwise apply by reason only that if distribution of income is made by the unit holders' family trust in favour of the unit trust, which is the nominated distribution, and the nominated distribution must be specified in the election; the unit holder making the election must be a family member or be included in the family group of the family trust which makes the nominated distribution; the unit-holder may continue to make elections during different years of income, provided that the total of all nominated distributions specified in elections made by a unit-holder shall not exceed a proportion of all losses available for carry forward by the unit trust as at 9 May 1995 and not otherwise recouped, which is equal to the proportion of the units and the unit trust owned by the unit holder.</para><para>No elections described in paragraph (a) will be made by any unit holder except with the consent of all unit holders, and the unit holder making the election must have been the unit holder at the time the unit trust originally incurred the losses. If senators are still following me, they are better men than I!</para><para>The application of the proposed transitional measure will be restricted to losses incurred 
 as at 9 May 1995. The measure is intended to apply with effect from 9 May 1995 only to unit trusts, irrespective of whether they are technically fixed trusts or non-fixed trusts. The proposed transitional measure will only apply where the unit trust meets all the relevant tests prescribed by the trust losses legislation, other than an income injection test, irrespective of whether unit holders are individuals, fixed trusts, non-fixed trusts, family trust companies, or any combination of the above.</para><para>A transitional measure along the lines described above will effectively cure a clear inequity in the design of the proposed trust losses legislation. It is consistent with the concession made by the Treasurer on budget night and should not be capable of being manipulated or abused for tax avoidance purposes.</para><para>I must apologise to Senator Cook for his having had access to these amendments only as they have been circulated.

This bill represents attempt No. 2 by this government to try to break yet another election promise. It represents attempt No. 2 by the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, Peter Reith, to deny a section of the Australian work force a fundamental right: the right to appeal against unfair, harsh or unreasonable dismissal.</para></talk.start><para>The government's current unfair dismissal provisions apply to all employers, irrespective of size, but the government now wants to give some employers the power to sack some workers unfairly. Once again in this chamber we have an ideologically conceived piece of 
 government legislation which has no empirical, quantitative or qualitative evidence to support it, nor has it any moral or justifiable grounds for its enactment. As I said in the previous debate on this measure, it is nothing more than a con. It is a con on the small business sector and a con on the broader Australian community.</para><para>The government's propaganda machine has been working overtime to try to convince the Senate that this legislation is required to secure jobs. That is not right; it is a con. This legislation will add to what is already a concern amongst Australian workers—the issue of growing job insecurity. This legislation will create a two-tier industrial relations system; a system under which employees will be separated into two groups: one with the right to appeal against unfair dismissal and one without the right. The right to appeal against unfair dismissal is a right which, in a world of increasing job insecurity, is crucial for the protection of workers from the behaviour of unscrupulous employers.</para><para>The question needs to be asked: why are we revisiting this legislation? The Senate has already made a determination on this matter. Is it because the government truly and honestly believes that this legislation is important? No, it is not. This government is not, nor will it ever be, altruistic or genuinely concerned about the conditions and rights of average Australian workers. This legislation is here for one purpose and one purpose only: as a trigger for a double dissolution. That is the only reason why it is back here.</para><para>The government has carefully crafted a strategy whereby a number of pieces of legislation will be used as double dissolution triggers, and this is one of them. This legislation is being used to divert attention from the real trigger—the Wik legislation. The government hopes that this bill will camouflage its actual objective, which is to implement its Wik legislation unamended, via double dissolution, a plan which has been hatched despite the fact that 90 per cent of the Wik legislation has been returned unamended by the Senate.</para><para>We have before us a piece of legislation that is part of that strategy. In itself, this legislation is unfair and unjust—important 
 points which have been ignored by this government in what is a cynical attempt to ensure that its election plans are not derailed. In order to ensure that this election strategy works, the government is happy in the course of it to subvert and sabotage the rights of average Australian workers. More recently, the government has revealed another part of the election strategy: the complete sale of Telstra, with more jobs lost and more job insecurity. Another double dissolution trigger is looming.</para><para>Let me say from the outset that the Australian Labor Party opposes this bill. We have opposed it before and we continue to oppose it. I reiterate the view that we stated in the Senate minority report that inquired into this government's first attempt to abrogate responsibility to ensure that workers are protected from unfair dismissal. I will quote from what I believe was an excellent minority report. It says:</para><para>We have come to the very firm conclusion the proposal in the Workplace Relations Amendment Bill to exempt small business from the unfair dismissal laws is seriously flawed and cannot be supported.</para><para>In our view, there are numerous convincing arguments against the proposal, but in essence they can be grouped into 3 core concerns:</para><para>1.	 The exemption is an explicit breach of the government's pre-election commitments.</para><para>2.	 The exemption is unnecessary.</para><para>3.	 The exemption is unfair.</para><para>We held that view then and we continue to adhere strongly to it now.</para><para>I would like to remind the Senate of a number of undertakings given by both the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business and the Prime Minister concerning the rights of workers—undertakings that obviously we now know are in fact non-core undertakings or non-core promises. I do so to put on record the utter hypocrisy of this government. First of all, let us hear what the now Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business had to say before the last federal election on ABC <inline font-style="italic">Daybreak</inline> on 28 February 1996. He said:</para><para>Look, our position's very clear. If you've been unfairly dealt with at work, then you should have a right of appeal. 
</para><para>An ambiguity there I would not have thought. That is pretty clear to me. It was certainly clear to him. The Prime Minister stated on the John Laws show on 23 January 1996:</para><para>I'm not going to have a law where an unreasonable employer can capriciously sack a decent, hard-working employee.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>2L6</name.id><name role="metadata">BISHOP</name><name role="display">Senator Bishop</name></talker><para>—Who said that?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>9L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator MACKAY</name></talker><para>—The Prime Minister, Mr Howard, said that. Again, the Prime Minister on the ABC on 25 January 1996 said:</para></talk.start></continue><para>I'm not going to make it open slather. I'm going to replace it—</para><para>that is unfair dismissal provisions—</para><para>with a law that's fair to both sides so that if you are doing your job properly you can't be capriciously dismissed.</para><para>That is what they said before the election. Perhaps the government could save everybody some angst if they indicated from the outset what is in fact a core or non-core promise. I am sure that the Australian people who have suffered from this government's decisions and policy backflips would probably appreciate it. To make this backflip even more questionable, when the unfair dismissal laws were changed over a year ago the government triumphantly heralded what they regarded as a new era with respect to unfair dismissal provisions. The Prime Minister in his 1996 progress report to the people stated:</para><para>I am proud to say that the previous government's anti-job unfair dismissal laws have gone. They have been replaced with a simpler, more balanced system that provides a fair go all round.</para><para>What is the Prime Minister talking about here? He is talking about the government's own legislation which they are now attempting to amend. I am not sure that those comments were worth making at that point. I go on to Mr Reith, the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, in his speech on the return of the bill from the Senate. He said on 21 November 1996:</para><para>We have delivered a workable system for dealing with unfair dismissal . . . and, in doing so, we have expressed an overwhelming community consensus that the previous Brereton system did nothing more than stifle employment growth and create division in the workplace. This was Labor's legacy, and the government has buried it. 
</para><para>That is from the minister himself. I have restated government undertakings to highlight to the chamber that the government clearly did not see an exemption for small business as being necessary. Indeed, it is crystal clear, as I have pointed out, from the statements made by the Prime Minister and the minister that the purported anti-job effect of the previous law had been, as far as this government was concerned, dealt with and fixed. These undertakings show, I believe, the government's duplicity in introducing this measure not once but twice and shows the utter contempt that this government holds for Australian workers and for its own election commitments and core and non-core promises.</para><para>What this government is asking us to do by agreeing to amend its own unfair dismissal legislation—I would like to emphasise that point because I think it is a point that has been lost on the government—is to add to what is already a growing problem of job insecurity in the Australian economy. We are being asked to say to workers in the small business sector that we do not believe that they warrant the same level of protection as workers in other areas. So here we have the two-tier industrial relations system.</para><para>We are being asked to say to these workers, `If you are harshly, unreasonably or unfairly dismissed, we don't want to know. It is okay to be discriminated against. It is okay to be sacked capriciously. We just don't want to know about it. We are not going to give you recourse to justice in relation to appealing against what may well be harsh and capricious unfair dismissal.' We are being asked to take away the right of appeal against being unfairly dismissed from one huge section of the Australian work force, a highly significant section of the Australian work force. There will be no protection for those workers, no protection whatsoever.</para><para>My colleague in the other place Bob McMullan has highlighted a number of cases which show the importance of unfair dismissal legislation, which I will restate for the record in order so that it is reinforced in terms of our opposition here in the Senate again. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para><para>Leave granted; debate adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ADJOURNMENT</title><type>Adjournment</type><page.no>1123</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Murphy)</name></talker><para>—Order!

The successful bidder in Launceston was Australian Pacific Airports Corporation—a consortium comprising the British airport operator BAA, Axiom, AMP and Utilities Trust of Australia with the Launceston City Council holding an option to acquire 10 per cent. There has been a very strong campaign, as you would know, Mr Acting Deputy President, run by the group called Save Our Airport, a group of local businesses aimed at maximising the level of local ownership in the airport in order that northern Tasmania does not lose out from the sale.</para></talk.start><para>As with a number of federal issues like the Howard government's outrageous plan for aged care, child care cuts, cuts to other government services and a very high level of unemployment, the member for Bass, Mr Warwick Smith, found himself under attack again from his constituents. His response to this pressure appeared in today's Launceston <inline font-style="italic">Examiner</inline>. It is up to his usual standard, I am afraid to say.</para><para>Mr Smith has announced a plan to develop what he described as a Hong Kong style special economic development zone around the Launceston airport. He suggested the zone could contain special bond stores to encourage trade. He said that a committee could be set up to run the zone. Its members would include the Launceston and Northern Midlands municipalities, the new airport owner and the Commonwealth. Not surprisingly, there was a negative reaction from both councils to the Smith plan.</para><para>This is clearly another off the top of the head reaction by a politician who is under siege. For a start, there are no free trade zones in Hong Kong. The whole island has no barriers to trade and does not levy any tariff. If he 
 is referring to the Shenzen free trade zone, which is located near Hong Kong, then he had better find another example upon which to draw. That zone has been successful because factory owners who have set up there have been guaranteed minimal supervision of wages, working conditions and safety.</para><para>Mr Smith would have also been wise to look at the history of the economic development zone established in the Northern Territory before he launched his plan for the Launceston airport. The Smith type plan was implemented in Darwin with terrible results. There were many breaches of the basic rights and entitlements of the workers in that zone largely by companies from Hong Kong—the very place upon which Mr Smith has based his plan. Those Hong Kong based clothing and textile companies forced their employees to live in very difficult conditions, underpaid them and failed to pay them on time. It was a disaster in every respect.</para><para>There was also a plan for the establishment of special Queensland zones floated in the early 1990s. That was quickly replaced with a state wide strategy which, from memory, was called the state wide manufacturing industry scheme. The Queensland government obviously took the view at the time that all manufacturing industries in that state were worthy of government support, not just a select few behind a barb wire fence.</para><para>Mr Smith also failed to consult the Australian constitution which prohibits discrimination against states or parts of states and provides for free interstate trade. If Mr Smith was to give Launceston airport a free trade zone he would be required to ensure that anyone else who wanted one could have one. It also appears that Mr Smith has a fair way to go if he is going to convince the key members of the Howard government to support his plan.</para><para>The views of the Treasurer, Mr Costello, were spelt out very clearly in an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> in July last year. Mr Costello is quoted as saying:</para><para>If I had my way I would not choose a small area here . . . to enjoy those benefits and a small area there. I would choose as much of the country as possible.  
</para><para>Mr Costello said that the government would not be diverted into `quick fixes' in its management of the economy. For once I agree with Mr Costello.</para><para>This idea also received a negative response from Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism, Mr Moore. Mr Moore said in relation to a proposal for such a zone in the Newcastle region:</para><para>Whether the special free trade zones are the answer or not I am not too sure. I think that is a bit difficult myself.</para><para>This is yet another example of Mr Smith not only failing the electors of Bass as their local member but also damaging his already badly damaged reputation amongst his colleagues in the cabinet room. I plan to pursue Mr Smith's free trade zone plan with the relevant ministers to ensure that all Launceston businesses and workers an not disadvantaged. I think that after the next election the electorate of Bass will be a Smith free zone.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Juvenile Crime</title><page.no>1124</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>1124</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise tonight to discuss the issue of juvenile justice. I note from the Australian Institute of Criminology's, the AIC's, proceedings of the juvenile crime and juvenile justice conference that it can cost up to $1,000 per week to incarcerate a young offender. Imagine what we could spend that $1,000 on if we were to dedicate it to community services. I would ask that those who argue for cutting income support and welfare and social services for young people seriously consider that figure of $1,000 per week.</para></talk.start><para>As the federal campaign looms, I suspect we are going to hear a lot more about the mythical crime wave and calls to get tough on crime—get young people off the streets, presumably with youth curfews or sweep laws. We have heard from one political party that this is one of their policies. We have also heard that we should lock young people up with mandatory sentencing, get them out of town and toughen them up with boot camps, scare them straight with day trips to gaols or shame them with the public wearing of signs. 
 These are all quick fix solutions that soak up public funds and generate headlines, but they have little, if any, impact on crime levels in this country.</para><para>We do not need to get tough on youth crime we need to get smart and respond to real research and not the rhetoric of talkback radio. There is no youth crime wave either nationally or within the states or territories. In fact the reality is that young people commit fewer crimes than adults, most youth crime is not violent but is against property and most young people offend only once.</para><para>A small number of repeat juvenile offenders commit most crime. The sweeping operations and regulations against all young people do little to address the problems of that small group yet governments continue to enact laws or consider laws which target all young Australians. Efforts to clean up the streets may include criminalising anti-social behaviour such as: being in a public place at night—we saw evidence of laws to tackle this in Western Australia where we had in 1994 operation sweep; being in a shopping mall where private security guards are actually granted the power to exclude particular individuals from the use of certain city sites; wearing of baseball caps backwards, which was mooted by the Premier of New South Wales a few years ago as being anti-social behaviour; or gathering in groups of more than two, evidenced by the proposals relating to anti-gang legislation.</para><para>If cleaning up the streets means getting young people off the streets we have to ask: who is public space for? Are not young people members of the public and entitled to use this space? We are in danger of criminalising the young. I know that one set of researchers have coined the term `spatial apartheid' to describe the treatment of young people when it comes to public space.</para><para>Originally, the word `juvenile' meant a young person without any negative connotations. Today, juvenile is used either as an insult or interchangeably with young criminal. In practice, the words `juvenile delinquent' are now practically considered a tautology and `juvenile justice' is in danger of becoming an oxymoron. The AIC report says that 
 `we are going dangerously astray in both our overall youth policy in this country', and, particularly, in regard to juvenile justice reform. We are excluding rather than reconnecting young people to society.</para><para>Young people who are excluded from their family, employment and education are most likely to be enmeshed in the juvenile justice system. Males are by far the more prominent offenders than females. There are few female offenders which means that there are very few appropriate services to deal with them if they are offending. Homelessness is another factor for many juvenile offenders. Indigenous young people are vastly over represented in both incarceration and unemployment figures. The unemployment rate for indigenous young people is more than twice that of the total number for Australian youth.</para><para>The high rates of incarceration of indigenous young people is in effect creating another stolen generation. At the South Australian youth detention centres, the Magill Training Centre and the Cavan Training Centre, Aboriginal young people account for more than one in five of those entering the centres despite the fact that they only represent 1.7 per cent of the total state population. Nationally, 36 per cent of young people in juvenile correction institutions in 1996 were indigenous.</para><para>Indigenous young people who accumulate a criminal record on average do so at a younger age than non-Aboriginal children. They generally receive harsher outcomes in the children's court than non-Aboriginal young people, particularly in being sentenced to detention. We need alternatives to incarceration for non-violent offences by those children because those who do end up in custody are more likely to come back again and again unless we can set up a diversion from a well-worn track of poverty, unemployment, despair and crime.</para><para>There has been much public condemnation of the Canberra incident where a 12-year-old was forced to wear a T-shirt saying `I am a thief' in the shopping mall from where he stole. Many would not agree with the notion of humiliation punishment, a decision of those concerned. Shaming and labelling works in a 
 small number of first offences when the youth is ashamed of the label `criminal'. Chronic offenders may accept this label however and might even aspire to it. The AIC report said on this matter:</para><para>The Brady Bunch kids are a good example of when shaming would work.</para><para>We should not judge all alternative disciplining systems for young people on the basis of the Canberra case. Particularly, we should not dismiss the idea of family conferencing. In many cases, it does have great merit. It is based on the principle of restoration and reconciliation.</para><para>For the less serious offences, those best placed to decide an appropriate punishment may well be the victim, the offender and their families. They with facilitators meet and attempt to agree on a punishment that makes some recompense, restitution and reparation. This model allows victims the opportunity to participate in the process of dealing with the offender, whereas the usual practice is for crimes to be against the state and the victim to be included merely as a witness. It is hoped that the offender will feel directly accountable for their actions by having their family present and by requiring them to confront the victim.</para><para>My home state of South Australia has gone some way down this path with some positive results. The South Australian Young Offenders Act 1993 included the introduction of an up-front police cautioning system which may include community work or compensation, a new diversionary option of family conference and a toughening of outcomes at the court level. Formal prosecution before the youth court is reserved for those repeat offenders who have already been through other options.</para><para>Family conferencing can be a very effective option for indigenous young Australians because it involves relevant family members in its justice proceedings. It is the police who are in a position of deciding which is the appropriate option in South Australia. Indigenous communities and their organisations and not just police should have some say as to whether their children would be best served by family conferencing. It is a consultative process. In all states the police hold a great 
 deal of power in dealing with young people, although we often hear reports to the contrary. They act within the laws governments pass but they can also bring to the job their own prejudices.</para><para>We do need to improve relations between police and young people, for example, through the police and community youth clubs, youth liaison officers and training which is youth and culturally specific. We do not need `street-sweep' laws which are a recipe for conflict between police and the great majority of young people who stay within the law. A very small group of young people are responsible for multiple offences. There needs to be provision of specialist psychologically based programs for serious repeat offenders, notably sexual and violent offenders. I do not think anyone would disagree with that notion.</para><para>The juvenile justice system usually hangs on the myth of punishment and deterrents. Deterrents only work when a person feels that they have something to lose, and many juvenile repeat offenders feel they have nothing to lose. Early intervention by justice and welfare agencies into the troubled lives of young offenders and their families is a better way to address the juvenile crime problem. The peak age for a first offence is 15 to 18 years.</para><para>Has the government considered the impact of the CYA legislation, particularly on those young people who do not meet the new obligations to be in training and education? I think there may be some social consequences here that we should consider in the context of the justice debate. The government may save a whole $160 a week in income support to an unemployed teenager, but what will be the cost in pushing young people away from their family and community and, in some cases, into incarceration with its $1,000 a week price tag?</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Internet</title><page.no>1126</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>1126</page.no><name role="metadata">Lundy, Sen Kate</name><name role="display">Senator LUNDY</name><name.id>7G6</name.id><electorate>ACT</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise this evening to make comment on a recent event in Australia's political history that will forever remain engraved on my mind. I speak of the 
 Constitutional Convention for which I was fortunate enough to represent my party, the Labor Party, as an appointee. I do not want to turn my comments to the actual issues debated at that Constitutional Convention. As a devoted republican, I am obviously welcoming of the outcome. But I turn to a phenomenon that occurred in conjunction with the Constitutional Convention which I think points to a very interesting development in Australian politics and also points to a great opportunity that exists in this country with respect to greater democratic participation by our citizens.</para></talk.start><para>The website that was created to promote and convey the information, the words, the substance and even some of the atmosphere of the Constitutional Convention provided an insight for many Australians as to what went on at the Constitutional Convention. The website itself was created by a local company, Safetyweb, for the department. It had a number of remarkable features. First of all, it actually posted the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> each day of the convention, which potentially allowed millions of Australians—but I know it was several thousand at least—daily access to the spoken words of the convention. The website featured a whole range of different sites that one could visit, including the biographies of all the participating delegates. It also carried that day's <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline>, what was on the agenda, which motions were carried, and the minutes of the meetings as they occurred.</para><para>This site had over 70,000 hits during the convention, and we know from the experience of the people managing the site that those visits were not mere scannings—that people actually took the time to have a look at what was being said. While the convention made great radio and attracted a lot of attention through the mainstream media, including the electronic and print media, I believe the website assisted in  the capturing of the spirit of the convention for the broader Australian public.</para><para>The convention itself, as I said at the time, was perhaps the greatest exercise in civics education that we have seen in recent times in this country. To be able to convey that experience in this new medium that we know 
 is particularly accessible to young people can teach us many lessons about the operation of this place. Here in Parliament House the information services are doing an amazing job in taking the parliament to the people on-line. Recent developments have meant an even more upgraded on-line service with the transfer of committee reports and <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> to the Internet for general reference for, particularly, students conducting their own research but, more recently, greater involvement and participation by people who are interested in a specific area of policy or legislation being discussed, or who are just curious about how our democracy works.</para><para>The design of a site is particularly important. It needs to be easy to use. It needs to be easily followed. It is too easy for technology to become intimidating for those unfamiliar with it. So more time, thought and resource being placed into designing effective websites so that people can easily access information is, I believe, a great investment in the enhancement of participation by people generally in our political processes.</para><para>Political parties too have not been slack in seeing what an opportunity the Internet presents. I can speak for my own party, who have taken great pride in establishing a comprehensive information-based website that is available as a resource for people curious about our party and our policies. The growth of Internet usage is something that is continually on my mind, both in terms of the potential it holds to enhance participation in our democracy generally and as a general tool of empowerment for those in our community.</para><para>One of the most critical policy aspects of this phenomenon that is occurring is, of course, this question of access to the Internet and the equity that is a must if we are to prevent the growing gap between the information haves and have-nots in our country. We know from the Australian Bureau of Statistics that the richer you are in Australia, the more likely you are to have Internet access. Does this mean that perhaps your opportunity to participate in an on-line democratic forum or exercise must be contingent upon your wealth?  </para><para>There is no more pressing policy issue in the area of information technology than addressing this one of equity of access to the Internet. It must take priority if we are to utilise developments in information technology to the benefit of the whole of Australian society. Unless we do this, the success of the Constitutional Convention and its on-line presentation can be measured only in terms of a particular grouping within our society, defined by its advantageous economic status. Would it not be a great indictment upon an Australian government if it did not specifically address these equity issues when they were able to?</para><para>Statistically, the number of young people using the Internet is growing exponentially every year. The most comprehensive statistics on the growth of Internet usage predictably come from the US, and the most remarkable feature of these indicators is still the phenomenal growth of usage.</para><para>In closing, I would like to draw the Senate's attention to the site for the Constitutional Convention. Now that senators and members have Internet access in their parliamentary offices, I only hope those who have not taken the opportunity to access it will do so, just to experience the Constitutional Convention experience of 70,000-odd Australians. The convention's home page can be found at www.dpmc.gov.au/convention/hansard. There are other buttons available on that home page that can take you to reports and resolutions, notice papers and speakers lists. And to help facilitate the reportage of the spoken word, there is even a button entitled `press releases' that everyone's public statements were placed on.</para><para>The Constitutional Convention site is just one example of a remarkable phenomenon that is taking place. The phenomenon has the potential to involve all Australians or it has the potential to marginalise most and benefit only a few. This policy challenge, I believe, is one of the most dramatic that is facing governments in today's age.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Cobar: Mine Closure</title><page.no>1127</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>1127</page.no><name role="metadata">Crowley, Sen Rosemary</name><name role="display">Senator CROWLEY</name><name.id>ZF4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I was very interested to listen

At the moment, by conservative estimates, the mine and its owners—particularly Ashanti—have got away with some $9 million of workers' money. That is money that is owed to them for their annual leave, their holiday leave and their retrenchment packages. Any decent contract between staff and an employer means that that money is not something workers suddenly thought of at the last minute; it is a contractual obligation that the employers have to pay those workers.</para><para>I believe this is a very devastating and significant disaster for Cobar, but it is not without precedent in other parts of Australia. We have heard of the closure of the Woodlawn mine in Goulburn, with again something like $6 million outstanding to the workers there—though Woodlawn, I have to say, have approached their responsibilities in quite a different way to Ashanti. Nevertheless, they have dudded the workers in their mine of $6 million, which they say they will try to pay, unlike the case with Ashanti and the CIA mine in Cobar. We have heard of the meatworkers at Grafton. That firm went insolvent 
 and, once again, the workers have been dudded of the many millions of dollars owing to them. A nursing home in Queensland equally has closed its business and got away with millions of dollars of money owing to workers.</para><para>We are beginning to see a pattern of behaviour here—a pattern of behaviour that is a deliberate flouting of the rights and contractual obligations of the people in employ. It is a behaviour that most reminds me of the robber barons of the 19th century—that is, `It's my money. I'll take it and go.' This is illustrated in a particularly devastating way in Cobar.</para><para>We had two meetings in the town. The first was with a significant group of women, mainly the wives of the workers on the mine, but not all. The women were either in small business or partners or wives of small business people who provided all sorts of provisions to the mine—from equipment, to bricks, to food, to whatever. All of those small businesses of course are completely without contracts, and they have just fallen over completely.</para><para>The impact on the community is that those families now have workers who are pretty broken and lacking in confidence. The husbands in those families are very depressed and despondent, and they are concerned most immediately about tomorrow's money—where is it coming from so they can pay for the food, the mortgage and the clothing for their families, and where on earth are they going to get more work?</para><para>Some of those families who have been able to access social security—and many have not, and I will come to that—are now finding that they are trying to live on social security payments when the husband has had to go interstate looking for work. If you think it is difficult managing on unemployment benefits when husband, wife and children are living in the one home, try managing on that same amount of money when the husband has actually gone to Perth or Queensland looking for work. There are the accommodation costs, the travel costs and the family at home still trying to hang together on the smell of an oil 
 rag with what is left of those payments. Those families are doing it very hard.</para><para>Some of the families have had a higher income, and they have used some of their spare money to set up some kind of investment—whether it is superannuation or other investments in property—for their retirement. They now find themselves, as has often been the case when we have considered social security, asset rich but income poor and not eligible for social security benefits.</para><para>Many hundreds of the people at the women's meeting and then later at the very large public meeting at the bowling club—mainly the miners and many of the women again—pointed out that, if the town had been flooded or if they had had a drought, either of those situations would have enabled them to be described as in a disaster situation and eligible for disaster relief. This is a disaster for that town and those families, but they are eligible for nothing special.</para><para>Sometimes, particularly in drought situations, farmers have been eligible for special disaster assistance when they have found themselves asset rich but income poor, and I am certainly going to be writing to the Minister for Social Security, Senator Newman, to ask if some consideration can be given to families in this disaster. It is nothing to do with the miners, but many livelihoods and families have been affected and now that town is reeling from that blow.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>656</name.id><name role="metadata">FORSHAW</name><name role="display">Senator Forshaw</name></talker><para>—Bet you they don't have family trusts!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Crowley, Sen Rosemary</name><name role="display">Senator CROWLEY</name></talker><para>—I do not know about that, Senator, but I do know that many of those families are in terrible straits. We also know that in that town unemployment has gone from three per cent to 30 per cent more or less overnight. None of these people are trying to be out of work. All of these people were decent hard-working people. They were committed to trying to manage, as well as they could, for their families. They now find themselves on the unemployment list and they find that they are getting no assistance wherever they turn.</para></talk.start></continue><para>A delegation met with Prime Minister Howard and he promised to respond to them 
 to see if there was any way in which a loan could be taken out to assist the families or some other arrangement could be made. So far, I am advised, Mr Howard has made no contact back to that group and it is over two weeks later. He promised to respond within two weeks; he has not done so. Those families are the battlers that Mr Howard promised to support. They are the families that Mr Howard says he barracks for, and yet he is able to do nothing—to this point—that could assist them.</para><para>Today, in the other place, my colleague Janice Crosio introduced a private member's bill to ensure that in the future workers' moneys of this sort would never be able to be abused in this way; denied to the workers. Unfortunately, that bill is not able to be retrospective. But, so far, the advice I have is that the government is not minded to support it. If they are serious about helping this group of families, this group of struggling, genuine decent contributors to our society and to that township, then they should seriously look—and I appeal to Mr Howard to look again—at ways in which he might help these families. Let us see our Prime Minister put his money—or the taxpayers' support and money—where his mouth has been to this point.</para><para>Those families are dealing with a number of other blows in that community too. People said with cynicism, `Well, I suppose as well as everything else we'll have the banks closing.' The day after we were there, the state bank in Cobar closed and is now leaving the town. The school has gone from 460 pupils to 410 and under New South Wales classification it has now been classified down. None of these things are due to any behaviour on behalf of the staff, the employees, the workers in that town, but all the devastation that has come their way is due to a high-handed, very illegal and I think morally reprehensible act on behalf of the employers. The owners of the mine, particularly Ashanti, have made devastation in their lives and I do believe it is a challenge to Mr Howard to deliver on some of that support. He has not so far.</para><para>The miners are waiting and they are not going to forget if he fails to support them 
 immediately or even, importantly, to support Janice Crosio's bill to make sure that this kind of devastation never happens to the miners in Cobar, to the workers in nursing homes, to meat workers in other businesses, to workers in this country who up until now expected their contractual obligations would be fulfilled by the employers. It is time we put paid to this kind of robbery.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Sunland Security Services: Superannuation</title><page.no>1130</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:25:00</time.stamp><page.no>1130</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In the few minutes remaining I want to bring to the attention of the Senate a matter that was referred to me last week concerning the non-payment of superannuation contributions to a number of employees of a company called Sunland Security Services in Queensland. Apparently, the employees concerned have not been paid in respect of their superannuation entitlements under the superannuation guarantee for at least the 1996-97 financial year. This obviously concerns not just the employee who has contacted me but all of the employees, both current and former, of this particular company.</para></talk.start><para>Why does it concern the employees? Firstly, superannuation will be a major component of the retirement income of Australians in future. Secondly, whilst the moneys are not paid, and if the company is experiencing some financial difficulty, there is certainly a fear in the employees' minds that they may never see their money. Thirdly, it is certainly arguable, and I think highly likely, that, given the non-payment of the superannuation moneys, the death and disability insurance coverage of the employees has lapsed.</para><para>It was also brought to my attention that the tax office has been made aware of this situation on a number of occasions by a number of employees, both former and current, certainly over the last nine or 10 months. Unfortunately, the employees, according to the information provided to me, have not received any response of substance about when they are likely to receive their money from the tax office.</para><para>I did write to the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp, about this matter last week. I 
 was also able to discuss it, at lunchtime today, with the owner of the company, Sunland Security Services. She explained to me that there were some financial difficulties—that the company had been disadvantaged by the bankruptcy of a subcontractor that occurred at least 18 months ago, and that that had created some financial difficulties. The owner of Sunland Security Services has assured me today that she believes the superannuation entitlements of current and former employees will be paid by the end of April, and that correspondence has been entered into with the tax office and the payments will be made.</para><para>I am sure that the employees, both current and former, of the security firm, will be pleased to hear this and certainly pleased to receive their moneys. I can appreciate and understand the financial difficulties that the particular company has experienced. I certainly accept the assurances of the owner that the moneys will be paid. I think it is regrettable that the moneys for the period of at least the financial year have been outstanding for some time. This has obviously caused some considerable worry and concern to both current and former employees and this is an unfortunate example. I accept there are some difficulties that the company has been experiencing, and I also accept that there are other cases likely to be of a more serious nature that exist elsewhere in the community.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><adjournment><adjournmentinfo><time.stamp>22:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>1130</page.no></adjournmentinfo><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senate adjourned at 10.30 p.m.</inline></para></adjournment><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>1130</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tabling</title><page.no>1130</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following documents were tabled by the Clerk:</para><para>Aged Care Act—</para><para>	 Allocation Principles Amendment (No. 1) 1997.</para><para>	 Approved Provider Principles Amendment (No. 1) 1997.</para><para>	 Flexible Care Subsidy Principles Amendment (No. 1) 1997.</para><para>	 Residential Care Subsidy Amendment Principles (No. 1) 1998.</para><para>	 User Rights Principles Amendment (No. 6) 1997.

Conceptually, real interest rates are calculated by discounting nominal interest rates by the average expected inflation rate over the duration of the term of the loan. There is, however, no precise method for estimating such inflation expectations. While for short term rates the current inflation rate is sometimes used as an approximation, considerable caution should be exercised in drawing any conclusions based on this approach.</para><para>International comparisons of nominal interest rates are also subject to several limitations. Rates may not be comparable if they relate to different segments of the market, or if they fail to take account of different levels of risk or different terms. In addition, different structures for fees and charges are also relevant in considering the significance of such comparisons. These considerations are particularly relevant when comparing interest rates charged to business borrowers.</para><para>(2) On 11 October 1997, the Prime Minister wrote to the banking industry expressing the Government's view that the Banking Code of Practice and the industry-operated Australian Banking Industry Ombudsman scheme and alternative dispute resolution mechanisms should be extended to small business.

The measures available to the ASC in carrying out this role include: 
</para><para>(i) refusing to register a prospectus if, at the time the document is reviewed for registration, the ASC is of the opinion that the prospectus contravenes the prospectus provisions of the Corporations Law ('the Law') (principally Division 2 of Part 7.12 of the Law); contains a false or misleading statement or that there is an omission from the prospectus;</para><para>(ii) issuing a stop order on a prospectus where it appears to the ASC that the prospectus contravenes, in a substantial respect, the prospectus provisions of the Law or where it contains false, misleading or deceptive statements or material misrepresentations; and</para><para>(iii) investigating suspected breaches of the Law in relation to the issue of prospectuses. In cases where there have been material breaches in the rules of prospectus disclosure, particularly where investors have suffered losses, the ASC has at its disposal civil and criminal powers of enforcement.</para><para>Under the Law, investors also have rights of action to recover any loss or damages against persons involved in the preparation of a defective prospectus.</para><para>(2) (b) The Law places primary responsibility on the issuer to prepare a prospectus which complies with the legislation. Registrable prospectuses are subject to examination by ASC staff to determine whether there are obvious false or misleading statements or omissions which would warrant refusal of registration. I am advised that, at that stage, ASC does not generally request further information to verify statements made in the prospectus.</para><para>In carrying out its role in ensuring prospectuses comply with the Law, I am advised that the ASC places emphasis on its post-vetting program, which involves a more detailed review of selected prospectuses after registration. In a post-vet, underlying documents are examined to ensure information in the prospectus can be substantiated. Selection for post-vetting is based on an assessment of risks and other intelligence information including complaints. The ASC regularly post-vets prospectuses whether or not specific complaints have been received.</para><para>(3) Traffic forecasts are complex and require specialised expertise in their preparation. Their reliability is usually subject to various factors and assumptions. Promoters often rely on the traffic expert's reports or advice in making the forecasts. I am advised by the ASC that it is concerned to ensure that the basis of the forecasts and the associated risks are disclosed in the prospectus so that investors can assess the reliability of the forecasts.</para><para>Although the Law provides for civil and criminal liabilities for promoters in relation to false or misleading prospectuses, there are various defences available to promoters, including reasonable 
 reliance on experts. Thus in any enforcement action, it is not sufficient to show (in some cases, with the benefit of hindsight) that a forecast is incorrect. It is necessary to prove that the forecast could not have been made on a reasonable basis at the time it was made.</para><para>In August 1997, the ASC issued Practice Note 67 `Financial Forecasts in Prospectuses' to give guidance about the standards it expects of disclosures with a director's or expert's financial forecast.</para><para>(4) I am advised that the ASC carried out the following surveillance in relation to the three projects to which the question refers:</para><para>(a) M2 Motorway—The prospectus for the M2 Motorway was subject to detailed post-vetting by the ASC shortly after its registration in late 1994. The ASC subsequently reviewed a number of complaints received in relation to the prospectus.</para><para>(b) Eastern Distributor—A post-vet was carried out in August 1997 following the receipt by the ASC of complaints about the forecast traffic volume and financial viability of the Eastern Distributor contained in the prospectus of the Infrastructure Trust of Australia Group ('ITA').</para><para>(c) Transurban City Link—A limited post-vet of the Transurban City Link prospectus was undertaken after its registration in February 1996. One complaint was received by the ASC regarding non-disclosure of pending litigation.</para><para>Based on assessment of information available at the time, the ASC decided not to take enforcement action on the complaints in relation to each of the three projects.</para><para>(5) (a) I am advised that the ASC received a number of complaints in relation to the M2 Motorway prospectus in the period November 1994 to September 1997. The source of those complaints is confidential.</para><para>(b) I am advised that a search of the ASC's records reveals that written complaints were received between November 1994 and September 1997. In addition, discussions were held with complainants in November 1994 and February 1997.</para><para>(6) I am advised that a general post-vet of the ITA prospectus was carried out in November 1996 and further post-vetting was carried out in August 1997 on the traffic forecast of the Eastern Distributor as outlined in the answer to question 4(b) above.</para><para>(7) I am advised that a search of the ASC's files in relation to the M2 Motorway prospectus, the ITA prospectus and related complaints files has not revealed any approaches from any officer of the Government.

Other workshops, seminars and conferences arranged by the Department since March 1996 and Centrelink since 1 July 1997 are listed below:</para><para></para><table pgwide="1" border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><tgroup><thead><row><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para></para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para></para></entry></row><row><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>Type of Function</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>Venue</para></entry></row><row><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para></para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para></para></entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>Call Centre Conference (2 days)</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>Centrelink premises Sydney</para></entry></row><row><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>Audit and Evaluation Workshop (2 days)</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>Bungendore</para></entry></row><row><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>Business Planning Seminar (2 days)</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>Jindabyne</para></entry></row><row><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>Resources &amp;

However, based on discussions between officials 
 prior to the referral of Victoria's industrial relations powers to the Commonwealth, it was estimated that it was costing the Victorian Government in excess of $8.7m per annum to provide the functions that were the subject of the referral.</para><para>The benefits of a unified industrial relations system in Victoria are:</para><para>.	 a single more efficient and less costly system with one set of rules to replace the legalism and complications that arise from systems running side-by-side and overlapping</para><para>.	 easier access to the agreement-making choices provided by the federal system through certified agreements and Australian workplace agreements</para><para>.	 an effective and fair transition process from the dual system to the single system—employment agreements under the former Victorian State law are given continuing effect and the safety net protections are maintained 
 and these functions are now not being performed by the State</para><para>It is also worthy to note that the Victorian Government has formally advised the Labour Ministers' Council at its meeting on 21 November 1997 of its continued support for the referral and of the benefits which have accrued to the State. The Joint Communique issued by the Labour Ministers' Council following that meeting included, inter alia the following:</para><para>"Victorian Minister Hallam confirmed the Victorian Government's continuing support for the historic decision, taken 12 months ago, to refer Victoria's industrial relations powers to the Commonwealth. Minister Hallam said the referral had benefited employers and employees alike and had successfully introduced a seamless and user friendly State and Federal industrial relations system in Victoria."</para><para>The savings which accrue from these benefits are not restricted to savings to Government or taxpayers. Private sector employers and employees are nett beneficiaries given that the industrial relations systems have been established for their common benefit. It is not possible to quantify the direct and indirect savings to the private sector given the wide variety of potential and actual users of the system. Savings to the private sector can, however, be grouped into categories which include:</para><para>.	 speed of establishing rights and obligations—by having one point of reference for administrative services such as enquiries and advice on wages and conditions</para><para>.	 accuracy of establishing rights and obligations—by eliminating uncertainty or confusion created by dual systems of award regulation or agreement making</para><para></para><para>.	 simplicity in investigation, compliance and enforcement measures</para><para>.	 expedition in agreement making and dispute resolution—by having one point of reference for access to services of the Industrial Relations Commission (including in dismissal matters and disputes) and one jurisdiction for agreement making</para><para>.	 less technicality in dispute resolution and agreement making—by eliminating preliminary jurisdictional points of law based on cross jurisdictional issues</para><para>.	 less cost in dispute resolution—by eliminating costly litigation relating to jurisdictional overlap</para><para>.	 less potential for disputes over wages and conditions—by a single jurisdictional regulation within individual businesses and the elimination of dual coverage of single workplaces</para><para>In addition, the standing of the workplace relations system in the eyes of employers (particularly small business), employees and the community at large is enhanced by a single point of service delivery, rather than stakeholders being referred from one jurisdiction to the other for information or assistance in dispute resolution or agreement making.</para><para>(2) The Commonwealth does not have access to more detailed information from all of the other States to extrapolate estimated cost savings from a unitary industrial relations system. The quantification of savings would be likely to vary in each State as each State system provides a service to differing numbers of employers and employees. There would however be common features in many of the categories of savings, including the features identified in answer to question (1) above.</para></answer></subdebate.1></debate></answers.to.questions></hansard>
