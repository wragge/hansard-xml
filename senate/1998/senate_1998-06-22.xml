It is a provision that would allow creditors of a company, including employees, to apply to the court for an order to recover for a parent company moneys that may have been stripped from that company in order to avoid paying that creditor—in this case obviously being the workers. The most notorious example of that has been where the Patrick group of companies systematically and wilfully stripped the labour hire companies in the group in order to avoid the obligations that companies owed to their respective work forces.</para></talk.start><para>We in the ALP believe in the principle that this amendment embodies. We also have committed ourselves to the passage of the Wallis related legislation. It is our belief that insisting upon this amendment in this bill would only give the government the opportunity to misrepresent and to malign the Australian Labor Party regarding its position on the Wallis legislation. We will not give the government that type of opportunity. We, therefore, will not be insisting upon the Patrick amendment at this point in time.</para><para>The ALP believes that the change embodied in this amendment cannot be done in isolation. This is why we are reviewing the Patrick case in the light of the need to make substantive changes to the industrial relations law. We have also introduced a private member's bill, the employee security bill, into the House 
 to give workers greater ability to recover their entitlements when they have been unilaterally sacked by companies that then seek to deny paying them their legitimate entitlements through nothing short of a financial sham. Given the government's wholehearted and full endorsement of the action Patrick took to sack their work force, the opposition will use this bill to highlight the government's anti-worker, pro-sacking agenda.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>3556</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Before I speak to the substance of this motion on the <inline ref="r471">Financial Sector Reform (Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 1998</inline>  I wish to put a question to the parliamentary secretary.

I would advise you that, accordingly, I will again move that amendment to the  Company Law Review Bill 1997  which is due for debate later this week. Therefore, I will accept the intention that is here before us: that, in terms of numbers, this amendment will now not go through. I advise the Senate that, although I will not be insisting on a division, the Australian Democrats would have insisted on this amendment because we think it is critical.</para><para>I would ask the parliamentary secretary to consider the terms of any future rejection which the government may be considering if this same amendment, now to be put to the Company Law Review Bill, is passed. I consider that some of the reasons that have been provided are both inadequate and possibly misleading. I do not mean intentionally misleading; I mean possibly misleading in terms of a number of matters referred to in the reasons.</para><para>The matters refer to the possibility of the amendment proving a problem in that the terms and the nature of the provision give little guidance to parties and their advisers as to permitted and non-permitted conduct. Specifically the first area with which I would take issue is that the Law Reform Commission—which principally drafted that amendment way back in 1988, except for two changes made by me and by Senator Cook—deliberately wanted the courts to be the arbiter of these issues because it was not intended to be prescriptive or difficult in relation to how companies structure themselves but merely to guide how they should behave. If they do not go insolvent as a result of manipulating or deliberately structuring their affairs in such a way that they do go insolvent, then they have little to fear. I remind the government that the way in which that amendment was structured was the specific consequence of a view and a recommendation by the Law Reform Commission in 1988.</para><para>The second area with which I take issue relates to conglomerates. Once again, conglomerates have nothing to fear unless either they or their subsidiaries are likely to go insolvent. Fortunately in Australia that very seldom happens. I do not mean it will not ever happen, but it very seldom happens, and I do not think that is a weighty enough reason to reject the amendment. Frankly, if it did happen to some of their subsidiaries—as is the case with Patrick at present or in the Cobar instance—then it is the court which would determine whether there had been any malpractice which would result in those matters then coming to the consideration of the court.</para><para>The third area relates to the issue of Minco. For the record, I remind the Senate that not only did a number of parties, including me, take issue with the Patrick arrangements and how they were restructuring their subsidiaries—and, indeed, there are the Cobar and Woodlawn examples—but also the government was advised by press release on 3 May of the exact nature of the amendment which was proposed to be moved. I am aware, as is the parliamentary secretary, that if the government finds it necessary it is able to move very rapidly indeed with Minco. Somebody put the view to me—and I cannot recall who it was—that arrangements with Minco could take up to 18 months to resolve. That might be true, but, with this very bill before us, for instance, the package of 39 pages of amendments was realised far quicker than that following the Wallis recommendations and following the government's views as to how to do things. Since this is only one page of amendment, certainly it is within the ability and the very strong lobbying power of the parliamentary secretary, to which I have at times been victim, to get on his bike and get the appropriate authority and support from the necessary states. So, once again, I regard that as an inadequate approach.</para><para>My view, Parliamentary Secretary—as you know, I have expressed it to you privately—for the record is that the government take a different approach. I am open to view that approach, providing the consequence of what you do is to outlaw activity which immorally 
 and unjustly strips assets from subsidiaries so that creditors or employees do not receive their entitlements. Knowing your personal morality, I know you would not approve of that. I know you do not regard it as something which is desirable that people artificially or immorally avoid their obligations. I would ask you to take note of my remarks in any consideration of any future amendments in this regard.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>3558</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am just standing to indicate that the Greens (WA) feel there is nothing that has significantly changed between now and when the vote was taken to change our view in relation to the amendments.

My fourth test is competition. Australia has 22 statutory trustee companies. There are an estimated 500 scheme managers operating some 2,000 schemes in Australia. It is expected the bill will result in market rationalisation. IFSA, described by Chanticleer in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline>  on 19 March 1998 as representing the big fund managers, believes that there will be `fewer schemes, fewer trusts, fewer managers'. This certainly means fewer competitors.</para></talk.start><para>Given the apparent diversity of the industry at present, rationalisation does not yet repre 
 sent the danger of an unacceptable level of industry concentration. Nevertheless, that danger, so real in much of Australian business life, may well become greater under the bill. Rationalisation does not necessarily mean better competition. Economist Dr Dwyer is of the opinion that the bill runs the risk of forcing prudent Australian investors to invest offshore in better protected funds in the better regulated markets. This would advantage foreign competitors.</para><para>Will the bill significantly affect the ability of Australian funds to market their products overseas? Under existing law we have no access to American markets but the United States funds do have access to our markets. As a large capital importer, our government obviously believes that it has to put up with this lack of reciprocity, which also extends to other industries such as agriculture and manufacturing. The Australian Securities Commission currently approves schemes from Hong Kong, the United Kingdom, the United States of America, New Zealand, Guernsey, Jersey and the Isle of Man to operate in Australia. Australian schemes are known by the ASC to operate in New Zealand but access to other countries, if any, would be negotiated directly between the fund and the foreign regulator. The ASC states:</para><para>. . . does not expect that the passage of the Managed Investments Bill will alter the existing or potential access of Australian funds to foreign jurisdictions, or the access of foreign funds to Australia.</para><para>So there we have it: one side says it will be bad while the other side says it does not really know but it is not going to change things much. Will the bill significantly affect the willingness of foreigners to invest in Australian funds? Will they see investor protection reduced by the bill? With regard to international competitiveness, Dr Dwyer again is of the opinion that we are on dangerous ground with the bill. He says:</para><para>Here we are in Australia signing treaties, such as the World Trade Organisation, committing ourselves to free trade and financial services, while potentially implementing a regulatory regime that the Americans will be extremely fast to point out is substandard and below theirs . . . 
</para><para>once you suffer from a lack of confidence in your regulatory arrangements, then you are in trouble.</para><para>The area of choice is one in which the case is clear. It seems obvious that informed, self-sufficient and innovative risk takers should be able to opt for alternative products. It is ironic that a coalition government which makes much of the philosophy of choice wishes to move from one mandatory trustee single choice system to another mandatory single responsible entity, single choice system.</para><para>Both the present mandatory system and the bill's mandatory system can be rightly criticised for interfering with the freedom of investors collectively to determine their own prudential requirements. That is regarded as the price one pays for having secure investment systems which enjoy international and domestic approval. But limiting freedom should not mean no freedom or choice at all and it should certainly not mean no consultation with investors, who surely have the right to make the choice. There is no provision in this bill to oblige fund managers or the government to ask the investors in the funds their opinion.</para><para>Single responsible entities are already a feature of Australian financial life through banks, life insurance companies and superannuation funds, for instance, although each has different fiduciary regulatory constraints. The government has determined that all new future collective management schemes be single responsible entities. The Australian Democrats do not propose to oppose that intention although, as is evident, we are fearful that it may expose some classes of investor to greater risk.</para><para>The government has also determined that all existing investment schemes will be single responsible entities subject to a transitional period of two years. The Australian Democrats do oppose that intention unless the investors in those funds themselves want to change. We believe that investors in existing schemes should have a say in whether they move to an single responsible entity environment or not.</para><para>There are also fund managers who oppose single responsible entities, as in the submission to the committee from Fidelity Invest 
 ments, an American subsidiary, which finds trustees to be a cheaper and better option than having to go in-house with all the compliance and custodial duties. A number of smaller and medium sized Australian fund managers hold the same view and presented evidence at the hearings. Indeed, this bill is characterised by its opponents as being designed for, and strongly favouring, the big end of town.</para><para>The Australian Democrats believe that the existing system can and should run parallel to the single responsible entity system, if investors in existing funds wish that it do so. This means that in existing funds, where investors so choose, the use of a trustee will continue.</para><para>The bill provides for a two-year transitional period for existing schemes. The transitional arrangements allow either the existing management company or trustee to become the responsible entity. The government intends investors will move from one mandatory scheme to another mandatory scheme. For us, there is an amazing presumption here—that the government can simply alter the security enjoyed by an investor without consulting them, or without requiring the funds themselves to consult them. It has not been established that the investors in each existing scheme want to change. Whether there is a majority or a minority in each existing scheme is unknown. Investors were largely unrepresented at the hearing that the committee held. Small investors in particular were not represented. I have seen, for example, that an organisation such as the Australian Consumers Association, which supports this bill, has not even asked the question of its own members.</para><para>The bill permits the ASC to appoint a custodian, or the fund manager may voluntarily appoint one. There is, however, no provision for investors to make the appointment. There will undoubtedly be investors who prefer the approach taken in the bill. There will also undoubtedly be investors who are more comfortable with the existing system. In a democracy, both should have a choice. Our quarrel with this bill is not that the government should take a view but that the government has failed to allow investors to take a view. </para><para>There are major problems with this bill. In our view, it does not provide choice and it does lessen security. That view is shared by a number of very senior and very capable persons in the community and it is opposed by other senior and capable persons. The Australian Democrats will be moving amendments to this bill in the committee stage to address the problems I have outlined.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>3560</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The  <inline ref="r424">Managed Investments Bill 1997</inline>  is a curious bill in many respects. It is especially curious as it positively works against some of the government's favourite catchcries, particularly its favoured stance of promoting domestic and international competitiveness and flexibility in contractual arrangements. It is absolutely the opposite of the theme that the government was trying to push during the last sitting fortnight in relation to choice in superannuation funds—whether that choice was real or not.</para></talk.start><para>This bill will leave investors with no choice between different structures. This bill will rob investors of the choice of having the protection of a trustee. This bill will diminish investors' rights of redress against negligent directors. The bill will leave Australia with an investor protection regime that is one of the weakest and least proactive regimes in the world. The bill will leave Australia with a regime that will favour large fund managers over small fund managers and that will make it very difficult for small funds to even enter the market.</para><para>The  Managed Investments Bill 1997 , along with the related  Company Law Review Bill 1997 , will bring about significant changes to the way in which business operates. The  Managed Investments Bill 1997  radically changes the structure of managed investment schemes in Australia. It alters the schemes from being two-tiered schemes, which include a funds manager and a trustee in a supervisory and watchdog capacity, to single-tier schemes comprising a single responsible entity. The  Managed Investments Bill 1997  relates to non-superannuation collective investment schemes. I will come back to the government's inconsistent dealing with super 
 annuation investment schemes and non-superannuation investment schemes later.</para><para>This bill raises serious questions on a number of fronts. First of all, on the investor front, this bill undermines the protection that investors currently enjoy and limits the choices available. On the competition front, in absolute contrast to the usual song sung by the government the bill actually undermines competition, especially for smaller funds, as a result of the costs involved in the new scheme.</para><para>On the international front, this bill undermines the pursuit of international best practice—another favourite tune that the government normally prefers to whistle. On a democratic front, this bill undermines the parliamentary process by leaving the details of this new scheme to be determined by the Australian Securities Commission at its leisure—outside the scrutiny and view of citizens and their representatives in parliament.</para><para>Investors are the losers in this bill. This bill not only weakens the protection for investors but removes any choice for investors as to the level of protection they would prefer. It is a bizarre situation that the government has been blowing the horn of flexibility in contractual arrangements in the area of workplace relations and superannuation investment yet is proposing to limit the freedom to contract in the important area of investor protection and consumer choice in managed investment funds. I wonder who is pushing this line?</para><para>While it seems rational that professional or informed investors should have the option to invest in a scheme without the prudential protections of a trustee, it is hard to think why the government wants to prohibit two-tiered investment schemes. The bill forces investors to accept a lower level of protection whether they like it or not. What is wrong with the so called mum and dad investors actually being able to have custodians or trustees to make sure the whiz-kids and screen jockeys don't blow the life savings of small investors?</para><para>In the lower house, Mr Rocher, the honourable member for Curtin, quoted from the Australian Law Reform Commission's summary to its report, <inline font-style="italic">Collective investments: 
 other people's money</inline>. I think the quotations are worth putting on record in the Senate as well. The ALRC noted:</para><para>Many investors decide to invest in these schemes—</para><para>collective investment schemes—</para><para>because they do not want the worry and responsibility of day to day management of their money.</para><para>The ALC also noted:</para><para>They rely on the law, rather than on their own expertise, to give them appropriate protection.</para><para>Considering such comments, clearly the issue of consumer investor protection is a crucial one. The Greens (WA) are not convinced—indeed, far from it—that this bill provides anything close to adequate investor protection. The idea which a `single responsible entity' is built on is that there is legal confusion as to who is answerable to investors. This is itself a questionable argument in light of joinder rules. It has been argued that the confusion is not such a calamity in reality. Nevertheless, the axing of the independent trustee is not a logical response to this problem. Clarification of the roles was what was clearly required. Indeed, Standard and Poor's, the international rating agency, has noted that the current structure provides greater investment protection as the trustee and the custodian are clearly independent. They also recognise that an independent custodian is the minimum standard adopted by foreign financial centres.</para><para>The bill provides significant scope for the responsible entity to engage in fraud and abuse their position. The safeguard under the bill is that the manager must have the support of either the majority of independent directors or a compliance committee. But the bill specifically stops the trustee from filling either of these positions. Pierpont, writing in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline>, elucidates the problem with this so-called `safeguard' through the example of Trustee Executor and Agency, which collapsed in 1983. In that case all of the directors were independent but had no idea about the rorting and speculation that the managing director was engaging in with the company's money. Moreover, the government is yet to outline the qualifications required for members of the compliance 
 committee or how often they are to scrutinise the fund.</para><para>Under this bill, there is not a stringent set of obligations on prospective fund managers and on day-to-day operations. Additionally, the constitution of a scheme may be modified or replaced with a new constitution by the responsible entity as long as it considers the change will not adversely affect the members' rights. This weak regime is in stark contrast to the highly regulated superannuation industry. Even though there is stringent regulation in the superannuation industry, it seems that there is still room for improvement. Thinking of cases such as EC Consolidated Capital and Sentinel, where `rogue fund managers' managed to decimate the life savings of investors, it seems that superannuation regulation has not gone far enough, especially when it might be compulsory.</para><para>How can the government possibly consider that the guidelines in the Managed Investments Bill are even close to adequate? Why is the government wanting to resile from commitments to more stringent corporate governance regimes? The Managed Investments Bill is handing over the means to pursue fraud on a golden platter. I can imagine a future Alan Bond or Christopher Skase in the making if this legislation is enacted and then someone will say, `We didn't know.' A similar prediction has been made by the investment managers Maple, Brown, Abbott Ltd in their submission to the committee reviewing this bill. They noted:</para><para>Unhappily, we predict that if the bill stays in the present form there will one day be substantial losses to investors which external custody may have avoided.</para><para>Let us look at the issue of redress. The bill leaves aggrieved investors to rely entirely on the Australian Securities Commission to take legal action on their behalf. They will no longer have a trustee legally charged with the duty of protecting their interests and supervising the fund manager to protect against fraud and unauthorised dealings. It diminishes the likelihood of private actions by investors, as most cannot afford the time or money to commence an action in the Supreme Court.</para><para>The Australian Securities Commission has had no guarantee that its funding will be increased to account for its new role—and perhaps these questions can be answered in the committee stage—and would be required to take an action at public expense to enforce private rights and interests. Mr Cameron of the Australian Securities Commission forewarned the committee by telling them that the ASC did not necessarily see itself being involved in handling complaints by investors against fund managers. So who is going to do it? Or is the answer `nobody'?</para><para>Adequate access to mechanisms for redress after the event is an important issue. However, perhaps in this instance it is more important to have preventive measures than remedial ones. It is all a bit too late to recover your life savings when the fund assets have been stripped and divested overseas. The ASC has no standing to pursue a claim for anticipated fraud. However, where a trustee holds the asset it may simply decline to draw the cheque until it is satisfied that everything is above board.</para><para>Let us look at some international comparisons. The coalition, as an enthusiast on global competitiveness and world's best practice, has taken a strange and inconsistent line to put Australia wildly out of step with the rest of the world. In 1995, KPMG conducted a survey of 43 developed countries where public offer investment funds were marketed. In all but the British Virgin Islands and the Netherlands Antilles custodians were mandated. After pursuing that road, now even the British Virgin Islands are making independent custodians or trustees mandatory for managed funds. What does that say about Australia?</para><para>At a time when the government is continually calling for investment and claiming to be implementing measures to attract investment, this bill seems to work against such aims. It is questionable whether the UK, US or European pension funds will be able to invest in SRE schemes. The bill may also encourage Australian investors to move their money offshore in order to receive higher protection. How does this subvert the parliamentary process?</para><para>The bill contains little substance on how the legislation will operate in practice. Mr Cameron of the ASC describes the legislation as `outcomes based', which is a nice way of saying that a hell of a lot of meat in the legislation cannot be scrutinised before the bill is passed. That seems to be a growing theme with this government at the moment. Important elements of investor protection have been left to the Australian Securities Commission to determine—for example, how separation of trust property is to be achieved. Neither draft regulations or ASC policy guidelines exist in relation to this bill.</para><para>This makes it difficult to know how the law will operate. This bill makes rights unduly dependent on ill-defined administrative powers and usurps the parliamentary process. Moreover, the government has lumped the ASC with the onus of monitoring and regulating funds. This huge increase in responsibility has not had a commensurate increase in funding. Indeed, the ASC has this extra burden in the face of a huge slash in its compliance and regulation budget.</para><para>Why is this scheme anti-competitive? The Managed Investments Bill positively operates in an inequitable manner that disadvantages small fund managers. The effect is the creation of an anti-competitive environment; something I think the government would be horrified by, at least in practice.</para><para>The bill operates to the advantage of large fund managers for two reasons. Firstly, the increased compliance cost under the new arrangements will be proportionately higher for small fund managers. Large institutions may already have the accounting and legal resources to provide safeguards for investors, but small funds would have to set them up from scratch. On top of that, they would have to hire expensive outside directors and compliance committee members. Secondly, small fund managers have a high level of credibility with investors where there is an independent trustee.</para><para>Consequently, with lower confidence levels coupled with increased costs, it would be very difficult for a small fund to enter or survive in the current market. These arrangements severely drag on the profitability and flexibili 
 ty of small fund managers. As some of the small fund managers have noted in their submissions to the committee of review of the Managed Investments Bill, the solution seems obvious; let the fund managers who wish to retain trustees keep them, with the proviso that the fund manager is responsible. That would clear up the buck passing worries, while making it commercially viable for smaller fund managers to have a presence in the market.</para><para>At a time when the crisis in Asia's financial markets is being blamed on cronyism and the lack of investment transparency, why would the government think it prudent to weaken investor protection in a manner out of step with international practice and put many aspects of investment regulation in the unguided ASC regulations?</para><para>I listened to the remaining contribution of Senator Murray and he mentioned that amendments will be put to this bill. The Greens would like to see changes to this bill as well and would like to see the government responding in a responsible way to the legitimate concerns of not only the wider community—those who know about what they are doing—but also those people who are working on a day-to-day basis with this kind of fund management and who are issuing the strongest possible warning signs that the government is going in the wrong direction in this particular bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>3563</page.no><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name><name.id>3L6</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak briefly on the Managed Investments Bill. I have enjoyed being a part of the discussions in the committee stage of this bill. We have been swamped by information, material, newspaper comment and representations. It is clearly a bill about which there is much interest in the community, although possibly it is limited to the financial parts of the community. Certainly, the financial journalists have been writing at length on it.</para></talk.start><para>Like the previous speakers, Senator Margetts and Senator Murray, one of the major concerns that the Labor Party has on this bill is the question of investor protection and whether or not investors—small investors in particular—will be better off under the 
 single responsible entity regime or better of by maintaining some form of trustee or custodian.</para><para>The Labor Party has looked at this bill, which commenced under our previous government when it was referred to as collective investment reform. We made a number of recommendations that were put into a bill which never made it into the parliament. The government picked up the ball and has moved pretty much with the same bill, although with a couple of important differences.</para><para>What has been the history of collective investments, or managed investments as they are now called? When you look at what happened to AustWide and Estate Mortgage and the difficulties encountered under the existing regime, you can understand the calls over many years about the need for greater reform. Many investors lost substantial amounts. There was argument about who was responsible and whether it was the fund manager or the trustee. Those are the sorts of issues that this bill is attempting to address.</para><para>Through the committee process we have also been made aware of the shenanigans that can go on even if you have a single responsible entity. I would like to quote one example, without naming any names or the institution involved. It was given in evidence to us in a confidential sense, so I need to restrict that, unfortunately. It is to do with one of the major banks.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Senator Sherry interjecting</inline>—</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name></talker><para>—No, it is confidential, Senator Sherry. One of the major banks had an unsuccessful share issue that was underwritten by many investment bankers in Australia. About the time that this underwriting was coming to a close, it was clear to the market that there would be a significant shortfall, that the shares were overpriced, and that the market was not going to take up the underwriting.</para></talk.start></continue><para>At the time, not only the trustees but other interest groups noticed that something unusual was happening. Without any previous strategies being announced, a number of the managed funds decided to direct their funds 
 to start buying this particular bank's shares in large numbers and out of sequence and context.</para><para>It is too easy in those circumstances for people not to realise. It is too easy for members' funds to be put into these sorts of investments with these sorts of problems. The outcome of the intervention of the trustees in this case was that the shares in the particular bank were not bought; they were held off. So the price of the shares fell dramatically the day after the close of the underwriting and it was announced that there was a large shortfall. By waiting until after the underwriting closed, and if the decision had then been made to pursue the bank's shares, they would have been purchased at a much cheaper price than they could have been a few days before.</para><para>This is the sort of problem which I have concerns about. I am concerned that, by moving without question towards a single responsible entity, the bill as it stands does not have enough investor protection. There are significant investor protections. There are attempts to address these sorts of issues but, if you have a situation where Chinese walls are set up within companies and the fund manager also has pressures from above in relation to investments, you can see that investors will be much worse off. There are other examples regarding properties being bought and sold and revalued at different rates than they otherwise would have been from an independent commercial valuer which can be rushed through the system. We were assured by those who were supporting this bill that that would not happen; that it could not happen. I would like to be 100 per cent comfortable that that would be the case. I am probably not at this stage.</para><para>I am looking forward to the parliamentary secretary's contribution to these issues during the committee stage and the debate that will surround Senator Murray's amendments and some of our own amendments, but I would have to say at this stage that I am not completely convinced that those sorts of examples which were brought to the committee's attention can be addressed adequately in the investor protection rules that we are going to be debating. Like Senator Margetts, I am a bit 
 perplexed that, on the one hand, we have a situation where the government is demanding choice of fund for superannuation investors. As the chamber has already heard on the choice of fund legislation, it is not a real choice; it is a choice for employers rather than employees. But it is at least a choice of sorts. So we have the government, on the one hand, trumpeting that they are about the `democratic right to choose' choice of superannuation fund but, on the other hand, introducing a piece of legislation that specifically mandates against choice.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">SHERRY</name><name role="display">Senator Sherry</name></talker><para>—Choice when it suits them.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name></talker><para>—That is exactly right, Senator Sherry; choice when it suits them. This should take away a large degree of the high moral ground that the government claim they have, though any reading of the choice of fund bill shows they do not. They claim that they have a mandate. I understand that they are reintroducing the choice of fund bill for superannuation into the House of Representatives and into the Senate. In the same week they are introducing a bill that says, `You can't have the choice of a custodian or a trustee if you want to pay for one.' A lot has been made in our own report about this issue. One of the opening sentences in the committee's report in relation to this bill states:</para></talk.start></continue><para>More recently, the need for reform has been supported by the final report of the financial system inquiry released on 9 April.</para><para>That was very compelling evidence and, as you can see, by leading up the committee's report the committee felt very strongly that that was something that needed to be pointed out. Yet, unfortunately, we have seen a number of members of that committee go public. They have written to the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and pointed out that their recommendation was based on the original Labor bill that, in actual fact, is a bit different.</para><para>I would like to quote from Mrs Nicholls, who is one of the members of the committee that initially supported the original bill before the government's bill had come to complete fruition. She states:</para><para>I support the concerns expressed that the bill in its current form—</para><para>that is, the form that we have before us today—</para><para>removes sound prudential requirements. I also support the view that the bill inappropriately limits investor choice. I believe investors should be free to choose and pay for the extra protection afforded by an independent trustee.</para><para>These are very strong words from somebody who has been championed by one side of the debate, saying this very important, eminent group of people strongly support the bill. The committee was swayed by that, and it is disappointing to see before the end of the debate such a substantial change. Perhaps it was not a change; perhaps not enough information was made available before people started quoting out of context the committee's support for different sections of the bill.</para><para>This is a letter to Mr Costello, the Treasurer. I am sure Senator Campbell has seen it and has possibly had some discussions about it. Perhaps in his speech we may be able to hear a little of his discussions—the toned down version—with any of the members of the committee. Professor Ian Harper, who was one of the main people involved with the report and who is to be the chair of APRA—one of the two key bodies that will be administering the financial sector after 1 July—is another person who has written to the government expressing his concern. If the head of APRA is concerned about the bill, that is reason enough for this chamber to have a good hard think about where it is going with this bill and not just glibly brush it off. It is not the trustees, it is not one of the two sets of vested interests that have been so heavily involved in this debate; these are the government's hand-picked members of their committee. More importantly, the head of one of the regulatory authorities is expressing concern about sound prudential requirements being removed.</para><para>Notwithstanding the debate which has raged on both sides, where we have seen substantial amounts of time and effort go into this bill, there are genuine concerns which through the course of the debate I am hoping we get a chance to air. I think Senator Murray is moving a string of amendments about which 
 we will have a chance to hear the government's position, to hear more from the government than we have heard previously, to hear responses to Mrs Nicholls, Professor Carmichael and Professor Harper. Because these are opinions of people that the government weighs very heavily.</para><para>We have a whole set of legislation—legislation which I think the Senate may have been dealing with just before this—which was recommended by these individuals; their views carried the day on a whole string of reforms to the financial sector. It just perplexes me as to why, when they write to the government and say, `Look, we're a little concerned that you're going in this direction on this particular financial reform,' all of a sudden their views are to be ignored. So I hope that the government and Senator Campbell are in a position to enlighten us on these things.</para><para>The other issue that has been taken up strongly by the Labor Party—and I know that Senator Campbell at various stages has made a number of interjections during debates on this issue—is the resourcing of the ASC. Again, we are looking with some interest for Senator Campbell's reassurances on this.

It would be interesting to know the views of Professor Harper, Professor Carmichael and Mrs Nicholls on whether or not there is sufficient funding for the ASC. Professor Harper, in particular, is heading up one of these two financial regulators. He will have a very keen interest in the level of support that the government is prepared to put into these regulators.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The Labor Party is disappointed—and we stress this in the report—about the level of funding in the ASC. I would like to make the point that this is not to be seen as a criticism of the ASC. The ASC is underfunded now; it has been underfunded in the past. I am not trying to apportion partisan blame on this. We have seen what has happened through the 1980s and 1990s. Things are a lot cleaner now than they used to be. But there are still a lot of shonky operators, and there is still a great need for the ASC to maintain its activities in a number of areas.</para><para>At estimates I have raised the question of the checking of prospectuses and company reports. This is an area where the ASC, because of funding constraints, has decided to reallocate its priorities and cut an entire program of auditing of company reports. It has taken that decision—and this is the ASC 
 speaking—`on the basis that we believe it can be better done in a different way.' It is disappointing to see the ASC doing that. It is disappointing to see the ASC walking away from creating the corporate culture. But these are the sorts of responses it has to make when it keeps getting more and more responsibility and less and less funds.</para><para>So, as I have said, this is not an attack on the ASC. The ASC is heavily worked but, unfortunately, underfunded. That is a criticism that could probably apply fairly across the governments of both parties in the last few years. We have a situation where there is not less corporate fraud than there was before the last election or in the 12 months before the last election; there is more corporate fraud. There is more need for regulators to chase up what has been going on in the corporate sector. We have seen the Crown Casino under the constant attention of the ASC—that is right, Senator Murray, this is one of my favourite topics. We have seen a whole range of companies that have got away with some fairly shonky practices.</para><para>I would like to finish up by talking about one of the strongest arguments that seems to have been put forward by one of the trustees, and that is this: there are few countries around the world with just the single responsible entity in this particular area. We have seen Australia, if you like, take the leading edge with this particular debate; we are moving to single responsible entities before others. The government is saying, `Well, it doesn't matter what the rest of the world has done; it doesn't matter that no-one else in the world has been prepared to take this jump that we are taking'.</para><para>But to the contrary, the government keeps putting forward as one of its strongest arguments for tax reform that, `We've got to have a GST because everyone else has got a GST.' Well, everyone else also has custodians and trustees—but that does not seem to be a convenient argument at the moment. Many other countries have death duties; but Australia is not saying that, on the basis of our being one of the few countries in the world without death duties, we should reintroduce death duties. This just seems selective to me. At one point it suits the government to say, `We've 
 got to have all these reforms, we've got to be moving in this direction because the rest of the world has it and we are lagging behind.' Then all of a sudden, when it conveniently suits the government, we are going in the other direction.</para><para>Those are the sorts of issues on which I am looking forward to hearing a response from the government. I am looking forward to the committee stage with this legislation. We are not looking to unduly slow down the processes of the Senate with what will be a very busy agenda in the next couple of weeks. But we certainly will be raising these questions in the committee stage. We will be looking forward to the answers, and we hope that some of those answers come through and allow themselves to clarify.</para><para>We also have a number of amendments that perhaps do not go as far as Senator Murray's amendments. But it will be interesting to listen to the debate on those issues. I will finish there and just reiterate that we are looking forward to the committee stage.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>3567</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I acknowledge what Senator Conroy has just said; I think it is a very important point that the government should consider very carefully. As Senator Conroy has said, Australia should be at the leading edge of measures to protect investors. We seem to be at that leading edge all right. But the question we have to ask ourselves of these measures that are currently before us is whether we, as a parliament, are being asked to pass laws which reduce and in some cases deny investors the right to protect themselves, which make illegal forms of business organisations which were not only formerly legal, but compulsory measures to protect investors.</para></talk.start><para>I think it is even more disconcerting for the chamber to reflect on the fact that the  Managed Investments Bill 1997  may be described as `creating new engines of fraud'. That is my opinion, but, before I am accused of not understanding the intricate, complex and sophisticated financial matters that relate to this question, I would like to say that that is the expressed opinion of Mr Trevor Sykes, a pre-eminent Australian financial journalist, who has written two histories of Australian 
 financial crashes entitled <inline font-style="italic">Two Centuries of Panic</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">The Bold Riders</inline>, the latter dealing with the excesses of the 1980s. I realise that the 1980s are ancient history to some people, and I realise that it is even more ancient history to point out that in the United Kingdom, unit trusts were first regulated under the Prevention of Fraud (Investments) Act 1939.</para><para>But the prevention of fraud is of great interest to some 2.5 million investors in unit trusts—many of whom are independent retirees. The test to be applied to this bill is whether or not it helps prevent fraud or facilitates it. It is the opinion of many witnesses from the Corporations and Securities Commission as well as Mr Sykes and other reputable journalists that this bill will leave investors less protected—that, in fact, is my opinion, but it is not original. I am therefore disappointed that the majority report of the committee has not reflected the weight of evidence presented to it in that regard.</para><para>In the brief time available to me, I will point out some points of deficiency in the bill. The bill reduces investor protection and investor choice. The Managed Investments Bill proposes radical changes to the laws that have, for the past 45 years, protected investors in unit trusts, share trusts, property trusts and other forms of collective investment from misleading, maladministration and self-dealing by the promoters and managers of such schemes. The Corporations Law currently requires all such schemes to have an independent trustee—that is, a public corporation approved by the Australian Securities Commission to act as trustee—or, in limited cases, a related party trustee to hold the assets of the scheme in safe custody and to monitor the management, investments and operation of the scheme to ensure compliance with the Corporations Law, the general law and the trust deed which established the scheme.</para><para>The stated aim of this bill is to create a new single responsible entity structure that is intended to strengthen the protections for investors whilst increasing efficiency and reducing the cost of operating collective investment schemes. The bill also aims to harmonise the regulation of collective investment schemes with that of public offer super 
 annuation schemes operated under the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1994, the SIS. That has been alluded to during previous speeches in the second reading debate. I believe the bill fails to achieve these stated objectives in material respects and that a number of substantive amendments are required so that the proposed responsible entity structure will not seriously weaken investor protection and will not deny Australian investors the right to contract for the extra protection of their savings.</para><para>The bill does not create a system like either the SIS or the Corporations Law. The bill does not give the same protection as required for superannuation funds. Investors will have neither the rights of beneficiaries of existing unit trusts nor the rights of company shareholders. Most superannuation funds have independent trustees. It is only public offer superannuation funds—currently a very small proportion of total super funds—which do not, and they are closely regulated and required to have either minimum capital or an independent custodian. In the case of corporations, directors are elected directly by and are liable directly to investors. As Alan Cameron, the current chair of the ASC said to the joint parliamentary committee, `managed funds are quite different'.</para><para>It should be noted, however, that in relation to corporations there are now proposals to further water down the liability of directors and shareholders. These proposals were recently announced by the Treasurer (Mr Costello), and, in relation to them, Chanticleer commented in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> of 18 March, as follows:</para><para>By comparison with the past, the new order will also make life a paradise for company directors. The risk of directors being sued by regulators and shareholders has been severely curtailed, with directors' liability now limited to cases involving evidence of criminality or gross and wilful negligence.</para><para>Will the bill improve investor protection? Let me quote again from the evidence of Mr Alan Cameron the chairman of the ASC to the joint parliamentary committee. He stated:</para><para>Whether [the Bill] ultimately brings about an improvement in investor protection, or the same level, or a reduction, will depend . . . on a whole 
 lot of measures that I am not quite sure how you will actually construct, but, more importantly, upon what actually happens—what people do in response to all of these provisions.</para><para>The committee heard no evidence that can assure the parliament that fewer investors will lose money under the proposed regime. Indeed, in her submission to the committee, the Victorian Attorney-General Wade stated:</para><para>There can be no doubt that under the proposed regime there will be greater likelihood of loss to investors and less likelihood that they will recover their losses.</para><para>Mrs Wade is a former Commissioner for Corporate Affairs in Victoria, the predecessor to the ASC with responsibility for this area of regulation. Mr Alan Cameron also stated:</para><para>I do not see this legislation as fundamentally transferring the obligation to monitor investment and so on to the individual investors. . . . I see this as a whole collection of remedies which, taken together and working effectively, should look after the interests of investors at least as well as, if not better than, they are presently looked after.</para><para>He said further:</para><para>The intention of the Bill . . . is to be preventative: to ensure as far as one can that these problems do not arise in the first place. It is a matter of judgment as to whether this, on the whole, produces this result.</para><para>That is very tentative. This is a faint assurance for the parliament that the bill will not diminish investor protection. Honourable senators will recall the failure of the ASC to act in the NRMA demutualisation case to protect members from a misleading and deceptive prospectus. We all recall that, when the profit results shortly after the prospectus differed by many millions of dollars from the prospectus forecast, the ASC did nothing. At the time I asked questions concerning this, and I must say I certainly was not very satisfied with the answers. I am still awaiting answers to questions that I put forward at the committee dealing with the Treasury estimates in respect of this area as well.</para><para>At the end of the day, the ASC can only act after the event at best and may be subject to attempts at improper influence at worst. Unless the Senate can be assured that the bill is clearly and demonstrably better than the current arrangements, the legislation should be 
 rejected as costly, unnecessary and achieving no material improvement. Again, I quote Attorney-General Wade. She says:</para><para>I have argued . . . that the changes to the regulation . . . adopted in the bill are both deficient and unnecessary. I am not confident that the structure proposed will enhance investor protection.</para><para>Who can doubt that investor security is of paramount importance? As Mr Kell from the Australian Consumer Association said in evidence to the joint committee:</para><para>[Investors] think security is important, that is a very important issue for consumers. . . . They do not have any particular concern, in our experience, as to how that security is delivered at the end of the day as long as it is there. . . . They do not have the financial sophistication or interest to go any steps beyond that level of knowledge.</para><para>I entirely agree that it is very difficult for ordinary investors to fully understand how their security is delivered, but this is precisely what they will need to do if the trustee role is abolished. Under current law, investors who invest in managed funds write their cheques to trustee companies and they have the comfort of knowing that there is a creditworthy and responsible independent party supervising their fund and ensuring safe custody of its assets. Why should they be made to worry about the details of security? By contrast, under this bill they will be completely reliant upon financial planners and others to advise them on the relative risks and security issues associated with different classes of managed funds, depending upon the array of flexible ASC policies that will be put into place.</para><para>That raises a further issue: the extraordinarily wide delegation of legislative power in this bill to the ASC to modify the bill by regulation, in effect. We do not know really what we are voting for. The Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances should be appalled by the sloppiness of the drafting style which has been put before the Senate here. How can a self-respecting legislative body pass a law abdicating parliamentary rights and duties to frame legislation? The bill is full of vague waffle words which are undefined and will end up meaning whatever the ASC wants them to mean. If that is the case, this is not law. This does not define rights and duties; this is confusion of concepts 
 and confusion of legislative and executive roles.</para><para>The next point is that the bill should be amended to strengthen accountability to investors. The bill should make the directors and officers of a responsible entity directly liable to investors if they fail to ensure the proper operation of the scheme. Under current law, both scheme managers and independent trustees are directly liable to investors if they breach their duty of care or trust. Directors and officers of responsible entities of public offer superannuation schemes are directly accountable to investors under the SIS Act. This outcome is not, however, achieved under this bill, despite it being a fundamental rationale of the bill that the protections currently provided to investors will not be weakened but strengthened.</para><para>Under the bill, only the responsible entity or the ASC—but not the investor who suffers loss—may sue the directors and officers of the responsible entity for compensation if loss is suffered due to failure to exercise proper care and diligence in meeting all requirements of the law, the scheme constitution and the compliance plan. This outcome diminishes the effectiveness of investor protection compared to the current law.</para><para>Empowering the responsible entity to sue its own directors and officers, as the bill does, provides little comfort to investors, as the wrongdoers are in a position to influence or determine the responsible entity's decision whether to take action.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>DX5</name.id><name role="metadata">MARGETTS</name><name role="display">Senator Margetts</name></talker><para>—They will suit themselves; of course they will.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>6H4</name.id><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name></talker><para>—Yes, Senator Margetts. The bill leaves aggrieved investors to rely entirely on the ASC to take legal action on their behalf. This outcome is undesirable from a public policy point of view and disadvantages the investors. It diminishes the likelihood of private enforcement action by investors and requires the ASC to take action at public expense to enforce private rights and interests.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Next, the bill should be amended to preserve investor choice to engage an independent trustee. Now, at the very minimum, 
 parliament should not deny people the right to take what steps they think necessary to protect their money from sophisticated white-collar crime, especially when Internet money transfers are opening up new opportunities for sophisticated crime. People have a right to contract for the protection of their money as they think best. The bill should be amended so as to permit investors in both existing schemes and new schemes to choose either to retain an independent trustee or to register under the single responsible entity structure created by the bill. The bill should require a resolution of the investors in existing schemes as a precondition to conversion to the new law.</para><para>The bill affects a very large number of Australian investors. As many as 2.5 million Australians now hold investments, directly or indirectly, in non-superannuation collective investment schemes. A large number of investors and fund managers wish to continue to invest in and operate schemes with an independent trustee assuming fiduciary responsibility to them for the proper administration of the scheme. The merits of the new, untried, single responsible entity arrangements created under the bill are not so powerful as to deny investors and fund managers wishing to do so the option of operating managed funds with an independent trustee structure. Such a structure is not only permitted but mandated in most major overseas jurisdictions. The reasons put forward for abandoning that structure in Australia and, what is more, prohibiting such a structure are neither supported by the evidence nor compelling, as clearly demonstrated by the evidence submitted to the joint committee.</para><para>Next, the bill trespasses unduly on personal rights and liberties—and I note the Scrutiny of Bills Committee did not invite the minister to address some fundamental issues on people's rights. The bill denies the beneficial owners of some $85 billion of assets in collective investments the right to continue to have those assets held for them on the same terms and conditions, and with the same level of protection that they currently enjoy. It is clearly retrospective in that the bill seeks to overturn established contractual and equitable 
 rights and obligations without the consent of those affected.</para><para>Retrospective abrogation of legal contractual rights has always been repugnant to this parliament, as it is in other countries which adhere to this rule of law. I would like to see some detailed legal advice on the constitutional aspects of this bill in relation to heads of legislative power and limits on legislative power. The constitution of the United States of America, for example, expressly forbids any state from passing laws which impair the obligation of contracts and generally forbids ex post facto laws. The Commonwealth parliament is being asked to pass a bill which no American state would regard as a proper exercise of legislative power.</para><para>I will be very interested to hear discussion during the committee stage. I have been looking at and considering Senator Murray's proposal, Senator Conroy's proposal and Senator Margetts's proposal, but I do urge the Senate not to be rushed into passing a bill which may come back to haunt its promoters and, by implication, ourselves.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>3571</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to start where Senator Harradine concluded, in terms of rushing this legislation. Before I do so I would thank all honourable senators who have contributed to the second reading debate, particularly Senator Murray and Senator Conroy who have taken a very close interest in this debate over many months. I would also recognise the cooperation that we have had from the Australian Labor Party and former Senator Gareth Evans, now the shadow Treasurer, and the advisers in his and Senator Cook's office in coming to a sensible understanding of how the arrangements will work.</para></talk.start><para>In response to the allegation of rushing the legislation through that has been made by others, I developed a time line of the law reform process in this case—and I will seek leave to incorporate it in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> at the conclusion of my speech—which outlines the reform process and which shows it beginning in 1989 with the Estate Mortgage collapse. Many of the people who were investors in Estate Mortgage relied on the existence of a 
 trustee to save them from losing money. Those investors, regardless of the money recovered from the trustees, lost millions upon millions of dollars. Former Attorney-General Duffy referred it to CASAC and ALRC for report.</para><para>While ALRC and CASAC were reporting into that, Australia was to witness the Aust-Wide collapse. This was yet another investment scheme where the investors, the mums and dads, had relied on the trustee being in place to secure their assets. Those who defend the existing two-tiered system would say that with the trustee in place that makes it safe. But millions upon millions of small investors' money was lost. Some of the funds were recovered seven years down the track. The schedule, which I will incorporate, shows that even though the collapse took place at the beginning of the 1990s, after ASC action against the trustees, some of the funds were recovered from the trustee, its insurers and its lawyers in September 1997. Certainly the investors would have been pleased to recover some, but I reiterate, at the risk of boring honourable senators, that millions upon millions of dollars of investors's money was lost.</para><para>That is the reason why the previous government, in the early 1990s, asked CASAC and the Law Reform Commission to look into this. That is why CASAC, the Law Reform Commission and, later, the Wallis committee, recommended a single line of responsibility for those people who get the investment dollars from the investors—that they be responsible to those investors for the investment, for complying with the investment scheme and for the custody of those assets. It was not for them to be able to say, `Sorry, the trustee is supposed to do that and if the trustee fails, bad luck' but for that single entity to be responsible for those funds.</para><para>In June 1998 the legislation is finally being debated in the parliament. There has been integrated and full consultation throughout the proposal, starting off with the release of draft legislation by Attorney-General Lavarch in December 1995, followed by consultations with me and the Treasurer throughout 1996 and 1997. There was then the release of draft 
 legislation, reference to the committee and further consultation and discussion over a period. This process will conclude, if this legislation gets through after a two-year transition period, some 11 or 12 years after the Estate Mortgage collapse.</para><para>I want to conclude this debate prior to question time, and I will try to cover the key elements raised by honourable senators. All of the investor representatives who appeared before the committee, and who have publicly commented on this legislation, have supported it almost without reservation. The Australian Shareholders Association and the Australian Consumer Association have been very vocal supporters of this legislation. If you read Peter Kell's evidence to the committee and if you look at subsequent press releases and letters written by the Australian Consumers Association—certainly not always supporters of what this government does in the financial area—you will see that they are vigorous supporters, on behalf of the shareholders and the consumers, of this legislation being passed. They believe, as the government does, that this legislation will enhance investor protection. That is why we have spent this time developing the law. That is why we have put in place the law and the structure of the single responsible entity. We have done so to protect investors. There is no other reason for it.</para><para>Senator Conroy raised the point about funding for the ASC. He has committed the opposition to a further increase in funding to the ASC, which Mr Evans will have to now put into his costings for the election campaign. He has said that we keep giving the ASC—soon to be called the ASIC—more and more responsibilities but less and less funding. The reality is that we have given the ASC more and more funding and more and more responsibility. In my contribution to the Wallis debate on the last sitting day, I went into some detail as to what that funding was, and I will not repeat it in this debate.</para><para>To say that this scheme does not offer investors choice is baloney. This scheme—the single responsible entity scheme—will offer investors far more choice than they have ever had before. At the moment, they have to have a two-tiered scheme. Under this, they can 
 have a scheme that has an independent custodian. They can have a scheme that has internal arrangements for custody. I predict that, under this scheme, the trustee organisations themselves will act as the custodian in many schemes in Australia for many years to come.</para><para>Senator Margetts, who comes from the state of Western Australia, said that this legislation was designed by the big end of town for the big end of town. I think Senator Murray may have made this point as well. The reality is that the small funds—with one or two exceptions that I know well—in Western Australia all want this legislation. I believe that Precedent Financial Services in Western Australia will have written to Senator Margetts saying, `We need this legislation.' In relation to the investor protection regime and the custody regime, the ASC has already published a detailed policy statement. They have been consulting with the trustee industry and the managed funds industry over the past six to eight weeks, and any honourable senator who wanted this could have received it from my office. I understand that I had offered full copies of this to every senator in this place.</para><para>In response to some points raised by Senator Conroy, I understand from reading the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> article from, I think, last week that Professor Carmichael, who had written a letter to the Treasurer in relation to this legislation, made it quite clear that, having read the Australian Securities Commission's policy guidelines on this legislation, he had withdrawn his opposition. I have not spoken to Professor Carmichael about this but, according to the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> article, he was comfortable with the bill and he did not see it as being inconsistent with Wallis.</para><para>This morning's <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline> makes the point that the other person who wrote a letter, Ms Linda Nicholls, was indeed a member of the board of Perpetual Trustees. The Chairman of Perpetual Trustees has made it very clear that this bill, if it passes, will reduce the income to Perpetual Trustees. For Ms Nicholls to oppose the bill is not that confusing when you see that her shareholders may reduce the income to that company if the trustee's role is reduced.</para><para>The government believes that this proposal will increase investor protection. We have been discussing a couple of amendments with the Australian Labor Party. I indicate that we regard them as acceptable to the government, and we have been working on a set of words in this regard. I think with those amendments to the bill, which has a start up date of 1 July, will see a new and much brighter era for managed investments in Australia. I commend the bill to the Senate.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para><para>Bill read a second time.</para><para>Ordered that consideration of the bill in the Committee of the Whole be made an order of the day for a later hour this day.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>REPRESENTATION OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY</title><type>Miscellaneous</type><page.no>3573</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—I inform the Senate that I have received, through the Governor-General, from the Administrator of the Northern Territory, the certificate of the choice by the Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory of Patricia Margaret Crossin to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Senator Bob Collins.

We stand behind the national gun policy and we will use every means available to us to see that the gun policy remains intact and is supported by the states. That is very clear from the action only recently taken by this government to amend the customs regulations to prohibit the importation of category C pump action semiautomatic weapons without the approval of the Commonwealth to ensure that those weapons would not be proliferating in Australia into the hands of people who were not licensed according to the national gun agreement and policy.</para><para>As to the comments allegedly made by Mr Russell of the National Party as to what would or would not happen if a minority coalition government were installed as opposed to a Labor government in Queensland, we will have to wait and see who takes government in Queensland, but Australians can be sure of this: whoever forms a govern 
 ment in Queensland will be certain of the Commonwealth government's position—that is, we fought hard to get a national gun policy; we have consistently supported it and only recently amended the customs regulations to further back it up; and we will stand firm for that policy against any state that seeks to walk away from it.</para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>3574</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Madam President, I ask a supplementary question.

 which the coalition fundamentally and completely rejects as improper, unfair, unworkable and untenable.</para></talk.start><para>The government's advice is that native title should be regarded as a property right which, certainly at the federal level, would trigger the provisions in the constitution which require that any acquisition  of property requires the Commonwealth to pay just terms compensation. That requirement is extended to the states by virtue of the operation of the Native Title Act, and this is as it should be.</para><para>Native title is and must be treated as a property right requiring full compensation for any acquisition of that property right. We have maintained those provisions in our amendments to the Native Title Act. Under our Native Title Amendment Bill, compensation on just terms is required for any non-discriminatory acquisition of native title. Certainly, with respect to Senator Chris Evans's question, the legal advice to the government is to that effect and we completely accept it.</para><para>The proposition that you can simply extinguish native title arbitrarily across the board could involve very significant compensation claims and, potentially, payments. One of the many reasons the coalition rejected the proposition that we should extinguish native title on pastoral leases following the Wik decision was that compensation could be quite significant. No-one is quite sure what appropriate just terms compensation is for the loss of native title and merely in the case of pastoral leases, which cover 40 per cent of Australia, that could be quite significant. If you were to, as the One Nation party suggests, extend extinguishment to the whole nation, involving the acquisition of what the Native Title Act treats—and, we accept, properly treats—as potentially the equivalent of freehold on vacant crown land, the compensation payments for the acquisition could be immense.

Now this is a very cruel hoax; this is simply a pea and thimble trick because the fact is there is no new money involved.

 swoop not only would you be frightening the living daylights out of the up to two million people who bought shares in the company, but you would also be removing any capacity to pay dividends.

They hate Telstra now, with a passion, to the point where they want to punish them for having the temerity to be supportive of privatisation.</para><para>What Senator Schacht told the estimates committee was effectively that Telstra senior management ought to resign because they were compromised by their support for privatisation. That is what this is about. He wants to cripple and kneecap Telstra by forcing them to spend billions and billions of dollars on something that is not in the slightest an economic or commercial proposition. It is not something that has been requested in rural and remote areas and it is not something that Mr Beazley is prepared to spend one red cent on and yet Senator Schacht, in one stroke, would remove any capacity to pay dividends.</para><para>The dividend last year was less than $1 billion. Senator Schacht is prepared to wipe many billions of dollars off the value of Telstra and remove any capacity to pay dividends. This is a hoax of the highest order. We are the party that has been prepared to spend real money, new money—$250 million for the regional telecommunications infrastructure fund. Who opposed that tooth and nail, all the way? It has been a resounding success because it has delivered services in rural and remote areas that they would not otherwise have got.</para><para>You opposed it. What about the $1.25 billion Natural Heritage Trust? You opposed that too. That was new money that came from our policy in relation to Telstra. There will not be a cracker left to spend on the bush. There will not be much left of Telstra either, and it is all because of this vicious, nasty attack led by people like Kim Il Carr who just cannot stand the prospect of a good Australian company doing well. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—I ask you to withdraw that reference to Senator Carr and refer to him by his correct name.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>LD4</name.id><name role="metadata">ALSTON</name><name role="display">Senator Alston</name></talker><para>—I will delete his nickname and substitute his correct name.</para></talk.start></interjection></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>3577</page.no><name role="metadata">Boswell, Sen Ronald</name><name role="display">Senator BOSWELL</name><name.id>YE4</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Madam President, I ask a supplementary question.

But, even on the corrected figures, the report stands as a loud condemnation of the state in which the Labor Party left our tax and social security systems. The corrected figures show that a typical single income family on $20,000 with a child in primary school and another in high school receives a total net income of $29,000. The same family, if it were earning $30,000, would only receive $30,150 in the pocket. So, for the extra $10,000 of extra work and extra pay, the family gets only $1,150 more. That is an effective marginal tax rate of 88 per cent.</para><para>Senators opposite should cringe in their seats, because they had the opportunity over 13 years to do something about it. It is your tax system that needs reforming. The Labor Party put one in place over 13 years, and it leaves battling families with marginal tax rates of 88 per cent. Let them cringe. We have already started doing something about reforming this mess, with measures like the family tax initiative, which we introduced soon after we came into government. The Institute of Chartered Accountants acknowledges this in their press release, where they have said:</para><para>There has certainly been a push by the government to redress the imbalance through both the taxation and the welfare systems. Families on $30,000 a year potentially have $27 more a week than they did last year.</para><para>So we are moving and fixing the problem, but marginal tax rates of 88 per cent are still unacceptable to this government.

It is not acceptable that in five years time average income earners will be on the top marginal tax rate of 47c in the dollar, just as today's <inline font-style="italic">Herald-Sun</inline>  has reported. It is not acceptable that toothpaste, pet food, watches and shampoo are all taxed while antiques and caviar are not. And it is definitely not acceptable that a family working harder and earning more can lose 88 per cent of their extra pay to the government. That is the mess we inherited.

Minister, going into the last election the coalition had a lot to say about its commitment to small business. Does your commitment still apply to private child-care centre owners, who are small business people, who employ some 50,000 workers in Australia? Over the past couple of weeks the Democrats have gone out and met with private child-care centre owners throughout the country. We have heard stories of centre owners being forced to lay off staff, sell their family homes and work up to 80 hours per week just to keep their businesses afloat as occupancy rates have plummeted. My question: what will the government do to 
 assist these private child-care centre owners who, with occupancy rates as low as 40 per cent, are now on the brink of going out of business?</para></talk.start></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>3584</page.no><name role="metadata">Herron, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HERRON</name><name.id>VW4</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank Senator Woodley for the question. It is true that certain child-care centre owners have run into trouble—but they have run into trouble because of the policies of the previous government. As I said in a previous answer to a question from the Labor Party representatives, or from the Democrats before, I thought they should get in touch with Senator Crowley because she was the minister responsible for bring in these changes.</para></talk.start><para>The 1997 budget allocated $270 million of ongoing funds over four years to outside school hours care; this is an increase of $11 million. Earlier this year, an extra $8 million was directed to assisting services. A total of $20 million is now being directed towards services to assist with the changeover to the new arrangements.	As I have said previously, the changeover is occurring because of the different type of funding. But the allocation of centres is entirely up to the sector that provides them; it is not the government's responsibility to guarantee their funding.</para><para>So, while there are some that are in trouble, there are others that are expanding. For example, I saw in one of this morning's papers a statement that there were closures of community based long day care centres and outside school hour care services, following the removal of the operational subsidy. It was stated in that newspaper report that 66 services have closed. However, it is a fact that places have increased under the Howard government. There were 48,785 places in June 1995 under Labor, and now there are 78,970 places in June 1997 under this government. So the number of places has actually increased.</para><para>The outside school hour care reforms assist low and middle income families, which is more important as well. The funding to services equivalent to the previous operational subsidy continues until the end of June: the sum of $20 million, as I mentioned, in restructuring and transitional assistance, including training for all services; a help line for 
 advice; and individual assistance in the form of service visits. New financial support of $4.4 million per year is provided to rural, remote and isolated services to ensure continuity of supply in these regions.</para><para>Senator Woodley should take note of this: since the 1996 budget announcement to withdraw operational subsidy from community based long day care centres, 43 have closed as at 30 April 1998; however there is a net increase of 310 centres over the same period. I will repeat that for Senator Woodley: 43 centres have closed as at 30 April 1998; however, there has been a net increase of 310 centres over the same period.</para><para>The main causes of closures were ongoing financial and utilisation difficulties and a complete lack of planning measures, as I have mentioned, by the former government. This government has introduced a new planning system to direct supply to areas of greatest need. So, inevitably, with the change to a needs base—that centres should open in areas with the greatest need—there will be some centres that have got into difficulty. The government has committed over $6 million over two years to June this year to assist community based long day care centres obtain financial and management advice. So I would suggest that those senators who are in trouble should access that advice to assist them.</para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>3584</page.no><name role="metadata">Woodley, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WOODLEY</name><name.id>HX5</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Madam President, I ask a supplementary question.

I suppose what always astonishes me so much about this particular government, and to some extent Senator Newman's views of those policies as they relate to youth allowance, is that they constantly state that they support families and they support battling families but this is not in accordance with what they are actually doing. On every occasion when they have an opportunity, this government and this Minister for Social Security in fact reduce the amount of money that is in families' pockets, and they often take the money out of the pockets of the families who are worst off.</para><para>It was interesting that the minister noted that the issue of battling families was one that was raised on a number of occasions in debate in this chamber on the youth allowance, where we discovered, much to our concern, that almost 48,000 families who are not very well-off—families earning just over $23,000—would be worse off as a result of the youth allowance bill introduced by this minister. It is interesting to me that, despite the questions that have been raised today and despite numerous matters that have been raised in this chamber before, this government seems to be unable to see that a family on $23,400 is not a family that is well-off.</para><para>I found it quite extraordinary that Senator Newman, during the debate on the youth allowance bill, told this chamber and the people of Australia that such families that had at least one adult child over the age of 18 
 years were well-off. Let me tell Senator Hill, Senator Newman and all the other senators on the other side that most people in Australia do not think that a family that earns $23,000 is well-off. In fact, most people would think that families that were earning that sort of money were really struggling. It is quite extraordinary that this government, which said during the election that they intended to look after battling families, families that were really having a hard time of it, are making it even more difficult for those families by taking away $87 per week when there is an adult child who is unemployed. That is what this youth allowance legislation does.</para><para>It seems that the rush to get this legislation through and the rush to get the information technology up might all be for nothing, because it appears, from Senator West's question and the response that was received, that there are so many problems in the computer system and in the new newstart computer platform that it seems unlikely to me that within such a short time before 1 July they will really have it operating properly. The question that was put to Senator Newman was whether the youth allowance computer system had crashed after just 90 minutes of running. I thought it was quite extraordinary that Senator Newman was unwilling or unable to answer that question. She managed to avoid it and to talk about the difficulties of the year 2000 in relation to computer programs. I am sure it is very interesting for people to discuss the issues of the millennium bug, but that was not the question that was directed to her by Senator West. What we are trying to discover is whether this government, which says it is going to introduce this new youth allowance package on 1 July, is really in a position to do so and whether the computer system that has been set up, at major cost to the government and to taxpayers, is in fact in a position to operate effectively as of 1 July.</para><para>Despite all these difficulties and the fact that the government are spending $3.8 million on telling the Australian community what a brilliant policy response they have made, they have failed to tell those families who are struggling, those earning $23,400, that many 
 of them—almost 50,000 of them—are in fact going to be worse off as a result of the youth allowance package. It seems quite extraordinary that you can expend that much money over a very short period; we were told at estimates that that $3.8 million would be spent in just one month. I think the vast majority of Australians would believe that spending that sort of money while taking $87 out of poor families' pockets is very much a waste. It appears to me that the government are spending $3.8 million on promoting themselves in order to put themselves in a better position for the election. They are spending $3.8 million of taxpayers' money to try and convince those battling families whose pockets they are grabbing money out of that, even though they are losing money, the Howard government is in fact helping them by doing so. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>3588</page.no><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator COONAN</name><name.id>2M6</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The extraordinary thing about Labor's sustained attack on the youth allowance is that it is an attack on an initiative which is actually designed to assist young people. What never fails to amaze me is why it would be suggested that we as the party in government would set out to deliberately make things more difficult for young people. It is pretty obvious that the youth allowance is actually assisting young people or else we would not have this sustained, ongoing and unjustifiable attack.</para></talk.start><para>The salient and the very good features of the youth allowance, which it is necessary to repeat once again, include the most attractive feature of it, which is that it simplifies income support arrangements for young people by combining five payments types and by reducing 13 different rates to just five. The complicated previous system that Labor had pursued left so many people falling between stools and not getting any assistance at all that it was necessary to actually look at how this youth allowance could be streamlined. It will now align both rates and qualifications for all young people up to the age of 21 and remove that incentive for young people to leave education early or to choose unemployment over education or training. It is blindingly obvious that those young people who get 
 education and training will have better opportunities to get jobs.</para><para>Parental means testing of students and unemployed people aged up to 21 will also be aligned. You have heard the minister say today that young people with the lowest income families will continue to qualify for maximum rates of assistance under the parental means test. There is nothing unfair about that. Access to rent assistance for students and for unemployed 16- to 17-year-olds who live away from home for education or employment reasons is also a significant advance under this policy. Rent assistance is also available to independent young people who live away from home. What a relief it must be for young people who are not living at home and who need rent assistance to actually have that assistance available to them. A flexible activity test allows young people to undertake a variety of activities without having to change payment type.</para><para>The abolition of the education leavers deferment period will ensure continuity of income support between leaving school and commencing full-time employment. Students will have access to a higher fortnightly income free income and an income bank of $6,000 designed to accommodate student work patterns for full-time casual employment over vacation periods. That is a significant advance compared to the old policy, under which casual employment actually disqualified people from their benefits; they went on, they went off and they did not know where they were with 13 different rates. The changed independence criteria are, of course, more lenient for students and tighter for some unemployed young people. All youth allowees will have access to the $500 loan advance currently made available under Newstart. That is a great benefit for young people.</para><para>There are many winners from the youth allowance. Of the 560,000 young people who will be covered by youth allowance, 416,000 are students and 144,000 are unemployed. Payment for 358,600 will remain unchanged and payment for 153,750 young people will increase. All young people will benefit from the simplified income support system, which provides incentives to remain in education 
 and training and which has the flexibility to cater for a variety of activities undertaken by young people in their transition from school to employment. Students not only gain from the availability of rent assistance but all under 18-year-olds who have to live away from home gain from the increased rates. This is a significant advance and a superior initiative to assist young people into employment.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>3589</page.no><name role="metadata">Gibbs, Sen Brenda</name><name role="display">Senator GIBBS</name><name.id>6L6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Senator Coonan has just told us about the wonderful things that her government is doing for people who have dealings with Centrelink. Senator Neal covered quite a lot of her question in that regard in question time. I would like to take this a little bit further with regard to Centrelink. I have had quite a lot of complaints to my office in Ipswich regarding this area. I would like the Senate to know of a couple in particular. The first is from a young man who lives in Caboolture and I would urge the minister to look at the Centrelink in Caboolture to see what can be done.</para></talk.start><para>This man had been to Centrelink at Caboolture and had seen a job on the screen that he felt he was well qualified for. First of all, he rang the number and was told to go all the way to Chermside for an interview. When he said that he lived in Caboolture and the job was also in Caboolture, he was referred to the BAVE Caboolture office. He took his qualifications and one written reference. All of his past employers had advised him that they were willing to provide verbal references whenever they were called for. He took all of his documents, about 10 pages in all, which would have gained him jobs through the CES in the past—he had used these in the past with the CES—and went along to this BAV office in Caboolture. When he presented his resume, apparently the staff member there looked down his nose at him and advised him that his resume was not good enough and that was that. I cannot believe that public servants supposedly there to help people find employment are looking down their noses and saying, `Your resume is not good enough.'</para><para>I have here another letter from a pensioner.

 1998 Queensland travel vouchers were lost. He had not received them.

Centrelink said that would not be necessary they would send me out a letter that day. Thinking I was talking to some person at the Caloundra office, the letter should be in the mail the next day. 6th May the letter arrived one week later, with Caloundra Post Box number and Caloundra Centrelink address.

Am I speaking to Caboolture or Brisbane or somewhere in Queensland?' `No,' they said. `This is the Adelaide office, but we will put you through to the Brisbane office.'</para><para>This is not funny.

The first that I would address is their criticism of the government educating members of the community and explaining the new system. Senator Neal has addressed this issue, in particular criticising 
 the government for placing some money into the budget expenditure on this very issue.</para></talk.start><para>It seems to me and to many others that it is the opposition who would be the first to criticise and the first to complain if a new system were introduced without an effort being made to explain its new aspects to the users of that system. It seems to me that they would be the first to complain if it were not appropriately tested. Senator Neal took issue with that today.</para><para>Senator Coonan addressed some of the changes which will be introduced. The most important of the changes is a simplification of income support arrangements for young Australians that combines five payment types and reduces 13 different rates to just five—that is, it simplifies the entire system for the users and the operators and enables young Australians to access the system more effectively.</para><para>As I think Senator Coonan noted, this is an initiative designed to assist young people—and let us begin there. For years and years there were complaints about the inequities in the system and the lack of incentive for young people to take up further education and training. I well remember, even in 1987, the much vaunted Priority One program of the previous government—a program that was said to be the answer to the problems of all young Australians. It was certainly decided some years later that it was not any sort of an answer—more like Priority None than Priority One.</para><para>In addressing the question of youth allowance, the government has introduced positive initiatives to assist young Australians. The Labor Party, over the 13 years it was in government in this country, had every chance to increase the standard of living of Australian students, and it simply did not do so. This is a social policy reform which is intended to make sure that young people do not see unemployment benefits as the only acceptable alternative to study. It is intended to make sure that those aged under 18 do not just go on the dole but that there is some opportunity for skills acquisition and further training. It is all about incentive. No matter which way you look at it, for years and years the inequity 
 between payments for Austudy and for unemployment benefits simply resulted in young people making the easier decision and choosing unemployment benefits rather than pursuing further education and training. It is this issue which the government has addressed with the changes to the youth allowance system.</para><para>Let us look at issues like rent assistance. Young students from country areas in particular were not able to pursue an education because their low to even middle income parents could not afford to send them away. As the minister said in her second reading speech, there is now an opportunity for families, especially those with several children, to be able to afford to send their young people away for further education largely because of the availability of rent assistance which makes a real difference. They have a chance of getting skills; they have a chance of getting an education.</para><para>This is merely one aspect of the government's initiatives in this area. I have spent months and months in various regional parts of New South Wales looking at government initiatives in relation to young people, particularly work for the dole, where young people have finally found some incentive and some initiative to participate in schemes and programs such as this. These are not programs that just shift numbers around as they were under the previous government—statistically convenient, yes, but in reality doing nothing for the young Australians they were supposed to benefit.</para><para>What we are doing in the initiatives under the youth allowance changes is making it clear that those young people, particularly under the age of 18, should focus—and so should their families—on what is valuable from training and education. Academic education, yes; vocational training, as the minister has previously said, yes. It is all about leading to jobs and to greater opportunities for people to participate in the work force. It is all about assisting young people and providing a focus for their activities when there are difficulties in other areas. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>3590</page.no><name role="metadata">Denman, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator DENMAN</name><name.id>FY5</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I also want to address the issue of

It is frightening for her to go to her bank and find nothing has been paid in.</para><para>Another case has come to my office of a woman who was caring for her pensioner husband. She lived out in the country, outside Devonport. Her husband was taken ill and hospitalised. She moved into town at the time of his hospitalisation and he passed on. She is a woman of 60 or 61. She stayed in town to make his funeral arrangements and those sorts of things. She went to Centrelink to tell them of the change in her circumstances. She was told to fill in documents, which she did. She was told to wait in a queue. She waited two hours under very stressful circumstances, because her husband had just died. Six weeks later she has had no acknowledgment of her application for assistance. She is still waiting to hear what Centrelink are going to do to try to resolve her situation.</para><para>Those sorts of cases are very difficult. They should not be happening.

Certainly in the area where I live it has not been ironed out. Hopefully, it will be addressed and addressed soon.</para><para>The CPSU put out a media release in March warning that this new computer system would fail and that staffing levels should be maintained.

His son, Terry Cameron, is someone with whom I have had an association in the Labor Party. He is currently a member of the Legislative Council in the state of South Australia.

I think many people know that Don Cameron and the Cameron family have been very close friends of mine. I had a lot to do with Don Cameron in particular over a number of years. It is with sadness today that I note his passing, not because he has not had a long life—84 years is a very long, and in Don's case, a very productive life in a whole range of different ways—but because I guess the moment has come now when we here in this chamber remember someone who once served in here and indeed went on for another 20 years of life and service to the community and the Labor Party. Particularly in the last 10 years or so, I think the advice he gave to many new members both in state and federal politics was very useful.</para></talk.start><para>Don Cameron did not have the flamboyance of Clyde. Clyde, whom we all know, has featured both in television programs of the era and in many publications. But make no bones about the fact that Clyde would be the first person to say that much of what he did was possible only because his brother played a significant and key role in the trade union movement in South Australia.</para><para>Indeed, Don was a very selfless man. Don did not seek high office. Don did not seek anything for himself. What Don sought was the betterment of his members, firstly, and, secondly, to look after the underdog, whoever 
 that may be. He did that in his union service, he did that in his parliamentary service, he did that in every part of his life.</para><para>Don was instrumental not only in Clyde's career but in the careers of a few others as well. I well remember the late Mick Young telling me a story that he turned up in Broken Hill when Don Cameron was a shearer at that time—and he spent quite a lot of his life as a shearer. Mick, at the age of 18, had just shown the older hands how to shear a sheep and Don Cameron immediately recognised Mick's greatness—but not for shearing a sheep. He said, `Mick, I think you ought to be going into the union office. It is probably not a good idea for you to stay a shearer here much longer.' The tally was getting too low. In many respects Don started Mick's career in the union movement and eventually in politics.</para><para>Don was elected as the Secretary of the AWU in 1964. It was an election that was fraught with controversy. In fact, there was eastern states intervention in the union. Don found himself literally out of work in November 1964, with two young kids to feed. Indeed, it was a long legal battle before the democratic right and the democratic tradition of the AWU was upheld in the courts some nine months later. I draw this to the attention of the Senate here today because Don Cameron, at that time, had to literally go out and get whatever work he could get. He was out on a broom for something like nine months to feed his wife and kids while the court case was going on—and Don never wavered. Don was there and his friends, Mick Young and Jack Wright—who were other officials in this union—and many of the other people who had been very important in the Labor Party in the 1970s and the 1980s, were at Don's side.</para><para>The advocate for Don's cause, Dame Roma Mitchell, who also went on to other things, took a very close interest. Eventually the case was won and Don was reinstated as the divisional secretary in South Australia. Dame Roma never lost interest in these fellows. When Keith Plunkett died some two years or so ago now—he was another one of Don's contemporaries—Dame Roma went to the 
 funeral and said she wanted to mark the passing of one of her boys.</para><para>When Don Cameron came into this place I think he was one of the last senators to face a state wide by-election, which is the way replacements were found. He served here until 1978. He never sought for himself high office because he did not have the ego that demanded that particular thing. Don wanted to serve his constituents as best he could. Don did serve his constituents the best way he knew how.</para><para>Don was an intensely private man who had party contacts right up until the very end. Sadly, in the last two years his health declined to such a point that he could not go outside his own house. Every couple of weeks he would roll up on a Friday to a restaurant in Adelaide's Chinatown that many in Labor politics in South Australia go to, but for the last two years he has been unable to do that. There were many times when we hoped that his health would improve, but unfortunately it went down further and further and it became impossible for him to have any quality of life. I hosted a dinner for him in that same restaurant on the occasion of his 80th birthday four years ago—it seems that time has flown.</para><para>There are many people in South Australia—many members of the Labor Party—who have a great deal of respect for Don and would like those remarks put on the public record here today. Indeed, Don Cameron was a person who quite openly would give advice to people. In fact I noticed, in looking through his parliamentary records, that when he was retiring a number of senators made note of the fact that Don Cameron was more of a friend to them than anything else. One of those, of course, was ex-Senator Neville Bonner, who made the comment about Don Cameron that had it not been for him he would have found the transition into the Senate very difficult indeed. Don went out of his way, in the words of ex-Senator Bonner, to make sure that he felt at home here and showed him the ropes in the first critical few months of his service to the Senate.</para><para>Don Cameron is survived by his wife of over 50 years, Colleen, his son Terry Cameron, who is a Legislative Councillor, 
 and his other son Barry. They and Clyde and Doris and other close members of the family all said goodbye to Don at a private ceremony the other week. Don left instructions that he was to be privately cremated with only close family at that particular service because it was not in Don's nature that he would want it otherwise.</para><para> I am sad at the loss of a friend and confidant. I would be remiss in not saying here that the last time this man took part in any Labor Party activity was to come to the preselection convention—he was very ill at the time—on 8 May last year and cast his vote for me.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>3595</page.no><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator SCHACHT</name><name.id>4J4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on the condolence motion for the passing of Don Cameron. I suspect I may be one of the few senators who were aware of Don when he was secretary of the AWU in South Australia in the mid to late 1960s when I was first active in the Labor Party and certainly when I became an organiser in the party in 1969.</para></talk.start><para>As Senator Quirke has mentioned, Don Cameron was elected to a casual vacancy in the Senate created by the passing of a senator. In those days, at the first opportunity for a statewide election—if the House of Representatives election was out of sync with the Senate election—an election would take place. At the 1969 federal election, which was a House of Representatives election with no Senate election, the vacancy could be voted on and Don Cameron had already been selected as the Labor Party half-Senate candidate. As a non-sitting candidate, he was our candidate for that by-election, if you could call it that, and he beat another Cameron—Martin Cameron—in that ballot. Martin Cameron is the present president of the Liberal Party in South Australia who, after being defeated by Don because he had been appointed to the vacancy, went on to become a Legislative Councillor, a founding member of the Liberal movement in South Australia,  and is now president of the South Australian Liberal Party. Don beat him in that 1969 election.</para><para>I remember it well. It was the first election I was involved in as a party official when the 
 Labor Party two-party preferred vote in South Australia at a federal election reached something like 54 per cent and we won five seats from the Liberal Party. Don came into the Senate at that time and, to my surprise I must say—and many of us tried to talk him out of it—he decided to retire in 1978 after barely nine years in the Senate. Many of us were quite surprised that he chose to retire after what was a relatively short period in the Senate. He certainly had the support of the party to continue for a longer period, if he had so chosen. But that, as Senator Quirke has said, was typical of Don Cameron; he did not seek the limelight for himself, though all of us who knew him realised he was a figure of considerable substance and calibre within the Labor movement in South Australia, both as a trade unionist and as a member of the Labor Party.</para><para>Don Cameron provided quiet advice to many of us who were much younger than him in those days. That advice would always be about the morality, the ethics and the consistency of what one should believe in. That was certainly Don's role and he had an influence much greater than most would believe. It is true that in a most celebrated case in AWU history Don won election as secretary, then was sacked by the then federal secretary of the Labor Party, Tom Dougherty. That was taken to the court. Roma Mitchell was the defender, as Senator Quirke said, of Don Cameron and the others who were sacked at that time. The court upheld the case that they should be reinstated.</para><para>In the group that Senator Quirk has mentioned there was Reg Groth, who went on to become state member for Salisbury for a decade in the Dunstan years; Jimmy Dunford, who went on to become secretary of the AWU and ultimately a member of the Legislative Council in South Australia and who, sadly, died in office in the early 1980s; Alan Beggs, who went on to become secretary of the AWU in South Australia; Jack Wright, who was Don Cameron's successor as state secretary of the AWU and who then became a member of the parliament in South Australia; and, ultimately, Deputy Prime Minister in the Bannon Labor government. There were a 
 number of others, such as Keith Plunkett. I do not think Keith was actually sacked by Tom Dougherty in those days because I do not think he had been appointed or elected as an official, but he certainly was an activist.	I may have missed some other names in that celebrated group—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZS6</name.id><name role="metadata">QUIRKE</name><name role="display">Senator Quirke</name></talker><para>—Mick Young.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>4J4</name.id><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator SCHACHT</name></talker><para>—Mick Young wasn't actually sacked. Mick had already just been elected before the sacking to be the state organiser of the Labor Party in South Australia. Though socially and politically he was very close to them, he had already just moved on from being the AWU organiser at Port Pirie to be the ALP organiser, and we know of Mick's celebrated career in the Labor Party since that time.</para></talk.start></continue><para>One cannot underestimate the success that Don Cameron and that team of people had in the AWU in South Australia in creating a climate for the Dunstan decade of the 1970s. Don Cameron was a very strong supporter of Don Dunstan and the many radical reforms that Don Dunstan introduced and put into place in the Labor Party in the famous Dunstan decade. Though Don Cameron had in every way a classic working class background, he certainly supported Don on many of the wider social and reform issues that he introduced in South Australia. That was a very important base for the success of the Labor Party in that period. Though Don Cameron is not given much credit, he should be given a lot of credit for it. As one who was an official in the Labor Party in the Dunstan decade, I know the role that Don played in the late 1960s and then in the early 1970s as one of those influential figures.</para><para>When I worked for the Whitlam government for a period of time with Senator Bishop, who was a close colleague of Don Cameron's, I had plenty of opportunity to see the work that Don did in the Senate during that period. Don's advice, balance and comment were always sound at a time when, to the say the least, the Whitlam government was providing some pretty exciting times and opportunities. Again, Don Cameron always supported those who were in favour of reform, whether it was economic or social. 
 Though he might not get the credit that he should have got for the Dunstan decade, he was an important figure behind the scenes in the Whitlam period.</para><para>As I said earlier in my remarks, many of us were very surprised that Don chose to retire from the Senate in 1978. I agree with Senator Quirk that Don Cameron continued to have an intense interest in the Labor Party and the labour movement. If one had to say about Don what would he like to be remembered for, there is no doubt that he would like to be remembered as an outstanding trade union official and secretary of the AWU, representing the workers and their interests, particularly low paid and semi-skilled workers, which overwhelmingly AWU members were in those days and still are.</para><para>I remember being a very green 22-year-old state organiser for the Labor Party in the 1969 federal campaign and then in the 1970s state campaign that began the Dunstan decade and being taken by Don to the Riverland of South Australia to speak at factory gate meetings, if you could call them that, that in fact were under an orange tree outside a packing shed or a cannery, and to talk to workers about those issues that we were promoting at the election. The way Don handled himself in talking—using simple but effective language—to ordinary people about the issues of the day was a real lesson to me about how to communicate. I have to say, he did it better than most. His record in the Labor Party in South Australia, in the Trades and Labour Council in South Australia and in the trade union movement is very significant.</para><para>It was with considerable sorrow that I heard of his passing. I pass on to his wife and family, Terry and Barry, my sincere condolences and also the fact that in my very young days in the Labor Party Don Cameron had an influence on my involvement in the labour movement beyond most others. For that I am eternally grateful.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>3597</page.no><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name><name.id>RF4</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I too wish to pay tribute to Don Cameron in speaking to this condolence motion. I did not know Don Cameron very much as a senator, I have to say. I did 
 know him as a union official. He was one of the first union officials I encountered when I started work as an industrial officer for the Clerks Union in South Australia in 1967. He was then President of the Australian Labor Party and continued as President of the ALP for at least another year.</para></talk.start><para>Don Cameron was an outstanding figure, as we have heard from my colleagues Senator Quirk, Senator Schacht and Senator Faulkner, in the South Australian union movement. He was, as the record shows, a long time secretary of the AWU. What the record does not show is that he held that position with considerable distinction and great admiration and respect were accorded to him by the rank and file members of that organisation. He was in many respects a union official of the old school, who held the rank and file point of view on all points in an argument and who saw it as his role to represent that point of view as fully, as frankly and as openly as he could. He did that to considerable effect.</para><para>I know that he was associated with the people in South Australia who were the luminaries of the AWU at the time—people such as Mick Young. A number of the names have been mentioned here today. There was Jack Wright, Jimmy Dunford and Alan Beggs. I remember particularly the industrial officers of the AWU at the time, such as Ernie Grimes. For a time John Bannon was an industrial officer of the AWU and Barry Kavanagh was also an industrial officer of the AWU at the time.</para><para>The AWU and the clerks union did have one thing in common. In the late 1960s South Australia was a state with more federal awards than state awards. The industrial organisations that had state awards were in fact the AWU, which was the biggest union as far as the state Industrial Relations Commission was concerned, the shop assistants' union and the clerks union. So often I found myself in consultation with their industrial officers on how matters could best be dealt with by the state industrial commission.</para><para>It was in this time that four weeks annual leave came in and when annual leave loading was deliberated upon and awarded by the commission. It was in this time, too, that 
 equal pay for work of equal value was first awarded by the federal industrial commission and these standards had to be converted into standards within the state jurisdictions as well. The AWU was a leading union in ensuring that no worker in South Australia was left behind and, in fact if at all possible, led the field this these matters nationally.</para><para>During all of that the eminence of Don Cameron permeated the scene. I have not had as close a relationship with him politically as my colleagues who have spoken in this debate, but I value what I thought was a generous and open friendship that he offered to me as a young industrial officer. He did so with a degree of decency and, I might say, sincerity that I have not really encountered very much in my political and industrial life. They were the hallmarks of Don Cameron. He was basically a very decent person and a very genuine Australian.</para><para>He was someone who always expressed, in whatever discussion he was involved in, true working class values. In the period of time in which he was an eminent figure in the labour movement he was a person best classed as a true progressive; someone interested in progressive reform at all times.</para><para>He was the president of the party at the time when the long run of the Playford government in South Australia came to an end and Frank Walsh became the first Labor Premier after Playford, followed by Don Dunstan. He presided as a strong figure in making sure that the ALP and the union movement was steered along sensible courses at a time in which massive change was occurring and a huge alteration in social values was occurring, too.</para><para>That was the role he played in my experience during the period of Whitlam government when his elder brother, Clyde Cameron, was a distinguished minister. Don would sometimes worry too much about issues. He always struck me as someone who was concerned to come to grips with what was really happening, get through all of the screen of the language, come to the kernel of the matter and see how it related to the working class values that he held. He would worry away at a problem until he got to that under 
 standing. Then, when he got there, he would be a very eloquent spokesman for the interests of the people he represented, and usually that was the rank and file members of the AWU. I feel frankly that I am a bit privileged to be able to convey my condolences to such a great Australian.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>3598</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Senator Bolkus did wish to be associated with this condolence motion.

Under current arrangements the only avenue open to an interested party seeking a review of a final finding is to institute proceedings in the Federal Court.</para><para>The Industry Task Force on Anti-Dumping, an informal grouping of major manufacturers and related associations, has expressed its strong support for the changes. The Task Force noted that the prompt implementation of the changes would remove the present uncertainty surrounding the administration of investigations, which has discouraged or delayed significant investment decisions to the detriment of the efficiency and competitiveness of Australian industry.</para><para>Introduction and passage of this package of legislation during the 1998 Winter sittings is desirable as it will ensure that the new amendments can begin by the scheduled commencement date of 1 July 1998 to the benefit of Australian industry. 
</para><para>(Circulated by authority of the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs)</para><para>DATA-MATCHING PROGRAM (ASSISTANCE AND TAX) AMENDMENT BILL 1998</para><para>The proposed Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Amendment Bill 1998 will remove the existing sunset clause in the Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Act 1990.</para><para>The Bill needs to be introduced and passed in the 1998 Winter Sittings as the current sunset clause takes effect on 22 January 1999 and, if it were to come into effect, data-matching activities which help ensure the integrity of the social security system would have to be discontinued. This would result in a substantial negative impact on the forward estimates. Therefore, it is important to ensure that the Parliament considers the future of the data-matching program in 1998.</para><para>(Circulated by the authority of the Minister for Social Security)</para><para>NATIONAL FIREARMS PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION BILL 1998</para><para>At its meetings of 10 May 1996, 17 July 1996 and 15 November 1996, the Australasian Police Ministers' Council (APMC) resolved that there be uniform national controls on firearms. The APMC also decided that there should be a buyback of prohibited firearms during an amnesty period of twelve months. The buyback was funded through an additional medicare levy. Compensation was paid by the States, the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory, which were then reimbursed by the Commonwealth for compensation paid out and for some of the administrative costs associated with the buyback.</para><para>Norfolk Island has almost finalised its legislation to bring it into line with the APMC resolutions. The National Firearms Program Implementation Bill 1998 will make provision for the Commonwealth to fund that buyback out of remaining medicare levy funds in the same way as it did the States and mainland territories.</para><para>The Bill will also deal with the position on Christmas Island and Cocos (Keeling) Islands. While it is thought that there may be few or no prohibited weapons on these islands, provision needs to be made for an amnesty period and a buyback by the Commonwealth.</para><para>The Bill is urgent because there should be provision for reimbursement by the Commonwealth before the Norfolk Island Administration starts making compensation payments for guns handed in. The amnesty period should commence in all three 
 territories as soon as possible so that prohibited firearms do not remain in the community for any longer than necessary.</para><para>(Circulated by authority of the Minister for Justice)</para><para>PASSENGER MOVEMENT CHARGE AMENDMENT BILL 1998</para><para>The main purpose of this Bill is to amend the Passenger Movement Charge Act 1978 to increase the charge from $27 to $30 with effect from 1 January 1999.</para><para>The $3 increase was announced in the 1998-99 Budget.</para><para>In most cases, the charge is collected on behalf of the Commonwealth by international airlines at the time of sale of tickets for departures from Australia, in accordance with arrangements entered into under section 10 of the Passenger Movement Charge Collection Act 1978. It is not uncommon for such tickets to be sold up to 12 months in advance of the intended departure date. In order for airlines to be able to collect the increased amount on tickets sold between 1 July 1998 and 1 January 1999, for post 1 January 1999 departures, it is necessary that the amendments, with appropriate transitional arrangements, be in place before 1 July 1998.</para><para>(Circulated by authority of the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs)</para><para>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT (FARM MANAGEMENT DEPOSITS) BILL 1998</para><para>Purpose</para><para>The proposed Bill implements the new Farm Management Deposit (FMD) Scheme announced in the Agriculture—Advancing Australia package. It replaces and/or amends a number of Acts, in particular the Loan (Income Equalisation Deposits) Act 1976 and the Income Tax assessment Act 1936.</para><para>The FMD Scheme will commercialise and modify the existing Income Equalisation Deposit (IED) and Farm Management Bond (FMB) schemes.</para><para>Reasons for urgency</para><para>Introduction and passage of the Bill in the 1998 Winter Sittings is sought to provide certainty to financial markets that an investment product and risk management tool will be available.</para><para>The FMD Scheme is a key plank of the Agriculture—Advancing Australia packages It progresses agricultural policy by providing a mechanism for enhancing farmers' ability to manage risk and be financially self-reliant. 
</para><para>Under the legislative changes the prior IED and FMB Schemes will be made more commercially attractive and accessible for primary producers. The proposed amendments have the support of the financial community and rural sector. Expectations are high that the FMD Scheme will be available for the next financial year (1998-99). The FMD Scheme is a taxation based tool and uncertainty for potential investors will be increased if the Bill is not passed prior to the commencement of the taxation year.</para><para>The Department currently holds deposits in trust for approximately 9,500 clients in the IED and FMB Schemes. When the FMD Scheme commences these funds will have to be either withdrawn or transferred to financial institutions depending on the wishes of the individual client. Transfer and clarity for depositors would be simplified if notification could occur in line with a financial year changeover. Introduction and passage should occur prior to 30 June 1998 to allow notification of changes to depositors so transfers to the FMD Scheme could be mate for the 1998-99 financial year.</para><para>Effect of not passing</para><para>Delaying the passage of the proposed Bill until the Spring sittings would create uncertainty for farmers' investment decisions in the 1998-99 financial year and reduce their ability to achieve self-reliance in managing risk It would also make uncertain conversion of existing IED deposits to FMD deposits for the 1998-99 financial year. It may create difficulties for financial institutions and rural stakeholders who have provided considerable assistance in the development of this mechanism.</para><para>(Circulated by authority of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy)</para><para>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT (LANDCARE AND WATER FACILITY TAX OFFSET) BILL 1998</para><para>Purpose of the proposed Bill:</para><para>This measure will implement the Government's election commitment that a rebate may be claimed for expenditure incurred on the prevention of land degradation.</para><para>The Bill contains the measure giving effect to an announcement made on 1 July 1997 by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy.</para><para>Reasons for urgency:</para><para>The Minister announced that expenditure incurred after 30 June 1997 would be eligible for the rebate. To give effect to this policy for the 1997-98 income year. the Australian Taxation Office needs the law to be in place as soon as possible before the end of this financial year.</para><para>Result if Bill not dealt with in these sittings: 
</para><para>The measure will not be implemented in the time frame announced by the Government if the Bill is not passed during the 1998 Winter sitting period. Until legislation is in place, taxpayers will be uncertain about the intended operation of the law. The costs of administering the measure will increase with any delay in implementation.</para><para>(Circulated by authority of the Treasurer)</para><para>WHEAT MARKETING LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1998</para><para>The purpose of the proposed bill is to implement the final stage in the restructure of the Australian Wheat Board (AWB) as a grower owned company from 1 July 1999. The first stage of this process, to allow the AWB to conduct its activities through wholly owned Corporations Law companies, was implemented by amendments to the Wheat Marketing Act 1989 last year. At that time the importance of a two stage approach to the restructure was accepted by the Senate and the need for further legislation was foreshadowed.</para><para>The proposed bill will terminate statutory marketing arrangements for wheat from 1 July 1999. A small statutory body will continue to undertake the AWB's current functions for the administration of wheat export controls. Ownership and control of a successor company to the AWB, to undertake the AWB's marketing and financing functions, will be passed to wheatgrowers by the issue of A Class shares and the conversion of equity in the Wheat Industry Fund (WIF) to B Class shares.</para><para>Introduction and passage for the Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill 1998 in the 1998 Winter Sittings is being sought to provide certainty to financial markets about the longer term changes to the AWB.</para><para>Under the legislative changes agreed to last year the AWB's wholly owned subsidiary will have the opportunity to develop a track record and identity as a fully commercial (rather than a Government-backed body) and achieve a credit rating to enable it to operate after Government underwriting is withdrawn on 1 July 1999. The sooner that the future conversion of the AWB's subsidiary into a grower owned Corporations Law company is settled in legislation, the more likely it is that the company will be accepted by financial markets.</para><para>The AWB is one of Australia's largest borrowers on short term markets to finance advance and related payments for pool wheat delivered to it, and it is essential that the new grower company's access to funds for these purposes is not put in jeopardy. Legislation which clearly establishes the capital base of the new company as shares from the conversion of the WIF will remove any doubt that the WIF capital could be dissipated. This should 
 build up the confidence of lenders dealing with the grower company.</para><para>Delaying passage of the proposed bill until the 1998 Spring Sittings could place unnecessary uncertainty over the final stage of privatisation which would be unsatisfactory from a commercial point of view.</para><para>(Circulated with the Authority of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy)</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>National Competition Policy</title><page.no>3603</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>3603</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I give notice that, on the next day of sitting, I shall move:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	 That the Senate notes:</para><para>	 (a)	 the observation expressed in the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Financial Institutions and Public Administration entitled <inline font-style="italic">Cultivating Competition: Inquiry into aspects of the National Competition Policy Reform Package</inline> , that there has been no major analysis of the broader socio-economic costs of the National Competition Policy; and</para><para>	 (b)	 that many voters in the 1998 Queensland election indicated that they were disillusioned with the unquestioning push by the major parties for economic reforms such as National Competition Policy without considering the broader impacts of such changes.</para><para>(2)	 That a select committee, to be known as the Select Committee on the Socio-Economic Consequences of the National Competition Policy, be appointed to inquire into and report, on or before the first sitting day in 1999, on the following matters:</para><para>	 (a)	 the broader socio-economic consequences, including costs, of the National Competition Policy, as implemented by the <inline font-style="italic">Competition Policy Reform Act 1995</inline> , including, but not limited to, the impact of the policy on:</para><para>		 (i)	 unemployment,</para><para>		 (ii)	 changed working conditions,</para><para>		 (iii)	 social welfare,</para><para>		 (iv)	 equity,</para><para>		 (v)	 social dislocation, and</para><para>		 (vi)	 environmental impacts; and</para><para>	 (b)	 the relative effect and variation in impact of the National Competition Policy on urban and rural and regional communities.</para><para>(3)	 That the committee consist of 7 senators, 3 nominated by the Leader of the Government

I do not think the patronising is particularly appreciated.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>7E4</name.id><name role="metadata">VANSTONE</name><name role="display">Senator Vanstone</name></talker><para>—That is why you were rung, Senator.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>3610</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts Legislation Committee</title><page.no>3610</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Extension of Time</title><page.no>3610</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Chee</inline>, at the request of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Patterson</inline>)—by leave—agreed to:</para><para>That the time for the presentation of the report of the Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts Legislation Committee on the provisions of the <inline ref="r514">Datacasting Charge (Imposition) Bill 1998</inline>  and a related bill be extended to 23 June 1998.</para></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ORDER OF BUSINESS</title><type>Business</type><page.no>3610</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Education: Questions and Reports</title><page.no>3610</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chris Evans</inline>, at the request of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carr</inline>) agreed to:</para><para>That general business notice of motion No. 1073 standing in the name of Senator Carr for today, relating to the Government's response to a question asked at an estimates hearing, be postponed till 5 sitting days after today.</para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>3610</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Rural and Regional Affairs Legislation Committee</title><page.no>3610</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Extension of Time</title><page.no>3610</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Chee</inline>, at the request of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crane</inline>)—by leave—agreed to:</para><para>That the time for the presentation of the report of the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee on the provisions of the <inline ref="r413">Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1997</inline>  be extended until 23 June 1998.</para></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Rural and Regional Affairs References Committee</title><page.no>3610</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Extension of Time</title><page.no>3610</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Woodley</inline>)—by leave—agreed to:</para><para>That the time for the presentation of the report of the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee on the commercial utilisation of native wildlife be extended to 30 June 1998; and the report on the effects of pricing and slot management arrangements at Kingsford Smith Airport be extended until 12 August 1998.</para></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ORDER OF BUSINESS</title><type>Business</type><page.no>3610</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Consideration of Legislation</title><page.no>3610</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown</inline>) agreed to:</para><para>That general business notice of motion No. 1158 standing in the name of Senator Brown for today, relating to the introduction of the Constitution Alteration (Right to Stand for Parliament—Qualification of Members and Candidates) Bill 1998, be postponed till 24 June 1998.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Australian Electoral Commission</title><title>Election of Senators</title><page.no>3610</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chris Evans</inline>, at the request of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Faulkner</inline>) agreed to:</para><para>That general business notice of motion No. 1089 (relating to the definition of associated entities in the Commonwealth Electoral Act) and No. 1121 (the division of senators into two classes for the purposes of rotation) standing in the name of Senator Faulkner for today, be postponed till 24 June 1998.

It has been mentioned that, up to the date of printing, there had been 792 submissions, making it an inquiry that has had more immediate submissions than many others, considering the time that was available. There are obviously some very strong statements that are coming out in relation to this report, but there are probably many more questions that are raised in the statements. It states: </para><para>Finally we note the assurance given by the Senate on 31 March 1998 by the Assistant Treasurer, Senator the Hon. Rod Kemp, that the government will not sign the agreement unless it is satisfied that it is in the national interest to do so.</para><para>It says:</para><para>In summary, there are both misconceptions and misleading material circulating about the nature and the effect of the MAI, some of which is reflected in the submissions received to date.</para><para>I guess that statement in section 1.65 reflects the press release that the chair put out before hearing evidence from the inquiry.</para><para>Not a lot will happen as a result of this report unless there is some means by which the government can change its own negotiating stance, and is prepared to change its negotiating stance and listen to what the public is saying about public interest. If there is no means for or no intention of the government to change its negotiating stance in relation to the multilateral agreement on investment then this report, thin as it is, will not be worth the paper it is written on.</para><para>Generally governments are required to look for a response within, say, three months of a report like this being written. That would put us just prior to the next time Australia will be asked to sign the agreement. I would obviously be looking for a quick response, if possible, from the government to the concerns that have been handled here. But, as I said, this may not be worth the paper it is written on; it may simply be a pre-election exercise by both major parties if there is no actual means, ability or political will to change anything in Australia's negotiating stance on the multilateral agreement on investment.</para><para>Many of the concerns expressed were that Australia's stated position was not in the national interest, that what was left out of the multilateral agreement on investment in terms of exemptions left very large gaps, including environmental standards, wages and conditions, and human rights objectives.</para><para>If nothing changes in Australia's negotiating position, all the nice words in the world from this committee or any other committee will not change that situation which is causing a great deal of concern throughout local governments and many regional and rural communi 
 ties in Australia. The question that needs to be answered, and answered as quickly as possible, is: has the government actually heard the concerns? If it has actually heard, is there any willingness whatsoever to change Australia's negotiating stance? If the answer is yes, let us hear that answer quickly. Let us find out what role Australia might play in the future. If the answer is no, then the honest thing for the government to do before the election is to say so, and the rest of the community can act accordingly.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT ISLANDER HERITAGE PROTECTION BILL 1998</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>3613</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Report of Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund Committee</title><page.no>3613</page.no></subdebateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>UNKNOWN</name.id><name role="metadata">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Watson)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Watson)</name></talker><para>—Pursuant to standing order 38, I present the 12th report of the Joint Standing Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund entitled <inline font-style="italic">The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Bill 1998</inline> , together with submissions and the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>  record of the proceedings which were presented to the President on 1 June 1998.

However, this particular report and the hearings which preceded it attracted a great deal of controversy.</para><para>I rise today to disassociate the Australian Democrats with this report, except in so far as our dissent is represented in the minority view. Although there presently exists only one member of the parliament who belongs to that organisation—I think an organisation which all Australians ought to despise—known as One Nation, the average Australian punter 
 could be forgiven for thinking that this report is indeed a One Nation policy document. Let me put it on the record that One Nation policy as it stands would abolish ATSIC and force indigenous communities to use mainstream services. It would extinguish native title and reinvigorate those policies that led to the near complete genocide of one of the most ancient civilisations on this planet.</para><para>Let there be no mistake: one of the tools of genocide is the destruction of elements of culturally significant places and artefacts so that people are isolated and alienated from those places. Surely after 210 years, and the decimation that has been visited upon Aboriginal and Torres Strait Australians, it is time now to say `enough'—enough of the destruction of rock paintings, enough of the forced removal of children from their families, enough of the paternalistic values and policies which choose not to see the pain of others and enough of the racially based arrogance that says white people simply know best. If history has shown us anything, it is that indigenous people and their cultures have suffered as a consequence of disrespect and ignorance. Surely it is time—in 1998—to say enough.</para><para>The reason why this is such a bad report is because the government members are in the majority. The report merely reflects their continuing contempt towards the indigenous people of this land and, I might say, to 99 per cent of the evidence presented to them in the two very quick hearings which were held in Melbourne and Canberra. The refusal of the government to hold hearings anywhere else except in Melbourne and Canberra once again says something about those two particular places and one other capital in Australia. Those of us who live outside of that particular triangle often have to make this complaint.</para><para>No-one in this parliament says that heritage protection legislation is not in need of reform, and the government certainly admits that. The 1984 act has, at almost every turn, been shown to be inadequate. However, I believe that most Australians would be aghast to know that no effective Commonwealth legislation is in existence to protect the culturally important and significant sites of indigenous 
 people. It is very difficult to fathom that almost no act of the Commonwealth parliament has been effective in protecting the ancient and precious heritage of Torres Strait Islanders and Aborigines. What is even more difficult to fathom is that the present government, by the presentation of the bill—the basis of which forms the substance of the report—fails to protect heritage.</para><para>The states and territories of this land have not covered themselves in glory in their dealings with indigenous people. In fact, not to understate the matter, they have been directly responsible for implementing many atrocities in the past. During the Wik debate, I put on the record many of those incidents. They are not something that happened 200 years ago or 210 years ago as people like to say; they are incidents which have occurred right up to the present day. The incompetence of the states and territories was tacitly recognised in 1967 when, in the most successful referendum in the history of this nation, the people of Australia voted to give power to the Commonwealth in the area of indigenous affairs. It is lamentable that that power has insufficiently been utilised to improve the lot of our most impoverished people.</para><para>Despite this momentous change in the constitution, the coalition government has argued in this parliament and the courts that, if it chooses, it should be able to make laws to the detriment of Australia's indigenous people. Government members actually argued it during the committee hearings into the native title Wik bill. They argued it in the Senate and in the House of Representatives, and the government argued it before the High Court during the Hindmarsh Island bridge case. Who will ever forget the anti-contribution made by Senator Lightfoot in his first speech in this place? He said:</para><para>I, in effect, said that Aboriginal people in their native state were the lowest colour on the civilised spectrum.</para><para>At the beginning of this contribution I made specific reference to the policies of the Liberal and National parties and how, in effect, they derive from the same philosophical position as One Nation. Let me underline that this is a sad falling away from a party which, 
 under Malcolm Fraser, moved the Northern Territory land rights legislation and had it passed into law. How far that coalition has come from those days. As we heard today in question time, some coalition senators have expressed that they would prefer to work with One Nation in the Senate than either the Greens or the Australian Democrats. Well, that speaks volumes.</para><para>Despite our proud 21-year history of defending the rights of ordinary Australians, despite the fact that since the Democrats first took their seats in this place in 1977 supply has been guaranteed to both Liberal and Labor governments, and despite the fact that it was the Australian Democrats which moved the first legislation to save the Franklin Dam and that it was the Australian Democrats that helped to stymie the introduction of the Australia Card, some Liberal senators would prefer to work with Australia's first experience of a fascist political party. I say that not in a pejorative way but in an absolutely technical description. That does speak volumes.</para><para>In closing, in dissociating ourselves from this report the Australian Democrats do not divest themselves of what we consider to be the national responsibility to protect all Australian heritage, but particularly Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. We will work with the non-racist parties in this Senate to make that possibility a reality and to fulfil the report that Justice Evatt did for the government, on their behalf, on this very matter and which the government then ignored in its bill and in this report. I am ashamed that a federal government in this country should bring down such a discriminatory report and a bill which is so inadequate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>3614</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I will speak briefly in relation to the Native Title and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund Committee's report on the <inline ref="r483">Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Bill 1998</inline> . I was able to sit in on one hearing. Not being a member of the committee, I could not be a participating member of this committee. However, I was greatly concerned about the way the committee was going about its business in as much 
 as, as Senator Woodley has indicated, the kinds of recommendations that have been put forward by Justice Evatt were not really on the agenda.</para></talk.start><para>Ironically, I recall that, during discussions on the Hindmarsh Island bill, I put to the Senate that those recommendations should be looked into and at the time Senator Collins also agreed that that should be done. At the time the government said it was all too difficult because they would have to go to the states, it would take a long time, they would have to talk about it, they would have to think about it and they really could not decide on it in advance of doing that, but funnily enough they had enough time to put through their own recommendations to their own amendments, which are going in the other direction.</para><para>I have not had a chance to have a look at this full report, but I would like to express, along with Senator Woodley, my concern about the way this took place and about the way that the government's agenda of reducing rights can be done really quickly, but in terms of any decent objectives for the protection of rights it is all too difficult.

This delegation was a great honour to lead. This delegation was accorded opportunities that many delegations may or may not have been accorded. We certainly were able to visit many of the important organisations within the European institutions. When you start looking at what the institutions are, it is quite mind-boggling, particularly to understand the differences between the various institutions.</para></talk.start></continue><para>We visited the European Union and the Council of Europe. We also heard about the European Council. We saw the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, which comprises the parliamentary members of that. We also saw the European Parliament. We saw the European Commission of Human Rights and the European Commission. We saw the European Court of Human Rights and the European Court of Justice. We did not see the International Court of Justice, which is in The Hague. We also saw the European Investment Bank. It is important to recognise that the European Union is our major and largest trading partner when you take the union as a whole. I think it needs to be remembered in Australia that, when taken as a whole, that is the case.</para><para>We were also honoured to be able to observe Anzac Day on the Somme on the Western Front. For many of us, I think, that was a very moving occasion. Before talking about the Western Front, I would like to say that we had the honour and the privilege of being guests of the European Parliament on the day that the British minister and the Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs outlined to the European Parliament what is now commonly known as the `Good Friday agreement'—the forerunner, we all hope and pray, of the resolution of the Irish conflict. The delegation thought it was a very great honour to sit and observe as these two great people outlined the work they had done and paid tribute to John Hume and Jim Nicholson. Ian Paisley was also mentioned.</para><para>It was a very interesting time for the delegation to be in Europe because there was not only the occurrence I have just outlined. The following Saturday the meetings occurred that 
 led to the beginning of the Economic Monetary Union and the beginning of the Euro. It was a significant time for us to be in Europe and to see the changes happening with the European currency.</para><para>It is also significant that there are some reforms going on in relation to common agricultural policy. Maybe the reforms are not moving as fast as we would like, but there are certainly some reforms being discussed and some major challenges being faced within Europe. In Australia we hear of the problems of small communities and the death of small communities because of the drop in commodity prices. We are not the only country that is facing the problem of the drift away from rural communities to the major cities. It is also a problem which is having to be addressed in Europe. I feel that there are a number of issues where there is commonality.</para><para>The delegation included some of my colleagues from the lower house. The deputy leader of the delegation was the Hon. David Jull. The delegation included Senator Gibson from this chamber and Mr Noel Nicks, Mr Ted Grace and Mr Steve Dargavel from the other place. I give my thanks to those of my colleagues who travelled with me. It was a great delegation. It was a delegation which worked hard, and we worked well together. At the time we were away the waterfront dispute was at its peak, and the delegation was able to work together to present Australia's point of view. We were able to respect one another's differences of opinion and, as I say, we worked very well together as a group.</para><para>I also want to pay tribute on behalf of the delegation to the Australian Embassy in Paris for their organisation, on our behalf, of the brief time we were in France. But a big thank you must go from the delegation to our embassy in Brussels, led by Don Kenyon, the Ambassador. The delegation thanks Mr Kenyon and his wife, Fleur, Jane Drake-Brockman, Alex Brooking, Anne Owens and Anthea Griffin. Anthea Griffin is the third secretary at the embassy in Brussels, and she was responsible for the itinerary. She made it work. Her tireless work and her contribution certainly need to be noted.</para><para>The delegation would not have worked as well without the support of the delegation secretary, Andrea Griffiths. We had some fun with the names `Anthea Griffin' and `Andrea Griffiths', but we managed to overcome that problem. The members of the delegation want to record their thanks to Andrea for her work. As can be seen in the report, we returned to Australia after 30 April and, about six weeks afterwards, the report has hit the chamber. The report was so promptly presented because of the work Andrea did in compiling it. On behalf of everybody in the delegation, I say a big thank you to her.</para><para>I also want to say a personal thank you to the delegation. It does not appear in the report, but a great-uncle of mine is buried at Lebucquiere on the Somme. He was killed in April 1915. When they heard about this, the Commonwealth War Graves Commission was able to provide us with the exact details as to where to find the cemetery and the grave. We drove across the Somme looking at the small villages a kilometre or so apart, each one of which had Commonwealth war graves. The Commonwealth war graves are signified by a very large and imposing white cross. You can travel for hundreds of kilometres without ever losing sight of a large white cross. Tens of thousands of men and women gave their lives in that war—it was horrific. But it was even more moving to stand at some of the battle sites such as Beaumont-Hamel and hear the stories of what happened. At Beaumont-Hamel, the Newfoundland Regiment put 1,000 men over the top one night and less than 100 were able to make it to roll call the next morning.</para><para>When you hear of those sorts of figures and the sorts of deeds that happened in those battles, and when you see how close together the front-line trenches of the opposing sides were, you realise just what an horrific occasion it must have been. You also become very aware that this was the last war fought with old technology. We had the very great honour of being able to see the new memorial park at Le Hamel where a monument is being built. The monument commemorates the first battle where Australian soldiers were led by an Australian general, General Sir John 
 Monash. It was called `the turning point'. It was the first Allied offensive in World War I to be a victory. It was the turning point. Monash was able to utilise all the new technology that was available. He was able to utilise the artillery in conjunction with the tanks, in conjunction with the infantry, in conjunction with the air force. That battle lasted 93 minutes—in 93 minutes it was over and won. The delegation was able to see the site that is being prepared for that memorial and, on 4 July, the memorial will commemorate the 80th anniversary of the battle.</para><para>As I said, I also had the honour of visiting Lebucquiere Cemetery where my great-uncle is buried. I was able to see that cemetery and that grave at first-hand. I was probably the first member of the family to actually visit that particular site. It was a very moving experience.</para><para>We also visited the Villers-Bretonneux memorial for Anzac Day and laid a number of wreaths at the memorial and at the local French memorial as well. We went to visit Bullecourt and the two memorials there plus the diggers memorial. It was a great honour to be able to participate and lay wreaths on behalf of the Australian parliament at those ceremonies. If you have to spend Anzac Day away from Australia and if you cannot be at Lone Pine or at Anzac Cove, there is no other more moving place to be than at the Somme.</para><para>On the Sunday, the following day, we were able to go to the Menin Gate ceremony at 8 o'clock that night where they play the <inline font-style="italic">Last Post</inline>. Every night, every day, every year the <inline font-style="italic">Last Post</inline> is played. It was of great significance. The whole committee feels greatly honoured and appreciative of being able to participate in that. I would like to thank again everybody who was involved in assisting us with this very worthwhile visit.</para></speech></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ASSENT TO LAWS</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>3617</page.no></debateinfo><para>Messages from His Excellency the Governor-General were reported, informing the Senate that he had assented to the following laws:</para><para> Ballast Water Research and Development Funding Levy Collection Act 1997

The bills raise a levy on stevedoring operations to fund payments that may be made by the Government in connection with reform or restructuring of the stevedoring industry and ensure that the industry is responsible for such funding and not the taxpayer.</para><para>The potential benefits of waterfront reform are of vital significance to our national interest. The 
 present arrangements, based on union monopoly, are costing Australia dearly. Our waterfront is inefficient, unproductive and unreliable by world standards. It prevents Australia achieving not only the immediate economic benefits flowing from maximising our international competitiveness, but also, more importantly, the long-term improvement in the perception of our overseas trading partners of Australia as a reliable supplier.</para><para>When the Government came into office in 1996, it inherited a stevedoring sector where productivity and reliability were in decline, despite a decade of direct government involvement in waterfront reform and commitment of some $430 million to the reform process.</para><para>Successive independent reports to the Government on the progress of micro-economic reform, including the Productivity Commission and Industry Commission, have concluded that the stevedoring sector remains an impediment to the competitiveness of our manufacturing and primary production sectors. Business consistently expresses concern about the high charges, low productivity and unreliability of the waterfront.</para><para>Control over the supply of operational labour is been concentrated in the hands of a single union, the Maritime Union of Australia (MUA). Consequently, the union has the scope to exercise considerable influence over how the stevedores manage their business and it has largely dictated the terms and conditions under which any new entrant stevedore may operate.</para><para>The monopoly power wielded by the MUA, has consistently prevented or undermined changes to outdated work practices. As a result productivity and reliability remain low. Relative to our international competitors, our performance is getting worse and not better.</para><para>Australia can no longer afford to have monopoly labour arrangements in strategic economic sectors, like stevedoring and shipping, which adversely impact on their efficiency and reliability and thereby reduce our nation's international competitiveness.</para><para>In line with its election mandate and public commitments, the Government has already taken decisive action to facilitate reform of the industry. With the passage of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 has outlawed union preference. The act also restores the balance in the relationship between employers and employees and encourages greater flexibility in the labour market.</para><para>Awards are being simplified to ensure they form a genuine safety net. Increased negotiation of employment conditions, both at an individual level and collectively, is ensuring conditions applying to a particular workplace promote efficient performance 
 of work at that enterprise and increased workplace flexibility.</para><para>For the first time, there are now effective remedies against unlawful industrial action. The reinstatement of the primary and secondary boycott provisions to the Trade Practices Act 1974 provide affected parties with redress in the event of illegitimate industrial campaigns. These remedies have been instrumental ensuring that recent industrial action on the waterfront has not escalated into the wide-ranging sympathy action that has characterised waterfront stoppages of the past.</para><para>On the waterfront, the Government has reached an agreement with our two major stevedoring employers, Patrick and P&amp;O Ports, under which the stevedores have agreed to adopt seven key performance benchmarks as the basis for continuing improvement. These include:</para><para>An end to overmanning and restrictive work practices.</para><para>Higher productivity. We have commitments from the major stevedores to achieve a benchmark for container terminal cranes of 25 containers being moved per hour, as a national average across the five major container ports.</para><para>Greater reliability through less industrial disruption and the elimination of outdated work practices. The level of industrial action on the waterfront should be no worse and preferably better than the national average.</para><para>Improved safety. Injury and fatality levels must come back to the all industries average or better.</para><para>Lower costs throughout the logistics chain to the waterfront gateway.</para><para>More effective use of the technology available to increase productivity and ship turnaround times.</para><para>Improved training.</para><para>The achievement of these reforms requires stevedores to implement significant structural changes in their operations and to manage the resultant rationalisation of their labour force.</para><para>While the means of achieving these reforms is a matter for the industry participants to determine, the Government has a vital part to play in ensuring the legal framework supports any legitimate initiatives to implement more productive labour arrangements including those adopted by new entrants to the industry.</para><para>The Government also intends to facilitate access to funding for redundancy related payments arising through reductions in excess labour arising from industry restructuring. The promotion of this restructuring is crucial if Australia is to have an efficient and reliable waterfront. This bill, together with the Stevedoring Levy (Imposition) Bill 1998 is intended to ensure that this funding is available 
 and that industry, and not the taxpayer, will meet the cost.</para><para>I now turn to the specific provisions of the bill to explain how this will be achieved.</para><para>The levy arrangements proposed by this bill, in conjunction with the Stevedoring Levy (Imposition) Bill 1998, are modelled on the existing stevedoring levy legislation, the Stevedoring Industry Levy Act 1977 and the Stevedoring Industry Levy Collection Act 1977.</para><para>However, the new arrangements are considerably simplified and, unlike the 1977 arrangements, they will not apply to bulk cargo. The performance of seaboard bulk cargo terminals is generally accepted as already being internationally competitive.</para><para>This bill provides the mechanism for collection of the levy imposed by Stevedoring Levy (Imposition) Bill 1998, on the loading and unloading of containers and vehicles in Australia. The flat rates of levy that will apply upon the commencement of this legislation are considerably simpler than the administratively complex scheme applying under the 1977 legislation.</para><para>Under section 7 of the bill, the levy is to be paid by the person who is responsible for the loading or unloading by way of contract, arrangement or understanding with the owner/charterer of the ship, which generally means the stevedoring company.</para><para>The maximum rate of levy is set by section 5 of the Stevedoring Levy (Imposition) Bill 1998 at $10.00 per vehicle and $20.00 per container. However, the bill provides for a lower rate of levy to be prescribed by regulations. The Government intends to set the actual rate at $6.00 per vehicle and $12.00 per container.</para><para>Both the major stevedores have agreed that the levy at this rate can be absorbed into their existing structure of charges so there is no overall increase in costs to shippers. The cost of these arrangements will be borne by the stevedoring industry itself. It is anticipated that not only will our importers and exporters not have to pay more but also, as workplace reforms are implemented, stevedoring costs will progressively diminish.</para><para>Importantly, unlike the arrangements under the 1977 acts, the proposed levy arrangements will not impose any obligations on shipping lines or shipping agents.</para><para>The method of collection also is simplified under this bill. As provided by section 9, this will be by way of returns to my Department at regular intervals on which payment of the levy is to be based. The Secretary of the Department can appoint inspectors, who are to be employees of the Commonwealth, or a State or a Territory, and they will have various powers to access premises and 
 search for documents, as outlined in section 13 of the bill.</para><para>The special appropriation in section 17 will allow the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business to authorise payments that are in connection with, or incidental to, the reform or restructuring of the stevedoring industry, including meeting the cost of associated financing and administration costs. The amount of money that may be appropriated is capped at $250 million.</para><para>The bill makes no provision for a "sunset" date by which time the levy must be terminated. It includes a mechanism in section 8 for the determination of the final levy month after which liability to pay the levy will cease. It is not the Government's intention that the redundancy funding arrangements will be available indefinitely. It is anticipated that it will take six or seven years for the levy payments to meet the full cost of the redundancy benefits.</para><para>A review of the levy legislation and rate of levy will be conducted within three years after its commencement.</para><para>Government assistance will be available to all stevedores who take the opportunity to undertake much needed reform. This legislation underpins the administrative arrangements necessary to encourage the stevedoring industry to actively tackle the fundamental restructuring required to achieve the Government's reform agenda. Reform that will allow the industry to move away from its history of inefficiency, inflexibility and uncooperative relations between employees and management.</para><para>STEVEDORING LEVY (IMPOSITION) BILL 1998</para><para>This bill should be read in conjunction with the Stevedoring Levy (Collection) Bill 1998. It establishes a levy on stevedoring operations consistent with the administrative arrangements that I have outlined for that bill.</para><para>Under section 7 of the Stevedoring Levy (Collection) Bill 1998 the levy is to be paid by the person who is responsible for the loading and unloading of shipping containers and vehicles in Australia by way of contract, agreement or understanding with the owner/charterer of the ship, usually a stevedoring company.</para><para>The maximum rate of levy is set by section 5 of the bill at $10.00 per vehicle and $20.00 per container. As I indicated for the previous bill, a lower rate of levy is to be prescribed by regulations. It is intended the actual rates will be $6.00 per vehicle and $12.00 per container.</para><para>Both the major stevedores have indicated that the levy at this rate can be absorbed into their existing 
 structure of charges so there is no overall increase in costs to shippers.</para><para>It is also intended to prescribe by regulation a zero rate of levy for local cargo, so that containers and vehicles shipped from one Australian port and unloaded at another Australian port will not be levied. This measure will ensure that Australians who rely on sea freight because it is cheaper than road or rail freight, or is the only means of transporting goods, will not be disadvantaged by the imposition of the levy.</para><para>I already have referred to my intention to conduct a review of the levy legislation and the rate of levy within three years after its commencement.</para><para>The levy mechanism is well understood in the stevedoring industry for raising funds for industry purposes with a statutory levy dating back to 1947. By contrast, the levy arrangements under the current bills are simpler and are directed at supporting crucial restructuring of the stevedoring sector.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Denman</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (RETIREMENT ASSISTANCE FOR FARMERS) BILL 1998</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>3620</page.no><id.no>r458</id.no><cognate><cognateinfo><title>CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 1998</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>r488</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate><cognate><cognateinfo><title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 4) 1998</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>r485</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate><cognate><cognateinfo><title>COMPREHENSIVE NUCLEAR TEST-BAN TREATY BILL 1998</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>r506</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>3620</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bills received from the House of Representatives.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>3620</page.no><name role="metadata">Newman, Sen Jocelyn</name><name role="display">Senator NEWMAN</name><name.id>BE4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Social Security</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I indicate to the Senate that those bills which have just been announced are being introduced together.

It will remove a significant barrier to the intergenerational transfer of the family farm in such situations.</para><para>Eligible farmers will be able to gift their farm enterprises, with a net value of up to $500,000, to family members of a younger generation who have been actively involved with the farm. This will allow those farmers to retire and have immediate access to the age pension. The family farm will no longer be required to support two or more generations.</para><para>The bill provides for the Scheme's commencement from 15 September 1997, although people who transferred their farms in the preceding five years might also be able to benefit from the Scheme. It is intended that the Scheme will operate for three years only, that is, until 14 September 2000.</para><para>There are several elements that need to be met for a retiring farmer to qualify for the age pension under the Scheme. I will outline some of them. 
</para><para>The Scheme will be open to farmers of age pension age who owned farming property as at 14 September 1997, and have owned a farm or farms for at least 15 years or have been actively involved in farming for 20 years, subject to the limitations on property value and income.</para><para>Madam President, the net value of the family farm can be up to $500,000, not including farm debts. However, where a farmer wishing to retire currently owns a farm in partnership with an eligible descendant, and wishes to transfer his or her share of the farm to that person, only the retiring farmer's share of the equity in the farm will be included when valuing the farm.</para><para>The farmer's total income over the 3 financial years prior to the transfer can be up to the applicable age pension rate, depending on marital status. Any losses from the farm can be used to off-set other income including non-farm income. Social Security and Veterans' Affairs income support payments as well as Austudy payments are not treated as income for these purposes.</para><para>If a farmer decides to retain a life interest in their home on the farm or excise their home from the remainder of the farm, the value of the home and of any surrounding land of up to two hectares that is used for domestic purposes will also be deducted from the value of the farm being gifted. The farmer can continue to live on the farm.</para><para>The member of the younger generation to whom the farm is being gifted is required to have been actively involved in the family farm for the preceding three years. However, the bill also allows a discretion to cover situations where an eligible descendant has been undertaking studies relevant to farm management or has been forced to seek employment off the farm due to exceptional circumstances such as drought.</para><para>Madam President, I commend the bill to the Senate.</para><para>Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance Consequential and Related Measures) Bill 1998</para><para><inline ref="r454">Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance Consequential and Related Measures) Bill 1998</inline></para><para>CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL (No. 1) 1998</para><para>The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1998, which is now before the chamber, contains a number of amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1995. I will briefly outline the amendments of substance.</para><para>Schedule two of this bill commenced on the third of July 1997. The customs duty on aviation gaso 
 line (avgas) contains a component to recover the costs of aviation terminal and enroute navigational services provided to the general aviation sector by Airservices Australia. In reviewing the costs of providing these services for 1997-98, Airservices Australia proposed a reduction in the duty of 0.6 cents per litre on avgas, which represents a five per cent decrease in real terms.</para><para>This reduction in costs to aircraft operators follows the implementation of an election commitment by this government. This commitment was to freeze the airways component of avgas duty in 1996-97, except for movements in the consumer price index, while working towards the implementation of a fairer system of funding for the general aviation sector's contribution to Airservices Australia.</para><para>The component of duty on avgas payable to the civil aviation safety authority for the costs of aviation safety regulation remains unchanged.</para><para>Madam President, the amendments contained in schedule three of this bill came into effect on the thirty-first of January 1998. The reduction in duty rates on avgas in schedule two of this bill would have been superseded by the commencement of the Customs Tariff (Fuel Rates Amendments) Act 1997 on that date. By customs tariff notice published in a Commonwealth gazette on the eighteenth of February 1998,  the reduced customs rate of duty on avgas was reinstated.</para><para>The other amendment contained in this schedule is of an administrative nature and results again from amendments contained in the Customs Tariff (Fuel Rates Amendments) Act 1997. Section nineteen to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 contains a table of paired customs subheadings and excise items. This section provides the duty nexus between customable and excisable revenue goods by allowing customs rates of duty to be adjusted in line with movements in the excise rate of duty.</para><para>The amendment amalgamates the table existing prior to the thirty-first of January 1998 with the new aspects introduced by the customs fuel rates legislation.</para><para>Schedule four is operative from the first of March 1998 and creates a new item sixty-four in Schedule four to the Customs Tariff Act 1995.</para><para>At its meeting on the twenty-seventh of August 1997, the ministerial committee on the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games agreed to introduce certain import concessions for the 2000 Olympic and paralympic games and associated test events. As a result, amendments to the temporary imports provisions have been finalised and a new passenger concession by-law for unaccompanied baggage for Olympic family members has been implemented by the Australian Customs Service.</para><para>This amendment creates a new item in schedule four to allow non-personal and non-commercial 
 goods to be imported into Australia duty free by Olympic Games family members.</para><para>The reality of the Olympics and associated events is that members of the Olympic family will bring with them a variety of goods which are to be used in a non-commercial manner. These will include give-aways, hospitality samples and other consumables that will be used for team promotion and for cultural and hospitality activities.</para><para>It is intended that the concession will not apply to tobacco and alcoholic products or extend to any importations of a commercial nature.</para><para>Similar concessions were offered at the Nagano winter Olympics and by host countries at previous summer and winter Olympic and Paralympic games.</para><para>The amendments contained in the other schedules of this bill are of an administrative or technical nature and will have no financial impact on the importing public.</para><para>I commend the bill.</para><para>Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance Consequential and Related Measures) Bill 1998</para><para><inline ref="r454">Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance Consequential and Related Measures) Bill 1998</inline></para><para>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 4) 1998</para><para>The Bill gives effect to some of the measures announced in the 1997-98 Budget and in other Government statements.

Legislation has already been introduced to deal with taxi travel, car parking and the arranger provisions. All these measures will reduce compliance costs for most employers and, in particular, for small businesses.</para><para>The record keeping measure introduced in this Bill is specifically targeted at those employers whose fringe benefits in a base year do not exceed an indexed threshold amount and who do not significantly alter the fringe benefits provided in later 
 years. The benefit threshold will commence at $5,000 for the 1996-97 FBT year.</para><para>Having established a base year, employers will not be required to keep FBT records and will have their FBT liability in future years determined from the base year taxable benefits. This measure will apply to benefits provided from the date of Royal Assent and to FBT liabilities from the 1998-99 year.</para><para>The FBT exemption for benefits arising from an employer' s participation in an approved student exchange program will apply from the FBT year commencing 1 April 1996.

It is a reflection of the strength of feeling held by both the Australian parliament and the Australian community that we should take a determined stand in our foreign policy in support of nuclear non-proliferation. I hope that we will see the same level of support for the CTBT Bill here in the Senate. Australia is strongly committed to the global nuclear non-proliferation regime as a key element of our national security and we should continue to maintain the very significant reputation that we have built up over the past 30-odd years as a constructive player in the establishment of that regime.</para><para>The CTBT bans all nuclear weapons test explosions and all other nuclear explosions for all time. It marks a watershed in international efforts to address the global threat posed by the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and is an indispensable component of the international nuclear arms control regime. Over the past 30 years, this regime has succeeded beyond all expectations in constraining the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. Almost every country in the world is committed never to acquire nuclear weapons, and never again to engage in the type of spiralling nuclear arms race which occurred during the years of the Cold War. 186 countries, including the five nuclear weapon states—China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States—have signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). 149 states have already signed the CTBT. Fourteen states, including two nuclear weapon states—France and the United 
 Kingdom—have ratified, while many others are preparing to do so.</para><para>The recent nuclear tests by India and Pakistan highlight the importance of the CTBT. The Treaty provides the firmest international and political basis on which to condemn India's and Pakistan's actions. The Government's response to Indian and Pakistani testing has been unequivocally strong. India and Pakistan have been similarly castigated by many countries individually and in international fora, including at a Special Session of the Conference on Disarmament (CD) in Geneva and the United Nations Security Council. The Government will be unremitting in our efforts to bring India and Pakistan into the global non-proliferation regime. We call again on both India and Pakistan to sign and ratify the CTBT without condition, to accede to the NPT and to support the commencement and early conclusion of a Fissile Material Cut-Off Treaty.</para><para>The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Downer, signed the CTBT on behalf of Australia when it was opened for signature in New York on 24 September 1996. Early ratification by Australia is critical. We are one of the forty-four states whose ratification is required in order for the Treaty to enter into force.</para><para>Australia is universally recognised as a key player in the adoption of the CTBT and we can be justifiably proud of the part we played in achieving this outcome. We were instrumental in accelerating the negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament (CD) in Geneva. Following the failure to achieve final consensus in the CD on a draft Treaty text which was all but agreed, the Government initiated action to take the unprecedented and courageous step of submitting the Treaty to the United Nations General Assembly for adoption in September 1996. Following intensive work by members of the Government and Australia's diplomatic missions, the Australian-sponsored resolution attracted the co-sponsorship of 127 countries, and was adopted with the support of an overwhelming majority of the international community from countries in all regions of the world. This was a truly great achievement by the Australian Government.</para><para>On presenting this bill, I would like to remind the Senate of Australia's long-standing and well-deserved reputation as a leading international player on arms control issues. That reputation has been enhanced by this Government's imaginative and successful efforts in taking the arms control agenda forward.</para><para>This Government's commitment to the cause of disarmament is evident in our substantial contribution to the international movement in favour of the total elimination of anti-personnel landmines (APL) as a weapon of war. In December 1997, Australia joined over 120 countries in signing the Ottawa 
 Treaty banning landmines. The next step is to get negotiations under way in the Conference on Disarmament as soon as possible as a way of complementing the Ottawa Treaty and tightening the clamps on the global supply of landmines. I was pleased to see the reappointment of Australia's Ambassador for Disarmament, John Campbell, to the position of Special Coordinator for anti-personnel landmines in the Conference on Disarmament, and we are working hard in Geneva to develop an ad hoc committee mandate for negotiations to ban exports, imports and transfers of APL.</para><para>On 3 February 1998, in his second address to the Conference on Disarmament since becoming Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Downer urged the CD to begin immediate negotiations, not only on a ban on landmines transfers, but also on a Fissile Material Cut-Off Treaty. Mr Downer has instructed that Australia be active in Geneva and elsewhere in promoting this so-called "Cut-off" Treaty as a priority arms control objective for 1998 and beyond.</para><para>In another area of the arms control agenda, Mr Downer recently announced a new initiative to strengthen the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC). The Government's initiative is aimed at fast-tracking the negotiations on a verification system for the BWC, and highlights our serious commitment to preventing the spread of weapons of mass destruction.</para><para>By signing the CTBT, Australia has aligned itself with the basic obligation not to carry out any nuclear weapon test explosion or any other nuclear explosion. Part 2 of this bill makes it an offence to engage in activities prohibited under the Treaty and provides appropriately severe penalties of up to life imprisonment for offences committed under clause 6 relating to the Treaty prohibitions.</para><para>The CTBT will establish an intrusive verification regime. The International Monitoring System (IMS), which is the principal arm of this regime, will be a worldwide network of over 300 monitoring stations and laboratories. Australia will host 21 monitoring stations and laboratories. Part 4 of the bill provides for the establishment and the operation of monitoring facilities on Australian territory, including authorisation to gain access to these facilities.</para><para>Part 3 of the bill covers the arrangements which would apply should an on-site inspection be called on Australian territory. Part 5 of the bill provides for the establishment of a National Authority to manage Treaty implementation in Australia.</para><para>I commend the bill to the Senate and present the explanatory memorandum to this bill.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Denman</inline>) adjourned. </para><para>Ordered that the bills listed on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline> as separate orders of the day.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>FILM LICENSED INVESTMENT COMPANY BILL 1998</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>3625</page.no><id.no>r525</id.no><cognate><cognateinfo><title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT (FILM LICENSED INVESTMENT COMPANY) BILL 1998</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>r526</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>3625</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bills received from the House of Representatives.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>3625</page.no><name role="metadata">Newman, Sen Jocelyn</name><name role="display">Senator NEWMAN</name><name.id>BE4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Social Security</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I indicate to the Senate that those bills which have just been announced are being introduced together.

The portrayal of uniquely Australian perspectives and stories are important to us as a nation. Australians are proud of the high standard and successes of our film industry, and there is increasing interest in contributing to that success through avenues such as investment.</para><para>We also recognise that the production of film is a high risk business, and that it is necessary to provide incentives for the private sector to invest in the film industry. Division 10BA of the Income 
 Tax Assessment Act was introduced in 1981 to encourage a broader base of private investment for Australian films.</para><para>Whilst 10BA  has been important in attracting private investment into the industry,  there are flaws with the system. A number of films were never released while others appear to have inflated budgets.</para><para>As part of his wide ranging review of Commonwealth Assistance to the Film Industry, Mr David Gonski recommended that the current 10BA and 10B taxation concessions be replaced by the introduction of a Film Licensed Investment Company tax concession.</para><para>The Government consulted widely on the detail of Gonski's proposal. We listened to industry concerns about replacing 10BA and 10B with a completely new and untested mechanism. As a result of these concerns we decided not to replace 10BA until the FLIC scheme had been properly trialed. The Government will retain 10B. The FLIC scheme will operate alongside the current 10BA concession for 2 years from the 1998-1999 financial year.</para><para>The adaptation of Gonski's FLIC model signals an innovative and exciting new approach to government support to the film industry in Australia. The FLIC scheme provides an opportunity for the Australian film industry and the investment sector to work together in attracting more effective and wide ranging private investment into the development and production of qualifying Australian films. It is envisaged that the FLIC scheme will be able to tap into a part of the investment market which has shown interest in the past in investing in the film industry. As the film industry matures and develops, the Government believes that sophisticated investors will be attracted to investing in a slate of film and television productions across which their risk can be spread.</para><para>This bill enables the introduction of the Film Licensed Investment Company pilot scheme. Under the scheme up to $40 million worth of concessional capital over the two year period will be allowed to be raised for investment into qualifying Australian film and television product. A Film Licensed Investment Company will be a commercially driven company that will invest in a slate of  eligible film and television product. Companies will be selected through a competitive application process. Shareholders will be eligible for an upfront tax deduction of 100% on their investment into the company.</para><para>While the licence period for raising concessional capital will apply for just two years, the FLIC will have up to three years to invest the capital and up to four years to complete production. The FLIC will be able to start raising non-concessional capital at the end of the two year licence period. 
</para><para>This represents a major commitment of Commonwealth funding to the film industry. The cost to Government is estimated to be up to $20 million over the two year pilot period. The FLIC scheme will deliver support to the industry that is transparent and accountable, and afford investors an alternative avenue for investment in film. This introduces a level of contestability between current funding sources through the provision of an alternative source of funds from that currently available from the Film Finance Corporation and that which can be raised under Division 10BA.</para><para>The FLIC scheme will support and promote the ongoing development of the Australian film industry by facilitating the establishment of a new Australian owned and controlled company that will raise capital primarily from Australian investors for investment in qualifying Australian film.</para><para>The FLIC does not replace any existing funding for the industry, rather it will complement those programs. The Government recognises the vulnerability of the industry, especially for some of the most culturally sensitive genres, and need for certainty for investors and producers alike. Forward funding for the Australian Film Commission and the Australian Film Finance Corporation was confirmed in the 1997-98 Budget, and the continuation of Film agencies was confirmed in the Government's response to the Gonski report in November 1997.</para><para>Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance Consequential and Related Measures) Bill 1998</para><para>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT (FILM LICENSED INVESTMENT COMPANY) BILL 1998</para><para>The Taxation Laws Amendment (Film Licensed Investment Company) bill 1998 is a companion to the Film Licenced Investment Company Bill 1998.</para><para>The bill authorises a deduction for money paid during the 1998-99 and 1999-2000 income years to subscribe for shares in a Film Licensed Investment Company (FLIC). The deduction is not allowable until the shares have been fully paid and issued to the shareholder.</para><para>The legislative package comprising the two bills is intended as a pilot measure, to provide assistance to the Australian film production industry in a way that complements the existing tax concession in Division 10BA of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. FLIC shareholders will be able to effectively spread their investment across a range of films, whereas Division 10BA applies to investments in individual films.

Industry and Government have both agreed that a structure based on these objectives would best meet the needs of industry into the next century.</para><para>In April 1997, the Government agreed to industry's recommendation for the establishment of a grower owned and controlled company to assume responsibility for wheat marketing from 1 July 1999, when the Government guarantee of the Australian Wheat Board borrowings ends.</para><para>The new grower company will operate under Corporations Law in accordance with its memorandum and articles of association. It will have two classes of shares—A class shares will be issued only to growers and will give control of the company; B class shares, issued on the basis of Wheat Industry Fund equity, will form the capital base of the company. 
</para><para>Madam President, as a transitional step towards these arrangements, Government agreed that the Australian Wheat Board establish a wholly owned company to carry out all the commercial activities of the Board. The new company AWB Ltd, with separate subsidiaries to undertake pooling and domestic trading, became operational on 1 June 1998.</para><para>In March 1998, industry put to Government, and Government endorsed, the final details for the new arrangements to commence on 1 July 1999.</para><para>Madam President, the bill before the House completes the legislation necessary for the restructure of the Australian Wheat Board. It addresses the following key areas:</para><para>.	 the conversion of the Wheat Industry Fund to shares and thereby providing the capital base of the new company structure;</para><para>.	 provision for managing the continuation of the wheat export monopoly; and</para><para>.	 other transitional matters to finalise the new arrangements.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Conversion of the Wheat Industry Fund to shares</inline></para><para>Almost a decade ago, the wheat industry commenced building up funds for a capital base for a future grower owned Australian Wheat Board via a levy on wheat sales. These funds were paid into the Wheat Industry Fund.</para><para>Under the bill, from 1 July 1999 the Wheat Industry Fund will be returned to growers in the form of B class shares. B-class shares will be issued to Fund equity holders on the basis of one share for every Fund unit and will provide the new company's capital base.</para><para>Madam President, the issue of shares to growers to replace Wheat Industry Fund equity is a significant financial transaction. Growers have been rightly concerned as to the taxation implications. The taxation treatment to apply to the conversion of the Wheat Industry Fund to shares is covered by tax legislation. So there can be no doubt, I would like to reiterate the taxation arrangements agreed to by Government.</para><para>As announced in November 1997, shares in the new grower company are to be treated as capital for taxation purposes. Automatic roll-over relief from capital gains tax on conversion of the Wheat Industry Fund units to shares, means that capital gains tax on the shares will only apply when they are disposed of.</para><para>For capital gains tax purposes, the cost base of the share is to include levy contributions made by growers prior to 13 May 1997, indexed for inflation. However, levy contributions made after 13 May 1997 will remain immediately income tax deductible, and will receive the benefit of capital 
 gains tax indexation until disposal of the asset. On disposal of the asset, the cost base is to be reduced by levy contributions made after 13 May 1997.</para><para>In addition, the Government has decided that the capital gains tax small business roll-over provisions, as announced in the 1996-97 Budget, will be available to growers where a wheat industry fund unit is disposed of and the proceeds applied to the purchase of another small business `active asset'. However, this roll-over relief will cease to be available after the Wheat Industry Fund units are converted to shares.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Provision of the Wheat Export Monopoly</inline></para><para>Madam President, the bill also provides for the retention of the wheat export monopoly from 1 July 1999.</para><para>Specifically, the bill provides for an independent statutory authority, to be known as the `Wheat Export Authority', to manage the export monopoly on wheat.</para><para>To give growers the certainty that they have been asking for, the bill also provides that the new grower company pool subsidiary (called `company B') has an automatic right to export wheat for five years. Requests to export wheat from other than the grower company pool subsidiary (as currently happens) will be managed by the Wheat Export Authority in consultation with the grower company pool subsidiary.</para><para>The Wheat Export Authority will oversight the pool subsidiary's use of the export monopoly to ensure it is being used in accordance with the intentions of Parliament. It will also examine and report on the benefit to growers from the pool subsidiary's performance in relation to the export of wheat.</para><para>Madam President, the Government is committed to the principles of National Competition Policy. Continuation of these arrangements for the export monopoly for the full five year period will be subject to the outcome of a comprehensive and independent National Competition Policy review in 1999-2000.</para><para>Assuming the National Competition Policy review in 1999/2000 recommends continuation of the export monopoly, it is envisaged that before the end of the prescribed five year period in 2004 an export monopoly performance review would be held. Specifically, the review would assess the performance of the pool subsidiary in its use of its wheat export rights and advise Government on the future operation of the export monopoly, including whether that company should continue to have special export rights. Such a review would probably be linked with a National Competition Policy review process. It would be up to the Government to decide who would receive any special export rights beyond 2004 and for Parliament to amend the legislation as necessary. 
</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Other Transitional Matters</inline></para><para>Madam President, the bill also provides for a number of other transitional matters to finalise the restructure of the Australian Wheat Board including:</para><para>.	 deletion of the redundant provisions of the Wheat Marketing Act 1989;</para><para>.	 the completion of the transfer of assets, liabilities and staff from the Australian Wheat Board to its wholly owned holding company prior to 1_July 1999; and</para><para>.	 continuation of Government underwriting for pool borrowings outstanding as at 30 June 1999, until these borrowings are repaid.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Conclusion</inline></para><para>This bill finalises the legislation for the restructure of wheat marketing.</para><para>Administrative and legal work, such as the transfer of staff and assets to the new companies, will be completed over the next twelve months.</para><para>The grower company of 1 July 1999 will be a robust, commercial company with the flexibility to meet the marketing challenges of the next century.

A significant element of these measures was the amnesty and compensation scheme for owners of semi-automatic firearms. It was agreed that people who surrendered these firearms during the amnesty period, would be compensated and the Commonwealth would pay the cost of the compensation scheme.</para><para>The Commonwealth also agreed to pay compensation for the surrender of other prohibited firearms of a more dangerous type where the surrender is consistent with the spirit of the national firearms program.</para><para>The compensation-for-surrender scheme in the States and mainland territories was funded by a one-off increase in the Medicare levy for the income year 1996-97.

The government's new Agriculture—Advancing Australia initiative is the first attempt in many years to comprehensively address the range of issues facing rural Australia. This Scheme delivers on a major commitment given by the Coalition at the last election.</para><para>Extensive consultation with State and Territory governments, farmer groups, financial institutions and the public has contributed significantly in shaping the measures introduced today. The initiatives in this bill have received widespread endorsement from key farming bodies such as the National Farmers' Federation and from the financial sector, including the Australian Bankers' Association.</para><para>The Farm Management Deposit (FMD) scheme enhances and expands the previous Income Equalisation Deposit (IED) and Farm Management Bond (FMB) schemes operated by the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. This bill has been carefully designed to meet the Coalition's long standing desire to encourage increased financial self reliance among farmers, while also taking account of the high variability of farm income streams, and the vulnerability of farming businesses to natural events.</para><para>Madam President, the bill takes the operation of the FMD scheme out of Government hands and commercialises it. The FMD scheme will be a tax-linked financial risk management tool that allows farmer taxpayers to transfer income between high income and low income years. The Government's aim is to improve primary producers' capacity to manage financial fluctuations caused by environmental and market conditions. It helps them do this 
 by allowing them to set aside considerable cash reserves earned during high income years for use in low income year, in a tax effective way. Financial institutions are likely to offer a range of products, providing farmers with more choice as well as increased flexibility in their investment decisions.</para><para>I will be asking my Department and the Australian Taxation Office to ensure reporting arrangements are in place so that the scheme retains its integrity and can achieve its objectives. The restriction of the scheme to prudentially controlled deposit taking institutions or those with government guarantees on the deposits will increase the security of deposits.</para><para>The key features of the enhanced FMD scheme will be:</para><para>.	 A limit on holdings in the scheme of $300,000 per taxpayer;</para><para>.	 The investment component will be set at 100 per cent on the entire balance—this means interest will be able to be earned on the whole deposit which has been made out of pre-tax income;</para><para>-	 currently the investment component is only 61 per cent for IEDs;</para><para>.	 Eligibility will be restricted to primary producers with a taxable non-primary production income of not more than $50,000;</para><para>.	 The scheme will be commercialised and delivered through financial institutions, making it far easier for farmers to make deposits and withdrawals;</para><para>.	 Investors will be able to elect only one institution with which to hold deposits, however this institution may be changed at any time;</para><para>.	 Financial institutions will pay an interest rate determined in the market;</para><para>.	 Deposits will be fully tax deductible in the year of deposit and taxable in the year of withdrawal;</para><para>There will be a minimum deposit period of 12 months;</para><para>Interest will be taxable in the income year it is earned;</para><para>.	 On withdrawal 20 per cent of the amount withdrawn will be deducted for tax purposes but this deduction may be exempted if the depositor demonstrates to the Department of Primary Industries and Energy that he or she is in serious financial difficulties;</para><para>.	 As with current arrangements, FMDs will not be available to companies, trusts or partnerships, although individual beneficiaries of trusts and individual members of partnerships will be able to use them.</para><para>IEDs and FMBs have, to date, had a low rate of uptake, mainly because they have been inflexible 
 and not commercially attractive or tax effective. Some 222 million dollars are currently invested by more than 6600 people in IEDs and 110 million dollars by more than 3300 people in FMBs. Primary producers with existing IED or FMB accounts will be able to transfer them to FMDs with no loss of tax benefits.</para><para>The revised conditions in the new FMD Scheme, including its commercial nature, larger investment component and flexibility of withdrawals, should secure an increased uptake of the new scheme. This is appropriate as the aim of the package is to encourage more farmers to use such deposits to manage risk.</para><para>The Government will be closely monitoring the operation of the scheme; in particular the interest rates offered by financial institutions and the fees and charges they levy on FMD accounts.</para><para>The Income Equalisation Deposits (Interest Adjustment) Act 1984 applied only to interest payments made under the IED scheme during the period 29 June 1984 to 22 November 1984 inclusive. All relevant periods for amendment or appeal processes relating to that time period have expired. The bill repeals the Income Equalisation Deposits (Interest Adjustment) Act 1984 as it has become redundant.</para><para>Madam President, today is a proud day for me as Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. The Farm Management Deposit Scheme and the new financial risk management capability it offers will be of great benefit to the farm sector.</para><para>I have great pleasure in commending the bill to honourable senators.</para><para>PASSENGER MOVEMENT CHARGE AMENDMENT BILL 1998</para><para>The purpose of this bill is to amend the Passenger Movement Charge Act 1978 to increase the rate of the Passenger Movement Charge (the charge) by $3, to $30, with effect from 1 January 1999. The increase was announced by the Treasurer in the 1998-99 Budget and will help meet the additional costs associated with the transit of people and goods for the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games.</para><para>The charge, which is imposed on the departure of a person from Australia, is collected by airlines and shipping companies at the time of ticket sales and then remitted to the Commonwealth in accordance with arrangements entered into under section 10 of the Passenger Movement Charge Collection Act 1978. These arrangements have been extremely successful and beneficial to all stakeholders, not the least being the passengers whose departure from Australia is unimpeded through a seamless process which no longer requires the purchase of charge stamps.</para><para>Current arrangements with airlines are due to expire on 30 June 1998 and the Government is finalising 
 negotiations with interested parties for new arrangements to apply from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 2001. The increase in the charge will have no impact on the arrangements and collection and remission procedures will remain the same.</para><para>It is, however, desirable that the amendment to give effect to the increase in the charge from 1 January 1999 be in place at the earliest opportunity so as to provide certainty for airlines and shipping companies in relation to ticket sales for departures after the proposed date for the increase.</para><para>Ordered that the resumption of the date be made an order of the day for the first day of the 1998 spring sittings, in accordance with standing order 111.</para><para>Ordered that the bills be listed on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline> as separate orders of the day.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>HEALTH CARE (APPROPRIATION) BILL 1998</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>3631</page.no><id.no>r537</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>3631</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill received from the House of Representatives.</para><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newman</inline>) agreed to:</para><para>That this bill may proceed without formalities and be now read a first time.</para><para>Bill read a first time.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>3631</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>3631</page.no><name role="metadata">Newman, Sen Jocelyn</name><name role="display">Senator NEWMAN</name><name.id>BE4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Social Security</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para><para>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> .</para><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The speech read as follows</inline>—</para><para>This bill delivers on the Government's commitment to pay in full the offer made to the States in relation to health funding at the Premiers' Conference in March.</para><para>This legislation allows the Commonwealth to continue funding to all states and territories based on the fair and reasonable Premiers' Conference offer.</para><para>The Government is not prepared to delay any longer in ensuring the continuation of funding for hospitals.

Let me speak for a moment to my amendment. This goes to the review of the operation of the act, and the explanatory memorandum of the government's bill states that the government intends to review the new arrangements applying to managed investments after two years. We are 
 proposing that this be done by the ASC and the Treasury, and will examine in particular the resource allocations of the new SRE regime—that is, single responsible entity—for the ASC and for the Treasury.</para><para>Labor hopes that this review will still occur as the resource implications for the ASC is a critical issue for the successful operation of the new scheme. What is unusual about the review, mentioned in the explanatory memorandum, is that the government does not anticipate changing the regulation of managed investments at the time of the review. If that is indeed the case, why have the review at all? What is its purpose? What if the review finds that the regulation of managed investment trusts is flawed and should be changed? Would the government ignore the results of such a review?</para><para>Labor's amendment will require a review to take place before three years and that the review is to be tabled by the minister in the parliament within six months of completion. The review should be conducted by someone with enough experience in the industry to have a good grasp of the operation of managed investments and an understanding of how the new regime will operate. It would be preferable that the person be external to the government.</para><para>Labor's amendment is designed to ensure that there is greater transparency in the operation of the new scheme and that any problems which are identified can be scrutinised by the public. The onus will be on the government of the day to respond to these problems with the appropriate legislative or other changes that are necessary. I must say that, given the contentious nature of the debate, an open and transparent review of the process in our view is essential.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>3632</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is very important, obviously, that we have parliamentary scrutiny in relation to the important issues that have been mentioned in the second reading debate on the Managed Investments Bill. I would like to take this opportunity, having picked up on what Senator Cook says about accountability and open processes, to return briefly to my speech during the second reading debate. In 
 that speech I mentioned that the draft regulations had not been made available. During that speech the minister, by means of interjection, called out, `Rubbish, you have had them for six weeks.' I would like to clarify the situation, having checked in the meantime exactly what had been around for six weeks.</para></talk.start><para>The policy document was around for six weeks. It is not unreasonable to put on the record that there has been no briefing offered to the Greens (WA) in relation to the draft regulations of the Managed Investments Bill. For all the guffawing, that is the reality. There has not been, to our knowledge, any sight of the draft regulations. So it is not unreasonable for people to assume, if in a speech during the second reading debate a senator says, `I haven't seen any draft regulations', and if you have the minister yelling out `Rubbish!' from the other side of the room, that that should be based on something related to the truth. But that is not what happened.</para><para>I have still not seen draft regulations. A policy document was available. It was my staff who were being contacted about the group of bills from which the managed investments bills were separated.

They clarify that the standard of care owed by directors of the entity is that required by the general law of trusts and not 
 some lower standard. Why should this be necessary? The standard is unclear. It may be lower than currently required under the general law of trust. The test under the Managed Investments Bill roughly equates to that under the Corporations Law. It is arguably less rigorous than the SIS Act test. However, there is a degree of uncertainty because the courts, in AWA Limited v. Daniels, have shown a willingness to expand the scope of the duty depending, amongst other things, on the nature of the enterprise in question.</para><para>The standard of care required of a trustee under the general law of trusts is that of an ordinary prudent man of business. That comes from Charitable Corporation v. Sutton. There is little doubt that this test is higher than the test proposed by the Managed Investments Bill. For the purpose of clarifying the standard of care required of a responsible entity, it is reasonable to suggest amending the provision to reflect that the standard required is that of a trustee under the general law of trusts. This basically reflects the theme of my contribution on second reading—that we should not, under the Managed Investments Bill, have a standard less than other laws.

My most recent experience in relation to these directors' duties matters is debating the fine detail of the words of the proposed amendments to the company laws under the corporate law economic reform program. When you start fiddling with the words of how a person under the companies law should be responsible as a director by adding words such as `a person in business', you start sending signals to the judges who have to ultimately determine these things.</para></talk.start><para>We are going through a debate at the moment in which this parliament will take part in the near future in relation to directors' duties as to whether or not to put some very similar words into the companies law, which all management investment schemes will be subject to anyway. All directors will be subject to the duties as prescribed in the Corporations Law. I was given these amendments this morning. They have not received any consideration by experts in this field. All of the Corporations Law proposals that this government has dealt with—and, to the credit of the previous government, that the previous government dealt with—were put through an extraordinary, excruciating but very worthwhile process of public consultation so that experts in the field of companies law, accounting and other areas were able to analyse the detail of the effect of these changes to the law.</para><para>I cannot be assured that the proposals put forward by the Greens in these amendments increase the responsibilities of directors or decrease the liability by potentially constraining the weight that a court would put on the responsibility of that person. I put forward as an example of that argument—and it is a very vital one—that a court might look at the care and diligence that a reasonable person would exercise under 1(b) of the bill. If you were to add, for example, the words `in business'—and this argument has been  put to me by top company lawyers in relation to a similar exercise which we are going through on the company law economic reform program—it diminishes the responsibility of people who are not in business.</para><para>That is the argument we have had put to us in relation to a proposal to amend the directors' duties provisions of the companies law where we were proposing to put in some words to make it clear that the director would be required to have to act as a director would who had had the experience based on that director's experience. We thought that would be a sensible reform because the court could look at the experience of that person who was exercising that judgment or making that decision in business. It was put to us by directors and by company lawyers of long experience that, by trying to make a practical 
 interpretation of what a director's duty should be and how the court should look at how a reasonable person might be judged as to whether it was a reasonable decision to make based on their experience, by putting in the words with that person's experience these directors argue that it would increase the requirement for experienced directors but significantly diminish it for inexperienced directors.</para><para>I would argue, with my very limited knowledge of these matters, that to put in the words `in business' you would increase the requirements on a director who was in business. But, if you had a director of a managed investment scheme who was a trade union representative for trade union interests, that person may not have experience in business, and therefore the courts would read down that person's responsibility. I do not give that as an example of why those particular words may or may not improve the scheme; I give them to the Senate as an example of how I cannot be convinced that these amendments increase the responsibility of directors. I cannot be convinced that these are amendments that will make the single responsible entity more responsible. I would not like to make any amendments to this bill that were so uncertain.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>3636</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Is it not amazing that the only people who seem to be able to demand certainty in Australia under legislation these days are large corporations? They seem to get it whenever they ask for it. What we are asking for is a greater deal of certainty and clarity for ordinary people in Australia. The minister has just given us a quite lengthy critique of my use of the insertion `in business' but it does not actually say that. It says `of business'. Experience of business is actually different from experience in business. If you have been a union official and you have been involved with superannuation funds for the last X number of years, I guess that would be experience of business. It does not reduce it. We are talking about the duty of people working within the industry. The fact that the minister has just rebuffed something that does not exist in my amendments is a 
 pretty good indication of what is happening here. I think it is a bit of a snow job. The reality is that we are asking for some clarity for those people who do not normally get clarity. At the moment the only people getting certainty are the people who have the power and influence to demand it.

First of all, in the earlier matter Senator Margetts said that she feared that the Labor Party had spoken boldly in its contribution to the second reading debate, that a deal had now been done and that our position had been watered down or words to that effect. This is a terrible, disgusting reflection upon such a noble party as the Labor Party and, by inference, upon me. I can assure the Senate that no deal has been done. Our view of the amendments that we have foreshadowed and intend to move to this bill have been consistent throughout its whole consideration.</para></talk.start><para>Having disposed of that, let me now go to the issue that is before the chair. I find myself in a similar position to that of the parliamentary secretary: that, considering the full import of what are, on the face of it, simple amendments but which plumb very deeply in terms of their complexity and inferences of law, this is not a matter that I feel confident to take on foot, as it were. Also, this is not a matter upon which I have obtained any learned or considered advice in the time available to me since receiving these amendments.</para><para>I am disposed though to say that the amendments ought to be kept in mind and, when the review in three years time comes back, the amendments could perhaps be reconsidered against the light of the experience of that review to see whether or not there is a call to make them. That was my first reaction. My second reaction is to say, `Well, one ought to be a little more considered than that perhaps,' and I could support a proposition which would mean that these amendments are not proceeded with at the moment. We could take advice over dinner, 
 come back and then put a definitive position down on the record, having given these amendments more thought. I am torn between both those options, none of which satisfactorily meet the desires of the mover. But I must say that, given the notice that I have before me of these amendments, I do not think my duty requires me to do anything more than I have said—prudence certainly does not.</para><para>So I do foreshadow to the mover, to the parliamentary secretary and to Senator Murray that, while I am disposed to vote against these amendments and consider them again in the light of that three-year review, I am open to any suggestion, should it be taken up by the Greens, to defer this matter until after I have had some more advice over dinner, since I think we will still be going by the time the dinner break comes around and could deal with it straight after.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>3637</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am happy to take up Senator Cook's suggestion.

The wording is considered to bestow a reasonable amount of clarity within law for courts to make decisions. Senator Campbell indicated that it might influence the court, and certainly that is what we are hoping to do. We are concerned that, if we leave legislation in such a form as to leave that degree of lack of clarity, it will make it more and more difficult for the average punter, if things go badly wrong, to get some form of justice. Whatever is possible at this particular time is worthy of consideration over dinner.</para></talk.start><para>I would like to point out that my office has not been slack on this issue; as everybody else has, we have used the time which has been available to us as well as we could.

You either stand back and look at a bill and say, `Okay, this has some real problems but, hey, potentially I'm in the balance of power so I haven't got time to deal with it,' or you could look carefully at it and produce amendments that try to improve the bill. That is what we have sought to do. I suppose there will always 
 be a problem when you have senators in this situation of trying to review legislation when there are entire parties looking at it from their own viewpoint which might be different in terms of the accountability that you require.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN (Senator Hogg)</name></talker><para>—Senator Margetts, could I suggest, therefore, that you move the deferral of the consideration of Greens (WA) amendments 3 to 6 on sheet 1023 revised?</para></talk.start><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Margetts</inline>) agreed to:</para><para>That further consideration of the amendments be postponed.</para></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>—We will move to Democrat amendments 3 to 7 and 11 on sheet 943 revised 2.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>3637</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I move:</para></talk.start><para>(3)	 Schedule 1, item 1, page 9 (line 9), at the end of subparagraph (i)(ii), add "by an independent custodian approved by the ASIC (see Division 4)".</para><para>(4)	 Schedule 1, item 1, page 9 (lines 27 to 30), omit subsection (2) and the note.</para><para>(5)	 Schedule 1, item 1, page 19 (after line 18), at the end of Part 5C.2, add:</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Division 4—Appointment of custodian</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">601FU  ASIC's approval of appointment</inline></para><para>(1)	 The ASIC must approve a company as custodian of a scheme's property if:</para><para>	 (a)	 the company is not an externally-administered body corporate; and</para><para>	 (b)	 the company is not an associate of the responsible entity; and</para><para>	 (c)	 the ASIC has no reason to believe that the company does not have the capacity to perform, efficiently and honestly, the functions of the custodian of the scheme.</para><para>(2)	 For the purposes of paragraph (1)(c), the ASIC may have regard to the following matters in relation to each officer of the company who is to perform duties in connection with the performance by the company of the custodian's functions:</para><para>	 (a)	 whether the officer is an insolvent under administration; and</para><para>	 (b)	 whether the officer has been convicted of serious fraud during the 10 years ending on the day the application for approval of the company as custodian is made; and

Therefore, I hope that the government will not only have had time to look at them but also be thoroughly supportive of them as a result.</para><para>Parliamentary Secretary, in my speech during the second reading debate I did outline the problems, as we saw them, with the Managed Investments Bill. These related to two critical deficiencies. Firstly, the bill, in our view, does not provide millions of Australians with adequate choice about the management of their savings—and that is not only our view, of course, but the view of a number of the critics of elements of the bill. Secondly, the bill does not improve the security of those 
 investments. In our view—and Senator Harradine quoted some very good other authorities—it generally reduces that security. So we have tried to redress those problems to the extent that we can within the current bill.</para><para>Both your government and the Labor government prior have made a laudable virtue of international benchmarking and striving for commercial best practice. But in its pursuit of the single responsible entity model the government directly contradicts international practice. The SRE is believed by some to be inconsistent with principles 2.1 and 2.3 of the International Organisation of Securities Commissions regulation of liquid collective investments document. Also, out of 42 countries surveyed by KPMG in 1995 only two, the British Virgin Islands—and I do not know if that is part of Richard Branson's outfit—and the Netherlands Antilles operated without the combination of manager and trustee custodian.</para><para>As Senator Harradine said in his speech during the second reading debate, Australia clearly intends to go out on its own—and we have some concerns about that. While we accept that to run against international opinion is not necessarily always wrong, we are concerned that in the process Australians' money could be put at greater risk, without them being asked whether it should be put at greater risk. The amendments I am speaking of here deal with the issue of the independent custodian and really are an attempt to reduce the risk in that area.</para><para>In an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline>, Simon Hoyle reported that international ratings agency Standard and Poor's raised concerns that the bill would severely undermine the security of investors' money. The article cited Standard and Poor's as advocating in an SRE system at the very least the presence of an independent custodian to hold the funds' assets separately. An independent custodian was a feature of Labor's proposed bill, as you would recall, Senator Cook, and was one of the key provisions excised by the coalition when they produced their own bill.</para><para>The amendments I have put together require scheme funds to be held by an independent custodian where a trustee does not exist, and 
 they define the role of the custodian. But, because the parliamentary secretary has in the past made the good point that you need to retain flexibility whenever you can, amendment No. 11 of the group we are debating here together allows for the ASIC—as it will be—to exempt a scheme from having a custodian in circumstances where the ASIC considers that the need for an independent custodian is negligible. In other words, a custodian would be mandatory unless the regulator says it does not need to be.</para><para>We think that those particular provisions that we have laid out in our amendments, in fact advance the security of assets considerably. They do not detract from the bill; they do not detract from the intention of the bill. They do, however, firm up the security element. In particular, you will see that amendment No. 5, which is under discussion here, covers the appointment of the custodian, ASIC's approval of the appointment—which is critical—the functions of a custodian and the duties of a custodian. Those are spelt out in some detail, and all of those are taken from experience, both in law and in practice.</para><para>Parliamentary secretary, as I said earlier, in our view this strengthens your bill; it does not take away anything from it. We are hopeful that the opposition will heed these arguments since they are the ones the opposition put in their earlier versions of the bill. Accordingly, I commend to the Senate Democrats' amendments 3-7 and 11.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>3639</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The coalition government will not be supporting these amendments to the <inline ref="r424">Managed Investments Bill 1997</inline> . I do, however, thank Senator Murray for providing the amendments to the government some many weeks ago and for accepting our offers of briefings and discussions on a number of occasions so that we could seek to work through where the Democrats were coming from and try to explain in more detail the government's proposals. I think Senator Murray also took up the government's offer of briefings by people such as the chairman of the ASC.</para></talk.start><para>We are not of a view to support these amendments because they fundamentally attack the single responsible entity concept. The government is very keen to avoid rebuilding the two-tiered structure by another name. If you are to bring into the law the concept of an independent, unrelated party custodian, you then start building in the potential for a fiduciary relationship between investors and the custodian.</para><para>The investor protection that is built into the regime, that has been recommended by CASAC and the ALRC, is that the responsible entity will be responsible to the investor and that the courts cannot try to lay off the blame to some other party. So it is crucial to ensure that that fiduciary relationship only exists between the responsible entity and the investor. The great investor protection regime that is built by this bill—and we strongly argue that it is a better scheme than the one that Australia has at the moment—is the strength of that fiduciary relationship, but it also is built on the flexibility that can apply.</para><para>Mr Temporary Chairman, as you know better than most, this legislative scheme is built to cover every investment scheme from a small agricultural scheme which may be worth only a couple of million dollars, right up to the huge funds managers such as BT and AMP and everyone in between. This includes the small funds that are emerging in Australia where some very successful funds managers are moving away from ANZ or Westpac or wherever and setting up their own niche market investment funds with $100 million, $150 million, $200 million under management, and competing against the big funds.</para><para>That range of entities, structures, schemes, will be covered by the Managed Investments Bill. This includes everything from a $500,000 to a $1 million vineyard, plantation, ostrich farm—though that is probably not a good example—all those agricultural type schemes, blueberries—for Mr Hartnell's benefit—property syndication type projects, small and middle sized funds managers right up to the hundreds of millions of dollars schemes.</para><para>You need a flexible scheme. No doubt—and we have given the ASIC the power to do 
 this—at the very small end it will be very much in the interests of the scheme manager to have an organisation, an agent, controlling the custody of the assets that is independent. There will be organisations that fulfil that role, and they will have to comply with the ASIC, the licensing requirements and the law. You may find that very large organisations will be able to do the custodial work by a related party, in-house, using the requirements under the law. Under that, they are going to need independent directors, they are going to need a compliance committee, they are going to need a compliance plan, and that is all going to have to be registered with ASIC.</para><para>This scheme is flexible; it does allow an independent custodian, so it does give people choice. They can choose to go to an existing trustee organisation and say, `We would like to create a compliance plan, set up a scheme, and we would like to use a trustee organisation as a custodian of the scheme assets.' They can go to some other organisation that offers itself out for custodial services and they have to comply with the law and they will have to comply with ASIC's policy statements, which—as Senator Margetts has pointed out—have been published in draft form by ASIC, have been consulted on with the industry and will be finalised prior to 1 July.</para><para>That is the benefit of this scheme. When you by law require an independent custodian for all schemes, you undermine the basis of the entire single responsible entity concept. There is a difference between the so-called bare custodian that was put into the collective investments bill that was released by former Attorney-General Michael Lavarch in December 1995 and the proposal that the Democrats put up here today. The so-called bare custodian that was put into the Labor bill could indeed have been an internal related party custodian. It did not need to be independent and it did not need to be at arm's length from the manager; that bare custodian, as it became known, could have been a related party.</para><para>The government looked at that concept and we thought that giving it a minimum assets requirement may well cost the small fund managers out of the business. If you put in a 
 minimum capital adequacy requirement for a bare custodian of $5 million, someone who had funds under management of less than $100 million would get priced out of the market and you would not have any small fund managers anymore. Of course, for a big organisation like AMP or BT the bare custodian would have been a joke anyway because $5 million capital adequacy would have meant nothing in terms of investor protection, nor would it have made much of a dint in their accounts. That is why the government opted for a flexible scheme. It will see many funds, I am sure, opting to have an independent custodian, for a whole range of reasons, but it will not restrict schemes to using that form.</para><para>The government's strong policy commitment in this is to bring in a single responsible entity and not to allow the law to be amended in a way that would diminish the fiduciary relationship between the investor and the single responsible entity by mandating independent custodians. That is when you start watering it down, building up a separate fiduciary relationship which we believe will get built up by the courts, and destroy the clarity of that relationship between the investor and the manager. We will be opposing these amendments and hope that the Senate will do so.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>3641</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—There is one major thing wrong with the parliamentary secretary's contribution, and that is that he has not actually explained adequately to the Senate why the government is not prepared to look at whether a single fiduciary entity is such a good thing. Various examples were given earlier that under the current system there have been rip-offs and there has been money lost, but there has been nothing proved in any way, shape or form by the parliamentary secretary that under the proposed scheme we are not going to see more. I just wonder whether, if we ever come to the point of reviewing this legislation, we are going to be under huge pressure not to change it if it actually lets people off the hook and provides an out for various fund managers. </para></talk.start><para>The reality is that giving examples of where the current system may be at fault is not 
 sufficient argument to say that you therefore make it a single entity and the single entity is therefore going to make it more accountable. Concern is clearly expressed by several senators here, including Senator Harradine, that this will be less accountable and, instead of actually fixing the problem, you actually create a huge problem and perhaps in a couple of years time we are going to have urgent legislation to address this. Someone will say, `Shock, horror! We did not know this was going to happen. We must do something.' We have the ability to look into the future to some extent and have some caution here, and I do not think the government is doing that in this regard.

I think that is the thrust of the criticism of the likelihood of Labor Party support for the government's amendments by the Democrats, by Senator Andrew Murray. I think that is a reasonable proposition to raise and I do 
 not criticise Senator Murray for doing so. Can I say that in my speech on the second reading I made it clear where we were coming from and that this would be our preferred approach. I mentioned two things to justify a change in our position. When you mandate an independent custodian, we believe you raise real doubts as to whether that will undermine the role of the single responsible entity. In the previous legislation, we did not have the same doubts at all that that would be the case. We do now have considerable doubts that you in fact undermine the role of the SRE.</para><para>However, one of the overriding concerns we have always had is that the funding and resources for the Australian Securities Commission be adequate to meet the task that commission will have in fulfilling its role with respect to this legislation. I note on that front that the government in this budget has provided $7.1 million over three years for the ASC. That would seem to meet the concerns that we have, although I would seek, through you, Mr Temporary Chairman, of the parliamentary secretary an assurance that government funding of the ASC will be at appropriate levels to meet the needs of this legislation and to ensure that the role is properly policed. If such an undertaking were not forthcoming, it would be of considerable concern to the opposition and in fact would cause us to reconsider our vote for the amendment.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>3642</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—That makes it hard to answer.

So we will be closely examining the implementation of this scheme and I give an unequivocal commitment that the ASIC will be appropriately resourced to ensure that the implementation of this scheme is successful and that it is able to implement an investor protection regime, which we think is an improvement for Australia.</para><para>Amendments not agreed to.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>3642</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><para>(7)	 Schedule 1, item 1, page 21 (lines 18 to 23), omit subsection (1), substitute:</para><para>	 (1)	 The constitution of a registered scheme may be modified, or repealed and replaced with a new constitution, only by special resolution of the members of the scheme.</para><para>This amendment relates to the constitutional changes and the impact that members might have on constitutional changes. This is important. What we are asking is to ensure that the constitution can only be changed with the approval of members. This is an amendment to 601GC(1)(a) and (b). Why is this important? We believe that, otherwise, we reduce the current protections. That is because, under the bill, responsible entities are permitted, under section 601GC, to modify, repeal or replace a scheme constitution without reference to or approval by investors in certain circumstances, depending on the sole judgment of the responsible entity. Nor does the bill require the ASC to approve changes to scheme constitutions.</para><para>By contrast, the current law requires the independent judgment of the trustee as to whether proposed changes to trust deeds are prejudicial to investors. If the trustee believes that a proposed change is prejudicial, it can only be made with investor approval. That, I believe, is a safeguard that should be there.</para><para>We are looking at the danger of erosion of rights. The constitution is the scheme's most important governing document. Can you imagine being in a club or an organisation or even a country when somebody could actually change the ground rules that you have been operating on, making laws and by-laws without your knowledge? You are going along believing the by-law is read in a certain way and they can change that whole set of rules.</para><para>Here we have the most important governing document specifying provisions for the managed investment scheme's most important aspects, such as the responsible entity's powers of investment, powers to raise and borrow money, members' rights to withdraw from the scheme, responsible entities' rights to be paid fees, members' complaint mechanisms and winding up of the scheme, and fund managers can make changes to scheme constitutions that in subtle and apparently innocuous ways can reduce the rights of ordinary investors. There is a real danger this will happen in some cases. Why should we let it happen? In a democracy, investors should have the right to have all amendments to the scheme constitution referred to them for approval. This amendment can be supported in the interests of giving investors some say over their investments.</para><para>The bill creates the power, on the part of the responsible entity, to change trust deeds unless it takes the view itself that the matter is prejudicial. This means that there is no independent party, such as the trustee or the ASC, so who is going to say that? Who is going to point that out? It is going to be able to approve the changes which a responsible entity makes to the rights of investors, as set out in the scheme trust deed or constitution. This is an extraordinary amount of power to vest in a responsible entity that is supposed to look after other people's money in accordance 
 with a set of rules under which those people invest in the first place. In any event, such absolute power is repugnant to sound business management principles.</para><para>The safest course of action under this bill is to require a scheme constitution to be referred to the investors for a vote. Otherwise, the responsible entity will have to be judge and jury as we no longer have this independent party. It will have to recommend and, in itself, approve changes without reference to a third party. There is no notice required.</para><para>It should be noted that there is nothing in this bill that requires any of the amendments made by the responsible entity to be notified to the investors before the changes take place. So not only do they not get to vote on them and not only is there not an independent entity that is necessarily going to judge whether they ought to have a say but they also do not have to have any notice. It is a bit like people getting a bit hot under the collar here if they are asked to vote on something that they have only just seen.</para><para>Again, this seems unnecessary erosion of the rights of investors to have a say as to how their legal rights are to be changed. If you were to look at each of these elements logically, you would have to say that the logic should be that, if the government is absolutely determined to have a single entity, there has to be protection in relation to changes in the constitution. I would urge support from the Senate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>3643</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The government will not be agreeing to this amendment. We believe that the constitution should be able to be changed, particularly where there is no adverse effect on members' rights. I refer Senator Margetts to page 21 of the bill, with which I am sure she will be familiar. Section 601GC looks at how a constitution can be changed. Paragraph (a) provides that major changes would have to be made `by special resolution of the members of the scheme'. In many examples, schemes should be able to be, and can be, changed where the changes are minor and do not affect members' rights.</para></talk.start><para>If some nasty scheme manager or single responsible entity does seek to change a scheme and that affects members' rights, then the members of the scheme have a recourse and may recover from the manager under 601MA, which you will find at page 44. 601MA (1) states:</para><para>A member of a registered scheme who suffers loss or damage because of conduct of the scheme's responsible entity that contravenes a provision of this Chapter may recover the amount of the loss or damage by action against the responsible entity whether or not the responsible entity has been convicted of an offence, or has had a civil penalty order made against it, in respect of the contravention.</para><para>So there is a remedy there if the responsible entity acts against the interest of members' rights. It is very much in line with putting more power in the hands of shareholders and members of schemes in this circumstance. It allows them to take action and gives them a statutory right to take action in the case of that breach.</para><para>If you were to require a managed investment scheme to hold a meeting of scheme members for every change to the scheme, you would put massive costs—and totally unnecessary costs—on members of the schemes. If you are looking at shareholders' rights, you have to look at why they invest in schemes in the first place. An important reason is to get a return on their investment. If a managed investment scheme is to be successful, one of the things you have to do is ensure that the cost of managing the scheme—the administrative costs—is kept to a minimum. If you go around forcing schemes to have meetings of members every time they need to make any change—as I think your amendment would force them to do; and I am not being frivolous here—it would certainly be good to be in the business of renting out large function centres, if not the MCG. If this amendment were to go through, you would actually be required to send out notices of meetings to possibly hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of investors on a regular basis. It would be very expensive and unwieldy.</para><para>We think the structure in the bill actually strikes a neat balance. It ensures that, if you do have a big change to the constitution, you 
 will have to go to a meeting, but if it is an administrative change that cannot affect, and does not affect, the rights of members, then you will be able to make it. This is set out on page 21 of the bill. You will have to lodge it with the ASC. Any of the modifications will have to be lodged with the ASC—or the ASIC as it will become known shortly. There must be a consolidated copy of the constitution lodged with the ASC. So there is a requirement. You cannot do it in secret—it has to be lodged. There are protections there for all scheme members. We think the balance is right. We think that your amendment would upset that balance.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>NaN:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>3644</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am sure most people are actually members of incorporated bodies. I think it is reasonable that members of incorporated bodies should get a say in respect of constitutional changes—even in the case of teeny-weeny changes where there might be no money involved.</para></talk.start><para>I believe there is a problem in that there is nobody to independently judge whether this will have adverse effects on members' rights. What happens when people do not find out until it is too late? Are we really saying that there is recourse if that recourse relies on action by the managers themselves—the managers who may, in fact, be bringing about the changes? In reality, you cannot say that that will be the case. You have already given us examples of legal recourse resulting in only a certain proportion of every dollar. We are saying that, as a government and as a parliament, we cannot deliberately put in legislation something that is going to leave people in the position of having to take legal recourse if we have the power to actually do something about it.</para><para>Constitutional changes have to be done in this way because there is no independent person who is legally required to advise members on adverse effects. If you have not given people the ability to have a say in any constitutional changes and you do not have an independent adviser, the reality is that you have left those people in double jeopardy. That is why this amendment is necessary. I am sure that, in most people's minds, it does 
 not come down to simply management costs. As a responsible parliament, there are more important things for us to be looking at. We are looking at certainty for investors. Individual mums and dads, the people who have put their money into such funds, do not know how to fight this when they do not know what is going on. That is a reality. There is nothing to ensure that they will know that these changes are going on. Are we going to rely on the managers to tell their members that they might be doing something against their interests? Surely we should be dealing with this with our eyes open and surely we need to take some action. Recourse may take a long time. Recourse may not bring any great benefits in the end if the changes that have taken place mean that people have already been damaged because they have not found out until it was too late.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>3645</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I think Senator Campbell is correct in striking the balance between practicality and the need to have some check in the interests of members.

I was commenting briefly from my experience in trust law relating to superannuation, which is not dissimilar in principle to the issue we are dealing with here with the Greens amendment. Certainly, in trust law in regard to superannuation if the trustees had to convene a meeting and consult with the members of a superannuation trust each and every time the 
 trust deed was to be amended, it would simply be administratively impossible and it would be highly costly.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I think we have to balance the practicality of the Greens amendment—and I think I would be impractical; it would be extremely costly in its implementation—with the checks against capricious action in respect of amendments of the constitution of a registered scheme. As Senator Ian Campbell has said, there are two checks. One is that the responsible entity must lodge with the ASC a copy of the modification or the new constitution. Then he referred us to page 44 of the bill where there is a second check, if we like—civil liability of responsible entity to members.

Parliamentary Secretary, I appreciate your remarks that a remedy is there within the bill whereby those who are defrauded or who have a problem can take action to recover their moneys. But as far as possible this Senate should avoid circumstances where people have to pursue the remedy, because preventive action is far cheaper, far quicker and far less damaging to the financial or physical health of investors than having to pursue the remedy at law. I make that as a general point.</para></talk.start><para>My second point really refers to your remarks about Senator Margetts's amendment forcing compliance with a particular course of action. I would have been prepared to accept your view if within that approach you had mandated that the funds were required to have got approval from their investors for a constitutional provision which allowed the fund manager to change the rules even if those rules were, as you pointed out, not serious or material. If somebody or an investor knowingly agrees to a constitution which delegates their rights to the responsible entity in whose interest it may be appropriate to conceal their motives or the reasons for their actions, if somebody in full knowledge makes that decision, then let the buyer beware. That is their problem. But clause 601GC of your bill actually says:</para><para>(1)	 The constitution of a registered scheme may be modified</para><para>. . .       . . .      . . .</para><para>	 (b)	 by the responsible entity if the responsible entity reasonably considers the change will not adversely affect members' rights.</para><para>The investor can have nothing to say about it. Whether the investor likes it or not, you are telling them they have to lump it or like it. I think that is the reverse end of the stick. You were criticising Senator Margetts's amendment for trying to improve investor security by requiring that constitutional changes be mandated by special resolution and yet at the same time you are supporting a mandated position whereby the responsible entity can disregard members' interests or views even where those members themselves may not like it and may not want to accept that approach.</para><para>I would have thought from your point of view that the appropriate approach if you did not want to mandate would be just to mandate that any constitution that had such a provision would in the first place have to be approved by the members. That is how constitutions are approved, aren't they? They are approved originally by members of the scheme. That is at the heart of the flawed thinking about this bill because you have here a situation where you are giving constitutional carte blanche to people in whose interest it may sometimes be to defraud, mislead or interfere with members' rights and interests in a manner which will result in loss.</para><para>Yes, there is a remedy, but then people have to go through the agonies of the courts. Then again there is the problem that the definition here in the bill is, shall we say, incomplete because it says:</para><para>(1)	 The constitution of a registered scheme may be modified, or repealed and replaced with a new constitution:</para><para>. . .       . . .      . . .</para><para>	 (b)	 by the responsible entity if the responsible entity reasonably considers the change will not adversely affect members' rights.</para><para>The entity may reasonably consider a change of the registered office from Sydney to Honduras entirely appropriate. It does not really 
 affect much, but it might allow the moneys to be moved around in a totally different manner from which they were moved before.</para><para>Whilst I understand your criticisms of Senator Margetts's approach, I am not sure at all that your alternative is better. If I had to toss up between the two, I know which one I would choose—and that is Senator Margetts's amendment because it guarantees that the members themselves have the say over what happens to the constitution, which is the instrument which governs the way in which their moneys shall be dealt with. On that basis, I would be inclined to support Senator Margetts's amendment.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>3646</page.no><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name><name.id>SF4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—There is one issue I want to raise, and that is the provision that the Parliamentary Secretary referred us to on page 44: the ability of a person affected by a responsible entity going amiss to take legal action.

This has been raised on a couple of occasions.</para></talk.start><para>Why that should be of some interest to you, Mr Temporary Chairman, is that it raises the issue of what legal funds are available for a person to take action.

I know of organisations which literally cannot afford stamps. But we are not talking about organisations which theoretically cannot afford stamps; we are talking about multihundreds of millions of dollar organisations which presumably can afford the stamps. We are talking about organisations which, if there were teeny changes to their constitutions, might do as other small organisations do: put the changes together when they are having an annual meeting. I would think that there would have to be some regular communication with members. I would think that the organisations could probably even save stamps if they advised their multiple members at the same time they were doing other mail-outs of the constitutional changes that were being proposed.</para><para>I do not believe we are talking about a ridiculous situation. If a fund changed its constitution willy-nilly every five minutes, I would think that would be a very poorly managed fund. I would think that the directors would find themselves in legal hot water because they themselves would not know where they were at, let alone their members. Are you suggesting that funds will and should change their constitutions every five minutes or every few days or every two weeks because they do not know how to manage themselves better than that?</para><para>I would suggest that, throughout history, organisations have worked out how to amend their constitutions in ways that meet their time deadlines and financial and other restrictions. Quite frankly, even small organisations which need to change their constitution for some reason between annual general meetings could organise a special general meeting or something—a mail-out or some other kind of communication with their members. I cannot believe that we are dealing with such very 
 large amounts of money and such very large bodies and that we are suggesting that it is beyond the realms of possibility that they can organise to change their constitution in any sort of order that enables their members to be advised.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>3647</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I just want to explain to Senator Margetts, through you, Mr Temporary Chairman, that this is not an easy process. I think the analogy that I used of a superannuation trust is a good one. Firstly, I know about this, having sat as a trustee on a superannuation fund and been faced with having to change trustees quite frequently. I am not saying weekly or every second day or anything like that, but maybe three or four times a year. Three or four times a year you say, `Well, 45c a throw. Maybe 100,000 members.' You are looking at a significant cost.</para></talk.start><para>Secondly, in respect of this legislation it is not necessarily the fault of the custodian or, in the case of superannuation, the trustee. Unfortunately, government legislation changes very frequently, and that is not a criticism of this government or our government. The fact of life is that I know that in respect of superannuation—having sat as a trustee when there was a Labor government—there were frequent changes every year. It has been the same under this government: frequent changes every year. Trustees do require alteration, and often, to make matters worse, retrospectively. Often you wait months for the legislation. That is not a criticism of this place; it is just a recognition of the facts of life in dealing with legislation. Often these changes are retrospective. It is annoying for the people who manage and are custodians of people's funds.</para><para>I have listened closely to the comments you made, Senator Margetts. I can say that, from the experience I have had, the practical concerns reinforce my conviction that it is extremely difficult to agree to your amendment. If there were no other balances in the legislation we would have to do something, but there are other balances in the legislation and I have commented on those. I just think we have to balance practicality against the checks and balances that are proposed—the 
 level of legal scrutiny. I do not think it is perfect, but I think it is the only practical way through.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>3648</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Senator Cooney asked me a question, and the core of it was about who pays if the responsible entity does act in a way that is deemed to be against the interests, in changing the constitution.

If you go to 601GA(2)(b) at page 20, you will see that the entity can only be indemnified if it is `in relation to the proper performance of those duties'.

However, the argument that we are making is that human nature, experience, the law courts and the media all say that there are people who will use other people's funds unscrupulously. Those people are not potentially going to have seminars with the minister to find out exactly what they should be doing: they may well find out what they can get away with.

That may well be the case, but there is a difference under managed investment funds. I understand that, whereas under super funds you may have a say in who your trustees are by electing your trustees, managed investment funds have people appointed without your say-so. Once again, you have something that super funds do not have.

More is the pity, but I think we are going to be back in this chamber in a couple of years time—providing we are all still here and are not dealing perhaps with parties who do not put in this kind of work—to check legislation and deal with it again, to try to clear up the mess.</para><para>Amendment not agreed to.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>3649</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><para>(8)	 Schedule 1, item 1, page 22 (lines 1 to 6), omit subsection (4), substitute:</para><para>	 (4)	 The responsible entity must send a copy of the scheme's constitution to a member of the scheme within 7 days if the member asks the responsible entity, in writing, for the copy, and must not charge the member any fee for the copy.</para><para>We are now dealing with the next stage. Having clearly found what the majority in the Senate were saying in relation to Greens (WA) amendment No. 7, this gives another opportunity for some level of notice in relation to members. This ensures that members have access to the constitution of the fund—it only requires a request in writing. It deletes the previous requirement in the bill that allowed access to the constitution only if the member paid for it. We are saying that people will know and people will be able to get funds back—or may be able to get funds back. Senator Cooney has clearly indicated that if you cannot prove in advance that a manager has broken the law then you have got to take the risk of taking them all the way down the line—if you can afford the risk—to try to get your funds back or try to get recourse.</para><para>We are asking that members have guaranteed access to the constitution of their funds by putting it in writing. Why do we need this? Members should not have financial limitations on access to such important information that outlines important features such as voting rights. Knowledge of the constitution and people's rights under it are important to investor protection. As there is no trustee, members will have to take more initiative to ensure their rights are not abrogated. They 
 should not have impediments to having access to their rights.</para><para>If, as the government and the opposition have indicated, and the opposition has indicated, this recourse is fair and available, then surely people need to have some information upon which they can judge whether or not the action taken by their managers has been according to the fund's constitution. We know this is going to be more difficult if the constitution can be changed without their knowledge, but at least there should be some basis by which members can be guaranteed access, if they require it.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>3650</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I was going to suggest to the Greens (WA) a couple of courses of action. I do have concerns—having spent the last 18 or 19 months of my life consulting with industry, investors, shareholders, people who manage funds and people who act as trustees for funds, on the fine detail of this legislation—that to make decisions not just on foot, as I think Senator Cook said earlier, but on the run, is not a sensible way. This bill was referred to a committee. Quite frankly, these amendments, at least for the government, appeared today.</para></talk.start><para>I was going to suggest that perhaps a constructive process—if we want to proceed down a constructive path—may well be to refer these amendments for consideration by the joint parliamentary committee. If the government and the parliament find merit in them through an inquiry, they can be incorporated. The government would have to give consideration to their incorporation, but certainly it would be open to the Greens or any other senator to move them as amendments to the Corporate Law Economic Reform Bill which we expect will be introduced into the parliament next week and debated in the next sittings of parliament. That bill contains a significant number of amendments to the Corporations Law. It certainly would be an available vehicle to the Senate within a matter of days in terms of its introduction, and a matter of only weeks in terms of its debate in this chamber. </para><para>If you would like the industry that will be affected by these changes to be able to look at them—and they go into a whole range of areas to do with managed investments—I suggest that it would certainly be a more normal process to allow industry to have a view and a say on all of these amendments rather than us having to second-guess the impact they might have on managed investment schemes which, as has been pointed out by all honourable senators who have contributed to the debate, affect the lives of millions of investors across Australia. I ask Senator Margetts to give consideration to referring these amendments to the Corporations and Securities Joint Committee. I would undertake that when they are referred, as part of the committee's current reference in relation to the CLER legislation, that the government would look at the report of that committee and it would remain open to any senator to move amendments to that bill.</para><para>I really have trouble with legislating company law reform and managed investment reform when I do not know whether the industry has even seen these. Surely someone has, but today is the first time that the government has seen these amendments. I reiterate that, after 18 or 19 months or longer, in discussing the fine detail of this legislation, I find it a little bit of an insult to the industry and the investing public to be trying to redesign a piece of legislation with about six hours notice.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>3650</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I find it a bit of an insult having to deal with legislation that has been so firmly criticised by those who know during the inquiry and the government did not take any notice themselves, quite frankly. We are responding to the kind of information that was thrown up in that inquiry and through people who we know who are experts in that field as well. I do not think simply going to the industry now and saying, `What do you think? How about you do this review on Senator Margetts's amendments?', is necessarily what is required. Maybe what there will need to be, and if I take some of the comments that Senator Cook made earlier, is a firm commitment from both sides of the 
 Senate that there will be a set time by which these arrangements under which the legislation is dealt with are reviewed.</para></talk.start><para>I can take advice and I can get give you some ideas by the end of this debate as to when, I might suggest, that review could take place, but I do not think simply giving it to industry and saying, `Can you tell us what you like and what you do not like?' gives the potential problems with investors time to emerge. We are being asked to take a lot of what the government is saying here on trust. During the speeches in the second reading debate three senators here said that the practice the government is talking about is not carried out in just about any country with these kinds of investments. So it is not we who are suggesting something that is unknown; the unknown is coming from the government side. What we are trying to direct you to is some certainty for investors amongst structures that are known, that do have some track record, rather than what the government is proposing. 	The cautious ones here are the Greens and the Democrats, and some within the opposition who probably are not in the chamber at the moment. It is not we who are leaping; it is you who are leaping. The cost will be to those people who are being put at risk. I can see what your intention is. I will still be arguing my amendments as they come. I will count the numbers as I go and if it is obvious that it is not going through, at least those arguments are on the record.

I might say, though, that I am inclined to take a view that the constitution of an entity ought to be available to the members of the entity. The provisions of the bill do make it available upon the payment of a fee up to the prescribed amount required by the responsible entity. When we are talking about the constitution of some body we are talking about the rules and procedures of that body that cover 
 and bind its members. In order to discharge one's responsibility as a member, one ought to be well advised about the rules. Not knowing ought not to be an excuse. Knowing should be within the reach of everyone. So I take a plain man's view of this amendment.</para></talk.start><para>I would be grateful if there were some guidance from the Parliamentary Secretary. When we say that `a responsible entity must send a copy of the scheme's constitution to a member of the scheme within seven days if the member asks the responsible entity in writing for the copy and pay any fee up to the prescribed amount required by the responsible entity', one presumes that the member will be made aware of this entitlement at the relevant point and can therefore exercise their right and that the fee they would be required to pay is not a userious fee; it is a fee that simply covers the cost of the transmission and printing of the document.</para><para>Could the Parliamentary Secretary confirm with me that that would be the intention of how this provision would operate and indicate whether he has anything to say on what the level of fee might be or on how one ought to regard what is a fair charge—whether the fee just pays the cost of printing and postage or whatever. `Up to a prescribed amount' means, I think, that in the regulations an amount will appear. If there is any advice you can provide to the chamber as to what that might be at this stage, I would appreciate it.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>3651</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The government's view is that it would be a cost recovery operation. If people do want to know their rights and obligations they would want to get a copy of the relevant legislation. If they want to do that, they will have to buy it either from a Commonwealth government bookshop or from CCH or some other supplier of the legislation. If they want a copy of the constitution of a scheme, that will be available on the ASIC database. They are required to pay a fee for accessing it there. Furthermore, if they want a copy of a company's constitution, it is open for companies to pay for that.</para></talk.start><para>Finally, I do not know what current practice is. I have not inquired into this. It is the sort 
 of thing that could be inquired into if you allowed it. And I did not say, Senator Margetts, `industry'. I said industry might like to comment on all these amendments. I said that a joint parliamentary inquiry into the effect of these amendments would certainly give the government more information on their effect. I do not know whether it is done at the moment, but certainly in the current legislation there is no requirement that members of a scheme be provided with a copy of the constitution for free. So to that extent it would be a departure from the existing legislation, I am informed.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>3652</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Basically what we are saying is that members will have to pay to access knowledge of their rights. Those are the rules that they are supposed to abide by and that other people are supposed to abide by in relation to them. If it is cost recovery, I guess we are back to the position of who is going to determine what the cost of putting together those changes are. It could be that one of their managers decided that they would have to have a conference in Europe in order to change some particular elements. This is a far-flung example, but who is going to change that? You were invited to give an idea of whether or not in these unseen regulations there would be some kind of ceiling limit and cost recovery. It could mean almost anything, depending on where the managers might have gone to have their conference in order to decide what the changes to the constitution might be. So we are still left none the wiser on the basis that you have user-pays. The people whose money is being used in order for the managed funds to make their money are going to have to pay for their rights as members.

Greens (WA) amendment No. 10 relates to approval—that approval by the ASC is required for all changes to the compliance plan. Amendment No. 11 requires that members must be given notice of changes to the compliance plan, that they will have access to the compliance plan and that new members should be able to inspect the compliance plan. I find it amazing to think that there should be some concept that this should not happen.</para><para>Why do we think this should happen? It is a document of fundamental importance for investor protection. The bill replaces compliance supervision by an independent trustee with supervision by either a majority of independent directors—that means a minority could object—or by a compliance committee. In either case, the compliance plan is the blueprint for compliance with the Corporations Law and the scheme's constitution. Like the scheme's constitution, the compliance plan is a document of fundamental importance for the scheme, including provisions for the manner in which scheme property is to be identified and held, when assets are to be valued, ensuring adequate record keeping and so on. It also provides notice of information of investors.</para><para>Under the bill, changes to this document may be made without notice to investors, like the constitution. Investors should have notice of changes to the compliance plan to be able to assess any potential implications of the 
 change. This amendment requires 21 days notice to members of any changes. It requires access and members should be able to receive a copy of the compliance plan free of charge, similar to what we said under the constitution. The scheme exists for the benefit of members, and members should face no impediments in receiving information about their investment scheme. It should provide access for new investors to free and informed choice. Why not? Because the compliance plan is of fundamental importance to the running of the scheme and to investor protection. A summary of the plan should be attached to the prospectus so that investors may judge for themselves whether or not the scheme is something they would wish to invest in. Such a requirement promotes free and informed choice.

The reasons are to facilitate early detection of any problems, inconsistencies or fraudulent practices. Once per year, in our opinion, is insufficient. It gives the auditor the ability to monitor on an ongoing basis, and perhaps that makes the annual audit a lot quicker. Even 
 minor breaches may be an early warning sign of more serious non-compliance in the future or serious but latent problems within the scheme. It also gives the SRE regular feedback on the compliance plan and allows the SRE to make the necessary changes. It is an incentive to be vigilant because regular audits give the SRE incentives to maintain their compliance with the plan.</para><para>It is possible, under the bill as it exists now, for there to be no external audit or compliance for up to 15 months after the commencement of a scheme, given that the audit would only need to take place within three months after the end of the financial year of the scheme. So basically people would not know for some time that something had gone very wrong.</para><para>Serious operational and compliance problems frequently show up in the early stages when a new scheme is developed. It is extremely important that there be frequent third party reviews of compliance in the absence of an independent trustee. These reviews should be carried out quarterly. An example of a problem that could arise with the inadequacy of the annual audit as opposed to quarterly audits is that of the payment of fees or reimbursement of expenses to the responsible entity.</para><para>Under section 601GA of the bill, a scheme's constitution must provide that a responsible entity is entitled to be paid fees or be reimbursed for expenses only in relation to the proper performance of its duties. Once again, like the managers who potentially put their constitutional changes together on some overseas posh holiday—that was just an example—no independent party signs off on the fees or expenses claimed by the responsible entity. It effectively pays itself. A dishonest responsible entity could easily abuse this power unless truly independent compliance audits are carried out fairly frequently.

It protects them from defamation proceedings if it makes these documents public. It ensures that the Freedom of Information Act exemptions do not limit this right of access.</para><para>Why is this necessary? This is necessary in terms of access because access to information is a key aspect of enforcing compliance. Remember, the parliamentary secretary said that people will have recourse if they can take their managers to court. Of course, to be able to take their managers to court, they would have to have some idea about what has gone wrong in relation to documents lodged with the ASC.</para><para>It is a basic principle of trust law that beneficiaries are entitled to information about the management of their property and to inspect trust documents—and for that, I refer to re Londonderry settlement. The right of beneficiaries to inspect trust documents flows logically from their ownership of what they have paid for. It ensures that the right of access cannot be modified or abolished.</para><para>However, this right can be modified or cut down by the trust instrument, or it may be adversely affected by contracts binding the responsible entity to commercial secrecy. Thus, the responsible entity could limit investors' normal rights to inspect trust documents by entering into a commercial agreement with confidentiality clauses. For instance, a responsible entity may sign such contracts with its parent company to shield documents from investors.</para><para>As the bill stands, there is also nothing to stop a scheme's constitution prohibiting—I repeat, prohibiting—a member's access to any information. For instance, the constitution could say that members may be entitled to 
 inspect documents after giving one month's notice in writing of their wish to do so. Inspection shall be subject to the absolute discretion of the single responsible entity, and the single responsibility entity shall be under no obligation to give reasons for the exercise of this discretion.</para><para>Obviously, in terms of accountability, the threat of publicity is all very important. The most potent inducement to compliance is to ensure that investors in managed funds have a clear and unqualified statutory right to any information held by the ASC—and, remember, the parliamentary secretary has just said that documents lodged by the ASC could be accessed. In relation to the fund, financial transparency is assured, and the markets are better insulated from potential abuses of trust or conflicts of interest—for instance, responsible entities using investor funds to bolster the profits of an associated underwriter facing a shortfall.</para><para>Potential publicity is a powerful inducement for responsible entities to avoid such conflicts of interest. Since defamation law is frequently used to suppress reporting of financial irregularities, it is desirable that publication of documents be privileged and that the law not be allowed to be used to draw an opaque screen over questionable actions of fund managers.</para><para>It should be noted that defamation law is never available to hinder free press reporting in the financial markets of the United States. Overseas analysts have commented unfavourably on how, in some countries in the region, such as Malaysia, legal threats have been used to suppress adverse economic or investment commentary. Are we going to have that in here to be competitive with the region?</para><para>In terms of transparency, much has been made recently of how the Asian financial crisis owes much to lack of financial transparency—and haven't we said a lot to the region about how this should be avoided—and how crony capitalism has masked underlying weaknesses in investment. It could be most unfortunate if the bill were to proceed without measures to ensure full transparency to investors on how their funds are managed. It is hardly necessary to state how such an omis 
 sion would damage Australia's financial reputation.</para><para>One expects this amendment to have the support of the government, which is at pains to differentiate Australia's financial system from some of those in Asia and to dispel overseas ideas that our markets are rigged by insiders, like some Asian financial markets. This amendment should provide early warning, because investors raising queries on documents with the ASC may well act as an early warning system for spotting potential problems of fund mismanagement, and it does not affect strategic decision making.</para><para>This right of investors to know does not cut across fund managers' strategic decision making or prejudice beneficial investment opportunities for investors since the documents and reports would normally go to the ASC after investment decisions have been made and implemented. It would only be in a rare case of dispute over legality or propriety of disposed investment that reports might become public in advance. But that is proper and appropriate, as investors ought to know if there are serious questions over proposed investments.</para><para>In relation to avoiding exemption in the freedom of information, as the Freedom of Information Act applies to the Australian Securities Commission, it is necessary to ensure that the intention of this section is not thwarted by claims of exemption under the act, such as client privilege or commercial in confidence. It is simply not appropriate that an investor seeking information as to what has been done with his or her money be met with any ground of refusal by an administrative body charged with a duty of monitoring the investment scheme.</para><para>There should be a cap on price. Investors are free to take copies of documents with their own equipment, such as portable scanners, without being charged, or to have the ASC provide copies for them at not more than 20c per page. This figure is reasonable in light of the fees and taxes paid by investors towards the ASC's running costs—otherwise, the government would be getting us to pay twice.   </para><para>What we are saying is more than reasonable. Basically, we are saying that we should have some transparency with people's money. Honourable senators may remember that, when the Greens (WA) asked that people have access to information about their superannuation funds originally—that is, where their money was going—shock, horror, the world was going to fall apart. Now we are proudly told by the insurance industry that this is part of normal practice; all good insurance companies do it—and, of course, there are legal requirements in there. We were part of the process which required that to happen—and the world did not end. In fact, it is considered to be quite good commercial practice for people to be able to tell others where their choices are within superannuation.</para><para>So I do not believe that the world will end here either. We are talking about people's basic right to know what is being done with their money—not anybody else's money. We are not protecting some commercial in confidence relating to otherwise unknown entities; we are talking about people being able to access what is happening to their own money. Hence, I would commend this amendment to the Senate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>3657</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—A few points that Senator Margetts makes demand a response.

They also require the compliance committee to report its assessment of the adequacy of the compliance plan to the ASC as well as to the SRE. Currently, this bill only requires the compliance committee to report to the Australian Securities Commission if it is satisfied the SRE has not taken or will not take appropriate action. Currently, the Australian Securities Commission is not privy at all to the comments on the adequacy of the compliance plan.</para><para>Why is it necessary? It increases the independent watchdog role. It is not enough to tell the responsible entity what it, itself, has done and only report to the Australian Securities Commission if the responsible entity has taken no action to remedy those breaches. If the compliance committee has to wait until the responsible entity takes action—if it takes action—before informing the regulator, the compliance committee's role as independent watchdog is severely weakened.</para><para>In terms of timing, significant damage may occur to members' investments in the meantime through improper dealings and possibly fraud. It facilitates early detection of problems. Although it seems a routine matter, a report on these matters to the ASC will serve as an early warning mechanism that there may be problems with the quality or level of compliance required of the responsible entity and, thus, larger, more serious problems can be averted. If the SRE knows that all breaches will be reported to the Australian Securities Commission, they have an incentive to ensure that they are following the compliance plan to the letter. It is not an onerous requirement; this extra requirement will require no more than a postage stamp or the electricity required for a fax or an e-mail.</para><para>Greens (WA) amendment No. 21 relates to independent advice available to the compliance committee. It allows the compliance committee to have independent legal, accounting, computing or other specialist professional advice to assist it in making assessments. 
 Why is it necessary? In carrying out its functions in an independent fashion, the compliance committee may need this advice. It should have the right to acquire such advice independently and at the expense of the responsible entity so that it can perform its functions thoroughly. One wonders what they might be forced to do if they did not have that right.</para><para>Amendment No. 22 increases duties on compliance committee members. Compliance committee members are required to act solely in the interests of members. Why? Because under the bill the duties of compliance committee members are significantly less strict than those of the board of directors. Because the compliance committee members stand in the place of independent directors and have the role of scheme watchdog in the absence of an independent trustee, the members of the compliance committee should have at least the same scope of responsibility as the directors of the responsible entity. Compliance committee members should act as fiduciaries solely in the interest of investors; they should not be the servants of two masters.</para><para>Amendment No. 23 relates to new section 601JD(3). This requires that each member report any compliance breaches to the ASC. Why not? It requires that compliance committee members are given qualified privilege regarding notification of breaches to the Australian Securities Commission so that they have some protection and thus will not be reluctant to perform their duty to notify the Australian Securities Commission. It is necessary to create a positive duty. Although it is stated to be a function of the compliance committee itself, placing a positive duty on each member of the committee ensures that breaches must be reported.</para><para>Arguably, a statement of function is not the same as a positive duty to do something, nor is it as strong an indication of the importance of the requirement. Thus the committee members should have a positive duty to report breaches of the constitution, of the compliance plan and of the Corporations Law of which they become aware as soon as possible to the ASC. Remember that we have heard that there is no guarantee that the members 
 are going to know that these things are happening. These are the same requirements as those placed on the auditor of the compliance plan.</para><para>Amendment No. 23 also has a new subsection 601JD(4), which gives compliance committee members access to documents. For compliance committee members to be effective, they must have access as of right to the records, documents and offices of the responsible entity. How would they report otherwise? This amendment gives them the same rights of access to information enjoyed by the compliance plan auditor under section 601HG(5) and 601HG(6).</para><para>Amendment No. 23 also inserts a new subsection 601JD(5). This makes compliance committee members directly liable to investors for failure to perform their statutory duties. It enables greater accountability, and a high level of responsibility and accountability such as this strengthens investor protection and, should I say, investor confidence. Compliance committee members will take their responsibilities seriously and remain vigilant regarding compliance by the responsible entity if this is the case.</para><para>Considering that I have put all my arguments together, I will be very pleased to hear the details of why the government this time does not like them. Of course, I am still happy to see that there will be some review of this later if all of them are knocked back.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>3660</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I can assure Senator Margetts that this scheme will be kept under review by the parliament and also by the government, and most definitely on a day-to-day basis by the ASIC.</para></talk.start><para>I will respond specifically to the amendments moved by the Greens (WA), firstly Nos 16 to 20. These amendments attack, not in an aggressive way but in a philosophical way, the concept of the responsible entity. We are trying to build here a culture of compliance within managed investment schemes, where the responsibility is placed on the directors. That is different to the concept of having an outside trustee looking over the shoulders of the directors and other third parties all trying 
 to have their say. We are trying to build structures within managed investment organisations that create a culture of compliance, and the compliance committee is part of that. It has functions as defined in the law, and in many respects the Greens' amendments say that they have quite specific duties and try to set out those duties in a check list sort of approach. I guess members of compliance committees could, if they had ticked the boxes, say, `I have been a good compliance committee member,' just by ticking that box that the law places in front of them, and then forget the other duties and responsibilities they might owe.</para><para>The bill seeks to adopt what we consider the more correct position, the one that will maximise investor protection. Under this position, the compliance committee must report any breaches to the responsible entity and it also must report the breaches to the ASC if it believes that the responsible entity is failing to act. In other words, if the responsible entity has had a report made by the compliance committee and the responsible entity fails to act on that report, the ASC must be advised. We think that seeks the right balance. It is encouraging internal redress before you run off to the ASC. The ASC certainly does not need to be made aware of each and every breach, no matter how minor or inadvertent. But, if there is failure to act, certainly it becomes a responsibility of the compliance committee to inform the ASC.</para><para>We also note that under section 601FC(1)(l) the responsible entity is under a duty to report to the ASC any breach of the law that has had or is likely to have a materially adverse effect on members' interests as soon as practical after it becomes aware of the breach.</para><para>Greens' amendment No. 21, together with Greens' amendments Nos 22 and 23—these comments relate equally to those now cognated amendments—would probably create a situation where the members of the compliance committee owed fiduciary duties directly to investors in the scheme. As I have said a couple of times, this begins to undermine the foundations of the single responsible entity concept, and once you do that you then undermine the move that the Managed Invest 
 ments Bill sets up—that is, creating a direct fiduciary responsibility, uninterrupted, between the responsible entity and the investors.</para><para>Once again, the amendment—I do not think it is doing so intentionally—seeks to undermine this concept. It seeks to set up an array of fiduciary obligations to members which may well conflict with those of the responsible entity or confuse members as to the responsible entity's duties. This is the problem. If you are all of a sudden whittling away at the responsible entity concept by setting up fiduciary responsibilities around that entity to the extent that those bodies, compliance committees and other parts of the structure, owe fiduciary responsibilities directly to investors, you reduce the responsibility of the directors of the responsible entity.</para><para>That is what is at the core of the concept. You want to keep the directors of the responsible entity wholly and fully responsible to the investors. Sure, you can contract out managerial type responsibilities within the scheme, but they cannot, and cannot be allowed to by the law, contract out their fiduciary responsibility to the investors, which is paramount in this scheme.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>3661</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—If we get a situation where perhaps the whole of the committee knows that a director is doing the wrong thing and they are not required by law to say anything, what will be the legal comeback after that?</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>3661</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—They are required to.

So, even if the compliance committee are not fulfilling their duties, the auditors will pick up on that. We believe it is an integrated structure that offers the best protection for investors and protection of the investors' funds. It is also a different approach to that which is built into the existing scheme, where you are relying on a number of different organisations, primarily the trustee

A member of the compliance committee under subsection 601JD(2) is required to take all reasonable steps to assist the ASC—so it is quite a positive duty there—in carrying out a check under subsection 601FF(1).</para><para>In terms of providing information to the ASC, which is a matter Senator Margetts has just raised in relation to the Crown matter, 601JE states:</para><para>A member of a scheme's compliance committee has qualified privilege in respect of a statement concerning the operation of the scheme made by or on behalf of the committee, or a member of the committee, to the responsible entity or to the ASC.

This is a problem that I am trying to wrestle with. I think the functions of the compliance committee are quite important.

Therefore, if one took a rigid reading of legislation—the reading I am prone to always take, I must say—then there is no need to unnecessarily clutter the bill with explanatory amendments which are not needed when one can read into this the normal rights and responsibilities of a body such as a compliance committee or the rights, responsibilities and duties of members.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The question now, though, however sums down in my mind to whether I ought to vote for amendment 21 on the grounds that it provides a signpost in the legislation which may direct people in doubt as to what their rights are to, in fact, what their rights might be. So that we are not taking things as understood or read within the legislation; it is clearly stated in there. As I say, my normal approach to this is not to clutter legislation unnecessarily. From time to time I have voted against amendments which simply restate provisions that are written in the law everywhere in the bill and make it a cluttered and unreadable document. I often vote against amendments which set out general statements.

You either go to your constitution—or  your memorandum and articles, as they used to be—or you go to the act. This specific area is an area in which, in my view, a compliance committee may be populated by people who may not be aware of the forceful approach that they might be entitled to take. Let us assume that they have some fund managers who are in turn rather forceful. Those fund managers may persuade them that to go in this direction would exceed their brief or what they are allowed to do.

The essence of our argument has been that we accept that the government has the right to pursue a different direction with this bill. We accept that the government may have the right to determine that future schemes should be shaped in a manner which is determined by the government, and which all investors would know is the law, because that would be the basis on which they first enter those schemes.</para><para>Our problem has consistently been with investors who are in existing schemes, who are going to find their funds changed as a result of this law, without them having any say in that whatsoever. We have consistently argued that it is contrary to the coalition's own belief in choice, and it is contrary to good and ethical practice, for that to occur. So Democrat amendment 15 goes to the heart 
 of choice: that where investors' own money is at stake, they should have the right to determine in existing schemes whether the existing format continues or whether they move to the government's new format. We are not talking about future schemes, we are talking about existing schemes.</para><para>This amendment refers to the situation where the two bodies presently existing have the opportunity to give a retirement notice. It refers to what happens if neither of the bodies gives a retirement notice. What the Democrats have recommended here is that after the first year, if neither the manager nor the trustee has retired, transitional period fund managers—and the transitional period, as you know, is two years—and trustees must separately devise the for and against cases for their scheme, have their cases approved in a form acceptable to the ASC which would ensure therefore that they are objectively and truthfully put, and put them to the vote of investors in that existing fund. We have proposed that a simple majority should determine the outcome.</para><para>If, as the proponents and the supporters of the bill argue, and as the government argues, the case for single responsible entities is so overwhelming, then investors will surely plump for them. We are suggesting to you, Parliamentary Secretary, and to the government, that if this is your belief you should have faith in it and not be afraid to offer the investors choice in case they do not go with your model.</para><para>Especially when you have majors such as the AMP, recently launched on the Stock Exchange with an immense thump, when you have the Bankers Trust, when you have these huge corporations like Lend Lease or very smart market operators like Macquarie, they should be able to show investors that their capital, legal and accounting resources make it possible for them to do without a trustee. But not giving investors a choice implies a fear by the government and the proponents and the supporters of this bill that investors in existing funds—not in future funds—may in fact disagree. I say to you, if they do disagree, that is their right; it is their money. It 
 is their right to disagree. It is their right to choose to retain the existing set-up.</para><para>The trustees are independent from the managers of the funds, are presently licensed by the ASC and are paid from trust assets. They are in a fiduciary relationship with members of the fund scheme. They hold the legal title to trust assets as custodian. They monitor compliance with the manager's obligations under the trust deed and they take enforcement action on behalf of fund members where the manager is in breach of the trust deed.</para><para>I have had enough conversations with you, Parliamentary Secretary Campbell, and I have heard enough from you in the hearings and on the Senate floor to know that you can point to deficiencies in that relationship. I accept that there are deficiencies. What I do not accept is that investors should not be able to choose whether they stay with a system that they are familiar with even if it does have deficiencies and warts. That is my problem. My problem is not that we disagree philosophically; my problem is that existing investors are going to be compelled to change from a set-up where they may indeed find themselves more secure.</para><para>Much better informed people than any of us senators in this place have said there is greater risk from this scheme. I am quite aware, too, that much better informed people have said there is less risk in the scheme. There are two sides to the coin. But why take the risk? Why not allow investors to make the choice? If we are to allow trustees a role in these cases in which they are desired by investors, desired by people—it is their money—then we felt that in this amendment that role needs to be spelt out. If you go through the amendment—it is a fairly lengthy one but it does have the virtue of having been pre-circulated—you will see that we have spelt out, both in common law and in statutory law, the understood functions of a trustee.</para><para>I am pretty certain, because I have had long conversations with the Parliamentary Secretary, that he will stand up and say no to my amendment. But my plea is to the remainder of the Senate to pay attention to the needs of 
 investors in existing schemes because the alternative—to paraphrase or to badly quote somebody else—is too ghastly to contemplate. If as a result of the choice here you end up in a situation where investors are not given that choice, and if by some chance that none us can foresee, particularly the government, whose heart is wholly behind this, some major fund goes belly-up and one of the problems is that people lose their money because a scheme is changed without regard to their own interests and their own wishes and their own needs as to how they deal with their money, I am not sure how we in this place would feel, but the government may find itself in serious legal trouble.</para><para>I would certainly institute a class action if I were such an investor, or I would get other people to institute one with me, because I do not think the government should take unto itself the legislative right to change the existing ways people are investing their money without their having the opportunity to say yes or no as to whether they agree. So that is the purpose of this amendment. I commend it to the Senate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>3671</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I do not know if we will be raining writs of mandamus.

It would have been a very neat way for me to have assuaged the concerns of my friends in the trustee industry. It would have been very easy for me and very personally pleasant for me to say, `It is okay; we are going to grandfather you all and we can all be friends.' That would have been a very easy policy decision to make. But CASC and the Law Reform Commission looked at it. I didn't know until today that they had, quite frankly. They looked at the concept of grandfathering and said that it was the wrong thing to do because you would end up with two different regulatory regimes for two different sorts of schemes.</para></talk.start><para>I came to that decision.

Existing investors in managed investment schemes can, under Labor's amendments, have a choice in the way that that scheme's assets are held. The way that the government's bill is currently framed, the investors in existing schemes have only one option in this area, and that is to withdraw from the scheme, which will involve transaction costs.</para><para>Under the government's bill, if after 12 months neither the fund manager nor the trustee of a scheme have left the field and allowed the other party to become the SRE, there must be a meeting of scheme members to determine what is to be done with the scheme. At the meeting of members, the members can choose to either wind up the scheme or they can choose which entity—the funds manager or the trustee—they would like to become the SRE. However, under Labor's amendment, scheme members will be able to direct not only which entity they would like to become the SRE but also how they would like the SRE to hold the scheme assets. That is, investors will be able to determine whether they wish the SRE to engage the services of a third party to hold the scheme's assets. The third party may or may not be related to the SRE.</para><para>Labor's two amendments intend to provide that, if neither the manager nor the trustee of an existing scheme retires in the first year of transition, then at the subsequent meeting of investors they may decide whether or not custody shall be undertaken by a third party. The provision is not, however, intended to restrict investors' choice in this regard to a party unrelated to the SRE, nor is it intended to require a  resolution appointing a specific party to hold scheme assets. The third party agent employed by the SRE will still have to be approved by the ASC as part of the licensing arrangements. SREs will have the right to appoint any custodial agent they see fit as long as it is in the boundaries of the direction provided by investors at the meeting of members. However, the agent must still be approved by the ASC. Labor's amendment gives investors in existing schemes a choice of custodial arrangement. Given that much of the debate on managed investments has been about custodial arrangements, these are important amendments.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>3673</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The government will support these amendments.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>3673</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Australian Democrats support both amendments.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>3674</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—That makes it unanimous, unless anybody else says so.

This organisation has effectively represented the views of young people for many years, and it has received government funding since 1991, enabling it to provide a voice for young people throughout Australia. Unfortunately, this voice is now telling the Howard government what it does not want to hear. This is a diverse group and they speak as they find the issue. Recently they have found that their members were concerned about issues such as work for the dole and the youth allowance. It is unfortunate that the reaction of the Howard government has not been to heed these views; it has been to attempt to silence them.</para></talk.start><para>The Howard government apparently cannot take constructive criticism on these issues. It is apparent that the government is not prepared to listen to the views of the people most affected by its policies or those that represent them. So the decision to cut funding to this key body reflects poorly on the government but particularly on Minister Kemp. It seems that this is a spiteful decision by the government. AYPAC is—perhaps soon I will be saying was—a diverse coalition of youth organisations and networks. Their members include such radical bodies as rural youth, the scouts, the guides, YMCA, Fusion, the youth affairs council and networks in each state and territory.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Senator Chris Evans interjecting</inline>—</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>8O6</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name></talker><para>—Terrible, Senator Evans! These are hardly radical organisations. AYPAC represents some 750,000 young Australians through over 400 organisational and individual members. Full membership was open to non-government national youth organisations and to state youth affairs councils from each state or territory. These groups combined to make up a national representative board of 19 members.</para></talk.start></continue><para>With such a membership base, AYPAC truly represented the views and interests of 
 young people from all walks of life and from all over Australia. AYPAC's role was as an umbrella group, and that allowed a coordinated response from youth and youth organisations to government on government initiatives. It has been a mechanism to encourage greater coordination and cooperation among youth groups by bringing together diverse organisations to identify problems and discuss solutions.</para><para>AYPAC has also participated in a wide range of policy and program advisory committees, including the national youth affairs research scheme; the youth task force of the Ministerial Council on Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs; the partnership subcommittee of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation; and various telecommunications forums. When the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Anderson, sought young Australians to travel to Rome to represent Australia at the International Food Summit and Youth Forum, AYPAC provided them.</para><para>It is not surprising, however, that the government has sought to silence this group. We are on the eve, I must say, of the introduction of the youth allowance. This policy has been met with great concern from young people all over this country. No slick advertising campaign will change the fact that it discriminates against young Australians. In a climate of rising youth unemployment, apparently the best that this government can come up with is a youth round table that will meet twice a year with 50 participants who have been hand-picked by the minister. While this discussion group will be dealing with issues such as youth suicide, employment and training, there is unfortunately no follow-up mechanism.</para><para>Minister Kemp apparently is bent on setting up a committee that will tell him only what he wants to hear. Unfortunately, he ignores the views of young Australians at his peril—and, of course, at the peril of this government. It gives the appearance that this government does not really want to listen to young people, to young Australians; it gives the impression that this government does not want to hear their views. This is a decision which will be 
 seen as a slap in the face for all young Australians.</para><para>If Minister Kemp and Mr Howard are serious about understanding the issues affecting young people, then they will reconsider their decision, they will reinstate funding for AYPAC and they will allow that organisation to continue on with the good work that it has been carrying out. It is AYPAC that will provide, that can provide and that would, given the opportunity, provide an impartial voice for young Australians.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Australian Youth Policy and Action Coalition</title><page.no>3675</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>3675</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise on the same matter and perhaps begin where Senator O'Brien has left off—at the axing, if you like, of the Australian Youth Policy and Action Coalition. Not only are we asking or urging the government to reconsider this decision, we are demanding that Dr David Kemp, the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, reverse this incredibly negative and regressive decision.</para></talk.start><para>We have condemned in this place today, and last week after the announcement was made, the decision of the government to shut down—that is, to defund—this nation's national peak representative body for young people, AYPAC. It was last Thursday, 18 June, that the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Dr David Kemp, announced—having told or effectively given the organisation a fortnight's notice only 20 minutes before the announcement was made publicly—that the government would not be renewing AYPAC's contract for this year, and that contract is now due to expire on 30 June.</para><para>That is a bit suspicious really, considering what starts on 1 July—and that is, the governments's common youth allowance. I just wonder exactly how bad the government expects its CYA legislation or policy to be, in that it has effectively banned any dissenting or consultative voice from young people. At a time when introducing its common youth allowance—effectively, the day before its 
 introduction—the government has chosen to throw away the expertise and networks that have been amassed since AYPAC's inception in 1991.</para><para>Instead of an expert, well resourced, permanent youth body, the government has stated that the only input young people will have on youth policy will be through twice yearly meetings of a select few—basically, 50 young people. There is no indication whatsoever that these people will be given adequate resources to support the development of policy and to advise the government.</para><para>The defunding of AYPAC is yet another broken promise, another non-core promise, from this government. In fact, this coalition actually acknowledged the important role that AYPAC played in its 1996 federal election document, `Giving hope to our young'—which, of course, was released before the election. It promised that the Howard government would `improve the effectiveness of government in responding to the needs and concerns of young Australians by consulting directly with young Australians around the nation through formal representative organisations such as AYPAC.'</para><para>AYPAC has been an invaluable resource not only in the provision of policy advice to successive governments but also in assisting those who work with young people, providing information through newsletters, holding conferences on youth issues and as a forum for national youth organisations throughout the country. AYPAC has hosted wide ranging projects, such as a non-English speaking background youth project and an indigenous youth project. The latter was funded by the reconciliation council for three years and resulted in, among other things, a document called <inline font-style="italic">Compact</inline>—a publication that gives valuable guidance on how to be part of the process of reconciliation. It is a document I was glad to quote from during Democrat contributions to the Wik debate.</para><para>Through the indigenous youth project, AYPAC assisted organisations to improve their networks and work better to help indigenous young people, and advocated for their needs. The circumstances that young indigenous people are in, in regard to hous 
 ing, health, education, unemployment, incarceration, et cetera, are all worsening. AYPAC is one organisation which has been well placed to ensure the issues of those most disadvantaged are addressed. I remind this chamber that the first budget brought down by this government cut ATSIC's funding by $470 million, forcing ATSIC to abolish its community and youth support program. This has left organisations like AYPAC as the only advocate—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>C16</name.id><name role="metadata">HEFFERNAN</name><name role="display">Senator Heffernan</name></talker><para>—Didn't stop them paying Sugar Ray Robinson $1 million.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3I6</name.id><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name></talker><para>—Hang your head in shame, Senator, through you, Madam President. I think many young people today are not interested in your interjections, Senator Heffernan, because they know that organisations like AYPAC have been left to pick up the pieces. They are one of the few advocates for young indigenous people in this nation today. AYPAC has held two national conferences, the Youth Gatherings of 1996 and 1994. These conferences provided training for youth workers and young people, publicised—yes, publicised—government programs, and developed policy. AYPAC is uniquely placed for this sort of role.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In the last few weeks AYPAC has been working with DEETYA's coordinator of the 41 new youth officers in order to link them into existing youth affairs networks. This is exactly the sort of liaison between government and non-government organisations that we all should be encouraging and that AYPAC was perfectly placed to provide and assist with. Now Dr Kemp, the minister, is proposing that DEETYA will consult directly with peak bodies representing young people across Australia.</para><para>AYPAC is an organisation of peak bodies, and Senator O'Brien has just referred to a number of bodies included in AYPAC, such as the Scouts and the Girl Guides. Yes, Senator O'Brien, through you, Madam President, they are not exactly the most subversive organisations in Australia, yet this government is still pretty scared of the concept of an umbrella, united organisation representing young people. Other groups include the YWCA, the YMCA, the Society of St Vincent 
 de Paul, the Australian Association of Adolescent Health, the National Union of Students, Australian Rural Youth, as well of course as the state and territory youth affairs bodies.</para><para>These organisations, through the AYPAC board, have already formulated policy and advice for government and the youth sector. The rationale of the minister is that he wants to give young people more direct input into government. It actually seems to deliberately ignore the range of activities that AYPAC is already responsible for—the kind of activities that they already conduct, that they facilitate—that do provide direct input to government policy for young Australians.</para><para>I am not intending to criticise the government's voices of youth initiatives—the round table and, apparently, support for the YMCA youth parliaments, an event that has been going on for a number of years with, I believe, minimal government assistance—because I am not suggesting that these are not potentially incredibly worthy endeavours. But Dr Kemp purports that the round table will replace AYPAC's wide-ranging functions. This is comparing apples with apple orchards, if you like. Why not complement the work of AYPAC, or add to, or perhaps value add to, with this so-called twice yearly round table that the government seems to prefer?</para><para>Is this government afraid of meeting with young people? Or is it that it just does not want to deal with young people, that it restricts its meetings with young people to two meetings a year? I was astounded in question time today to hear Senator Ellison, the minister representing the minister, in this place suggest that one of the opportunities being made available for young people to input into government policy and discussion was an Internet site. Great—let's go to a chat room with Dr David Kemp; I can't think of anything more exciting. This government seems to be very cyber friendly, what about contacting and dealing with young people and consulting with young people directly, face to face, not just twice a year?</para><para>Fifty individuals on this round table, without resources or research facilities, meeting twice a year, does not constitute a policy formulation process. It is an insult to Austral 
 ian young people to claim that their concerns can be addressed in this way. Is the government intending to defund the Australian Council on the Ageing? Will they claim that perhaps flying in 50 older Australians to a function twice a year serves as a sufficient means of consulting with them? No—because this is a political decision. They are not cutting AYPAC's funding because they have to; it is because they want to. As Michael Raper of ACOSS commented:</para><para>This is not the first time the government has withdrawn funding at short notice from an organisation that was publicly critical of some of their policies. The Government should recognise that silencing voices in opposition does not reduce the negative impact many of their policies are having on low income and disadvantaged groups.</para><para>It makes no sense to create such a valuable resource for young people in government and then disband it. There has been a peak national body in this nation for 20 years. The predecessor of AYPAC was the Youth Affairs Council of Australia, established in 1979, and every government since then has been able to work with it. They may not always agree and like what they say, but they have worked with it—except this government. It is a mean-spirited and nasty move by the federal government to destroy a long-established organisation through which the major youth organisations around Australia are able to liaise and develop policy on the issues facing young people. This can only be seen as a political decision—a nasty, regressive decision designed to silence the voice of young people in this country.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Illegal Immigrants</title><page.no>3677</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>3677</page.no><name role="metadata">McKiernan, Sen James</name><name role="display">Senator McKIERNAN</name><name.id>1I4</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to return to one of my well versed themes that I have used in this place on a number of occasions, that is, migration matters, particularly dealing with illegal migration.</para></talk.start><para>On Saturday, 13 June of this year the <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline> newspaper, under the headline `Fishermen in migrant racket', reported on the sentencing of a number of Indonesian fishermen who were convicted in Australian courts in Broome and in Darwin of landing illegal migrants in Australia. The group of four 
 Indonesians in Broome were given sentences of seven months and those in Darwin were given sentences of eight months—they were mainly young men. The people who brought the illegal immigrants into Broome by boat were paid the equivalent of $508, which is around one year's salary for the fisherpeople, and the ones in Darwin did much better because they got paid the equivalent of $1,000—this is information that was given to the respective courts. Seventeen Bangladeshis were brought in through Darwin, so it is no small problem.</para><para>The Federal Police agent who investigated it is quoted in the newspaper as saying that it was a big worry that the lure of easy money would prompt a spate of Indonesian fishermen to take part in illegal immigration rackets. The newspaper report continues:</para><para>He said federal police were mounting a crackdown to send a clear message to the fishermen that it was not worth the risk. But this was hard because the money was better and easier than fishing. If they were caught, they at least knew their families were taken care of while they enjoyed three good meals a day in an Australian jail.</para><para>Racketeers approached fishermen to transport the immigrants because they knew the way, were experienced ocean-goers and many were poor and desperate enough to cooperate. "They are very easy targets at the moment, with the situation over there, because the money's ripe," Agent Curtis said. "Our information is that it's fairly organised. Indonesia seems to be the launching place."</para><para>The article continues:</para><para>Last month, in the Northern Territory, another eight Bangladeshi men were found wandering near Gove, in Arnhem Land, after being dumped by an Indonesian fishing boat crew.</para><para>In sentencing the four Indonesians in Broome to seven months gaol on the Wednesday of the week preceding this article, Magistrate Col Roberts said that a deterrence policy was needed. I would certainly agree with the magistrate. But from a visit to Broome I made last week I found that perhaps a sentence to prison is not in itself a deterrent. I found out something that particularly disturbed me: the individuals who are apprehended and sentenced could actually be making money out of it. Even though they are only paid a pittance by our standards—whilst they serve time in prison they are paid $13.44 
 per 
 week—for somebody who is sentenced to 12 months, that is pretty close to the equivalent of the salary they would be receiving for carrying out their normal occupation back in Indonesia, and generally that is fishing. So it could actually be an incentive for people to keep coming here.</para><para>I have mentioned the people smuggling, but I am equally disturbed to note, from my visit to the Willie Creek detention centre in Broome on Friday last, that the fisheries authorities, the people who patrol our fisheries zones, have apprehended 50 fishing boats illegally fishing in Australian waters so far this year. That is a record number of apprehensions. One individual in the detention centre is there for his eighth visit; it is the eighth time that he has been apprehended, in some instances has served time in prison and then was sent back at enormous expense to the Australian taxpayer. There are the detention costs and then the repatriation costs as well.</para><para>It appears, because of the situation in Indonesia, that there is a real incentive for these people to risk coming to fish illegally in Australian waters. If they come down and get a reasonably good catch and are not apprehended by our authorities, they have made money. Even if they are apprehended, charged with illegal fishing and then sentenced, they can still go back home with a significant amount of money. There is a catch, however. Our Migration Act has a clause in it which says that money can be taken from them when they are removed from Australia to be put towards the detention costs. It appears that these well-travelled individuals are quite aware of that. So, after earning their money in the prison—usually Broome prison, which I suppose is not the nicest place in the world, but you can be imprisoned in worse parts of the world—they transfer the money into goods, such as colour TVs, CD players and on one occasion gold watches. They bring them out of Australia back to their fishing village or wherever they have come from and they sell it and they have made the money for the trip.</para><para>That is very disturbing for a number of reasons. Our fisheries in that region of the 
 world need protection, otherwise we would not be protecting them to the degree that Australia is protecting them. If they are not protected, they will be fished out in a very quick time, I am told. I do not pretend to be an expert on this particular subject, but I did receive a very detailed briefing from some fisheries officers in Broome on Friday last. I did appreciate that, and I commend them and the people at Coastwatch and at other organisations who are involved in the protection of our fisheries.</para><para>I hope that my raising this subject here tonight will encourage some people, be it the immigration department, the Australian fisheries authorities or the authorities in the Western Australian government, to take some action on this. I do not think it is good enough that we in Australia are offering an incentive to people to break our laws and to have them benefit from the breaches of our laws. I think something has to be done about it. We have had 50 fishing vessels breach our borders and illegally fish in our waters. You see the photographs of the catch they have taken and you hear some of the horrific stories of them taking sharks, for example. They just take the fin; they do not take any other part of the body any more because the fin is the most important and expensive part of the animal. We cannot allow this to continue. I would hope that our Western Australian government might also look at this problem as well and look at the policy of payment to individuals while they are serving time in prison.</para><para>I am further disturbed to be told—and this is second-hand information, no stronger than that—that these individuals, the Indonesian fishermen who have been apprehended, have been sentenced and are being released on parole to do work around the town of Broome. That work can be pruning, it can be sweeping the streets or it can be just generally tidying up. But it can also be working in the homes of some of the aged people in the community. I was told that some of the people have been approaching the residents of Broome, seeking cigarettes and money from them. These people are not legally in Australia, even though they are in prison. There is a 
 duty of care on the authorities, in my opinion, to ensure that they are not wandering unsupervised, as it would appear, through the streets of Broome.</para><para>I hope that my words here, brief though they may be on this occasion, will spark some action. I know our immigration officials are already concerned about this and I would hope, perhaps in the near future, that our Joint Standing Committee on Migration might be able to have a look at it.

The draft standard prescribes mandatory labelling for any food that is or contains components produced using gene technology containing new or altered genetic material and not substantially equivalent in any characteristic or property to a conventionally consumed food.</para><para>(2)—(4) and (15)—(25) In the context of the draft standard, substantially equivalent in regard to a characteristic or property of the food means that the nutritional and compositional value of the food falls within the normal range for similar foods that are or contain foods derived by conventional breeding methods. This includes that the food does not contain higher levels of anti-nutritional factors or natural toxicants or introduced allergenic factors and does not lead to the food having a different pattern of dietary exposure. 
</para><para>A determination of substantial equivalence can be carried out at the level of the food source or at the level of the specific food product. This involves a consideration of the molecular characterisation of the new food source; phenotypic characteristics of the new food source in comparison to an appropriate comparator already in the food supply; and the compositional analysis of the new food source or the specific food product in comparison to the comparator. The comparison may be made to the parental line/strain and/or other edible lines/strains of the same species, or it can build on a comparison of the derived food product (eg, protein, carbohydrate, fat) with a comparable conventional food product.</para><para>The application of the principle of substantial equivalence to safety assessment enables the public health and safety risks of the food to be characterised by reference to the known public health and safety characteristics of its conventionally bred counterpart. All relevant effects are taken into account in determining `substantial equivalence*.</para><para>(5)—(6) Australia is party to two World Trade Organisation (WTO) Agreements which are relevant to foods. The Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS) addresses measures necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or health. The Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) addresses technical regulations and standards to ensure the quality of exports; protection of human, animal or plant life or health, or the environment; or for the prevention of deceptive practices. These agreements oblige Australia to ensure that its regulations and standards are applied consistently, are based on sound data and are no more trade restrictive than is necessary to achieve a legitimate objective.</para><para>(7) The draft standard is consistent with the requirements of the WTO SPS and TBT agreements in that it provides a level of consumer protection for safety and deception, consistent with other existing food standards, without imposing undue restrictions on the movement of goods in trade.</para><para>(8) There is currently no specific regulation of foods from gene technology. If the draft standard is not implemented then consumers would not be assured that foods from gene technology had been assessed and found to be safe before they were sold and that where these foods were compositionally or nutritionally different they would be informed.</para><para>(9) The issue of whether the labelling of foods containing new or altered genetic material which is substantially equivalent is, or is not, useful information for consumers has been assessed by ANZFA in the context of all potential sources of information likely to be available to consumers. ANZFA is concerned to ensure that a comprehensive approach is taken to ensure consumers have access 
 to adequate information which would allow them to make informed choices.</para><para>In regard to the value of mandatory labelling, ANZFA has given particular attention to the comprehensive labelling requirements enacted in the European Union. This regulation allows "may contain" labelling statements where the presence of a genetically modified component is uncertain. ANZFA has questioned whether the statement "may contain" is of value as it has the potential to be required on a very large number of foods. Such a statement may be of value to the extent that a consumer totally opposed to the processes of gene technology could avoid any food bearing the appropriate label. However, for a consumer wishing to make a choice on the basis of perceived relative benefits of a food produced using gene technology compared to a conventional counterpart, or between two foods produced using gene technology, the statement "may contain" is of little value. In addition, it is likely that a number of foods bearing this label would in fact contain no genetically modified component and, in that respect, such labelling has the potential to be deceptive. Therefore, to introduce full mandatory labelling, resulting in the proliferation of such "may contain" labelling statements, could in fact distract a consumer from making an informed choice.</para><para>(10)—(13) ANZFA is currently undertaking a comprehensive review of the Australian Food Standards Code. In developing or reviewing food standards, the ANZFA must have regard to the objectives outlined in section 10 of the Australia New Zealand Food Authority Act 1991.</para><para>Consistent with these statutory objectives, the review will, where possible: reduce the level of prescriptiveness of standards to facilitate innovation by allowing wider permission on the use of ingredients and additives, but with consideration of the possible increased need for consumer information; develop standards which are easier to understand and make amendment more straight forward; replace standards which regulate individual foods with standards that apply across all foods or a range of foods; consider the possibility of industry codes of practice as an alternative to regulation; and facilitate harmonisation of food standards between Australia and New Zealand.</para><para>The review will also be carried out in accordance with the competition policy principles which have been adopted by the Council of Australian Governments. These principles require the review of all business regulation to remove unnecessary obstacles to competition, and an assessment of the social, environmental and economic impacts as well as the impacts on health of proposed regulation on all affected sectors of the community.</para><para>Through this review ANZFA will ensure that mandatory food labelling is only required for 
 information which has been assessed as necessary, having regard to voluntary labelling and to the other sources of information available to consumers. ANZFA will also ensure that standards are enforceable and that any standards which cannot be enforced are deleted.</para><para>(14) ANZFA is aware of a number of surveys undertaken in Australia and overseas in which a majority of consumers have expressed a desire for foods produced using gene technology to be labelled. ANZFA considers that it is the primary responsibility of industry to provide consumers with information on such foods where these are substantially equivalent to their conventionally bred counterparts and is committed to working with industry and consumers to facilitate the provision of such information.</para><para>(16)—(17) There is no intrinsic reason why a food derived from a plant or animal which contains new or altered genetic material should not be the same as food derived from a plant or animal which does not contain new or altered genetic materials. Any differences will result from the specific genetic material present and the way in which it is expressed. Traditional breeding techniques would not normally result in the introduction of genetic material from one phyla to another, although, wide-crossing and similar techniques can be used to transfer genetic material between species which do not normally interbreed.</para><para>(18)—(19) Genetic engineering provides a means for introducing a precise sequence of DNA into a genome. The exact position of each insertion and the level of expression will vary from insertion to insertion. Screening is used to determine which insertions are then selected for further commercial development.</para><para>(20) The frequency of successful transfer of genetic material from one genome to another will depend upon the techniques used, the species to which the technique is applied and the level of expression of inserted genetic material desired.</para><para>(21) Inserted genetic material is not necessarily stable. Stability in a commercial product is ensured by screening prior to approval for release of a genetically modified organism. Only organisms containing material found to be stable are approved by the Genetic Manipulation Advisory Committee (GMAC) for release into the environment.</para><para>(22)—(23) The use of marker genes and the types of marker genes selected will depend upon the techniques used and the organisms involved. The ANZFA draft standard will ensure that any food that is or contains components produced using gene technology will be assessed for safety before it can be sold. This assessment will include consideration of any marker genes present, including possible antibiotic resistance marker genes. The 
 assessment of any implications for the environment is undertaken by GMAC prior to release.</para><para>(24) Although there is a theoretical possibility of horizontal gene transfer from foods into the genome of humans, in practice such transfers do not occur. Furthermore, there is no evidence that the probability of such transfer from a food made from or containing a genetically modified organism would be any greater than from food made from conventionally bred organisms.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Australia New Zealand Food Authority</title><page.no>3686</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 1110)</subtitle><id.no>1110</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>3686</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator Stott Despoja</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Family Services, upon notice, on 30 March 1998:</para></talk.start><para>With reference to page 67 of the 1996-97 annual report of the Australia New Zealand Food Authority (ANZFA):</para><para>(1) Does ANZFA undertake `special projects'; if so, what special projects are currently being undertaken.</para><para>(2) What `special projects' were undertaken in the 1995-96 financial year.</para><para>(3) What monies were provided to ANZFA for these `special projects' in the financial years 1995-96 and 1996-97.</para><para>(4) (a) Who or what provided these monies; and (b) what did they receive in return for these monies.</para><para>(5) What does `other' in `other revenues' mean.</para><para>(6) What `other' are currently being undertaken.</para><para>(7) What `other' were undertaken in the 1995-96 financial year.</para><para>(8) What monies were provided to ANZFA for these `other' in the financial years 1995-96 and 1996-97.</para><para>(9) (a) Who or what provided these monies; and (b) what did they receive in return for these monies.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>3686</page.no><name role="metadata">Herron, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator Herron</name><name.id>VW4</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Minister for Health and Family Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><para>(1) The term `special projects' refers to one-off tasks that ANZFA is required to undertake, however, these `special projects' are directly relevant to the core business activities of ANZFA.

question:</para></talk.start><para>(1) The Commonwealth provides matching, dollar for dollar, expenditure for the tobacco research and development levy up to a maximum of 0.5% of the gross value of production. It is estimated that Commonwealth expenditure in 1998/99 will be around $270,000 with similar amounts expected in the following 2 years. This compares with expected industry contributions in 1998/99 of around $660,000. 
</para><para>(2) The operations of the TRDC are funded from industry levies and the matching Commonwealth contribution. The Commonwealth does not make any direct contribution to the administration of the TRDC.</para><para>(3) (a) The Directors of the TRDC are Mr Eddie Gilbert, Mr Laurie Hunt, Mr Barry Dare and Mr Des Naughton. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Senator Judith Troeth, is currently considering candidates for the appointment of a new Chairperson.</para><para>(b) The TRDC's core functions are to: investigate and evaluate R&amp;D requirements; prepare five year strategic plans and annual operating plans for tobacco R&amp;D; ensure R&amp;D activities are consistent with TRDC plans; monitor and evaluate R&amp;D progress; and facilitate the dissemination, adoption and commercialisation of R&amp;D outcomes.</para><para>(4) In general, the Commonwealth provides assistance for primary industries R&amp;D by matching, dollar for dollar, expenditure for industry research and development levies up to a maximum of 0.5% of the gross value of production. The broad objective of this policy is to develop competitive and sustainable rural industries.</para><para>The Government's dollar for dollar matching contribution is designed to provide an incentive for the primary sector to increase its R&amp;D funding and to become more involved in R&amp;D priority setting and the adoption of outcomes. This policy also recognises that activities funded by R&amp;D Corporations generate a mix of public and private benefits.</para><para>The tobacco industry, which provides significant social benefits to the Mareeba and Myrtleford communities, is treated on the same basis as other industries.</para><para>(5) The Department of Health and Family Services has advised that:</para><para>The Public Health program includes a number of national strategies including the National Drug Strategy. Allocations under the National Drug Strategy cover all drugs including alcohol, tobacco and illicit drugs and it is not possible to provide a breakdown of specific allocations on a drug by

With the concurrence of the Government of Indonesia, the Australian Government immediately provided funds to support the relief effort being mounted by these agencies. There was no request at this stage from the Indonesian Government for ADF assistance and no ADF evaluation of the need was therefore conducted.</para><para>(2) AusAID officials did not downgrade the situation in Irian Jaya. As indicated above, once the extent of the problem became known, the Australian Government immediately provided $1.3 million for the relief operations of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), ICRC and World Vision Australia. In January 1998, a further $2 
 million was provided to the ICRC emergency appeal.</para><para>(3) ADF assistance was not offered in 1997.</para><para>(4) ADF assistance with the relief effort was not offered until a Government to Government approach for assistance was received from Indonesia. In April 1998, Indonesia provided the first formal advice that they would accept an Australian offer of assistance with the relief operation. Following his discussions with the Indonesian Defence and Security Minister, Minister McLachlan announced on 15 April 1998 that Australia would increase its assistance to the humanitarian relief effort and this would include the use of ADF assets to increase airlift capacity. The first ADF personnel were deployed in early May 1998. This additional Australian assistance to Irian Jaya from the aid and defence budgets is expected to be worth up to $10 million.</para><para>(5) Official estimates indicate that at least 600 people may have died as a result of the drought conditions. However it is likely that some deaths in more remote villages have not been reported to the authorities. As well, the incidence of malaria has significantly increased as a result of displacement of populations with low natural immunity. Recent tests carried out by medical teams from the NGO, Medecins Sans Frontieres, indicate that the mortality rate may be as high as 30 deaths per 10,000 cases.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Captioning for the Hearing Impaired</title><page.no>3736</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 1188)</subtitle><id.no>1188</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>3736</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator Brown</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts, upon notice, on 13 May 1998:</para></talk.start><para>(1)What are the current rules regarding the captioning of television programs so that deaf and hearing-impaired people can enjoy them.</para><para>(2) Is it the case that America and Britain have laws in place to ensure that programs are captioned.</para><para>(3) Will similar laws be introduced in Australia.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>3736</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator Alston</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><para>(1) Under the self regulatory arrangements contained in the Broadcasting Services Act 1992, the broadcasting industry is encouraged to develop codes of practice which relate to the captioning of programs for the hearing impaired. Commercial free to air television broadcasters are responsible for deciding whether their programs are closed captioned, in accordance with the Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations (FACTS) Commercial Television Code of Practice (the Code). The Code requires FACTS members to endeavour to increase the amount of closed cap 
 tioned programming in consultation with organisations representing hearing-impaired and deaf viewers.</para><para>Open and subscription television narrowcasting services are covered by the relevant Australian Subscription Television and Radio Association (ASTRA) Codes of Practice, which require narrowcasters to identify captioned programs in their program schedule information, and to consult organisations representing hearing-impaired and deaf viewers when introducing or extending the provision of captioned programming. Codes for subscription television broadcasting (pay television) and community television are being developed.</para><para>There are currently no legislative requirements for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) or the Special Broadcasting Service (SBS) to provide captioning of their television programming. However, the ABC is required by both its Code of Practice and Editorial Guidelines to endeavour to increase the amount of closed captioned programming as funds permit.</para><para>The Government has implemented other measures to increase the level of captioning on free to air television.

The Government will require existing commercial and national (ABC and SBS) free-to-air broadcasters to commence digital television services in metropolitan licence/coverage areas on 1 January 2001 and in regional areas from that date, so that digital transmission has commenced in all regional licence/coverage areas by 1 January 2004.</para><para>As part of its policy framework, the Government will require commercial and national free-to-air broadcasters to provide a closed captioning service for all prime time programming as well as for news and current affairs outside prime time.</para><para>Bills to give effect to the Government's decisions on digital television were introduced into the House of Representatives on 8 April 1998. Provisions in these Bills require the development of regulations to determine standards which are to be observed by commercial and national broadcasters for captioning of television programs transmitted in prime viewing hours and news and current affairs programs transmitted at other times.</para><para>The captioning standard will apply to both analog and digital transmission of television programs and</para><para></para><para>will come into effect from 1 January 2001 (the date of commencement of digital television services in Australia).</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Greenhouse Gases</title><page.no>3737</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 1189)</subtitle><id.no>1189</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>3737</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator Brown</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for the Environment, upon notice, on 12 May 1998:</para></talk.start><para>(1) (a) Why has the National Greenhouse Advisory Panel (NGAP) not met since October 1997; (b) when is it next scheduled to meet; and (c) what is its ongoing role now that Australia has signed the Kyoto protocol.</para><para>(2) (a) What proportion of homes in Queensland, New South Wales, South Australia and Western Australia, respectively, have solar hot water; (b) what quantity of greenhouse gas emissions would be saved if the proportion of homes with solar hot water in Queensland was increased to the level of Western Australia.</para><para>(3) What quantity of greenhouse gases will be emitted by the Nambour coal-fired power station planned as part of Queensland's Surat scheme.</para><para>(4) Will the Government require an assessment of this proposed power station under the Environmental Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974</para><para>(5) Which `national environmental significance' criterion in the Government's proposed `reform' of environmental legislation would trigger Commonwealth involvement in the assessment of the Nambour power station.</para><para>(6) (a) How will the Commonwealth restrict increases in greenhouse gas emissions to the 8 per cent limit set by the Kyoto protocol; and (b) will the Commonwealth assess all projects with large scale emissions, including land clearing, or will it simply allow projects to proceed on a first-come first-served basis until the limit is reached.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>3737</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator Hill</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Environment</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><para>(l) (a-c) The National Greenhouse Advisory Panel (NGAP) has made a valuable contribution to the National Greenhouse Strategy which is now being finalised by governments.

The discussions on 6 and 7 March took place by telephone.</para><para>(2) (a) The Report of the Standards Review Panel of Tasmania was published and distributed by the Department on 21 July 1997. I am informed that a copy was delivered to the honourable senator's office  in  Hobart  on  20  May  1998.  As  to  the</para><para></para><para>evidence considered by the Panel, that is set out in the report. Insofar as some of the documents belong to the Commonwealth, the Department is willing to provide copies to the honourable senator at his request. Other documents considered by the Panel were the property of the service provider, Jadwan Pty. Limited, and it would not be appropriate for the Department to release those documents without the service provider's consent.</para><para>(2) (b) The matters raised in the question, namely complex factual issues which, for the most part, involve expert opinion are currently before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for review under the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1977. It would therefore not be appropriate to comment. To the extent that these complex factual issues relate to a current action before the Federal Court of Australia, referred to in more detail in the response to the next part of the honourable senator's question, it would also not be appropriate to comment.</para><para>(2) (c) If, by this question, the honourable senator is referring to the decision of the delegate of the Minister to revoke the approval of the nursing home under section 44 of the National Health Act 1953 (the Act), that decision was reconsidered by Mr Robert Griew, State Manager, New South Wales of the Department of Health and Family Services as the delegate of the Minister for Family Services for the purposes of s.105AAB(4) of the Act. Mr Griew affirmed the decision to revoke the approval of the nursing home. Mr Griew's decision is currently the subject of an application for review under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 and is to be considered by the Federal Court of Australia. It would therefore be inappropriate to comment.</para><para>If, however, the honourable senator is referring to the finding of the Standards Review Panel of Tasmania chaired by Dr Penelope Flett that the submissions of the proprietor would not result in sustainable improvements in the quality of care being provided, then that finding is not a reviewable decision within the terms of the National Health Act 1953.</para><para></para></answer></subdebate.1></debate></answers.to.questions></hansard>
