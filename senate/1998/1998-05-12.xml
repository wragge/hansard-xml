It relates to the question of jobs. Will the minister outline the reasons for the recent positive figures on unemployment, such as unemployment falling to 7.9 per centâwhich happens to be the lowest level since 1990 when Labor created the recession we had to have? How is the government's responsible economic management of low interest rates, low inflation and low debt assisting families and small businesses?</para></talk.start></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>2512</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Environment and Heritage</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThat is an important question. The reason is that this government has taken tough decisions on tough issues. In the same way that it has taken on the waterfront, it took on doing something about the gross expenditure abuse by the previous Labor government. We inherited a deficit of $10.3 billion. I would have thought that Senator Cook would have something to say about that a little laterâlike a personal explanation. We inherited that and we tackled it. Unlike the previous government, we did 
 not walk away from it, and now all Australians are gaining the benefit of that.</para></talk.start><para>They are gaining the benefit through lower interest rates and low inflation which are enabling business, and in particular small business, to expand and to employ, and so we are now getting good employment figures. These are the best figures on unemployment since before the recession we had to have which was imposed on the Australian people by Prime Minister Keating and the Australian Labor Party.</para><para>What a stark contrast. The Labor Party gives you an unnecessary recession and mass unemployment. It has taken nearly nine years to recover the employment level to the situation that existed before that recession. So many Australians have suffered from unemployment as a result of the maladministration of the economy by the Australian Labor Party. So, Senator Knowles, the issue you raise is vitally important because we are now getting figures which can demonstrate to Australians that they have the opportunity for future employment.</para><para>There is no doubt that we still need to do better. Okay, we have turned it around. We have now got the best figure since 1990, but we still need to do better. And we have in place the policies that can achieve that; we have in place policies that have restrained expenditure and got interest rates down to record low levels. We are tackling the waterfront and we will achieve the competitive gains that are necessary on the waterfront. We will tackle tax reform, which is also necessary to ensure that we have an economy that can continue to pick up the unemployed that Labor unfortunately left.</para><para>There are further good signs that we can make progress in relation to unemployment. Recently, the ANZ job advertisements rose by 4.7 per cent in the year to April. In April alone, they rose by nearly one per cent. The Morgan and Banks job index survey in May showed that 17.4 per cent of firms intend to increase employment over the next three months. These are  positive signs and they can give further confidence to Australians that, as a result of the policies that the Howard government has implemented, they have 
 the best opportunity for employment that they have had for years. This is good news for all Australians and news that I would have thought that even the Labor Party would have been prepared to applaud.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>RF4</name.id><name role="metadata">COOK</name><name role="display">Senator Cook</name></talker><para>âNo, it is misleading!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>BH4</name.id><name role="display">Senator HILL</name></talker><para>âSenator Cook interjects and says that it is not good news. I do not know what the Labor Party wants. Do they want to return to the past? Do they want to remind Australians that when Mr Beazley was employment minister we had one million Australians out of work? When the Labor leader was employment minister in this country, unemployment was over 11 per cent. We have now got it back to under eight per cent. We have made real positive gains in this regard and we have, furthermore, given hope to the unemployedâthose who are still out of work.

A number of questions were put on notice that go to the question of the government's role in the Dubai exercise and the mass sacking of workers because they happen to be members of a union.

What other legal advice was provided to the department and the minister? When, and at what cost?

But the truth is that Mr Paul Houlihan revealed that Mr Reith was briefed on the Webb Dock operation on 6 January, which was two days before the NFF registered the three companies. That is when Mr Reith learnt about this matter. That is when he knew about the NFF's plan for the Webb Dock. Of course, Senator Alston and Senator Vanstone today, in one of their worst ever performances, could not answer the questions directed to them by the opposition. There is no way that you could reconcile the dishonest answer that Mr Reith gave on the <inline font-style="italic">7.30 Report</inline> with the facts of the matter.</para><para>There is a real problem for Mr Reith now, because Mr Reith is either being publicly exposed as a lying, conniving, co-conspirator with corporate cowboys like Chris Corrigan and Mr Scanlon, a minister of the crown who actively and knowingly has incited the sacking of an entire work force, or he is a dupe and he has been led by the nose by those same corporate cowboys into what we believe and what has been proved to be a massive abuse of his ministerial trust. That is the truth of the matter. Mr Reith either willingly got into bed with these characters or he has been duped by them. I can assure the Senate that we will be examining this close relationship between Mr Reith and these characters a great deal more.</para><para>But look at Mr Corrigan and what he has said. He lied on the ABC's <inline font-style="italic">AM</inline> program on 
 4 December when he denied any knowledge or involvement in the Dubai training scheme. He lied to the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> the same day when he denied that he had provided money for the Dubai training scheme. He lied under oath to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission when he denied any financial involvement in the Dubai training scheme. He lied to Minister Reith, when the issue was first raised in the parliament, by claiming that the Dubai scheme was news to him. Mr Corrigan lied when he failed to disclose that he was the primary Australian contact for Dr Marc Faber, who was the financier behind the Dubai stevedores. He then claimed that all these lies were justified because it was in his commercial interest to do so and there was no overwhelming public interest to knowâand that position was defended by Senator Hill, the Leader of the Government in the Senate in this chamber today.</para><para>We say that Mr Corrigan is continuing his corporate behaviour from 1982 when a special investigator raised very serious doubts about his evidence regarding Elders shares and the stories that have been concocted after the event. We say that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) ought to instigate a comprehensive, independent public inquiry into this whole sordid matter, especially given the symbiotic relationship that exists between Mr Reith and the government and Mr Chris Corrigan. Without such an inquiry the Howard government's credibility will be exactly the same as Chris Corrigan's credibilityâand that is non-existent.

He chooses to try to character assassinate the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, Peter Reith, and a number of other people rather than address the issues. A report on waterfront reform was released by the Productivity Commission 14 or 15 days ago. It would be interesting to know how many on the other 
 side bothered to read and study it and recognise the necessity to do something. We have two situations here, with the Labor side defending the indefensibleâit is absolutely impossible to defend what has been going onâand the government side trying to do something by getting some productivity improvement into our waterfront and improving our ability to compete.</para></talk.start><para>I want to run through a few of the issues that were raised in that report because they are very important. These are the things that the public need to know about. They need to know why it is necessary to reform our waterfront. I will touch briefly on some of the matters raised in respect of the Productivity Commission reports. The first point is that it:</para><para>Fully supports the Government's position that substandard waterfront performance is hurting Australia and reform is needed.</para><para>The following comment is made in regard to the second report:</para><para>Shows how labour arrangements are retarding container stevedoring performance.</para><para>The document went on to list a number of things and I will touch briefly on some of them. Under the heading `Container stevedoring' it listed the following:</para><para>a. charges higher than overseas</para><para>b. shiploading &amp; unloading slower</para><para>c. poor reliability (a large proportion of ships are delayed in Australian ports)</para><para>d. increased costs to users</para><para>e. significant scope for improvement.</para><para>With regard to MUA working arrangements and work practices, the following items are listed:</para><para>a. complex, inflexible system</para><para>b. retards productivity</para><para>c. increases costs</para><para>d. reduces reliability</para><para>e. entrenches `overtime culture'</para><para>f. the `pick' or order of engagement is a key problem</para><para>g. high shift premiums and overtime.</para><para>These are some of the issues. When are Labor Party senators going to get dinkum about this issue and do something about it? They should support a coalition government that is trying to do something about it. They should say to 
 the people that they support, `You've got to lift your game; you've got to lift your performance. It is in the interests of Australia that you do so.'</para><para>An example of an industry that is having some difficulties right now is the wool industry. Just moderate reform on the waterfront would be worth at least 6c per kilo to every woolgrower in this country. The benefit of that to the community would be absolutely enormous. They are the plus dollars; they are the dollars that get spent; they are above and beyond the cost of production. Yet this lot on the other side continually hide behind their old charade. As Senator Alston said in answer to a question today, the conspiracy is really between the Labor Party, the ACTU and the MUA. They refuse to take a realistic approach to this and address the issueâthe real things that matter.</para><para>We are told about reports and consultancies. I remember well seeing some information with regard to the report that was done by Turnbull and Wran on the Australian National Line. Would Senator Collins give us a line? Would he give us a word? Not a word. He said, `That is government property. We have this right as a government.' You can check the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> on this; it was asked many times. Repeatedly he said, `We do this to carry out our function; it is not something for the parliament.' Yet you run this conspiracy line as if there is something very strange or unusual about getting a consultant in to give advice in terms of a particular issue. You have been dragging a red herring across this matter; and what is more, you know it is a red herringâit is your way.</para><para>Let us touch on a couple of other things. All we have asked for on the waterfront is a lift in container rates from 18 to 25. Yet we find that New Zealand is doing better than that. We find that Thailand, using the same equipment, has a rate of 30 an hour. Fremantle has only 18.9; Brisbane, 16.8; Sydney, 18.4; Melbourne, 18.8; and Adelaide, 21.4. We should look, for example, at double-header timeâthat is, back-to-back shifts on Saturday, when people working on the waterfront earn $630 as a result of poor unexplainable work practices which exist in that indus 
 try. That is what this debate is about, and that is what has to be addressed. The Australian public know that that has to be addressed in terms of fixing up the problem. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>2529</page.no><name role="metadata">Knowles, Sen Susan</name><name role="display">Senator KNOWLES</name><name.id>TH4</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI would like to make some comments about the double standards that have been demonstrated so ably by the Labor Party over so many weeks now. I will quote some words of certain people. It might be interesting for people to decide who might have actually said this and about whom. One quote is:</para></talk.start><para>My message to them is that they will cop every instrument of punishment and retribution and reaction that the operators bring against them. It is a different game this time boys; it's war. They are exceptionally greedy.</para><para>A further comment was made. The quote is:</para><para>They are behaving like a bunch of bloody-minded thugs.</para><para>Another quote was:</para><para>They are a special elite group that can hold this country to ransom.</para><para>One might ask who were these words directed at and by whom. The first quote was by Bob Hawke when he was referring to the pilots dispute. The other two quotes were by former Senator Bob Collins. He, too, was referring to the pilots dispute. But it does not end there, because the duplicity of the argument that we are seeing today will never end when you look at one group of people vis a vis another. Senator Collins said this about the pilots:</para><para>What I overwhelmingly want to do is go out and kick a few airline pilots to death.</para><para>Anyone in their right mind would say that it is absolutely and utterly absurd for a member of parliament to say that. But the Labor Party did not bring him into line; the Labor Party did not say, `Well, hold on. Maybe there are other people who should be brought into line, other unions who should be called to account.' The Labor Party had no reform agenda at that time at allâjust a pure and utter unadulterated vendetta against the airline pilots.</para><para>The Labor government brought in the army. The fact of the matter is that it was the Labor government that brought in foreign workers 
 at the cost of Australian jobs. Yet those opposite do not seem to be worried about that at all today. The Labor Party just seems to say, `But the MUA is a very different case.' The MUA is a different case all right. The MUA silvertails are allowed to hold up millions of dollars in vital exports on Australian docks. They are allowed to maintain inefficient work practices, hang on to their ill-gotten gains and conduct industrial warfare with the total and utter approval of the Labor opposition. That is how they are different from the pilots.</para><para>The other myth that the Labor Party is creating non-stop is that industrial disputation has increased since the coalition government came to office. What one must look at is the figures from 1983 to 1995 and the industrial disputes of the stevedoring industry compared with the all other industries average. In those years from 1983 to 1995, the average for the stevedoring industry was 2,174 days lost. The all other industries average was 193. So there we have itâ2,174 versus 193. Since the coalition government has been in office, the 2,174 average of the Labor government has been reduced to 1,030, and the all other industries average has been reduced from 193 down to 103. Yet we still have the Labor Party saying that the MUA is some special protected case.</para><para>The stevedoring industry is performing poorly even in terms of occupational health and safety. The number of work-related injuries in 1994-95 was 169.6 per 1,000 employees. Compare this with the figure of 64.3 for the mining industry and 29.1 for all industries. Yet the Labor Party can still say that the MUA, this restricted club that they support because the MUA supports them in return, is something that should be protected. Even worse than that, the average incidence of fatalities per 10,000 employees between the years 1991 and 1995 was seven times the all Australian industries figure. That just demonstrates the MUA's lack of care for their own members. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:25:00</time.stamp><page.no>2529</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen George</name><name role="display">Senator GEORGE CAMPBELL</name><name.id>NB5</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to support the motion to take note of the answers given by Senator Alston and to say, `What a differ

That is what they were congratulating themselves on in the other chamber on 8 April. They were slapping each other on the back and saying, `We've achieved a major victory. We've put 1,400 families in jeopardy, and we've put another 1,400 people on the dole.'

But they probably would have in the long term after the redundancy payments they would have got from the government  funded by the taxpayers because Mr Corrigan was not going to fund them. After those redundancy payments were expended, they may have then had access to the dole. But in reality what has happened in the intervening five weeks? We have had 10 prominent judges in this country all say that a potential conspiracy had occurred between the stevedores on the waterfront and the government that sacked those workers and, much more importantly, that they have a case to answer.

They will demonstrate whether they knew. They will tell the Australian people whether or not Peter Reith was part of the conspiracy. 	That is not an unreasonable

They keep screaming about it. In fact, the MUA have been too effective; they have done too good a job on behalf of their membership. That is what the agenda is aboutâit is about union busting and it has been union busting all along; it has been union busting right from the start.</para><para>Otherwise, why would you have a situation where they sacked trade unionists in Tasmania and in Townsville? Why? Because there were excessive rorts. Why? Because they were not making benchmark figures. In fact, it was demonstrated that these workers were achieving world's best practice but, at the end of the day, it did not matter to the Prime Minister or to Peter Reith what they were achieving in terms of efficiency and productivity on the 
 waterfront because this was an agenda to destroy the MUA. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>2531</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferris, Sen Jeannie</name><name role="display">Senator FERRIS</name><name.id>5L6</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI also rise to take note of the answers given by Senator Alston. We have heard in this place today questions from Senator Quirke, Senator Faulkner and Senator O'Brien about who knew what, when they knew it, why they knew it and how they knew it. But the real question surely is: who is interested in waterfront reform?  Let us have a look at the evidence. Interestingly enough, John Coombs, the National Secretary of the MUA, claims to be interested in waterfront reform. On the <inline font-style="italic">Four Corners</inline>  program on 9 March, just a few weeks ago, he said:</para></talk.start><para>I accept that productivity . . . can always be improved, and that's what I'm about . . . trying to improve productivity . . .</para><para>Even the President of the ACTU, Jennie George, has agreed. She said this on the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday</inline>  show of 12 April:</para><para>Look . . . I think there is a good case, and Mr Coombs has conceded that too, that there is room for further improvement.</para><para>So we now have the national secretary of the waterfront unionâthe MUAâand the ACTU president conceding that there is room for improvement on the waterfront. But have a listen to what Mr Beazley said at the same time:</para><para>. . . I endorse the activities of the Maritime Union of Australia . . . on the whole the union movement has handled this quite well and I think they ought to go on handling it that wayâquite well.</para><para>So the Leader of the Opposition, contrary to the views expressed at the same time by the union president and the union secretary, does not favour waterfront reform. He pays very poor lip-service to waterfront reform.</para><para>The only time Mr Beazley had supported waterfront reform was under the WIRA process when $420 million of taxpayers' money went the way of the waterside workers. A better question for the opposition to have asked today would have been: how many of the MUA are still working on the waterfront after they took the WIRA package comprising $420 million of taxpayers' money? </para><para>Perhaps another better question that Senator Carr might consider asking tomorrow is: what did Neville Wran deliver in that report that we never sawâthat, as Senator Campbell said, was never laid on the table. A better question for Senator George Campbell to ask tomorrow might be: what was delivered in Neville Wran's package of consultancies to the government of the day, the previous government, for the $304,000 that he was paid? If it was annualised, it would even make a wharfie embarrassed because it was $760,000 for a two-day a week, part-time job. It sounds a bit like the sort of productivity we have come to accept on the waterfront. But not any more.</para><para>During the past week, I had the pleasure of attending a small business meeting with the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, Mr Peter Reith. I sat next to a small businessman who previously had been a Vietnam veteran. He told me that he had been in Vietnam as a 19-year-old and he had spent two Christmases in Vietnam. The first Christmas he got no letters from home because the wharfies would not load the mail bags, and the second Christmas he got no Australian beer from home because the wharfies would not load the beer.</para><para>That is a long time ago, but that is why this community, three to one, supports waterfront reform. We will deliver it; we will go the extra mile; we will make the hard yards; and we will deliver the ports of this country an efficient, effective union and non-union work force.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>2531</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator BISHOP</name><name.id>2L6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI also support the motion to take note of the answer given to the question asked by Senator Mackay. At the outset it seems that two matters need to be identified. Firstly, this whole waterfront dispute is now not about reform, productivity, growth, improvement, more jobs, better jobs, or sound and sensible ongoing permanent reform. The entire trade union movement, individual unions and whole sectors of industry have been engaged in that process since at least the early 1980s. For the last 15 years, all of the former union officials on this side of the chamber have been actively engaged in that reform process.</para></talk.start><para>Repeatedly, the ALP through the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) has said that this party in government will recommit to reform and achieve that end. Our record on that issue is sound. It is proud and it has stood the test of time. So if this issue is not about waterfront reform, one asks the obvious question: what is it about? It is about one thing onlyâbashing and destroying the MUAâand that process is to be achieved by illegality, deceit, corporate manipulation, surprise, and the engagement, hiring and training of de facto mercenaries.</para><para>Today in Australia the lesson for children at school, the lesson for the business community and the lesson for the entire Australian community is that the end justifies the means. The litany of illegal and improper activity by this government, Minister Reith and a range of private interests is now emerging inch by inch, and other questions in today's question time outlined the scope of those lies and that deceit.</para><para>There were multiple instances of Mr Corrigan lying on 4 December when he denied any knowledge of involvement in the Dubai training scheme. Mr Corrigan lied to the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> on the same day, denying that he had provided money for the Dubai training scheme. Mr Corrigan lied under oath to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission when he denied any financial involvement in the Dubai training scheme. He lied to his friend and ally Minister Reith when the issue was first raised in the parliament by claiming that the Dubai scheme was news to him. Most interestingly, he claimed that those particular lies were justified because it was in his commercial interest to do so and there was an overwhelming public interest to know.</para><para>Mr Howard condoned asset stripping as a tactic to avoid a company's normal contractual obligations to redundant workers. The same Mr Howard was apparently happy to condemn asset stripping as a device for companies to avoid tax liabilities back in 1982-83. Apparently, those unacceptable practices 15 years ago are okay when they involve the illegal sacking of workers in 
 1998. We have a tissue of lies from Mr Corrigan and an about-face by Mr Howard.</para><para>We come now to the arch-protagonist, the leader in this whole dispute, Mr Reith. We know that Paul Houlihan told Mr Reith of the Webb Dock operation on 6 January, two days before the NFF registered the three companies. We know that 21 days later Minister Reith told the <inline font-style="italic">7.30 Report</inline>, on 27 January, that he knew nothing of the NFF registration of the same stevedoring and training company. Why do we continually have these lies from Mr Reith and Mr Corrigan and apparent about-faces by Mr Howard? The answer is clear: the end always justifies the meansâwe bash the MUA and we destroy the union. That is what this whole dispute is and will be about.</para><para>Similarly, with respect to Dr Stephen Webster and his mates well-known Liberal Party operators Jonathan Gaul and Mark Textor, there was no tender process for government consultancies involving the huge sum of $95,000. Dr Webster was working directly to Minister Sharp and Minister Reith as a consultant, but the consultancy fees were paid directly by the department. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>âOrder!

He moved to Australia with his family when he was 12. David was educated at Adelaide Boys High School and the Universi 
 ty of Adelaide. He was also one of the first research students at Monash University. Before entering federal politics, David had been a university lecturer, a pioneer in the area of computer science and a farmer. While lecturing at the University of Glasgow, he developed the first computer data-based expert system used for medical diagnosis by the Western Regional Hospital Board in Scotland.</para><para>In 1971, David and his wife Susan returned to Australia and David joined the South Australian Institute of Technology as head of the school of data processing and director of the computer centre. Together, they bought a mixed cereal, dairy, poultry and sheep farm in the Barossa Valley in South Australia to accommodate their growing family, as well as to expand their business challenges. Today, their farm is a base for an executive training facility and computer consultancy which developed and markets an innovative medical system to help in-patient care and management of medical practices.</para><para>David was a founding member of the Australian Democrats and was elected to the Senate in 1984. He was national Vice-President of the Australian Democrats from 1983 to 1984 and a member of the Senate Legislative and General Purpose Standing Committee on Science, Technology and the Environment. In his maiden speech he stated his belief that you can `change the world in which we all live'. These were words to live by for David Vigor.</para><para>He assumed his Senate duties with enthusiasm. He introduced private members' bills on varying subjects and was tenacious in his questioning in Senate estimates sessions. He was also a staunch supporter of proportional representation and self-government in the ACT. He showed endless support for individuals and struggles with the legal system and bureaucracy. For example, he highlighted the problems with the Australia Card.</para><para>He left the Senate in 1987 and went on to become a founding member and at the time of his death was Secretary of the Association of Former Members of the Parliament of Australia. After politics David returned to computer consultancy and software develop 
 ment. The day before his death he attended the opening of a dental research unit at the University of Adelaide which featured software developed by his company.</para><para>Madam President, on behalf of the government, I extend to his family our most sincere sympathy in their bereavement.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>2534</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âOn behalf of the opposition, I wish to associate the opposition with this condolence motion that has been moved by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Hill) on the death of David Vigor, a former Democrat senator from the state of South Australia. Labor senators expressed our sorrow at David Vigor's sudden death last month and we, too, offer our deepest sympathy to his family.</para></talk.start><para>As Senator Hill has indicated, David Vigor was elected to parliament until 1984, but he was unsuccessful in retaining his Senate seat in the 1987 double dissolution. So David Vigor was a senator for only a very short period of time, but I am assured by many people in the chamber who served with him that he certainly made his presence felt during that period.</para><para>He was a man of strong principle and conviction. He fought hard and, I am assured, long for the issues that he believed in. He did advocate strongly proportional representation and self-government in Canberra. That was part of what was a strong personal commitment to fair elections and responsible government. He was also very active on consumer issues as well as fighting to ensure funding for all levels of sport Australia wide. I understand from colleagues how vigorous and thorough his questioning was at times at Senate estimates committee hearings, and many senators in this chamber have shared those experiences with him.</para><para>There was another one of David Vigor's achievements which perhaps he is not recognised as widely for, which is the role that he played in stopping smoking on Australian aircraft. That perhaps was an achievement not welcomed by all Australians but I must say, as a frequent traveller and one who does not smoke, it was certainly one that I would 
 welcome and I am sure many other fellow travellers do.</para><para>Let me say to David Vigor's family, on behalf of all opposition senators, we offer to his family our most sincere regret at his death and our condolences to his family and friends.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>2535</page.no><name role="metadata">Lees, Sen Meg</name><name role="display">Senator LEES</name><name.id>8U4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise also to speak on the unexpected passing of former Senator David Vigor. Twenty-three Democrat senators have served in this chamber over the past 21 years, but this is the first time that a condolence motion has been necessary for a Democrat. Therefore, it is fitting that I, as current leader of the party, should make these comments.</para></talk.start><para>There have been obituaries published which detail David's life prior to politics and told by people in a better position than I who only came to know David at the time that I became involved in the South Australian division actively in 1986. So I would like to take up the tale at the time that I met him.</para><para>Yes, I knew him through his and my involvement in the party in South Australia. In those early days of our acquaintance he struck me for the very qualities that no doubt he is best remembered for by those who served in this place with him. He was enthusiastic, indeed incredibly enthusiastic, about all the issues that he was involved in. He was capable of great passion. He was a man of commitment and an avid technophile.</para><para>He was a founder member of the Democrats and gave long service both on our state executive and also at national executive level. He served as deputy national president, as has already been mentioned, in 1983-84. Later in 1984 David Vigor was elected to the Senate, giving the Democrats a second South Australian Senate seat, a seat today held by Senator Stott Despoja. This was a milestone for our party in South Australia and one of which David could be rightly proud. When elected, David was one of only five non-British European born MPs in the Australian parliament. He and his father in particular were incredibly proud of their cultural heritage.</para><para>There are many in his class of `84 who are still with usâamongst them Senators 
 Vanstone, Cooney, Knowles and McKiernan, who probably all have a personal story or two about David Vigor. Unlike many of these honourable senators, the then Senator Vigor did not have any period on the back bench. On his first day in the Senate chamber in the Old Parliament House he held the portfolios for us of trade, transport, science, communications, local government and administrative services and territories. He attacked all of them with gusto. I am told by some who were around at the time that whatever David Vigor did as a senator he did with gusto, whether it was legislative debates, committee workâand I have quite a few stories about his work in estimates committeesâor indeed placing questions on notice. I suspect that, if one goes back through the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>, one would see that he held close to the record for the largest volume of questions ever placed on notice in any 12-month period.</para><para> In the 1984 campaign which saw David elected, our party's slogan was `You can change the world' and, in many ways, this describes David's attitude to politics. He believed in it, he tried to achieve it and indeed he lived it. He was a central player in the move to self-government in the ACT and a tireless advocate for the science community within public life. He also took a strong interest in improved electoral and parliamentary procedures. One of his many ideas, a 1987 amendment to require senators to declare any interest in the outcome of a vote, is well known to current senators. Indeed, it is what we dealt with immediately prior to this condolence motion. While it took until 1994 to be accepted by this chamberâand, unfortunately, by that time David was no longer hereâit is one of his many initiatives.</para><para> Outside the parliament, David Vigor was an enthusiastic contributor to the communityâa founding member of the Australian Democrats, active in the campaign for proportional representation, a founding member of community television through ACE Television in Adelaide, and a founding member of the Association of Former Members of the Parliament of Australia. At the time of his death, he was secretary of the association.</para><para> Before I conclude my remarks, I cannot fail to mention the fact that, eventually, David Vigor and I found ourselves on the opposite sides of an inter-party disagreement within South Australia, one which saw David Vigor unsuccessfully contest the 1987 election as a candidate for another party. This party was a very short-lived one. However, many members of the party in South Australia still hold great affection for him and view the internal drama of 1987 in the context of a life of active enjoyment with and contributions to the community in which he lived.</para><para>David can rightly be described as having lived an extraordinary life. I offer my sincere sympathies to his wife, Susan, to his children and to his grandchildren. It must be for them a time of great sadness. My final words which best describe the motivation behind his political involvement have been provided by David Vigor himself. Knowledge is power, power to change the world we live in for the better if we care. No-one who ever knew him in the Australian Democrats or elsewhere will ever doubt that David Vigor cared.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>2536</page.no><name role="metadata">Boswell, Sen Ronald</name><name role="display">Senator BOSWELL</name><name.id>YE4</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI join with my colleagues in speaking to the condolence motion moved by Senator Hill in respect of former Senator David Vigor who came here in 1984, and I express my sympathy to his family at his death. He could only have been 57 or 58 years old, which is too early to go. Not only did he have a parliamentary career but I believe he was very successful in the computer industry. One thing you could say about David Vigor was that he was enthusiastic. I believe that he was the most vigorous debater this parliament has ever seen. In fact, at one stage we took a rough calculation and we believe that one senator, David Vigor, was using one-third of the Senate's time. He almost had former Senator Walsh driven to distraction at the estimates committees. He gained some fame in his one term of office.</para></talk.start><para> He was a pleasant person, a person who really got excited about any issue that he became involved in. He became involved in very many issues in his one term of parliament. He is one of those characters who will 
 always stick in your mind. Many people come and go, but David Vigor was different. He will be remembered by all of us who were here in 1984. I once again express my sympathy to his family and his wife and say to them that we are thinking of them in this hard time.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>2536</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI support the condolence motion moved by Senator Hill on the passing of David Bernard Vigor. I do so as I regarded his friendship as being very important. Vigor by name and vigour by nature, although they are spelt slightly differently. His name was spelt V-i-g-o-r, but in the v-i-g-o-u-r category he left other people for dead. His enthusiasm for this place and for this particular chamber was extraordinary, probably a little overemphasised. He had a little bit of an inflated view about the power of the parliament as distinct from the power exercised by others outside of this parliament. I am stating this as a matter of fact, not as a desirable proposition.</para></talk.start><para>He of course placed numerous questions on notice and his questioning of ministers in this chamber was direct and well researched. He had a number of private members' bills prepared and tabled in this place. I would like to associate myself with my parliamentary colleagues in offering condolences to David's wife, Sue, to his family and extended family.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>2536</page.no><name role="metadata">Watson, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WATSON</name><name.id>VJ4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI would like to take the opportunity of this condolence motion to express my sympathy to the family of the late David Vigor. He was a hardworking senator, highly motivated, and had a huge capacity for hard work. His office in Parliament House was a mass of files, with a major shelving arrangement bisecting his room.</para></talk.start><para>There are not many technocrats in this place. However, it is a lot richer for people like David Vigor and even Bruce Childs, who was another technocrat. Such people bring to this place a specialisation that makes people sit up and take notice when they talk.</para><para>Although he was here for only one term, David Vigor put much energy and enthusiasm into his work and placed many issues on the Senate agenda. It would take others 10 years to achieve such a record. His questioning at 
 estimates brought profound respectâthe manner in which he researched his questions, the number of questions and the vast range of issues that he covered simply amazed many of his admirers as well as his detractors. I believe he made a significant contribution to this place. However, I do not think he realised all his expectations as a result of coming to the Senate, but I think few of us do. Certainly while David was here he enriched this place. He was one of those senators who people will long remember.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative, honourable senators standing in their places.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><petition.group><petition.groupinfo><title>PETITIONS</title><page.no>2537</page.no></petition.groupinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10001</name.id><name role="metadata">CLERK ASSISTANT</name><name role="display">The Clerk</name></talker><para>âPetitions have been lodged for presentation as follows:</para></talk.start></interjection><petition><petitioninfo><title>Landmines</title><page.no>2537</page.no><no.signed>135</no.signed><name.ids><name.id>QD4</name.id></name.ids><names><name>Brown</name><name> Sen Bob</name></names></petitioninfo><para>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled:</para><para>The Petition of the undersigned shows that we citizens of Australia support a world-wide ban on the production, stockpiling and use of all forms of anti-personnel land mines.</para><para>Your Petitioners request that the Senate support our call for a world-wide ban on the production, stockpiling and use of all forms of anti-personnel land mines, give high priority to support for efforts to clear land mines in affected countries and use its influence to encourage other countries to financially support the clearance of land mines in poor countries.</para><presenter><talk.start><talker><name role="display">Senator Brown</name><name.id>QD4</name.id></talker><para>Senator Brown(from 135 citizens)</para></talk.start></presenter></petition><petition><petitioninfo><title>Higher Education Contribution Scheme</title><page.no>2537</page.no><no.signed>119</no.signed><name.ids><name.id>5F4</name.id></name.ids><names><name>Calvert</name><name> Sen Paul</name></names></petitioninfo><para>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled:</para><para>The Petition of the undersigned shows strong support for a quality, accessible, liberating, public higher education system.

It would appear from the tenor of the Scheme as a whole that such service providers may well be commercial organisations. However, there is no avenue provided in the terms of the Scheme whereby a person or organisation, which is dissatisfied with the decision to reject its application to be a service provider, may seek a review of that decision.</para><para>Clauses 1.4.1 to 1.4.3 permit the Secretary to require a veteran to be examined or assessed, or both, by a service provider, and for that service provider to report to the Secretary, who in turn reports to the Commission. However, there is no provision in the Scheme requiring the service provider to maintain confidentiality of the information it acquires in that process. Since the service providers may be private individuals or companies, it does not appear that they would come within the restrictions of the <inline font-style="italic">Privacy Act 1988</inline> , with the result that any requirement of confidentiality would have to be included in this Scheme.</para><para>Paragraph 1.5.2(b) requires the service provider or the Secretary (if they have prepared a rehabilitation plan) to agree with the veteran on its details. The Committee suggests that this provision could not be enforced as the law cannot force parties to come to an agreement.</para><para>Clause 3.2.3 provides that an approved scheme should not <inline font-style="italic">normally</inline>  include particular elements. If a scheme were not to be approved because it contained some such element, it would appear to be impossible for a veteran to succeed in a review of that decision. The Committee notes that there are no criteria by which the reviewing body might determine whether the case before it was normal or not. Even if it were found to be abnormal, there is no indication whether that circumstance would be enough to permit the reviewing body to include the relevant element. 
</para><para>Clause 4.5.2 gives to the Secretary a discretion to determine whether or not a grant has been applied for a proper purpose. However, Chapter 5, which deals with rights of review, applies only to the review of decisions of the Commission, and hence does not apply to the decision of the Secretary under this clause. There does not appear to be any provision in the <inline font-style="italic">Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986</inline>  which allows for review of any decisions of the Secretary. The Explanatory Statement would also appear to be misleading as it does not qualify that reference to rights of review to decisions made under the Scheme are those of the Commission only.</para><para>The Committee would be grateful for your advice.</para><para>Yours sincerely</para><para>Bill O'Chee</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Chairman</inline></para><para>The Hon Bruce Scott MP</para><para>Minister for Veterans' Affairs</para><para>Parliament House Canberra ACT 2600</para><para>Telephone: (02) 6277 7820</para><para>Facsimile: (02) 6273 4140</para><para>Senator Bill O'Chee</para><para>Chairman</para><para>Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances</para><para>Australian Senate</para><para>Parliament House</para><para>Canberra ACT 2600</para><para>Dear Senator O'Chee</para><para>Thank you for your letter of 6 March concerning the Veterans' Vocational Rehabilitation Scheme (the Scheme). In your letter you have sought my advice on various issues concerning the Scheme and my comments are as follows.</para><para>Firstly, you observe that there is no avenue available under the Scheme for a service provider, as defined in clause 1.3.1, to seek a review of a decision to reject its application to become a service provider. Such a provision is not considered appropriate because, like certain other service providers with whom the Department deals on a normal commercial basis:</para><para>.	 the Scheme, insofar as service providers are concerned, is to be arranged under normal tender and contractual arrangements;</para><para>.	 service providers are not to be delegated the functions that the Secretary or the Commission have under the Scheme or the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986;</para><para>.	 services provided by service providers are not of a kind that were previously provided by the Department; and</para><para>.	 service providers are independent contractors and have access to remedies under contract law. 
</para><para>Regarding your comment that there is no provision in the Scheme requiring the service provider to maintain confidentiality, the position is that where the Department enters into a contract with either a private individual or a commercial organisation, then that contract will bind the service provider to the requirements of the Privacy Act 1988. I stress that this is the normal practice for contracts in this Department, the terms of relevant clauses having been cleared by the Privacy Commissioner's office.</para><para>In any event, the Department, as a result of the tender process, is to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with a Government body to provide the services. That body is bound by the requirements of the Privacy Act 1988. In addition, it is intended that there will be clauses in the MOU requiting undertakings by individuals, in relevant circumstances, in respect of privacy obligations. Accordingly, both in principle and in practice the privacy issues will be dealt with.</para><para>Paragraph 1.5.2(b) of the Scheme requires the service provider or the Secretary to reach an agreement with the veteran as to the details of the rehabilitation plan. you note that the law cannot force the parties to come to an agreement. That is true. If there is no agreement then the veteran does not go onto a rehabilitation program. Neither the veteran, the service provider or the Secretary can be compelled to agree to a particular program It is important that all parties agree on the program. The process of agreement is a matter for further discussion and compromise rather than the adoption of adversarial techniques.</para><para>In connection with your comments on clause 3.2.3, you observe that if a Scheme were not to be approved because it contained a particular element that should not normally be included, then it appears impossible for a veteran to succeed in a review of that decision.</para><para>The matters that should normally be included are set out in other clauses of the Scheme. Clause 1.3.3 sets out the contents of an approved program and lists various elements that are to be included in the program, but the list is stated not to be exhaustive. Clause 3.2.1 sets out factors that are relevant when the Commission approves a rehabilitation program, but this list is also not exhaustive.</para><para>The purpose of clause 3.2.3 is twofold. The first is to ensure that those matters that would normally be provided by a person themselves, for example in keeping their skills level up for a particular type of employment, are not provided at Commonwealth expense. Secondly, and most importantly, the use of the word "normally" in that clause is clearly intended to indicate that the Commission does have a discretion to examine the circumstances of each case.</para><para>That is, clause 3.2.3 is intended to provide the flexibility to add matters that can be provided at 
 public expense. It is not limited even to exceptional circumstances. It is drafted in this way because it is considered unwise to fetter discretion. If a fuller definition/criteria were to be included there would inevitably be more specificity and the likelihood of some tightening up. Overall, the preferred approach is to retain flexibility, which is to the veteran's benefit.</para><para>Finally, in relation to your comments on clause 4.5.2, it is now proposed to give the Commission the discretion to determine whether or not a grant has been applied for a proper purpose, and accordingly that decision will be reviewable under the appeal rights in Chapter 5 of the Scheme.

Advice to Mr Reith on 27 February last year from Mr Derren Gillespie, Assistant Secretary, Industry Strategy Team, stated:</para><para>. . . a dispute would not, of itself, remove or alter MUA coverage, remove or suspend registration, or cancel the award or terminate any agreement . . . although it could provide the basis for taking action to one or more of those ends.</para><para>What would be needed for the MUA's influence on the waterfront to be significantly weakened would be for a range of affected service users and providers to take decisive action to protect or advance their interests.</para><para>Stevedores would need to activate well prepared strategies to dismiss their work forceâ</para><para>I repeat, `dismiss their work force'â</para><para>and replace them with another, quickly, in a way that limited the prospect of for example, the Commission ordering the reinstatement of the current work force.</para><para>The first problem with the Reith plan was that its success depended on conflict and division. The second problem with the Reith plan was the role required of the government. It was not a role of setting a policy and legal framework, as governments normally do. The government and the minister in particular had to be active participants in the implementation 
 of the plan. And the third problem with the Reith plan was that, in fact, it broke this government's own laws. That is now the major problem facing the government and Mr Reith.</para><para>The plan to dismiss an entire work force and replace it quickly is in breach Mr Reith's own Workplace Relations Act. The act specifically prohibits the termination of an employee's employment because the employee is a trade union member. The Prime Minister has, in effect, already confessed to this charge on national television. When asked why the entire Patrick work force was sacked, Mr Howard told <inline font-style="italic">A Current Affair</inline>:</para><para>They're all part of the one union.</para><para>One of the consequences of having a bargaining monopoly, ruthlessly used in the hands of the union that won't listen to reason, is that some innocent people get affected.</para><para>That means that people were sacked because they were members of a union. The sackings were also in breach section 170CL of the Workplace Relations Act, which requires prior notification to the CES of proposed sackings. The sackings were also in direct breach of the Stevedoring Industry Award 1991, which of course is a law of the Commonwealth. Clause 43 of that award specifically required Patricks to notify their employees and their union of any definite decision that is likely to	 have a significant effect on employees, including termination of employment, and it obliged Patricks to discuss such changes before they come into effect.</para><para>But don't just take my word on the question of the legality of the government's actions. Let me remind senators of the findings of Justice North which were upheld by the full bench of the Federal Court and then upheld by the full bench of the High Court. Justice North found that there was an arguable case that Patrick acted illegally by breaching employees' contracts of employment. There was an arguable case that Patricks breached the Workplace Relations Act by dismissing workers because they were members of a union. There was evidence that Patrick's owners and others agreed on the unlawful acts as part of an overall plan. There was an arguable case that Patrick's owners and 
 employer companies engaged in an unlawful conspiracy.</para><para>There was evidence that Patrick's owners and others agreed on the unlawful acts as part of an overall plan. There was an arguable case that Patrick's owners and employer companies engaged in an unlawful conspiracy. The Reith plan to beat the commission by getting rid of one work force and getting a new one in place quickly might have beaten the commission, but it did not beat the Federal Court.</para><para>Mr Reith now has another legal problem, again of his own making. The alleged conspiratorsâthe Howard government being one of themâhave to prove they are not guilty, rather than the MUA having to prove that they are. This arises from Mr Reith's own legislation. The explanatory memorandum tabled in parliament with the Workplace Relations Bill states that the section containing the freedom of association provisions reversed the onus of proof applicable to civil proceedings. Normally, the onus of proof would fall on the complainant to prove the charges, but not in this case. Mr Reith has certainly got himself and the government into an awful mess. The High Court highlighted the size of this mess. Chief Justice Brennan said:</para><para>If the damages consist of the lost earnings of the entire workforce for the rest of their working lives, one must wonder about the sufficiency of the defendant's assets.</para><para>That must be taken into consideration.</para><para>The question is conspiracy, and what remedy might be appropriate on an interlocutory basis when the case of conspiracy is mounted against a number of the defendants.</para><para>It would have regard to all the mitigating circumstances in relation to lost earnings, everything that would be relevant to the damage suffered by those series of individuals.</para><para>And Mr Justice McHugh said:</para><para>The damages in this case could be enormous and they could include punitive damages and that is something that has to be kept in mind.</para><para>This was not a plan prepared in haste. It was a strategy that was a long time in the making. It was carefully put together with the use of a large number of consultants starting in May 1996 when the then minister for transport, Mr 
 Sharp, convened talks in his office with a core group of players including Mr Andrew Robb, Mr David Trebeck and Mr Paul Houlihan.</para><para>Mr Trebeck's company, ACIL, was commissioned to develop a plan. That plan was handed to the government in August 1996. The central points of that plan were: how to keep the ports moving during a strike; how to hire new labour during an all-out stoppage; the legal aspects of banning secondary boycotts; the role of common law action; and how to target the MUA and highlight dock inefficiencies.</para><para>Mr Corriganâwe have heard a lot about himâwas also involved in the plan. He met with Trebeck early in 1997. The option of mass sacking of Patrick's work force  was discussed at that meeting. Mr Corrigan said that the pair met at Patrick's Sydney offices to discuss options if the MUA took unilateral action over the sale of ANL. The senior public  servant responsible for waterfront policy, Mr Derryn Gillespie, met with Mr Corrigan on 25 February. Corrigan sought advice on how the new act could be used to weaken the MUA.</para><para>The Reith strategy was further developed through a second ACIL contract, awarded without a tender process being followed, on 20 June last year. The principal contractor was again Mr David Trebeck. But Mr Reith wanted Dr Stephen Webster involved. Greg Feeney, from the maritime branch of the department of workplace relations, advised the estimates committee on 12 November last year that Mr Sharp had instructed the department to engage Webster following meetings of the cabinet subcommittee established to look at maritime reform issues.</para><para>On 30 July Dr Webster was formally appointed as a consultant on waterfront reform to Reith but he was on Mr Sharp's payroll. In September, Liberal pollster Mark Textor's company, Australasian Research Strategies, was commissioned to provide a report to ACIL on community attitudes, at a cost of $42,000. He found that although waterfront was not a top of the mind issue there was strong concern over waterfront 
 efficiency, international competitiveness and hindrances to exports.</para><para>Another consultant and long-time Liberal Party election strategist, Jonathan Gaul, through his company, Canberra Liaison, used this research to develop a formal communications strategy. The strategy addressed ways for the government to convey concern about the privileged wharfies. John Howard claimed his government had reformed and changed the law. He said the climate now existed for companies to act in a way that they had not been able to act before. He did not mention plans to manipulate public opinion, however. Nor did he mention the government's strategy to get around key provisions of the Workplace Relations Act. This was a political campaign put together by political strategists.</para><para>Dr Webster then employed a number of other consultants, and the Reith plan was further refined. We are now told by Mr Wells from Fynwest, in a sworn statement, that Dr Webster kicked off the Dubai venture on 30 July, the day he officially started work for Mr Reith.</para><para>The first attempt by the minister for workplace relations to smash the MUA was launched in Cairns on 18 September last year. It was a disaster but, again, do not take my word for it. Let me quote Mr Greg Bondar, the former senior maritime adviser to Mr John Sharp, former minister. Mr Bondar is quoted in the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Commercial News</inline> as saying of Cairns:</para><para>It was initiated by Peter Reith's department but I think in a way it got out of hand.</para><para>So Mr Reith and Mr Sharp then moved on to plan B. They met in Melbourne with advisers to talk about waterfront reform on the same dayâ18 September. A key item on the agenda was the establishment of a new stevedore. The ever-present Dr Stephen Webster wanted to bring the NFF into the discussions. Within an hour, Ms Craik and Mr Ferguson were in the room. And, after some discussion, Craik and Ferguson agreed to consider setting up a new stevedoring company. Fancy that! Present at that meeting were Dr Alan Hawke, secretary of the department of transport and Dr David Rosalky, secretary of Reith's department.</para><para>The government, together with the NFF, launched plan C at Webb Dock on 27 January. But when the minister was asked whether he was aware of the NFF plan on the <inline font-style="italic">7.30 Report</inline> that night he claimed not to know anything. He was asked:</para><para>Mr Reith, you are now telling me you did not know the National Farmers Federation had registered a stevedoring and training company?</para><para>Mr Reith answered:</para><para>No, I didn't know. Your people told me in the last twenty-four hours.</para><para>But the weekend edition of the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline>  newspaper later revealed that one of the architects of the NFF strategy and former consultant to Mr Reith and then to Mr Sharp, Mr Paul Houlihan, had briefed Mr Reith on 6 January. Houlihan was quoted as saying:</para><para>Reith was briefed on January 6. Even then we didn't spell out the details of the operation. But I have to add he was not unhappy with what we had to tell him.</para><para>And John Coombs told AAP on 28 January that the minister, Mr Reith, threatened him with the farmers at a meeting before Christmas. John Coombs said:</para><para>He taunted me with this information about farmers coming down to take over the waterfront on the last occasion I met with him in Melbourne before Christmas . . . </para><para>It is also interesting indeed that Mr Paul Houlihanâone of the key architects of the Reith planâjust happened to be in the office of the Minister for Defence (Mr McLachlan) when the Dubai plot was raised in parliament on 3 December. Mr Houlihan was reported as saying:</para><para>A cold clammy feeling ran down my spine as I took the callâ</para><para>that is, from a journalistâ</para><para>I was praying the reporter did not know where I was. If she did all hell would have broken loose.</para><para>Houlihan did not say why he was in Mr McLachlan's office. And what about Mr Corrigan and Dubai? Chris Corrigan was asked on 4 December whether his company would ever get involved in something like Dubai. He said:</para><para>Not really. It's just so hypothetical a proposition. I can't, I can't respond to it. 
</para><para>He was not telling the truth, was he? And what about Mr Reith? He was asked:</para><para>Can you guarantee that no member of your staff, or your department, had any prior knowledge or involvement in the operation? If you cannot give this guarantee, will you undertake to make all the necessary inquiries and advise the House before we finish today?</para><para>Mr Reith said:</para><para>I am not going back to my office and have a Spanish inquisition with my secretaries, my staff, my this, my that. All I can tell you is that I knew nothing of this until I heard about it yesterday.</para><para>Well, he should have. And now we know that there were several meetings between Dr Webster, who was on his staff, and the Fynwest people. And there were sworn statements from a man who served this country with honour that Dr Webster was a key to the Dubai exercise. And there were clearly many meetings between Corrigan, Webster and the minister. Mr Reith said he regularly had talks with Corrigan but knew nothing of the Dubai venture until Corrigan confessed to his involvement. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>2551</page.no><name role="metadata">Gibson, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GIBSON</name><name.id>BX5</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThis is another diversion by the Labor Party from the fundamental thing that the government is tacklingâwaterfront reform. Why are we tackling waterfront reform? I remind the Senate that Australia is a trading nation. We trade about 20 per cent of our GDP and most of that is in goodsâthere is only a small proportion in servicesâand over 95 per cent of those goods move over our wharves.</para></talk.start><para>We were elected more than two years ago. One of our election promises and pledges to the community was that we would fix up the wharves, and we are about doing that. All Australians know that there have been rorts and inefficiencies on the Australian wharves for a long, long time. A lot of that inefficiency is tied up with the monopoly control by the MUA. This government has provided leadership and it is going on with the job of providing efficiency changes and reform on the waterfront. I add that the public fully supports the government's call for waterfront reform. We are doing the hard work needed to bring the waterfront up to world's best practice. </para><para>Australia's ports are some of the least efficient and the most expensive in the world. The Productivity Commission's report of two weeks ago confirms that. Inefficiency is a burden to all in the nation. Australian exporters pay for this inefficiency as they struggle to compete against other nations with much more efficient ports. Part of our mandate when we were elected was to improve the waterfront, and that is what we are doing.</para><para>Our ports are the worst in value for money terms. For example, Adelaide may have crane rates of 21 lifts an hour, but it is also the most expensive port in the country. The average crane rate at our five major ports is 18.3 lifts per hourâthe government benchmark is for a modest 25 lifts an hour. The main port in Thailand averages 30 lifts an hour. Working days lost on the waterfront are more than nine times those recorded across all industries, and injury and disease rates are four times those of the national average across all industries. Industrial disputes are 12 times higher than the national average and reached a peak under the Labor government in 1994.</para><para>In the meantime, the wharfies go home with salaries of $70,000-plus: compare that with average weekly earnings of $37,000. Pity the poor battlers on average weekly earnings and lower when they look at what the wharfies are getting: five weeks annual leave with 25 per cent holiday loading; 10 weeks cumulative sick leave that can be cashed in; two weeks extra leave every 15 weeks; subsidised meals at major cost; paid stop-work meetings; and clothing, laundry and telephone allowances. The Productivity Commission has revealed the overtime culture that the wharfies work to. The only time they work to world's best practice is when they can finish a shift and knock off early, or go do down to the pub, or go and watch a strip show.</para><para>Labor had 13 years to fix these problems. Back in the eighties they threw $420 millionâof which $165 million was supplied by the taxpayerâon its WIRA reform process because it knew, and it confirmed to the public, that the waterfront was largely overstaffed. But that process was largely a waste of taxpayers' money; not much was changed. The only improvement has been in bulk grain 
 handling where we now have world's best practice. Why do we have that? Because we got rid of the MUA out of that process.</para><para>Labor cannot do anything about the wharves because it is still tied hand and foot to the MUA. Labor will not condemn the MUA's actions; Labor will not do anything about them. Regarding the dispute, Mr Beazley said on 19 April:</para><para>On the whole the union movement handled this quite well and I think they ought to go on handling it that way.</para><para>Quite well! This is after lots of confrontation. He thereby condoned children on the picket lines, unlawful picketing, defiance of Supreme Court injunctions and international threats made to Australia's trade. Between 1983 and 1996, the previous Labor government gave the unions nearly $92 million. In 1994-95, the unions received more than $16 million from the taxpayer funds of the Labor government. Labor is hamstrung and wants to stop our government from doing what Labor cannotâreforming the waterfront.</para><para>The government has put forward its seven benchmark objectives for the efficiency of the waterfront. The first objective is to end overmanning and restrictive work practices. The overmanning of container terminals is a major factor behind the restrictive work practices and resistance to change in the industry. Reducing the numbers will make a marked improvement in productivity. The government has put in place a very generous redundancy package worth up to $270,000 each to help wharfies made redundant in the process.</para><para>The second point is about higher productivity. We have commitments from the two major companies, P&amp;O and Patricks, to achieve 25 container lifts per hour as a national average. This is not world's best practice, but it shows that the government is flexible and it is a marked improvement on 18. This is an intermediate target and we want to see this achieved within 12 months.</para><para>The third point relates to greater reliability through less disruption. Australia has a reputation for great unreliability through its wharvesâit is near the bottom of world rankings. Greater reliability is crucial for the 
 shippers, and they will not achieve this unless we stop the disruption which we continually have had until now.</para><para>The fourth point relates to injury and fatality levels being reined back to the all industries average. Between 1991 and 1995, the actual response on the wharves was seven times the all industries figure,âseven timesâand can be seen as a measure of poor practices on the waterfront. This is unacceptable to all Australians, and achieving this goal would be welcome as it would mean saving the lives of many Australians.</para><para>The fifth point is lower costs through the logistics chain of the waterfront gatewayâin other words, the movements in and out of the wharves. The government has made a commitment to talk to state governments to examine ways of containing costs and improving the efficiency of those movements in and out of the wharves.</para><para>The sixth point goes to making full use of technology that is available to increase productivity. The major stevedoring companies have invested $400 million over the last three years and have done so with very little return. That equipment must be used efficiently for the benefit of everybody.</para><para>The seventh point relates to improved training. The government is prepared to commitment funds to training to maximise benefits flowing from the new technologies over the next three years. We will encourage stevedores to develop apprenticeships and training opportunities to enhance the overall pool of skills.</para><para>Senators, the waterfront reform is under way. The government, and I guess anyone who has had anything to do with the waterfront, always knew that it would be a very difficult process and that there would be lots of complications. And so it has proved. But the government is determined to proceed. We are making a commitment to the people that we will go on with the reform and make sure that there is improved efficiency on the waterfront. Already this week the major companies are signalling that they want major reductions in manning. Both P&amp;O and Patricks are indicating that they can work the wharves efficiently with something like a one- 
third to one-half reduction in the number of people they employ on the wharves.</para><para>The government is committed to seeing this through. The first step it made when first coming to government was to change the law with regard to industrial relations and restore the secondary boycott legislation that the previous government had removed from the statutes. That change was made with the help of Cheryl Kernot. With that change, secondary boycotts are now outlawed. That has made a big difference and made possible an attack on the waterfront.</para><para>Patricks is to be congratulated for having a go at changing the waterfront practices. Sure, we do not agree with all the tactics that took place, but we always knew that it was going to be difficult. With hindsight, some of those tactics should perhaps have been better, but this is a difficult and dangerous game. Many of the people involved at the managerial level are under threat of physical violence. The government is committed to seeing this through. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>2553</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to support the motion of Senator O'Brien. On the industrial relations and competition fronts, the Democrats see that there are five issues at stake: freedom of association, job security, monopolistic and restrictive practices, secondary boycotts and productivity reforms.</para></talk.start><para>The Democrats oppose compulsory unionism. We also oppose compulsory non-unionism. Freedom of association is entrenched in the Workplace Relations Act, which means that workers can choose whether or not they wish to belong to a union. Under the act it is unlawful for an employer to make unionism or non-unionism a condition of employment.</para><para>I think it is important to note that the Employment Advocate has not, to this date, indicated that the MUA or the NFF practices are illegal. To date, neither the government's aggression against the MUA nor its support for the NFF has been dealt with by the Employment Advocate, who has responsibility for freedom of association provisions. However, these issues are being dealt with by the courts. </para><para>Sacking workers because they belong to a union, sacking the good and the bad together, regardless of their work record and actual productivity, is clearly unethical; it is also illegal. Serious questions concerning the minister's and Patricks' alleged breaches of the letter and spirit of the act, of complicity in unfair and unlawful dismissals, are, as you know, currently before the courts.</para><para>The Democrats are strong supporters of job security. Volumes of research confirm that happy, secure, well-trained and well-managed employees with good working conditions and wages are not only much more productive but are much better for society as a whole. Claims that the Patricks group of companies contrived in-house job contractors and then turned them into bankrupt corporate hulks through slick legal and accounting footwork in order to evade their rights and responsibilities to employees are also before the courts. If those stratagems can be used by any unscrupulous employer, then every Australian employee is at risk. My expectation is that the courts will find such stratagems unlawful, but if not, then that legal loophole must be closed, and both Labor and the Democrats have indicated that they will move to do so.</para><para>The Democrats oppose private sector monopolies, oligopolies and cartels, whether they are in the hands of labour or capital. The wharves have been characterised by monopolistic and restrictive practices on both the labour and capital fronts. The MUA has a historical monopoly on the supply of labour but, in lawâand we all recognise itâthey now cannot prevent any employer employing non-union labour as well. On the company side, 16 of Australia's 46 ports are in the hands of various monopolies and nine are in the hands of various duopolies. Jeff Kennett does not oppose corporate monopolies, as we know from the Crown Casino. He feels the same way about duopolies, having prevented a third stevedoring company coming on to the Melbourne docks.</para><para>In an act of bias, and contrary to its own supposed commitment to competition, the government has been supportive of these practices on the capital side but has attacked them on the labour sideâthat is, until Peter 
 Costello came along. Just recently, both the federal and WA governments approved the reduction from two stevedoring employers down to one at Dampier Port.</para><para>The Democrats oppose secondary boycotts as an instrument of industrial action. The 1996 Workplace Relations Act retained Labor's laws, allowing the innocent third party to seek civil damages if a boycott damages their business. It introduced special protection against boycotts affecting international trade, but only if the boycott was not about employment related matters or issues such as consumer or environmental protests. By all accounts, the MUA has not infringed the secondary boycott provisions in the act.</para><para> The Democrats support the advancement of productivity improvements on the wharves, but the government rhetoric has been way over the top and, in consequence, you have lost the support of the community. The lowest figure I have seen of potential benefits to Australia is $150 million, and the highest is $1 billion. Those figures are significant and important, but they are not critical.</para><para>Our bulk cargo movements rank with the world's best, and some container ports, such as Townsville, Burnie and Adelaide, were before this dispute very productive. At Fremantle, which has a way to go yet on productivity reform, costs per unit in cargo have decreased by 48 per cent in real terms over the past six years, with container trade per employee quadrupling over the same period. It is not true to say that there has been no productivity improvement. There have been significant productivity improvements over the past 10 years, and there are bound to be significant productivity improvements in the years to come.</para><para>There are two themes on the political front. The first theme is the coalition hard Right's frustration at being unable to forcibly crush union power on the wharves, until they found two willing waterfront union breakersâthe farmers union and Patricks. Gaining absolute control over Australia's wharves is the coalition hard Right's dogma.</para><para>The second theme is a broader anti-unionism. Some powerful members of the coalition seem to have a strong prejudice 
 against unions and workers which descends into visceral hatred in some quarters. While not all Liberal and National supporters feel like that, the gloating and savage triumphalism of Mr Howard and Mr Reith at the loss of 1,400 union jobs reflected the views of many. The gloating was quickly suppressed when they realised it was bad public relations.</para><para>There are just two issues on the parliamentary and public interest front: have the minister and the Prime Minister been telling the truth in their answers to parliament; and have the partisan and prejudiced stance of the minister and the Prime Minister resulted in activities that have improperly committed the government and exposed them to the serious charge of unlawful conspiracy?</para><para>Let us understand that if that charge were found to stick in the courts, we would be in a constitutional crisis. Senator O'Brien, the mover of this motion, is quite right in saying that this issue therefore deserves proper investigation by either the government, the Senate or the House of Representatives. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>2555</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThink of a country where a work force is shut out from its lawful workplace; think of a country where troops or police are sent in against those workers; think of a country where greater rights are given to workers who illegally are put in to replace those workers with the assistance of dogs and police; think of a country where the government has laws in place that enable prosecutions to even be attempted for members of a union who communicate with other unions in other countries and communicateâor even think of communicatingâthat what is happening to them is illegal; think of a country that treats its workers and its own laws with contempt; and think of being able to proceed honourably with countries that treat their workers in that way for wishing the `crime' of acting collectively.

unionists but also small business people or unemployed people looking for work. It seems that, on a number of occasions, the attempt by this government to drive a wedge between one group of workers and the rest of the community has not worked. This wedge politics is about creating a situation to divert the attention from those people who are hurting: the larger group of working poor in our society who are being handed worse working conditions on a daily basis. They include the 300,000 people who last year were cut off benefits by this government and who have to work for whatever is available. This is the country we are talking about, and these are the issues that are recognised by all of those community members who joined with me and other people down at the docks in Fremantle and across the country. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>2555</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Sandy</name><name role="display">Senator SANDY MACDONALD</name><name.id>CX5</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âOne of the things that is typically Australianâand we are fortunate indeed in this regardâis that commonsense prevails. Commonsense will prevail on the waterfront because it is in the best interests of Australia and everyday Australians that it does. Our aims in government are simple, honest and appropriate in the 1990s with respect to waterfront reform.</para></talk.start><para>What do we want? We want a more productive waterfront, providing for the creation of more jobs in the wider community, more employment flexibility and more legitimacy, so that more shipping companies and potential customers will come here. It is all because productivity on the Australian wharves is far below our trading partners and worse than many Third World nations. In terms of container lifts, Thailand has 30 per hour; the Philippines, 29 per hour; Mozambique, 27 per hour; and Australia languishes at 18.5 per hour.</para><para>Next, we want to remove the Maritime Union of Australia's monopoly on waterfront labour. If you run the taxi driver test, you get two answers about the MUA: firstly, answers about violence and thuggery and, secondly, answers about continued rorts and strikes. Simply, the stevedoring industry has the second worst strike record of any industry in 
 Australiaâafter coalmining, which is another industry that has a sorry history of union manipulation at the expense of everybody else.</para><para>In 1997, stevedoring working days lost amounted to 930 per 1,000 employees, which is 12 times the national average. It is interesting to note that we have two per cent of world trade and 25 per cent of dock disputations. Well-known waterfront rorts indicate a work force which is out of control. Issues range from the petty, like going on strike about where the billiard table has been moved toâcan you believe it?âto the outrageous, like delaying a ship to cause an extension of overtime and then nicking off before the ship is unloaded.</para><para>Next, we want to improve occupational health and safety because in that area the waterfront has the worst record of any industry in Australia. Most importantly, we want to provide for a fair day's pay for a fair day's work and we want to deal with overmanning. Australia's container terminals are overmanned by about 50 per cent. Basically this means that for every existing job you have 2Â½ people employed, with one doing the jobâreasonably inefficiently, I suspectâand the other 1Â½ making sure that that wharfie does not work too hard.</para><para>On our commitment to a fair day's pay, I ask you, Mr Deputy President, to compare the MUA workers' average wage of $74,500 per annum with that of really important members of the communityâreal contributors to the community. For instance, nurses earn in the high $30,000s; middle-ranking police officers earn in the low $40,000s; and school teachersâthe people who have the future of our children in their handsâearn about $40,000. But just remember that this day at Port Botany the meter reader is back at work earning $73,000 a year.</para><para>We have no desire to see the MUAâor, for that matter, any other unionâdestroyed. That will be determined by the good sense or otherwise of union leadership, but the MUA is a dinosaur in the modern global world and it has been for quite some time. Before the war, the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline>, a good left-wing magazine in those days, used to refer to the MUA as 
 `our foreign policy'. It was not until Hitler invaded its heartlandâthe Soviet Unionâin June 1941 that the Federation of Waterside Workers actually started loading the ships properly for the war effort in World War II.</para><para>The MUA is generally a law unto itself. This has been shown to be true in the creation of the unlawful pickets in the current dispute. Mr Carr has made absolutely pathetic efforts to look for credibility somewhere. The most tragic leader of any state is today in South-East Asia telling them that New South Wales is a good place to do business because it has the competitive advantage. We will wait and see about that.</para><para>The MUA's philosophy can be summed up as being jobs for all or jobs for no-one. In the months leading up to this dispute the MUA workers were on strike and, after being sacked, they became very agitated. I remind the Senate that they offered to work for nothing.

It is time for Mr Beazley to do what he knows is right. He should repudiate the MUA's record of violence and he should support the ALP's now forgotten Hobart resolution to allow new stevedores to operate the Australian wharves. He should also repudiate a typically stupid comment by Mr Gareth Evans who said, `So what if the inefficiencies cost another $50 per container!' I will tell you what that means: it means $100 million, and that is a lot of money that could be used to create jobs and to make a profit for producers and exporters.</para></talk.start></continue><para>As a government, we never assumed that it would be easy to reform the waterfront, but we said we would and we will. Dealing with a powerful, cornered and rich union with a monopoly was never going to be easy. Margaret Thatcher took over seven years to reorganise the labour arrangements in the British coal industry. At that time, public opinion and support for her reform program fluctuated, as it has in this dispute. But one thing is sure: this government is resolved to do what is right.</para><para>I would like to make two brief final comments. Firstly, I have a word of support for the Patrick company. It has been brave enough to do something that should have been done 25 or even 60 years ago. At great personal cost and at great personal riskâwhich is especially evident if you read some of the threats made against them over the last few weeksâthey will achieve the reforms that we want. P&amp;O's decision to move makes it surer than ever that the waterfront will never be the same again. The game is up for the MUA. It should realise that. Congratulations to P&amp;O for coming inâalthough a little belatedly, I might sayâand acting in a way that is appropriate and is in the best interests of the company and in the best interests of Australia.</para><para>Secondly, I note the proud record of the NFF and all Australian primary producers generally in bringing reform to the waterfront and to other industrial relations areasâincluding the live sheep dispute, the wide combs dispute and Mudginberri. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>2557</page.no><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator MACKAY</name><name.id>9L6</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI find it interesting that not one coalition speaker on the urgency motion on the waterfront today has addressed the substantive issues that were raised. We have heard the usual stuff about how they are all about waterfront reform, but not once have they mentioned the illegality of the sackings. Why? Because it is indefensible. Let's have a look at some of the facts. Let's look at how the government spent $1.3 million of taxpayers' money on secret waterfront consultancies.</para></talk.start><para>Fact: in April 1996, the government commissioned a consultancy to determine the views and concerns of industry about waterfront reform and to provide a strategy for the implementation of the government's reform agenda. Fact: in May 1996, the first ACIL contract was awarded with no tender process. Dr David Trebeck was asked to begin discussions with various industry groups and port users about their needs, and Mr Paul Houlihan was asked to look at the industrial relations situation in each port.</para><para>Fact: in June 1996, the draft ACIL report was completed. Fact: on 18 September 1996, the ACIL report was completed and received by the government. We are aware of some of its contents, and I think Senator O'Brien has already covered that. Fact: on 20 June, the second ACIL contract was awarded, again without a tender process being followed, and the principal contractor was again Dr David Trebeck.</para><para>Let us have a look at the existence and content of the now infamous departmental minute. Fact: a departmental minute in February to Minister Reith from Derren Gillespie entitled `Meetings with stevedore employers' describes in detail what happened on the waterfront, with absolutely astounding prescience, I believe. Fact: the minute advises Minister Reith not to commit to any strategy but draw out the employers' commitment to reform and their assessment of risk.</para><para>Let us look at the government's refusal to produce the ACIL consultancy reports. Fact: the government has consistently refused to produce the ACIL consultancy reports, despite the Senate asking the government to do so. The government has given the usual old excuseâcommercial-in- confidence, cabinet-in-confidence; `whatever it takes we don't want to give you the documents.' Finally, let us look at how the Dubai debacle was finally exposed. Fact: the story broke that a $20 shelf company was set up by Mr Wells and Mr Kilfoyle to recruit people in Dubai as an alternative work force on the waterfront.</para><para>Let us look at how this government is inextricably linked to Dubai. Let us look at Minister Reith's total misleading of the people of Australia on the <inline font-style="italic">7.30 Report</inline>, a 
 matter that was questioned today in question time. Fact: despite clamming up on 27 January and saying that he did not know anything about the Dubai debacle prior to the ABC informing him, Paul Houlihan informs us that Minister Reith was actually briefed on 6 January and was `not unhappy with what we had to tell him'. Question: who is telling the truth hereâMr Houlihan or Mr Reith? Question: what was the minister so happy about? I think we now know what the minister was so happy about.</para><para>Let us look at the claims that the government knew nothing about the Dubai debacle. Fact: the sworn affidavit by Mr Mike Wells, former director of Fynwest, claims that Dr Webster telephoned Wells on 30 July 1997 and asked him to contact Chris Corrigan about a possible job. Fact: the sworn affidavit claims that Dr Stephen Webster, a government consultant on waterfront reform, told Mr Wells that he was doing a special job for John Howard. Fact: this discussion occurred on the very day Dr Webster took up the $1,000 a day consultancy to advise the federal government on waterfront reformâa consultancy which resulted in a report which still remains secret, despite the Senate directing the government to table the information.</para><para>Question: what was the special job? Question: who was behind the Dubai scheme? Question: what was the involvement of the government? Question: did the government provide any moneys or support for the plan? Question: what was the nature of this contact? Question: did Dr Webster brief Minister Reith on his discussions with Mr Wells? Question: did Dr Webster talk to anybody else about the matter? Answer: this government does not want the people of Australia to know. Question: what does this government have to hide?</para><para>Fact: on 7 August Michael Wells telephoned Stephen Webster to advise him of his meeting with Corrigan. Webster asked if Wells could recruit the people he sought. Wells said, `Yes, sure.' Of course he could. Fact: on 5 September 1997 Wells telephoned Stephen Webster and advised him everything was in place to proceed with the Dubai operation. Dr Webster advised that as everything was okay it was probably not wise to 
 contact him again unless Mr Wells had a particular problem. Fact: at all times, Mr Wells states, he believed that Dr Webster was reporting back to the federal government.</para><para>Question: is Mr Wells's statement correct? Question: if not, why doesn't this government hold an inquiry to clear itself? Answer: because this government is in it up to its neck and it does not want the people of Australia to know the actual truth. Question: what does this government have to hide? Fact: it is alleged that discussions occurred before 3 December, the date when Minister Reith told parliament the government was unaware of the Dubai scheme, and that Dr Webster had had detailed discussions regarding this.</para><para>Fact: documents obtained by the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> allegedly confirm that Mr Wells placed several calls to Dr Webster. Mr Wells claims that this was about the Dubai recruitment. Phone records and diary notes reveal a series of contacts between a key government adviser and the Dubai organisers.</para><para>Fact: according to reports in the <inline font-style="italic">Weekend Australian</inline> on Saturday, 9 May, `a key government adviser has admitted having a series of discussions with organisers of the Dubai training scheme, but said they had nothing to do with the secret plan to break the waterfront union'. The <inline font-style="italic">Weekend Australian</inline> of 9-10 May reported that Dr Webster stated that `not only had he never discussed the plan to replace MUA members with former soldiers, he advised against it'. To whom did he advise against it? That is another question.</para><para>The story gets more intriguing. Dr Webster confirms that he has had several conversations with Mr Wells, but Dr Webster's version of events is that the conversations concerned arranging a chauffeur and a bodyguard for Mr Pratt. Apparently the reason for this series of calls was that Mr Pratt had decided to hire the person full time. What an absolute joke! It gets more intriguing.</para><para>Question: the telephone calls apparently took place. Exactly what was the nature of the telephone calls? Question: why are Mr Wells's and Dr Webster's stories inconsistent? Question: was Mr Reith briefed on the communications between Mr Wells and Dr Webster? Answer: the government does not 
 want the people of Australia to know. The government does not want to answer this. Question: what has this government got to hide?</para><para>Let us have a look at Mr Downer's office and its link to Dubai. Fact: according to information, if passports were not issued promptly the personnel were simply to mention a Mr Tweddell of Mr Downer's office, after which passports were issued within hours of their applicationâa couple of hours, as I understand.</para><para>Let us look at what have now become Mr Corrigan's quite clear lies with regard to funding Dubai. Fact: the documents assert Mr Corrigan fully funded the Dubai plan in contradiction of his sworn evidence before the AIRC. Fact: Commonwealth Bank statements dated 9 January 1998 obtained by the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> show that Patrick Stevedores deposited $140,000 into Fynwest's bank account. Wells states that Corrigan totally funded the Dubai operation. Under oath before the AIRC, Corrigan said that he had no financial involvement in Dubai except for leasing some equipment. Corrigan denied any knowledge or involvement until he owned up in early February this year.</para><para>Let us look at Mr Reith acknowledging the secret discussions he had with industry with regard to this. Fact: Mr Wells has stated that at all times Mr Corrigan made it clear that he, Mr Corrigan, had the support of the federal government and that he was reporting back to the federal government. Fact: Mr Reith has confirmed that the government had canvassed with Patrick Stevedores throughout last year the option of replacing its unionised work force. Fact: the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> on 9 May reported that Minister Reith said, `There were certainly discussions about what could be done, but as to what he [Corrigan] was intending to do or thought he would do that was always a matter for him.' Question: what communications did Minister Reith or anybody associated with Minister Reith have with Mr Corrigan? Question: what was discussed with regard to those?</para><para>The allegations in the affidavits are very serious. No government would want them on the public record without having an inquiry so 
 that they can be repudiated. It is simply not good enough for Minister Reith to claim in respect of Dubai, as he did yesterday, that he is not sure that anyone actually came up with the idea. That is probably the most astounding statement. I think you start to absolutely lose the plot when you start making those kinds of statements.</para><para> The Australian people deserve to know to what extent, if any, this government was involved in creating the environment for the waterfront dispute. They deserve to know. Ten out of 11 judges agree that there is a case to be answered. We already know from Mr Howard that one of the reasons for the dispute was that the workers were union members. I restate what I think Senator Murray said. The Employment Advocate has had no communication with Minister Reith's office with regard to an alleged breach of the freedom of association provisions on the waterfrontânot a single communication. In fact, he routinely has a barrage of complaints from Minister Reith's office to his office saying, `Please investigate this closed shop or that closed shop'âevery closed shop in Australia except the one they allege, which is the one on the waterfront.</para><para> Questions that should have been answered include: who is behind the Dubai scheme? Where would the men be put to work? What was the involvement of the government? Did the government provide any moneys or support for the plan? The government has had regular contact with P&amp;O and Patricks during the industrial dispute. What was the nature of this contact? Did Dr Webster advise Minister Reith on 5 September last year that all was in place to proceed with the Dubai operation?</para><para>Question: why does the government not want an inquiry? Answer: this government does not want an inquiry because it does not want the people to know what the truth of the matter is. Answer: this government is in this scandal up to its back teeth. Answer: this government is involved, I allege, in a conspiracy of gargantuan proportions. It does not believe it can defend itself. It does not believe it has a case to answer despite criminal proceedings going ahead in various legal forums. This government is running scared. 
 Not one single coalition minister has been able to answer in either chamber today allegations directly related to this matter. The bottom line is that this government cannot and will not put itself at risk, but it cannot defend itself in terms of a process that is open and transparent. I commend the motion to the Senate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>2560</page.no><name role="metadata">Payne, Sen Marise</name><name role="display">Senator PAYNE</name><name.id>M56</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âSenator O'Brien calls for a public inquiry into the nature and extent of the government's role in the waterfront dispute. He alleges, for example, that the conspiratorsâand one assumes that he includes the government in thatâhave to prove that they are not guilty rather than the MUA having to prove that they are. That would be an easy task for the MUA because they are guilty as charged: charged with the crime of presiding basically slothlike over an overmanned, inefficient, indefensible waterfront.</para></talk.start><para> The allegations about the government are very interesting. As the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business has said, we will plead guilty to conspiracy because we have encouraged reform on the waterfront. He said, `Let's have a conspiracy. Let's fix up the waterfront.' In fact, he said that he will write a book on how we conspired to fix up the Australian waterfront. What he said, and what is absolutely right and what those opposite are choosing to ignore, is that most Australians would sayâand they are saying in pollsâthat it is about time somebody did something to encourage the employers to finally fix up the rorts, the overmanning and the excesses which have plagued this country for years.</para><para> In moving this motion the opposition calls for an inquiry. We can only presume that they are hoping the inquiry will not even glance in their general direction, because it would find a closeness of relationship that would defy even the most vivid imagination. What a public inquiry would find is a relationship between the MUA and those opposite that is extraordinary in the extreme. We have journalists, for example, saying that Labor is drafting affidavits for the MUA.</para><para>I think I heard Senator Conroy use the phrase `up to their necks'. It is the Labor 
 Party that is up to its neck in a conspiracy with the MUA by running their campaign. It has been given research by the MUA so that the MUA can tell it what to say publicly on their behalf. They demanded of Mr Beazley that he oppose voluntary unionism on the waterfront so that they can retain their monopoly and so that crane drivers can earn $90,000 for about 14 hours a week.</para><para>The MUA dictated to Mr Beazley what his policy will be and he, like a very good boy, has publicly announced that they will repeal the secondary boycott provisions of the Trade Practices Act. Why is that? Because the MUA like to have a monopoly. Mr Beazley is going to remove the one sanction that there is against them, in spite of their ability in the past to hold this country to ransom with the stranglehold of their monopoly holding up trade. Just what are the links that we would suggest are a conspiracy between the Labor Party and the MUA? What about the commitments given secretly by the Labor Party to the MUA about policy? What about the involvement of senior members of the Labor Party with the MUA? What about the deals with senior frontbenchers of the Labor Party to publicly encourage people to break state laws and injunctions issued by state supreme courts? You want a full public inquiry but you cannot have a full public inquiry because, as you well know, the matter is already before the courts. The ALP is obviously aware that the MUA has made allegations against the government with regard to the events on the waterfront.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Opposition senators interjecting</inline>â</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>M56</name.id><name role="metadata">Payne, Sen Marise</name><name role="display">Senator PAYNE</name></talker><para>âThey do not want to listen, Mr Acting Deputy President, but I am not going to stop.

Let us return to the government's key policy objectivesâthat is, the achievement of real competition on the waterfront and fixing up the problems which have delivered this country such a poor international reputation.

Today's statement by the Executive Director of the New South Wales State Chamber of Commerce, Katie Lahey, is instructive and a good indicator in this regard.

 commitment of so many thousands of Australians who are contributing to wrestling with Australia's natural resource problems. In effect, they are overcoming and remedying damage that has been done in the past and putting in place better processes to ensure the sustainable management of those resources with proper conservation for the future.</para><para>Another finding in the Auditor-General's report is that in the overwhelming majority of cases the reasons for rejecting or varying state and territory recommendations were adequately documented and related to the published decision-making criteria. Even though the Auditor-General noted that there were a small number of cases which could have been better documented he found that there was satisfactory oral advice as to the background and reasons for the decisions in all cases. He confirmed that the reasons behind decisions taken by the ministerial board were sound and related to the board's desire to see more money go to community groups instead of state government agencies and more money go towards projects on the ground and outcomes.</para><para>He also examined those projects which had not been recommended by regional or state 
 assessment processes. I mention in particular the Baillieu family from whom the opposition sought to make some political mileage. He found that of the 16 such projects that can be classified by electorate, interestingly nine were in Labor seats and only seven in coalition seats. More importantly, he found that each of these projects met the published eligibility criteria for funding under the trust. He acknowledged that most of these projects were incorrectly assessed by the regional and state panels as ineligible. In other words, that is exactly what we said in this place.</para><para>He confirmed also, as we have been saying all along, that the major programs of the Natural Heritage Trust are aimed at the major environmental problems which are found in rural areas, which is why most of the money was going to rural areas. I have reminded the Senate before that, if 90 per cent of rural seats are held by the coalition, it is not surprising that in this instance that is where the money ends up. As I have said before, it was exactly where the money ended up when Labor administered its much smaller scheme when in governmentâsomething that Labor conveniently forgot when it decided to attack the coalition in this instance.</para><para>He also states that the number and value of project applications from coalition seats were significantly higher than from Labor seats. I have mentioned that. He found that rural communities are well organised and more familiar with the types of programs being run by the trust. Therefore, he put forward some suggestions that will encourage a broader range of applications in the future, and we will, of course, take up those suggestions. We already are, by the appointment of facilitators, trying to extend beyond the original landcare groups to other groups the capacity to make applications and quality applications. We accept these suggestions he made for improvements.</para><para>He said he would like to see more biodiversity experts on the panels. We have already put that in place. We acknowledged from the start that that was necessary, and this year's regional assessment panels will be better represented in that regard, as will the state assessment panels. He wanted us to 
 further communicate the emphasis the Commonwealth was placing on particular selection criteria. We have already done that this year through our letters and other published material to the states and to regional and other organisations.</para><para>These findings are a complete vindication of the government's actions in relation to the Natural Heritage Trust. I would like to put on the record too that they are a vindication of my departmental staff as well. The professionalism of the departmental staff in properly documenting all the decisions that were made should be commended.</para><para>It is a matter of great regret that literally tens of thousands of dollars of public money has now been wasted as a result of this Labor Party attempt to gain some political points when they knew they were never there in the first place. A lot of extra work had to be put in by departmental officers to meet the opposition's demands. Nevertheless that was duly done. In summary, this report is, therefore, a damning indictment of the Labor Party's politically motivated muckraking.</para><para>The most important thing now is for Senator Faulkner in this place, who I am pleased has come in here, to finally have the intestinal fortitude to apologise to the Baillieu family for so unjustly and maliciously defaming them in an attempt to try to attack us. We demonstrated in this place there was no foundation at all for his attacks on the Baillieu family. He accused them of colluding with us for their financial advantage. He accused some of those who have actually been dead for decades of colluding with us for financial advantage. It has been demonstrated that he failed to exercise any or due care in his attacks on those individuals.</para><para>It is time that he had the stomach, as I said, to come in here and apologise for doing that to that innocent family who are prepared to commit part of their land to protect important remnant vegetation in the public interest. For that, what did they get? They got attacked and abused by Senator Faulkner under the privilege of this place.</para><para>Now the Auditor-General has shown that there was no basis for that attack, surely the time is there for Senator Faulkner, if he is to 
 demonstrate any sort of leadership at all of the Labor Party in the Senate, to be willing to now stand up and say to the Baillieu family, `I'm sorry. I missed it. I got it wrong.' That would be the least he could do to demonstrate that sort of leadership to those of the Australian community who are prepared to make this commitment to better environmental practice.</para><para>I remind you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that some 6,000 different groups or individuals made applications under the first full year of this trust, which demonstrates how many Australians out there do want to contribute to better environmental management. By apologising to the Baillieus, he can indicate to those Australians that he recognises finally that the Natural Heritage Trust is a sound investment in Australia's environment. In fact, it is the largest investment by any Australian government in rectifying the damage that has been done to the Australian environment.</para><para>Senator Faulkner could finally be prepared to come on the record and say, `It's true. It is a good investment. The Labor Party recognises it. We fought it up hill and down dale. We opposed the funding basis for it. We said it would not work. We tried to rip the guts out of it in the attacks on the ministerial board. We even got the Auditor-General to assist us in that task. It has been demonstrated now publicly and with authority that there was no foundation at all for our baseless attacks. We're now prepared to get behind the trust and help make it work.'</para><para>If Senator Faulkner was prepared to get up here today and say that, he would actually be contributing to the good of Australia, which would be something of a change from what we usually get. Apart from that, if he does not get that far but at least apologises to the Baillieus, it would be a small step in the right direction.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>2568</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>â<inline font-style="italic">Audit Report No. 42 1997-98: Preliminary inquiries into the Natural Heritage Trust </inline> very much vindicates the opposition's highlighting of the funding imbalance, where $9 out of every $10 went to coalition electorates. In his report, the Auditor-General states that neither DPIE or Environment Australia chal 
 lenges Labor's analysis. This report also confirms Labor's highlighting of the degree of ministerial intervention into the process. It also states that, notwithstanding the circulation of extensive eligibility and selection criteria:</para></talk.start><para>. . . the emphasis placed on particular criteria by the Ministers was greater than expected by applicants, RAPs, SAPs, State and Territory Ministers and the Departments for the 1997-98 funding round.</para><para>In other words, the published criteria cannot explain the decisions that the ministers made. We were absolutely right in pointing out the unrepresentative nature of the panel composition, and the ministers themselves have agreed to make changes to that for the next round.</para><para>Our concerns that the Natural Heritage Trust must be improved if the environmental priorities, rather than the political priorities, are to be addressed are vindicated by this report. This report is not a clearance, as the Minister for the Environment, Senator Hill, reckons. In fact, the ANAO concludes, `There is scope to enhance the geographic reach.' As far as the selection process is concerned, the opposition stresses that this report indicates that the flaws in this program flow from the structure of the selection process.</para><para>What we have here is a scheme at the mercy of a submission-driven process which was grafted on to some existing rural landcare and catchment programs. A national government proposing a national scheme intended to address national problems should have ensured that funds went to all areas of need and should have avoided a situation where those already established groups were able to take advantage of the first round. By the time the ministers and the Australian National Audit Office acknowledged the imbalance in the representation on the community panels, the first round of fundingâalmost $200 millionâhad underwritten the coalition's political imperatives in the electoral cycle.</para><para>One of the concerns which the opposition had and which we put vigorously was the level of intervention by Senator Hill once the recommendations were put to him after this exhaustive, costly and independent process 
 had taken place. We recognise that the Auditor-General addressed himself to this particular concern and, given that Senator Hill invited me to comment on it, we note the very guarded language the Auditor used in reference to the Woodhouse Pastoral Company project or, if you like, the Baillieu family project.

Why did Senator Hill find it necessary to involve Senator Crane in making decisions about trust fund grants in Western Australia? Why did he fly Mr Billson to Adelaide to assist with the Victorian grant? Why was Senator Eggleston in the room? Any reader of this report looking for answers to those questions, for the Auditor's view of the propriety of Senator Hill's actions, would be very severely disappointed. He did not even look at it and he did not even address it.</para><para>The processes associated with the selection of the NHT projects may well have been transparent, but so is the inherent political 
 bias of those processes. Notwithstanding this report, the opposition remains very concerned at the skewed outcomes of the first round of funding under the multi-million dollar program.

What he is saying is that, irrespective of the evidence and irrespective of the findings of an independent arbiterâthe Auditor-General who is brought in to check these things and who gives it a tick on all countsâyou are interested only in the gutter.</para></talk.start><para><inline font-style="italic">Honourable senators interjecting</inline>â</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>LD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name></talker><para>âIt speaks volumes for your ethical standards and codes of practice.

We had lost our wayâour budget, under Labor, was $10.3 billion in deficit. Government debts had grown nearly $80 billion over five years. Looking out to the next century there was just a haze of deficit upon deficit and climbing ranges of debt which hemmed us in and closed off our future opportunities.</para><para>Australia needed direction. Australia had to change its way.</para><para>So our Government laid out a map. We marked out the places we wanted to get to. We identified the goals we wanted to achieve and we put down a timetable so we could measure our progress. So we could stay on track.</para><para>We wanted to get the budget out of deficitâout of the red and into the blackâin three years. We wanted to stabilise our growing debt then halve it (in proportion to GDP) in five years. We wanted to achieve our goals not by raising taxes but by spending taxpayers' money more efficiently and well.</para><para>That was two years ago. This coming year is the third year of the journey. We will finish the first leg in good shape. We have achieved our goal. Our budget is now in surplus. We are back in the black. We are back on track.</para><para>The Commonwealth budget will be in surplus in 1998-99âa surplus of $2.7 billion.</para><para>When we set out on this journey we knew it would be a tough road. If it were otherwise our predecessors would have taken it. And in many respects the road has become tougherâwith the severe turmoil in the Asian region.</para><para>But we all know that worthwhile achievement requires work and dedication and we have never lost sight of our goals.</para><para>The burdens were shared and the benefits will be shared. It was something that all of usâas Australiansâhave achieved together.</para><para>And now we set out on the second leg of our journey.</para><para>Our second leg is to pay our way now and set up opportunities for the future by repaying Labor's debt.</para><para>Repaying the debts of the past will secure the jobs for the future. Lower debt means lower interest payments. Our taxes will be lower and they will go on new services, better services, improving living standards, rather than servicing the past debts and the past failures.</para><para>We are now well on track.</para><para>In fact today we can map out even more exciting possibilities. The Government's sale of one third of the equity of Telstra gave millions of Australians the opportunity to share in the ownership of this companyâmums and dads, employeesâmany people who have never owned a share before in their lives.</para><para>The Government proposes to sell the further shares in this companyânot because we need to balance the budget. The budget is already balanced. But a once only sale will let us get a once only reduction in our debt burdenâa once only opportunity to reduce net debt to 1Â½ per cent of GDPâto wipe out Labor's debt for good. This would put the Commonwealth, at the Centenary of Federation, back in the strong position it had in the mid 1970sâin its best position in twenty-five years.</para><para>I said earlier that the burdens that have been shared mean that the benefits will be shared.</para><para>When we began this journey two years ago mortgage interest rates were 10Â½ per cent. Now they are closer to 6Â½ per cent. These are the lowest home mortgage rates since 1970. For the average Australian home buyer this represents a saving of $320 per monthâthey are $3,800 per year better off.</para><para>And low home interest rates means the affordability of housing has, according to the HIA index, improved by 24 per cent over the last two years. What this means is more 
 young Australians, more young families can buy their own home and get a start in life.</para><para>Young people and families are sharing the benefits of good economic policy.</para><para>Two years ago small business overdraft interest rates were over 11 per cent. Now they have come down to 7.7 per cent. These are the lowest rates for small business since the 1960s. At the start of the decade, under Labor, small business interest rates were 20.5 per centânearly three times the current rate. Small business is sharing the benefits of good policy.</para><para>If we had not acted to repair the nation's finances, if we had not acted to lock in low inflation, if we had not been able to enjoy lower interest rates, if we had not been able to help small business, jobs would have been lost. But these measures have allowed new jobs, better jobs to be created. Employees are sharing the benefits of good policy.</para><para>There are now more Australians in work then ever before. Whilst unemployment is too high, it is now the lowest it has been in Australia since 1990âthe lowest in eight years, the lowest since Labor's recession. That was the recession we did not have to have. Finally, we are over it.</para><para>CHALLENGES</para><para>In his first Budget Speech two years ago, he said that unless we acted decisively then ". . . Australia would be dangerously exposed to shifts in the international outlook . . ."</para><para>We did not know then that the Asian region would, as happened late last year, experience its greatest financial crisis ever and its largest downturn in economic growth since the oil shocks of twenty-five years ago. We did not know then that the Asian region, which for decades has been an engine for growth in Australia, would become a brake on our growth.</para><para>But we knew that prudent management meant we should strengthen the Australian economy against shocks outside our control. And we did. And it is now clear what an important decision that was. Our critics opposed us. Labor, which had put Australia in deficit, fought to keep it there. We are fortunate their views did not prevail.</para><para>In the midst of the turbulence of the region, Australia's economic growth will remain strongânot as strong as it could have been without this external downturn, a downturn beyond our controlâbut Australia will have one of the highest growth rates in the developed world. Importantly, Australia will be the strong economy of this region. Our economic fundamentals are as good as they have been for twenty-five years: low inflation, low interest rates, good growth, falling unemployment, falling debt and a budget swinging into surplus.</para><para>It is important to remember that this is the result of a coherent policy framework:</para><para>.	 a new framework for the conduct of monetary policy with  an agreed inflation objectiveâset with the Reserve Bankâkeeping inflation low;</para><para>.	 a Charter of Budget Honesty recognised as a standard setter by the International Monetary Fundâimplementing the best practice in the worldâkeeping the budget on track;</para><para>.	 a leading edge reform of the financial sector which has proven strong and will be strengthened further under new institutional arrangements flowing from the Financial System (Wallis) Inquiry; and</para><para>.	 a programme of Corporate Law Reform that will make Australia one of the most efficient, stable, reliable centres in the world to do businessâdirected to our objective of providing economic growth and jobs.</para><para>But the turbulent events of Asia in recent times should remind us of the need to continue to work to strengthen our future. While many hard yards have been covered, many more have to be travelled to improve our tax system, to improve our ports and wharfs, to keep our focus on a stronger economy and jobs, to maintain our commitment to help families, the elderly, and those in regional and rural Australia.</para><para>BUDGET OUTCOMES</para><para>Madam President, we have turned around the nation's finances without increasing the tax burden on Australians.</para><para>For the third time in a row, tonight the Treasurer will announce that there will be no 
 increase in income tax rates, no increase in the company tax rate, no increase in the wholesale sales tax, no increase in the petrol excise.</para><para>The uplift factor for provisional tax in 1998-99 will be reduced again one further percentage point to 5 per cent, half the rate that applied under Labor at the beginning of this decade. This will save business and individuals around $75 million in provisional tax instalments in the forthcoming year.</para><para>We are putting the nation's finances in order by being careful with government spendingâtargeting the areas of need, whilst eliminating rorts and wastage. In the social security area alone, in the first eighteen months of the Coalition Government more than $600 million was repaid by people who had received more than their entitlements. In 1996-97, $28 million a week was saved by cancelling payments to those who were not entitled to them.</para><para>Budget outlays as a proportion of GDP are expected to fall from around 27 per cent of GDP in 1995-96 to below 24 per cent by 2000-01. This represents an outcome not achieved since the early 1970s.</para><para>And careful management of the nation's finances has allowed us to redirect spending to those with greater need.</para><para>Care and Support for Older Australians</para><para>Madam President, the Government has already demonstrated its strong commitment to older Australians.</para><para>This is the only Government that has, by legislation, set the benchmark rate of the age pension at 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings. This means that although the Consumer Price Index did not increase last year, the rate of the age pension did. This delivered an increase in the pension of $6.80 per fortnight in March 1998. The Government has also provided for this increase to flow to the recipients of War Widows' pensions.</para><para>This Government also delivered tax fairness to the self-funded retiree. The Government has now introduced, in full, the availability of the pensioner tax rebate to self-funded retirees. Self-funded retirees now pay no more in tax for the same income than do pension 
 ers. This allows a qualifying single self-funded retiree to earn up to $12,163 without paying tax.</para><para>Starting from 1 July 1998, the savings rebate will reduce tax on savings by 7.5 per cent and by 1 July 1999 reduce tax on savings by 15 per cent up to the first $3000 of income.</para><para>The Government has decided that from 1 January 1999, a Gold Card for health care will be made available to an additional 50,000 Australian World War II veteransâthose who faced danger from hostile forces during that war. This measure, which costs around $500 million over four years, recognises the significant contribution made by Australia's war veterans. A grateful nation acknowledges the debt we owe them.</para><para>The Gold Card provides the veteran with free treatment as a private patient with choice of doctor or medical practitioner in hospital, together with a wide range of other services such as optical, dental, physiotherapy, podiatry and chiropractic services free of charge. These services are provided whether the conditions treated are service related or not. Gold Card holders receive the pensioner concession on pharmaceuticals. They are not required to pay the Medicare Levy. Their treatment is free.</para><para>This Government wants to encourage people to save for their own retirement. And so it is determined to support those retirees who through thrift are now living from their own savings.</para><para>To further encourage and support self-funded retirees, I announce tonight that eligibility for the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card is to be expanded from 1 January 1999.</para><para>The income test threshold for the card, which will be based on taxable income, is to be increased from around $21,000 to $40,000 per year for singles and from around $36,000 to $67,000 per year for couples. This change, costing $190 million over four years, is expected to allow some 220,000 additional self-funded retirees to qualify for the Seniors Health Card.</para><para>It will enable cardholders to purchase eligible pharmaceuticals for $3.20âthe same concessional rate as pensionersâwith any 
 prescriptions above 52 within a year being available free of charge.</para><para>1999 is the International Year of Older Persons. A Government programme which will focus on implementing practical initiatives for improving the health and well-being of older Australians and recognising their contribution to the community and nation is being put in place to mark this occasion.</para><para>A Healthy Australia</para><para>Madam President, the Government is also building a stronger health system.</para><para>Under Australian Health Care Agreements, Commonwealth funding available for public hospitals will increase by $2.9 billion over the next five years. In total, this will increase funding nearly 15 per cent in real terms and bring Commonwealth spending to $30.2 billion over the five year period. As part of this, the Commonwealth has taken on the full cost of purchasing veterans' health care, which is separately funded at $150 million per year. The extension of the Gold Card to an additional 50,000 veterans, separately funded for free treatment as private patients, creates additional places in the public system for others.</para><para>Health Care Agreement funding will ensure that public patients receive free access to public hospitals, and will facilitate reforms to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of health services. This demonstrates the Government's strong commitment to the public hospital system.</para><para>Earlier this year, the Government announced a range of measures to enhance the care of older people staying in the community, and to provide greater recognition and support for carers. The Government's package <inline font-style="italic">Staying at Homeâ</inline><inline font-style="italic">Care and Support for Older Australians</inline> , announced in April, will assist elderly Australians to remain independent and live in their own homes with additional care and support.</para><para>The measures, costing around $280 million over the next four years, will see the number of people receiving assistance through Community Aged Care Packages to stay in their own home double to 22,000; they expand eligibility for the Domiciliary Nursing Care 
 Benefit; they will establish another fifteen Carer Respite Centres to give those caring for older people the chance for respite and help them to look after elderly relatives; and they provide additional respite care places for people with dementia.</para><para>This year, the Commonwealth will also provide increased funding for the States of $130 million over five years under the new Commonwealth State Disability Agreement. This will provide for additional accommodation support services for people with disabilities. This funding is in addition to the $54 million in extra funding which was provided in the 1997-98 Budget.</para><para>Our efforts to improve the health of Australians do not end there.</para><para>Tonight, I am announcing the provision of around $80 million over four years to enhance preventive health programmes. This will fund a number of new programmes, including:</para><para>.	 a free annual influenza vaccine to all Australians over 65 in order to treat this preventible illness, as recommended by the National Health and Medical Research Council; and</para><para>.	 a $6.1 million programme to reduce tobacco-related illness including school education campaigns to warn our children of the dangers of smoking.</para><para>Following the successful introduction of Medicare claims units in pharmacies in rural Australia, the service will be extended to outer metropolitan and growth areas. Two hundred new units will open in pharmacies to allow people to access Medicare refunds from their local chemist.</para><para>Foster parents, who generously give love and care to children, will be entitled to have a Health Care Card for the child, if the child qualified in his or her previous family, to use for health expenses. This recognises the important role of carers and the health needs of those who are cared for by them.</para><para>The Government's commitment to medical research is demonstrated by our decision tonight to provide additional on-going funding for the National Health and Medical Research Council at a cost of around $175 million over four years. This provides longer term certainty 
 for the health and medical research industry, and will encourage those with research skills to participate or continue in medical research.</para><para>Expenditure on diagnostic imaging has grown significantly in recent years. Although this growth was slowed by measures introduced in the 1996-97 Budget, further reforms are needed to ensure that growth does not become unsustainable. The Government will be working with peak professional bodies to constrain diagnostic imaging expenditure.</para><para>The Government will also be taking steps to ensure that abuse and waste in the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is minimised, through enhancing the compliance activities of the Health Insurance Commission and the development of education and awareness programmes.</para><para>Youth, Education and Training</para><para>A key priority of the Government has been to expand employment opportunities, through labour market reform and improvements in Australia's education and training system. A particular concern has been our unemployed youth.</para><para>The Government's initiatives have included the major reform of the provision of employment services, with the establishment of the Job Network from May this year; improved incentives for employers to take on apprentices; and the Work for the Dole scheme.</para><para>The Work for the Dole scheme is based on the principle of mutual obligation. A person out of work is given income support by the community and is expected, in return, to support the community by doing useful projects, learning skills and keeping up work habits.</para><para>The Government is also providing an additional $350 million over four years for a range of measures to address problems associated with youth unemployment.</para><para>In particular, the Government is taking the Work for the Dole initiative further, requiring all young people unemployed for six months or more to participate in an activity in addition to looking for work. The additional activities required can include the Green Corps, education and training, a new 
 programme for literacy and numeracy or community job projects.</para><para>This Budget provides for the extension of the Job Placement, Employment and Training programme until the end of 1999-2000. This programme helps young people up to 21 years of age who face multiple disadvantages, particularly the homeless. It provides individual assistance, tailored to their particular needs, to help them overcome the barriers they face in putting their lives back on track.</para><para>A new Youth Allowance is being introduced, which simplifies income support arrangements for young Australians and encourages them to further their education and develop the basic skills needed to secure their future.</para><para>Additional funding is also being provided for programmes to facilitate the transition of young people from school to work and to assist those at risk of early school-leaving.</para><para>This year, the Government will establish a Volunteer Ambassadors for Development programme. This will provide the opportunity for around 500 young Australians of up to 30 years of age to live and work as volunteers in the Asia Pacific region. Volunteers will be involved in activities such as teaching, providing health services, advising small business and improving the environment. This will help build Australia's ties with the region. Importantly, it will also expand the skills and experience of the young people themselves.</para><para>In this Budget, the Government is also providing significant increases in resources to fight the scourge of drugs through the National Illicit Drugs Strategy. The Strategy involves funding of around $215 million over five years to reduce the demand and supply of illicit drugs in the community, for drug treatment and rehabilitation and for community education. The new initiatives funded in this Budget will involve establishing new strike teams against illegal drugs and fighting the drug trade at its source with new Federal Police posts overseas where the drug trade can be intercepted before it reaches our shores.</para><para>Rural and Regional Australia</para><para>Madam President, the importance of the rural industry to Australia, to the nation, can never 
 be forgotten. We know that many in the bush have faced difficult times, particularly because of drought.</para><para>Sound policy and low interest rates are of enormous benefit to rural and regional Australia. The $525 million Government package, <inline font-style="italic">Agricultureâ</inline><inline font-style="italic">Advancing Australia</inline> , aims to help farmers out of debt and drought problems and, through the new FarmBis programme, provides assistance to farmers to improve the management of their businesses.</para><para>Shortly after tonight, the Government is introducing legislation to provide a tax rebate for landcare works of 34 cents in the dollar. This will apply to expenditure in the 1997-98 financial year. Primary producers will be able to claim the rebate for works on levee or contour banks to control soil erosion, drainage works to control salinity, and the eradication of pests. There will be an annual limit of up to $10,000 for eligible landcare expenditures. The rebate will be available for those with taxable incomes of up to $20,700 from primary productionâor around 70 per cent of farmers. The landcare rebate is an incentive for farmers with low taxable incomes to improve their landâone of our country's greatest natural resources. The rebate, worth $80 million, will be paid from the Natural Heritage Trust.</para><para>In the coming year over $200 million will be spent on natural resource management and sustainable agriculture under the Natural Heritage Trust and other programmes.</para><para>Steps are being taken in this Budget to improve rural and regional health, through the expansion of multi-purpose health and family services for Australians in rural or remote areas. This involves providing a flexible, integrated range of health and family services in conjunction with the States, in areas where individual health and care programmes would not otherwise be viable. An extra thirty rural areas will have access to new multi-purpose services, with an additional 836 residential aged care places to be made available over four years. This is designed to complement services to older Australians in rural areas who want services near their friends and families.</para><para>Other Measures</para><para>Madam President, one of the first areas where the impact of the downturn in Asian economies has been felt is the Australian tourism industry. We recognise the importance of tourism for the Australian economy. In that context, we recognise the need to promote Australia effectively in the world tourism market.</para><para>Accordingly, this Budget provides increased funding of around $50 million over four years for the Australian Tourist Commission to improve Australia's promotional effort overseas in existing and emerging markets. A further $8 million will be provided over that period for the promotion of tourism in regional Australia.</para><para>The Government is also taking steps to enhance the effectiveness of Australia's immigration and visa procedures. Experience shows that there is a high risk that visitors from certain countries will attempt to remain in Australia after their visas expire. Accordingly, visa applications from those countries are to be more closely scrutinised. These measures are to be funded by introducing a new visitor charge for applicants from high risk countries. At the same time, arrangements provide for faster processing of travellers from low risk countries.</para><para>BUDGET REVENUES</para><para>In August last year the Prime Minister announced the Government's commitment to fundamental reform of the Australian taxation system.</para><para>Our current tax system is not serving Australia's interests and is therefore no longer appropriate to a modern and dynamic economy.</para><para>It is unnecessarily complexâthe result of years of changes to patch up a system that was first developed in the 1930s.</para><para>It imposes high rates of personal tax on additional earnings for Australians who do not have high incomes. The interaction of the tax and social security systems reduces the incentive to find work, or to earn more. Reward for effort is taken away through tax and reduced benefits. </para><para>The tax system includes a Wholesale Sales Tax which applies high tax rates on a relatively narrow range of goods including many everyday items. The structure of the indirect tax system also adds to the costs of businesses and penalises our exporters.</para><para>A more certain, fair and efficient tax system is necessary as Australia enters the next century. We need a tax system that ensures that all parts of the community pay a fair share of tax.</para><para>In its first two Budgets the Government has taken action to protect honest taxpayers by clamping down on tax avoidance and tax minimisation. This has been achieved without increasing the overall tax burden facing the community.</para><para>But repair and maintenance of the present taxation system can only go so far. In short, it is no longer a sufficient option for achieving fairness and avoiding disincentives to work. We must have fundamental reform of the taxation system.</para><para>Madam President, since the Government is committed to ensuring all taxpayers meet their obligations, I am announcing tonight an extension of the funding for a special taskforce within the Australian Taxation Office which is investigating the tax minimisation practices of some high wealth individuals. Examination to date has already unearthed a number of undesirable practices. Tonight's Budget sets aside $19 million for this taskforce which is expected to yield $200 million in additional tax compliance over the next two years.</para><para>Year 2000 Computer Software</para><para>The Government considers that expenses incurred in detecting and remedying software problems associated with the Year 2000 millennium bug should, in general, be immediately deductible for taxation purposes.</para><para>To a limited extent this is provided for in the current law but amendments will be made where this is not so. This decision reflects the Government's determination that businesses should be encouraged to take all steps to iron out possible computer software failure before the Year 2000.</para><para>The Government has also decided to amend the taxation law as it applies to computer software expenditure in response to a recent announcement by the Commissioner of Taxation withdrawing a ruling that deals with the taxation treatment. Unless the Government acted, most software expenditure could not be written off for taxation purposes or at best could be written off over twenty-five years. Most software expenditure would have been treated as capital and therefore as not deductible in the year incurred.</para><para>The Government has decided to act in response to provide that expenditure on acquiring or developing computer softwareâapart from that associated with Year 2000 complianceâwill be written off over 2Â½ years.</para><para>The write-off rate of 2Â½ years reflects the relatively short expected effective life of software arising from rapid developments in the information technology industry.</para><para>The proposed arrangements are generous compared to those applying in comparable overseas taxation jurisdictions.</para><para>The new arrangements will encourage business modernisation and apply from the time of withdrawal of the ruling.</para><para>I am also announcing some measures that will simplify the tax law and address some potential anomalies.</para><para>A new generic tax framework will be introduced for the demutualisation of non-insurance organisations. Demutualisation is an emerging trend as more sectors of the Australian economy respond to increasing competition and structural reform. The development of the framework has benefited from extensive public input. It will provide greater certainty for organisations about the taxation consequences of demutualisation.</para><para>The Government has decided to increase the revenue collected through telecommunications numbering charges in order to better reflect the market value of these numbers and discourage hoarding. Additional revenue of around $30 million per annum will be collected from telecommunications carriers for the use of special service telephone numbers such as `13' and `180' numbers. The Government's decision recognises the fact that

But for the effect of Asia we would be looking at a continuation of rapid growth in 1998-99.</para><para>The strong growth in activity in 1997-98 reflects strong private sector demand. This is expected to carry into 1998-99. Investment plans remain strong, supported by low interest rates and high corporate profits. The housing recovery is proceeding and consumption will be supported by continued favourable labour market conditions.</para><para>Employment growth should remain firm, supported by recent and prospective growth in non-farm activity. The unemployment rate is forecast to fall to around 7Â¾ per cent in the year ahead.</para><para>While inflation will rise gradually in the year ahead, it is under control and expected to remain within the RBA's medium-term target band.</para><para>The slowdown in some of our Asian trading partners will reduce Australia's export returns. Continued strength in the domestic economy will lead to a temporary rise in the current account deficit, edging it up to an average 5Â¼ per cent in the coming year.</para><para>However, the rise in the current account deficit in prospect is expected to remain below the peaks in the 1980s and mid-1990s.</para><para>And importantly, the rise in the current account deficit in prospect is taking place in clearly different circumstances to those earlier episodes. It does not reflect excessive growth in domestic demand. It is taking place in a period where the Government has locked in low inflation. It is occurring against the 
 backdrop of policies designed to increase public saving and to provide a better environment for private saving.</para><para>As a result, investor confidence in Australia can be expected to remain strong.</para><para>CONCLUDING COMMENTS</para><para>Madam President, on its election the Government mapped a course for economic and social prosperity into the next century.</para><para>This Government was determined to deliver, not just for this generation, but the next.

 of the Australian pork industry. On 7 April the Senate supported a motion that I moved calling on the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Anderson, to take immediate action to assist the Australian pork industry. Specifically, the Senate called on the Howard government to launch an immediate inquiry to determine whether the level of imported pig meat was the primary cause of the industry's current difficulties. If that proved to be the case, then the Senate called on the government to look to the `emergency protection of an industry' provisions of the World Trade Organisation rules to limit the volume of imports. The motion also called on the government to review the current level of financial assistance available to the industry and put in place proper labelling arrangements.</para></talk.start><para>There is no doubt that the industry was in a state of crisis at that time. In many instances, the prices received by growers were well below the cost of production. Following that Senate resolution, two things happened. Prices deteriorated further. The front page of the May issue of the <inline font-style="italic">Pig Producer</inline> says it all with the heading `Farmers Shoot PigsâThey can't sell them'. The minister, Mr Anderson, decided to play politics with the issue. In an interview on the ABC <inline font-style="italic">Country Hour</inline>, the minister claimed that there had not been a rise in imports. He said:</para><para>My honest assessment of that is that at the moment it is likely to be found that there's been no particular rise in what's coming in.</para><para>In fact, what's coming in now is what was allowed in under the 1992 protocol set up by Labor.</para><para>He continued:</para><para>Nothing extra is coming in from Canada or Denmark under the slightly revised protocols that were issued in November last year which caused so much concern.</para><para>I was very surprised that the minister was so out of touch with the circumstances of this important industry. The reason why I raised this matter in the first place was because it was obvious to meâand to everyone else except Minister Andersonâthat the pork industry was in trouble and needed help from the government. That is why governments are elected, is it not? That is the reason why we 
 have a minister for primary industries, is it not?</para><para>I said that this was not the minister's fault because import protocols for imported pig meat were varied last November. I said that there had been a surge in imports and a collapse in the domestic price and that the government needed to look at that as a matter of urgency. I said that, if imports were the major problem, then there were things that the government could go to to assist the industry. I called on the government to look at what action could be taken within the terms of our GATT arrangements.</para><para>That was the view, apparently, of 75 other senators. The resolution had the support of National Party senators, Liberal Party senators, my own colleagues, the Democrats, the Greens and the Independents, but apparently not Mr Anderson or Mr Fischer. I believe that the Senate saw this as an apolitical issue, but the minister was not of the same view. He did not say, `Yes, there is a problem and we will do what we can.' He said, `There has not been an increase in imports and, anyway, it's all Labor's fault.'</para><para>There were record imports in 1997. Over 11,000 tonnes were imported, resulting in a fall in pig prices in the lead-up to last Christmas for the first time in history. Most of these imports were boneless leg meat, which is the premium market segment in Australia. The majority of this meat is manufactured into ham. Canadian imports now account for 30 per cent of this segment of the market in this country. The fact that an unlimited quantity is available through imports means that processors are able to bargain the domestic market down.</para><para>A number of processors have also contracted for imports and are, therefore, not in the market for Australian pigs whatever the price on offer. Some producers cannot even give their pigs away. Despite what the minister might say, there has been a significant increase in imports over the past year, and in imports of special cuts, not just pig meat. The prices being received by growers are now at their lowest level for 30 years. Prices are currently in the range of $1.28 to $1.70 a kilogram, with a national average of around 
 $1.50 a kilogram. The average cost of production is around $2 a kilogram. A farmer with an average 100-sow piggery is currently losing over $1,000 a week.</para><para>The minister must also be aware that pork producers do not have the same options as the extensive livestock industries to hold stock back during periods of low prices. The pigs have to be fed and if they are fed they grow, and if they grow too much there is no market for them. For that reason, when the government failed to respond quickly to the terms of the Senate motion, I wrote both to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade. I urged both ministers to immediately investigate the state of the industry and the impact imports were having. Mr Anderson had the courtesy to acknowledge my letter. Unfortunately, Mr Fischer has not even bothered to do that.</para><para>On 24 April, Mr Anderson finally released a media statement announcing that he would consider an application from the pork industry for the provision of exceptional circumstances assistance to producers. He said that he had asked the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics to conduct an analysis of the state of the industry. I understand that that work has been completed and is with the minister.</para><para>There is a need to look at how this industry can best be helped through this extremely difficult period. The provision of exceptional circumstances assistance is, in my opinion, not the answer. At best, it is part of the solution. Some action to deal with the volume of imports must also be considered and the Deputy Prime Minister has a key role to play in this regard. The government plan for this industry is to help it export its way out of trouble. I believe that the $10 million package that the government offers this industry is designed to do just that.</para><para>I note that, in a media release, Mr Fischer said that a trade delegation to Russia in the next few weeks will include representatives from the pork industry. I agree that the future of the industry is to be found in a growing export sector, but that cannot happen if the breeding sow herd is not sustained. The herd 
 is now clearly under threat, with the prospect of hundreds if not thousands of producers being forced out of business. I am sure that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy understands this point very well. It was an issue which he pursued with some vigour in relation to the nation's sheep and cattle breeding herds during the 1994 drought.</para><para>The record shows that the pork industry supports trade that is fair and free, but the industry is quite rightly opposed to competition from countries which subsidise and protect their own industries. Denmark has granted unimpeded access to Australia for pork product exports to Denmark, but only as long as our local producers pay a tariff of up to $3,145 a tonne. I believe that Canada provides its domestic industry with production subsidies of around 16 per cent. The Canadian High Commissioner has contacted my office and suggested that this figure has been reduced to 11 per cent. I am investigating that matter further.</para><para>If the Australian pork industry were to enjoy a production subsidy of 16 per cent a year, it would cost the government around $100 million annually. We are certainly not talking about level playing fields when we talk about Canadian and European Union imports. I note that a recent issue of the <inline font-style="italic">Pig International</inline> magazine refers to the active role of provincial governments in Canada in the expansion of the pork industry. In a column in that magazine, the editor, Mr Peter Best, says that there is expected to be a significant expansion in pig production in Alberta `now that projects have access to a preferential loan program underwritten by about $50 million of government funds'. That is what he says the Canadian government is doing.</para><para>It is important to note, and it is important for the government to acknowledge, that the Australian pork industry has been going through a significant period of change. In the 1970s, there were more than 40,000 producers; now there are just over 3,000. Very few sectors in the rural economy have experienced such a significant change. The pork industry for the 1990s produces more meat of a better 
 quality at a lower production cost than ever before.</para><para>Such a radical change was not without difficulties, but this sector accepted that it had no choice. It has been underpinned by a considerable producer investmentâaround $12 million annuallyâin research and development and marketing programs. This change has come about without the support of the price stabilisation schemes, floor prices, single-desk arrangements or import tariffs and quotas enjoyed by the wool, wheat, sugar and dairy producers.</para><para>Some 34 days have passed since the Senate called on the government to take action in support of the pig industry. Since that day, the industry estimates that it has lost another $10 million. In these circumstances, and considering the desperate situation that this sector of the economy is in, it is incumbent on the government to act and to act soon.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Pork Industry</title><page.no>2582</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>2582</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">Senator FERGUSON</name><name.id>EP5</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI had not intended to speak tonight on the adjournment but having listened to Senator O'Brien I feel obliged to respond to some of the issues he has raised tonight. I do so knowing that had I spoken on this some four years ago I would have had to declare an interest, having spent 30 years in the pig industry as an owner and managing a piggery in conjunction with my brother. I do not know how long Senator O'Brien has been involved in the pig industry or whether he has just collected information that has been passed on to him by other pig producers, but he accuses the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) of playing politics when in fact I am not sure whether the person who is playing politics is not Senator O'Brien himself.</para></talk.start><para>I attended a very large meeting at Balaklava in South Australia about two weeks ago at which some 250 pig producers attended. One of the issues that was raised was the notice of motion that was given in this place by Senator O'Brien. There are many people outside the parliament who are totally unaware of the procedures of the parliament and the tech 
 niques that are used by opposition senators and at times by government senators as well.</para><para>I do recall on one occasion prior to Senator O'Brien's notice of motion, which was formally passed, that there had been 130 notices of motion put in place as a political tactic by the opposition because this was the way they wanted to proceed on a certain day. On this particular occasion, Senator O'Brien's motion, which was passed without debate by this Senate, called on this government to do certain things. People who are unaware of the procedures and tactics that often take place in this chamber were quite surprised that the very next morning something had not happened as a result of Senator O'Brien's motion being passed unanimously.</para><para>I have no objection to Senator O'Brien highlighting the difficulties the pork industry is facing. In all of my years in the pork industry there were always ups and downsâsome terrific ups and some tremendous downs. I have to say that in all the years I was involved in the pig industry there was never a crisis as much as there is today. I will concede that point. Prices are as low as they have ever been. But they are not the lowest for 30 years. Senator O'Brien said that the prices per kilogram were the lowest they had been for 30 years. They are not. In adjusted terms they may be, but they certainly are not in real terms.</para><para>The government in acknowledging the problemâand it does acknowledge that the problem exists in the pork industryâis doing its best to endeavour to try to help pork producers and pig meat producers in Australia within the constraints of our international obligations. It is important to remember that those international obligations were put in place by the Australian Labor Party when they were in government. Ten years of negotiations with the World Trade Organisation, the Uruguay Round and the GATT talks took place in order for the existing international agreements on tariffs and trades to be put in place. They were not put in place lightly, and they had the total support of the National Farmers Federation at that time. The pig producers and pig meat producers, being members of that National Farmers Federation 
 and by their very association, supported the actions that took place at that time.</para><para>There are a number of measures that the government cannot take. One of the things that was in your notice of motion, if I remember rightly, and certainly one that has been brought forward by the Pork Council of Australia, is that we immediately stop the imports of Canadian pork. It may not have been in Senator O'Brien's motion that there be a call for an immediate pause on imports, but certainly the Pork Council requested the primary industries minister that there be an immediate pause on the importation of pork.</para><para>I was asked at this particular meeting as an individual rather than as a member of the government whether I would support those first two clauses. In response to those pork producersâand as you can imagine they were not there for a discussion; they were there to try to tell me about the difficulties that they were going through, and I did understand their difficulties because I have been through them myselfâI said that I would only support the cause that was put forward by the Pork Council provided it could be done within the framework of our international obligations and in no other way. I believe that they must be adhered to. If we are going to maintain the trust we have with our trading partners and if we are going to maintain our integrity, it must be done within the international framework that has been put in place.</para><para>I do not believe there is a level playing field. I do not know anybody who believes there is a level playing field. Let me say that it is more level than it has ever been in the past number of years. It is not level but it is more level. We are not looking for a level playing field; we are looking for fairer trading terms. I believe the negotiations that have taken place in the last 10 or 12 years, for which the previous government deserves some credit for the role they took, have put us in a better position now than we have ever been.</para><para>It does stand to reason that there are some industries that have suffered more through this process than other industries. Right now the pig meat industry is one of those industries that is suffering. I can promise Senator O'Brien that the government is aware of the 
 difficulties. We hold 42 of the 45 rural seats in Australia. So there is hardly a lower House member of parliament who does not have a pig producer in his electorate who has not contacted him and said how difficult things are at present.</para><para>Being aware of their situation and determining what we can do under the current agreements we are working with is a far more difficult situation than the simplistic arrangements of saying, `Stop the imports' or `give money to the industry.' The real difficulty, which Senator O'Brien has highlighted and one that I have known myself over all those years, is that you cannot hold your product for any length of time. It has to be sold when it is ready to be sold. The real difficulty is that, although we may wish to put export programs into place, if that takes a period of six months or more and if prices do not recover in a very short time, it will be too late for many of the producers we are trying to protect.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5F4</name.id><name role="metadata">CALVERT</name><name role="display">Senator Calvert</name></talker><para>âAnd the abattoirs, too.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>2583</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">Senator FERGUSON</name><name.id>EP5</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe other thing is that, over time, as my colleague Senator Calvert says, the abattoirs that we currently have in place are simply not capable of handling and processing the amount of export trade we would like to put in place on an urgent basis. It just cannot be done. There is a significant amount of work to be done particularly in the area of slaughtering and abattoirs in order for the magnitude of exports that we want to take place to take place.</para></talk.start><para> The argument was brought forward at that meeting that the Canadians have reduced the amount of beef that we can send into Canada, but in fact they are sending pig meats to Australia. The argument in world trade terms is that we can send as much pig meat to Canada as we like. If you are going to compare trading terms, you have to compare apples with apples. It just happens that the trading terms favour the Canadians in particular, and I am thinking of the Canadians more than anybody else because they are the ones that have had the major impact on Australian trading in pig meat over the past four or five months. The Canadians can in fact do it on better trading terms than we can at present.</para><para>In raising this, Senator O'Brien raises a very important issue. We have to be very careful that we go past the politics of the issue which Senator O'Brien raises when he asks why the government has not done something after 34 days. An anti-dumping case was taken and thrown out of court, so we cannot use anti-dumping. The measures that were brought forward about subsidised arrangements for Canadian pig meat simply did not stand up in court, so we cannot use anti-dumping as a measure. We can look at countervailing measures but that takes time. As you know, there is no time for us to act successfully in the case of many pig producers that are currently experiencing such difficulties.</para><para> I can assure Senator O'Brien that the government is very conscious of the problem that exists in the pig industry at present. It is very conscious that whatever action has to be taken has to be taken as urgently as possible. It will respond to the request that the Pork Council asked to be responded to within the 60 days. I can promise you that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Anderson, is very conscious of the matter along with a number of other issues that are troubling primary producers throughout Australia at present. I can promise you that this government will take every action necessary and possible to alleviate the problems that are currently facing Australia's pig meat producers at this time.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Compact Disc Imports</title><page.no>2584</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:25:00</time.stamp><page.no>2584</page.no><name role="metadata">Lundy, Sen Kate</name><name role="display">Senator LUNDY</name><name.id>7G6</name.id><electorate>ACT</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âOver the last few months the government and Professor Fels from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission have made a number of assertions about how the Australian record industry will benefit from the introduction of parallel importing provisions for CDs. On 20 March this year the ACCC issued a press release stating that the price of CDs in Australia is extremely high and that consumers receive no benefits whatsoever from the Australian recording industry. Professor Fels's solution is to introduce parallel importing which he mistakenly claims will reduce the 
 cost of CDs without any effect on the local music industry.</para></talk.start><para> Senator Alston, political master of relevance deprivation, has relied exclusively on Professor Fels's arguments even though they are based on research conducted more than eight years ago. The government is now proceeding, thanks to special cabinet approval prior to the budget, with a three-quarters of a million dollar information campaign designed to target those who do not concur with the government's view on CD parallel importation. Out there in the community the government specifically identifies youth, media and, believe it or not, government backbenchers to persuade them to come to the government's view.</para><para> This public expenditure prior to the passage and debate of the bill that affects the changes I have mentioned is a cynical mechanism to fund a political campaign, because I doubt that we will see this issue debated before the election is called. The lack of leadership with respect to the development of Australia's greatest creative and cultural strength exposes the fragmented and inconsistent approach the coalition has on industry development. Senator Alston as minister for the arts and information economy should understand more than anybody else the exciting developments in on-line content using the creative platform of music. However, instead of advocating the strengths of creative content generally, he is undermining it. This debate is not about just what is happening now; it is about what happens next.</para><para> When almost every other country is seeking stronger controls over intellectual property and copyright, the coalition wants to throw protection for Australian culture out the window. They want to wind back the type of copyright protection that virtually every other country uses to foster and protect their music culture. It is an interesting and pertinent exercise to review what other countries are doing in terms of copyright policy and protection.</para><para> In England, a 1994 report by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission concluded that uncontrolled importation of CDs would result in a worse situation for consumers. According 
 to this report, the removal of parallel import provisions in the UK would be damaging because of the increased risks of privacy and the threat that weakened copyright protection would cause. In 1995 the Music Industry Group of the Irish Business and Employers Confederation reported to the Irish government on their music industry. They concluded that the success of the Irish music industry is dependent on the ability to capture revenues generated by Irish composers, performers, publishers and producers. They found that unless a reasonable share of these benefits return to local composers, publishers, venues, recording and production companies and record retailers the music industry will wither and die.</para><para> By way of explanation, it is worth saying at this point that parallel importation causes the bypassing of the payment of royalties to artists thus removing an incentive for them to create and earn revenue from their original works. Of particular significance is that the report to the Irish government found that:</para><para>Unless the originators of unique works can be confident that they will be rewarded for their work, original work will disappear. Likewise, if record companies cannot be sure that they can be remunerated for their investment in the development of recordings, they will withdraw from the industry.</para><para>The report also stated that jobs and prosperity in Ireland were dependent on the protection of intellectual property rights. Amazingly, and let me state this clearly for coalition members, the Irish music industry identified Australia as one of the main countries to adopt policies that supported intellectual copyright protection. I say `amazingly' because this report is dated 1995.</para><para>The Liberal government of Australia is proposing to remove this very same protection that is held up by other countries as an essential policy level that ensures a viable and identifiable part of a nation's culture. Ireland is just one example of how other countries protect intellectual copyright.</para><para>A similar report in 1994 concluded that the success of Canadian culture was also dependent on the existence of adequate copyright laws. They found:</para><para>Only if songwriters, composers, performers, music publishers and sound recording companies are able to control the use of their work . . . can the music industry succeed and creators and performers have successful professional careers.</para><para>The Irish and Canadian governments both see music as a fundamental component of their culture. They have commissioned reports that confirmed the need for strong copyright protection to ensure the survival of their indigenous music.</para><para>To put it simply, copyright laws are required in order for the creators of cultural works to be protected against unauthorised use of their works. Copyright laws also protect those who have invested in and nurtured cultural industries. Copyright laws also protect artists from CD piracy, which is estimated to be worth a staggering $2,246 million a year.</para><para>It is far easier for this government to say, `Cheaper CDs for all,' than it is for them to explain the machinations of copyright and unauthorised sound recordings. Blind repetition of a populist mantra must not be interpreted as an argument of substance. A closer analysis exposes the flaws in the government's position and their blatant manipulation of the facts.</para><para>Professor Fels holds up Sweden as an example of a country with successful parallel importing laws. Yet Sweden has produced only two international acts in the last 20 yearsâAbba and Roxette. Norway, a country where CDs are more expensive than here, experimented with parallel importing but was soon beset by a major influx of pirated CDs and unauthorised imports.</para><para>England does not allow parallel importing and it has more expensive CDs than Australia when you consider the weakness of the dollar against the pound. Hong Kong, a great promoter of free trade, has moved to strengthen the ban on parallel importation of intellectual property rights. In fact, it costs less to buy a full-priced CD here than in Japan, France, Spain, Germany, Denmark, Norway, Greece, Sweden and the UK.</para><para>Finally, we have the USA, a country where CDs allegedly are so cheap that we must 
 dismantle our copyright protection so that consumer goods are the same price here. Professor Fels has stated that it is:</para><para>. . . inconceivable, given the price differences between Australia and the US, that the price [of CDs] would not fall.</para><para>However, even Professor Fels would be hard-pressed to continue that argument based on retail price, given that the dollar is now hovering around 64c to the greenback.</para><para>The Prime Minister has also taken the opportunity to play patsy with CD prices. On 16 October 1997, the Prime Minister told a press conference that parallel importing will mean that CDs will fall by at least $7 per item. Given the current state of the Australian dollar, Mr Howard's blind boast looks all the more ridiculous. As of today, an Australian retailer importing premium priced CDs from the US will pay $24.66, and  that is before any retail mark-up is added. The truth is that the price of CDs in Australia is not comparatively excessive. When you consider that over 50 per cent of CDs sold here retail for $20 or under, I fail to see how Professor Fels can allege that prices are extremely high. There is nothing of substance to substantiate this statement.</para><para>Consider the fact that many countries are net producers and exporters of contemporary music and many others are net consumers. That is why intellectual copyright protection is so important in terms of cultural identification. Without adequate laws to protect intellectual property and ensure the artists, composers and record companies are rewarded for their talent and investment, Australian music would not exist. We in Australia are quick to celebrate the success of our music industry. We must be as quick to nurture, to protect and to provide support to that industry.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><adjournment><adjournmentinfo><time.stamp>20:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>2586</page.no></adjournmentinfo><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senate adjourned at 8.35 p.m.</inline></para></adjournment><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>2586</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tabling</title><page.no>2586</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following government documents were tabled:</para><para>Administrative Appeals Tribunal ActâAdministrative Review CouncilâReport for 1996-97âErrata.</para><para>Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission ActâHuman Rights and Equal Opportunity CommissionâReportâThose who've come across the seas: Detention of unauthorised arrivals.</para><para>TreatiesâText, together with national interest analysisâ</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Bilateral</inline> â</para><para>		 Agreement between Australia and the Islamic Republic of Pakistan on the Promotion and Protection of Investments, done as Islamabad on 7 February 1998.</para><para>		 Exchange of Notes constituting an Agreement to further amend the Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of New Zealand on Social Security of 19 July 1994.</para><para>		 Films Co-Production Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of Ireland, done at Dublin on 4 February 1998.</para><para>		 Headquarters Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna, done at Canberra on 20 January 1998.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Multilateral</inline> â</para><para>		 Amendment, done at Montreal on 17 September 1997, to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer of 16 September 1987.</para><para>		 Amendment and adoption of Annexes, done at Kuching, Malaysia, on 27 February 1998, to the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal of 22 March 1989.</para><para>		 Fifth Protocol, done at Geneva on 12 December 1997, to the General Agreement on Trade in Services of 15 April 1994.</para><para></para></subdebate.1></debate></chamber.xscript><answers.to.questions><debate><debateinfo><type>Answers to Questions on Notice</type><title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title><page.no>2587</page.no></debateinfo><para>The following answers to questions were circulated:</para><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Research Nature and Costs</title><page.no>2587</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 903)</subtitle><id.no>903</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>2587</page.no><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator Robert Ray</name><name.id>UI4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Treasurer, upon notice, on 16 October 1997:</para></talk.start><para>(1) What qualitative or quantitative research has been undertaken by the Department and its agencies since 3 March 1996.</para><para>(2) What was the nature of the research undertaken (sample sizes, questionnaire length, evaluation) and to whom were the results of the research available.</para><para>(3) In each instance, which firm or firms have been engaged to undertake this work.</para><para>(4) In each instance, what has been the cost of the work undertaken.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>2587</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator Kemp</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><para>The information sought is provided for each agency in the portfolio.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Treasury Department</inline></para><para>Since 3 March 1996 two research consultancies have been contracted by the Department of the Treasury.

From year to year there are a number of inputs and outputs which affect the overall level of non-government school enrolments. New students enter the non-government sector </para><para></para><para>either as new starters or through transfer from the government sector. Students leave the non-government sector at the completion of their education or to transfer to the government sector. There are 12 categories of Commonwealth funding for non-government schools. As the Government does not track individual students, it is not possible to identify the funding category of the schools the students entering the non-government sector are enrolled in. This is further complicated by the movement of students between non-government schools with different funding category levels and of students leaving the non-government sector to enter the government sector. It is therefore not viable to provide an accurate cost to the Commonwealth of the increase in non-government school enrolments in 1997.</para><para>(5) (a) Budget enrolment projections are based on ABS population projections, and grade progression ratios.

People with this level of expertise have been involved in research funded by a range of sources. If experts who have had any involvement with industry in the past were excluded from participation, it would be almost impossible to establish an Expert Committee.</para><para>(a) I am advised that that Dr Ken Joyner was invited to participate on the NHMRC's EME Expert Committee because of his internationally recognised expertise in the fields of physical dosimetry, radiation physics and engineering.

Professor Basten is the Executive Director, Centenary Institute of Cancer, Medicine and Cell Biology and the Head of the Department of Clinical Immunology, Prince Alfred Hospital as well as having a strong involvement in internationally recognised research in the RF EME field. Dr Harris is a Senior Research Fellow at the Walter and Eliza Hall, Molecular Genetics of Cancer Division, and was also involved in internationally recognised research in the field.</para><para>(2) Yes.</para><para>(3) Yes. The NHMRC's guidelines relating to conflict of interest are a matter for the NHMRC. However, I am advised that the NHMRC's conflict of interest guidelines are not limited to pecuniary interest but also cover both indirect pecuniary interest and non-pecuniary interest, and that any actual or potential (or perceived) conflict must be disclosed. 
</para><para>(4) Adherence to the procedures outlined in the NHMRC's guidelines is a matter for the Council. I have been advised by the NHMRC that the procedures outlined in the guidelines are being been followed in the process. You may wish to note that there have been no grant approvals to date as I understand the process has not progressed to that stage.</para><para>(5) The appointment of members to the NHMRC Expert Committee is a matter for the Council and it is inappropriate for me to express a view on its composition.
