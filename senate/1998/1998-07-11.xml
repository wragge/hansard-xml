I think it is time for the Senate to suspend debate on this bill, to finish this debate, to adjourn it, and for the electorate to have an opportunity to decide the issue of the full privatisation of Telstra. John Howard made a solemn commitment before the last election that only one-third of Telstra would be privatised. John Howard said that in the 
 life of this parliament he would privatise only one-third of Telstra and we are now in high farce mode debating an issue which the Prime Minister of Australia gave an ironclad commitment would not happen during the life of this parliament.</para></talk.start><para>I think all senators are aware that a deal has been done on the issue of the full privatisation of Telstra. All senators are aware that behind closed doors yesterday Senator Colston met the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, for apparently one hour in Brisbane and understandings on this issue were reached. We say that this Senate has an entitlement to know what those understandings were. We have a situation where Senator Colston at no time is willing, or able, to make a contribution to debate. We had the situation, for example, with the Native Title Billwhere Senator Colston supported the government through thick and thin, but at no time did he make any contribution on the floor of this Senate, be it in the committee stage or in the second or third reading debates.</para><para>Senator Colston put certain demands, we understand, to the Prime Minister about accepting his vote in the Senate, because I think senators would be aware that, after the opposition campaigned for a long time on the fact that Senator Colston's vote was tainted, Senator Colston's vote was bought for the deputy presidency of the Senate. After arrangements were come to in relation to the first one-third privatisation of Telstra and a staff upgrade was agreed to in the Deputy President's office, I think eventuallyâonly because of Labor Party and public pressureâreluctantly and belatedly Mr Howard agreed not to accept Senator Colston's vote in this chamber.</para><para>We know that one of the demands that Senator Colston has put to the Prime Minister is that his vote be counted by the government. I want to know what else Senator Colston put to Mr Howard. I think we are entitled to know what arrangements have been agreed between Mr Howard and Senator Colston. I think we are also entitled to know what the nature of any arrangements between Senator Harradine and Mr Howard and the government might be on this issue. I do hope that at 
 some stage during the debate both Senator Harradine and Senator Colston outline those arrangements to the committee or to the Senate as a whole.</para><para>The situation is this: the National Party throughout Australia have major internal concerns and major constituency concerns with the issue of the full privatisation of Telstra. We have two National Party members of the House of Representatives already, the member for Dawson, Mrs De-Anne Kelly, and the member for Kennedy, Mr Bob Katter. Both have indicated that they will not support the full privatisation of Telstra again in the House of Representatives. The problem is that, when this matter was debated first in the House of Representatives, Mr Katter was missing in actionâhe was not thereâbut Mrs Kelly did support the government on that occasion. But we all know that the key vote on this issue is the one that will take place in the Senate.</para><para>In the House of Representatives it does not really matter if a few National Party members, who have got the message from their constituency, cross the floor. But in the Senate it does matter because Senator Boswell and his team can actually affect the fate of this bill. If Senator Boswell's National Party colleaguesâSenator O'Chee, Senator Brownhill, Senator McGauran, Senator Sandy Macdonald and Senator Tamblingâjoin him, if even one of them crosses the floor, stand up for rural and regional Australia, stand up for their constituency, stand up for the bush, then they can defeat this bill.</para><para>The problem we have is this: there is no evidence that National Party senators have the same electoral instincts, the same survival instincts or the same level of intestinal fortitude that some of the National Party members of the House of Representatives have. I outlined yesterday the sort of representation that we have here in the Senate from the National Party. It is important that the Australian people understand the change that has occurred in the National Party over recent years. After all, we have a situation where the Country Party of oldâthe old National Party, the National Party of `Black Jack' McEwen, of Doug Anthony and of Ian Sinclairâhas 
 long gone. The courageous National Party of yesteryear, I am afraid, is just a footnote of history.</para><para>The National Party of today is the Charles Blunt, Tim Fischer, Senator Ron Boswell National Party. I think, Madam President, that you would be aware that in days of yore you would not have had anyone like McEwen, Anthony or Ian Sinclair roll over on an issue like this, which is of significance to the National Party's bush constituency. They simply would not have done it. They simply would not have accepted the Liberal Party's domination in the coalition government. They just would not have sold out their constituency the way the National Party of 1998 is willing to do.</para><para>I do not know how Senator Ron Boswell and Senator Bill O'Chee can hold up their heads in the Queensland National Party. No-one up there takes any notice of them. Look at the influence they had on the issue of preferences to the One Nation Party, for example. First of all, Senator O'Chee came into the Senate and said that the issue of National Party preferences going to the One Nation Party was of no significance whatsoever because no preferences have been distributed. The fact is that they were distributed in eight seats and eight seats elected One Nation candidates. The amazing thing about two of those eight seats, the actual sitting members who were defeated, is that the incumbent party was the National Party. That is how wrong Senator O'Chee was on this issue.</para><para>Senator Boswell then said that, as far as he is concerned, `We don't have to worry about the issue of One Nation preferences,' because he was going to argue very strongly that One Nation be put last on National Party how-to-vote cards. The trouble is that no-one in the National Party machine in Queensland takes any notice of him. No-one believes him. No-one is going to take any notice of Senator Boswell at all, because Senator Boswell and the National Party in the Senate have no clout in that political organisationâand they know it. The National Party organisational wing wants Senator Boswell and his team to stand up on this issue. They won't do so. The 
 National Party, of course, are now completely discredited. They have sold out to the Liberal Party.</para><para>I think the classic example of this is Senator Sandy Macdonald. Senator Sandy Macdonald from New South Wales is someone who has virtually made no public comment in the whole of his political career. Can anyone recall, before the last week, Senator Sandy Macdonald actually saying anything about any political issue at any time? He hasn't. He came out of the bunker, he came out from the rock under which he was hiding about a week or so ago, and said, `I am going to ensure that we get a price for the full privatisation of Telstra. I will not cross the floor and I will certainly support anything that John Howard wants me to do, but I am really concerned about this issue.'</para><para>Where is Senator Sandy Macdonald today? He is not even here; he is not even in the parliament while this issue of very great significance to the National Party is being debated. He can't even be bothered to front up and represent the rural constituency that he claims he has some empathy with.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>UI4</name.id><name role="metadata">RAY</name><name role="display">Senator Robert Ray</name></talker><para>âWhere's he gone?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name></talker><para>âSenator Ray asked me where he has gone.

I am sure `Black Jack' McEwen would be rolling in his grave.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I did notice in the newspaper this morning, and some of my colleagues in Victoria would know this well, that one of Mr McEwen's close relationsâhis nephew, in factâis running for the seat of McEwen in Victoria that was named after Mr McEwen. He is running for the seat of McEwen, but is he running for the National Party? Oh, no. He is not running for the National Party. He is running for the only political party in Australia that will protect the interests of the bush and that will protect rural and regional Australia. He is running for Labor. It is great to see even Mr McEwen's own family have got the message in this regard.</para><para>We are entitled in this debate, for those who have come to arrangements with the government, to have them put before the chamber. The real point I want to make, why I do not believe the committee should have leave to sit again at a later hour this day, is that Mr Howard, before the previous election, made an ironclad commitment that the full privatisation of Telstra would not occur in the life of the Howard government during its first parliament. Mr Howard said that this would not occur. He gave a commitment to the Australian people that he would not progress the full privatisation of Telstra.</para><para>What we are debating is another Howard breach of promiseâanother non-core commitment. But this non-core commitment is very much more significant than many of the other broken promises that we have seen in the litany that has taken place since the election in 1996. It is an important principle. To keep the Senate here and to propose that the Senate debate a piece of legislation that Mr Howard said he would not consider bringing before the parliament is simply an outrage. It is an absolute outrage.</para><para>The Labor Party is being asked to cooperate with Mr Howard breaking his word to the Australian people. We won't do it. Why should we cooperate with Mr Howard in perpetrating this untruth on the Australian people? There is no suggestion that this matter would have any urgency. Even Mr Howard himself is not proposing to have the legislation proclaimed until after the next election, if he is to win it. As far as the Labor 
 Party is concerned, if the committee does get leave to sit at a later hour this dayâif that occurs, opposition senators will certainly give leave to those senators from both sides of the chambers who would want to see prayers read by you, or whoever is presidingâleave will certainly be granted for that to occur. Let me make that clear to all honourable senators in the chamber. But we do not believe that this farce should continue.</para><para>We believe that Mr Howard should honour his commitment to the Australian people, made in the last election, to privatise only one-third of Telstra. We did not support that and we argued against it. The only reason that partial privatisation of Telstra actually occurred is the tainted vote of Senator Colston. That is the only reason the bill went through the parliament. Of course, the same operation is on again. We know the fix has gone in up there in Brisbane over the past 24 hours. We do believe that there should be an opportunity for this to occur. I have to say that, as far as the Labor Party is concerned, we are going to argue this issue out while ever the parliament sits. While ever the parliament sits, the Labor Party will not let Australians down, but we do not believe that the government and Mr Howard should be able to perpetrate this outrageous breach of commitment, the outrageous falsehood of Mr Howard's election commitments in the last campaign. I urge all senators not to grant leave for the committee to meet at a later hour this day. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>5594</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Environment</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe Leader of the Opposition (Senator Faulkner) has exercised, in my opinion, very bad judgment this morning.

Yet Senator Faulkner has taken the opportunity to abuse that request of Senator Boswell and, rather, to engage in a 20-minute speech of abuse against members of the National Party.

I think there should be a full, honest and incisive debate on this matter because it is very important to the whole country and I, for one, cannot see how it can be adequately debated and completed in the hours that are left today. This issue is going to affect every Australian and the government has failed to give a guarantee to rural consumers that they are going to get local call rates to their local town and their local business centre.

We saw that happen three times the night before last, but I for one do not want to go into a debate which is going to be truncated at the end of the day for political purposes. I want to know that this debate will be able to run its full and proper course. I was amazed to see Senator Harradine gag debate three times in this Senate just over 24 hours ago to prevent senators from expressing themselves.</para><para>I want to know from Senator Harradine, in particular, because in the past I have thought that his application of goodwill to the Senate was above that of the Liberal and National parties, that he is not going to stoop to the 
 lowest form of contribution to debate in this place, and that is to prevent debate.</para><para>Before we have this vote, we should have a fair dinkum indication from the government that the debate will proceed untrammelled and that it is not just here to smooth the way for the Prime Minister, John Howard, to call an election some time next month against the interests of the Australian people, with a year yet to run in the proper course of events before we have an election and, of course, complicit with the Independents, because without the Independents such a thing cannot happen.</para><para>I notice that in a full page advertisement by Telstra in today's newspapers Tasmania has been left off the map yet again. I would like to know that it is not going to be left off the map, as far as this debate is concerned, because we do know that since Senator Harradine struck his bargain with the government in the selling of the first tranche of Telstra over 100 jobs have been lost out of Telstra in Tasmania. I do not want that trend to continue and I would like to know that we are going to get a better deal next time around. Of course, neither Senator Harradine nor the government has been open about just what is in the package for the people of Tasmania, let alone the people of the north island.</para><para>So there we have it.

All those things continually come up. Please get us into the 21st century, or the 20th century. We are being driven by steam out there. Our faxes will not work and we cannot hit the Internet when we want to. Please, if you want us to be competitive, if you want us to drive forward, if you want us to be the exporters that carry the rest of this nation on our back, then give us the tools to do it with.

Why are they so afraid of this debate? Why do they want to limit debate on this issue of the full privatisation of Telstra, something they claim is so important? I think the truth of the matter is this: because the coalition government is embarrassed by the fact that this is a debate about a broken promise of Mr Howard. This bill should never have been before the parliament if Mr Howard had kept his word. This is the privatisation of Telstra that Mr Howard gave a solemn commitment in 1996 would not happen. This is the big lie. This makes Telstra just another non-core commitment of the Liberal government.</para><para>Of course it is even more embarrassing for the government because it has caused enormous tensions between the coalition partners. We have got the National Party in open revolt with the Liberal Party and we have got the National Party in open internal revolt. We 
 have got the Senate Nationals under incredible pressure from their own organisation, particularly in Queensland, and they have not got the bottle to stand up on this issue and be counted on behalf of rural and regional Australia.</para><para>The National Party in the Senate have sold their rural constituency out. This is the final nail in the coffin of the old National Party, the old Country Partyâthe Country Party that used to have the herbs to stand up to the Liberals in a coalition government. That is the old Country Party, the old National Party of Jack McEwen, of Doug Anthony and Ian Sinclair. It has gone forever. The new National Party are the National Party of Charles Blunt, Tim Fischer and Senator Boswell. The new National Party are the running dogs of the Liberal Party. The new National Party are the National Party that are in coalition government to just roll over and have their tummies tickled by the Liberals. That is what this debate is about.</para><para>What has become clear is that the only way the Australian community, particularly those people who live in the bush, particularly those people from rural and regional Australia, can have Telstra protected with majority public ownership is for those people, all Australians, to vote Labor at the next election.</para><para>The National Party is signing its own death warrant with this particular bill. In some ways, we do not mind that. We have got a lot of differences with the National Party. We do not particularly want to see the National Party replaced on the political stage obviously by the One Nation Party. What the National Party is trying to do is prove that it has been able to extricate out of the government about $400 million worth of bribes here, another $150 million of bribes there and one or two other things that Senator Harradine and Senator Colston have not admitted to the Senate or the Australian people. We want to know about it. We want to know about what deals are being done with Mr Howard behind closed doors.</para><para>We say this: if this vote goes through, if you gag debate, if you guillotine this debate, if you get this through contrary to John Howard's commitments at the last election, it 
 will be done on the basis of the tainted vote of Senator Colstonâa vote bought by Mr Howard and he just cashed in some of the investment yesterday in Brisbane. This is an outrage. The only way the Australian people can stand up on this issue, can have their rights protected, and the bush can be protected is to vote Labor at the next election after this extraordinary sell-out by the Nationals and Mr Howard.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>5602</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âOnce a time management motion is in place, only government amendments can be dealt with.

This is an infamous day for their own supporters. A handful of National Party senators have sold out their regional supporters, who have stuck with them through thick and thin since the 1920s. For 70 years they have supported this National Party and, before that, the Country Party to deliver certain benefits to the bush. The old Country Party made no bones about it. They were not sophisticated. They said, `Just give 
 us bagfuls of money to help our people in the bush.' The National Party today, led by Tim Fischer and by Senator Boswell in this place, have sold out to the Liberal Party and have just become a mere shadow faction of the Liberal Party. They have sold the bush out, aided and abetted, it appears, by two independent senators. I will come back to them in a moment.</para></talk.start><para>The National Party, including the Deputy Prime Minister, have supposedly been saying that the announcement last week of the new mobile telephone system for the bush is an enormous benefit for their own people. This will enable them to get coverage equal to what they have with their existing analogue. There was two-minute Tim Fischer in the press conference holding up the new telephone, having pulled in the minister for communications to smile and look like a puppy dog and hold it with him. He told the minister for communications to hold up the diagram to show the new coverage. This was a big announcement and a big achievement for the bush. Yesterday, the National Party senators got up in here and explained this was a victory for them and that this new mobile telephone coverage was wonderful.

When the year 2000 came around, everyone would have a transmitter and would at least be able to buy the phone. But they will not have all the transmitters in the bush, according to Mr Blount.

Only a Liberal senator would interject and say, `We don't have to tell the public of Australia what is in the deal and why $40 billion of Australia's biggest, most profitable, most successful and most important company has to be sold on a secret deal. We will not tell the people of Australia what it is 
 while the legislation is going through to do it.' It is typical of the sleaze of the Liberal Party. I am just astonished that the National Party has fallen for it.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Senator Boswell said in his speech earlier in this debate, `We do know what the deals is but that we are not telling you.' Senator Harradine says that he knows what it is but that he is not telling us. Senator Harradine indicated that he had a fair idea what it is. They all know. They will vote in secret. They know what the secret deal is on this legislation, but the people of Australia will not. If it goes on the track record so far, if the rest of the secret, sleazy deal is anything like what the National Party has so far negotiated, they will have been done like a dinner by the Liberal Party. All they have so far is $150 million spread over four or five years for the upgrade. For that they are going to sell a $40 billion company.</para><para>I point out to Senator Boswell that each year in the bush, irrespective of the $150 million, Telstra spends over $800 million on capital works. The money he is talking about is a mere pittance. Last night the minister had to back down from his outrageous claim on the cost of making 64 kilobits capacity available to all Australians. Two weeks ago he said that it would cost $26 billion. Last night, he crept away from that. We were not asking that it be made compulsory, that you had to all be connected, but that you had to have the capacity if you wanted it. That is what we in the Labor Party have argued for 18 months. However, last night, in about four minutes, he dropped from $26 billion to $15 billion. I have never seen $10 billion go so quick in all my time in parliament.</para><para>But what has Senator Boswell negotiated? Knowing what this minister is doing to him, he has nothing. Whatever he has will be minuscule compared to the long-term needs. Even if he gets something for online services in terms of kilobit capacity for the next year or so, as his colleague De-Anne Kelly, the member for Dawson, said, what happens in five years time when new technology comes in? There is nothing left of Telstra to sell. You cannot sell it again to get a social bonus to upgrade the bush further. We know that 64 
 kilobits will be needed and we absolutely support it as a minimum in the next couple of years. But by the middle of the next decade people will be arguing that they want that capacity increased to three or four megabits to get real-time online services. What will you sell of Telstra to get that to the bush? You will not have anything left. Where will you get the money from? The cities will get it; the rich suburbs and the CBDs will get it. They will get five megabits, but the bush will still be stuck with only 64 kilobits. When they ask where they will get it from, there will be nothing left to sell. Telstra has already gone. They will not want to raise taxes. People in the bush will have to pay an outrageous fee to get that further upgrade or they will not get it at all.</para><para>For a momentary gain here, they are selling $40 billion worth of Australia's best company, providing 100 per cent of telecommunications services to the bush, to get a few baubles onto the deck now. This is an outrageous performance by the National Party. It is their demise. This is the day they die.

You do not want that discussed in this country. It is very fortunate for the Liberal Partyâbut not so fortunate for the National Partyâthat this issue will be debated throughout the length and breadth of this country. It will be debated because Australians feel very strongly about this issue. A majority of Australians have demonstrated in public opinion polls time and time again that they are strongly opposed to the sale of Telstra. They have made it very clear. The reasons are very straightforward. This is a fundamentally strategic part of the Australian economy. I would go much further and say that Telstra has a vital part to play in the Australian way of life.</para></talk.start></continue><para>This debate goes to the very simple question of the way in which Australians communicate with one another. This government does not want to hear about that; it does not want to hear about the cost of its measures. It certainly does not want to hear about the way in which the National Party has undermined itself and destroyed its political credibility. For a very, very cheap price, the National Party has given away generations of supporters, the people who have defended the party for as long as Telstra has been being built. Those two organisations have been around for about the same length of time. It is an extraordinary coincidence, I suppose, when you look at the way in which generation after generation of Australians have invested in this entity to build this nation, and what we have got from the National Party is a miserable, sleazy arrangement to undermine that commitment of generations of Australians.</para><para>The National Party's actions are predicated on a great fear that time is catching up with them.

He says in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> this morning:</para><para>I think it will cost them very dearly in the next election.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">SHERRY</name><name role="display">Senator Sherry</name></talker><para>âDid he say he was going to cross the floor?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>AW5</name.id><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator CARR</name></talker><para>âWe will wait and see what he actually does, just as we will wait and see whether or not there is anyone in the cocky's corner here who actually has any

She said:</para><para>It is going to be very hard for the Telstra board to justify spending billions in infrastructure in rural and regional areas where it is not going to pay for itself.</para><para>Quite clearly, there is deep concern. I am sure by the time you get home on Monday, Senator Boswell, you will know about it because your organisation will be on to you. The National Party is strange in some ways. It has this relationship with an extra parliamentary organisation, a bit like the Labor Party. I know that things are done in a parliamentary party, because the parliamentary parties know better, of courseâthere is a tendency, unfortunately, for people to accept things as being simple when they are not quite so simpleâbut, when you get home, you actually find that the extra parliamentary party has a few things to say to you. I suspect, Senator Boswell, that quite a few things are going to be said to you.</para><para>Quite frankly, the proposals that you are advancing are a complete con job. You are being completely sucked in. People are going to want to know whether or not you have been persuaded out of complete panic, or whether or not you have actually understood what you have committed yourself to.</para><para>Senator Ray explained the other day his experience as a younger man how positions would be taken by friends who came down from the country who were offered chocolates when, in fact, they were presented with laxatives. That analogy is similar to what is happening here. Senator Alston has offered what you think are chocolates. You will soon discover that they are in fact laxatives. When you go home, people are going to point out to you that they have had enough of taking the laxatives and they are going to take it out on you.</para><para>With regard to the business community of this country, we have already seen very deep reservations being expressed about the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and concerns being 
 expressed for the need for change within the Liberal Party. I hope you are not laid down as the traction in the battle between Costello and Howard. The business community, as demonstrated in the <inline font-style="italic">Business Review Weekly</inline> poll this week, have indicated that already very deep reservations have been expressed there on one central issueâthat is, the failure of this government to deal with the issues that have been raised by One Nation, the threat of One Nation.</para><para>The poll of 150 top executives demonstrates that the preferred Prime Minister perhaps will not be Mr Howard for much longer. I hope you made sure you had a few side bets on the deals that you have entered into now because the whole operation of the Liberal Party is about to change. That poll demonstrates that 83 per cent of those 150 top executives are totally dissatisfied with this government, the way in which it has failed to respond to the threat from the fascists within One Nation.</para><para>You, Senator Boswell, are going to be used for traction in that fight. I say quite sincerely that it will be deeply disappointing to see your party replaced by extremist elements within rural Australia. You have not demonstrated the power of the National Party in this coalition but its impotence. You have actually given aid and comfort to One Nation by accepting what is a lousy proposition which will sell out rural interest in this country and will undermine the capacity of Australians to have high quality technology. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>5612</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI intend to comment about twoâ</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>YE4</name.id><name role="metadata">BOSWELL</name><name role="display">Senator Boswell</name></talker><para>âMadam Chairman, on a point of orderâ</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN (Senator Jacinta Collins)</name></talker><para>âYou were slow in getting to your feet.

I do want to raise a couple of issues with Senator Harradine quite specifically. We have seen yet another example of the failure of the National PartyâSenator Boswell too slow to get to his feet. That is the story of the National Party right throughout the sale of Telstra and on most other issues. Senator Calvert and Senator Alston are muttering under their breaths, expressing their contempt at how bad the National Party is, how poorly they perform.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>LD4</name.id><name role="metadata">ALSTON</name><name role="display">Senator Alston</name></talker><para>âI said that Bozzie is very quick on his feet.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name></talker><para>âOn this occasion he was too slow, wasn't he, Senator Alston? As I say, it typifies the approach of the National Party when it comes to representing rural and regional Australia. I will go to a couple of issues relating to the National Party. I am sure Senator Boswell will endeavour to respond and find excuses for their poor performance on this and other related issues over recent years.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I wanted to take up a couple of matters with Senator Harradine quite directly. I did listen to Senator Harradine's contribution yesterday about the economic gains, the bottom line improvement to the budget of government debt, that may or may not result from the sale of Telstra. He did not express a view. I think he did indicate that he had received conflicting advice about this matter.</para><para>I did spend some time in my contribution in the debate on the second reading on issues relating to the proceeds from the further two- 
 thirds sale of Telstraâ$40 billion to $45 billion, around that figureâand the bottom line gain by the reduction of government debt, assuming an average of six per cent interest charges, vis-a-vis the loss of the payment of the dividend from the Telstra shares that the government owns, which at the moment is two-thirds. There is also the issue of the dividend increasing in future years and then at some point in time the loss to the government of the dividend, because even though debt is initially reduced there will be the loss of the dividends that increase in future through government owning two-thirds of Telstra. In the first five or six years the government will make a gain because of the reduction of debt, but in five or six years or maybe longer, even seven yearsâit seems from all the economic advice that I and the Labor Party have seen that it could be a maximum number of 10 yearsâthe government will start losing money because of the loss of the dividend stream.</para><para>I would like Senator Harradine to indicate what his view is of that issue, which I think is very important. We have spent a lot of time rightly talking about the effects in rural and regional Australia of the loss of government ownership of Telstra, the importance of government direction to Telstra as at least a two-thirds publicly owned corporation and the government's ability to ensure a fair distribution of investment and that pricing policies in rural and regional Australia do not disadvantage people who live in those regions. We have spent a lot of time on that, quite rightly.</para><para>The issue that we are debating is the two-thirds sale of Telstra. That is another breach of the Prime Minister's commitment to the Australian people. He said that he would not be selling Telstra prior to the next election and that if they were re-elected then he would make an announcement and present legislation. Unfortunately, we are dealing with the sale of two-thirds of Telstra here today in the Senate and expected to pass this legislation prior to the next election. Senator Harradine is supporting that. He has indicated that.</para><para>I would like Senator Harradine to indicate, not just to the Senate but via the record to the Tasmanian people whom he representsâand 
 we should note that if we have a half Senate election, and we are assuming that we will, Senator Harradine will be up for election whenever that may beâwhat his position is. When that election occurs, will Senator Harradine be supporting the sale of Telstra, the two-thirds remaining government ownership of Telstra? What will he indicate to the people of Tasmania about his position? How are they expected to vote? What is his position? Does he agree with the sale of Telstra, the remaining two-thirds, or does he not agree with that? Quite rightly, people in Tasmania will want to know what Senator Harradine's position is. He cannot have it both ways.</para><para>Telstra is a major issue of public debate at the moment. The supporters of Senator Harradine in Tasmania will want to know whether to vote for him or not if they are concerned about this issue, as at least some of them will be. I would like Senator Harradine to tell us what position he will take in the forthcoming election. That is a very important issue that I would like Senator Harradine to address.</para><para>Senator Harradine has foreshadowed an amendment that if the legislation is not proclaimed within two months of the election then this legislation will be wiped from the books. I understand that Labor is going to support that amendment. But our position was made very clear by our shadow minister, Senator Schacht, yesterday. Senator Harradine, whether your amendment is passed or not, Labor, if it is elected, will immediately move to reverse this legislation if it is regrettably passed.</para><para>I would like to make a few comments about the National Party. Over the last week we have had some National Party members in the House of Representatives and a number of their senators, mainly via doorstops on their entrance to the Senate and I assume endorsed leaks from their leader, Mr Fischer, protesting about the sale of Telstra in a variety of forms. Mr Paul Neville said in the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline>:</para><para>The government should sell only a further 16 per cent of Telstra and leave the telecommunications giant 51 per cent in government hands.</para><para>We will be interested to see how Mr Neville votes on this matter when it goes back to the 
 House of Representatives. In a similar theme, my attention was drawn to the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline>  of Friday, 3 July, in which Senator Sandy Macdonald warned that his crucial Senate vote would support the sale of only a further 16 per cent of Telstra, leaving the company 51 per cent government owned. What is in this bill? Senator Boswell is looking a little bit bemusedâand rightly he should be. I am sure Senator Sandy Macdonald is a little bit bemused. This bill does not say, `16 per cent of Telstra being sold'; it says, `Sell the whole lot off. Sell the two-thirds off.'</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>6H4</name.id><name role="metadata">HARRADINE</name><name role="display">Senator Harradine</name></talker><para>âIt does not.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name></talker><para>âThat is the effect of it, Sen Harradine. Don't get too excited. I would like you to address the critical issues that I raised earlier in this debate. I have listened to your contribution to the debate. I hold some considerable respect for your negotiating skills. I would like a response to the questions that I raised with you earlier in my contribution.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Senator Sandy Macdonald is not the only one. I was a little disappointed that my leader, Senator Faulknerâthough he did refer to a number of contributions to the issue of the sale of Telstraâdid not go into a lot of the background of Senator McGauran. Senator McGauran has been extensively criticised for his performance by the Premier of Victoria. Mr Kennett has been very vigorous in his criticism of his colleague in the current coalition. Senator Boswell would recall the very vigorous criticisms of Senator McGauran by the Premier of Victoria about his supposedâI think it is probably trueâlack of performance.</para><para>Senator McGauran made some headlines about two or three years ago. He had taken a trip to the Cocos (Keeling) Islands or to Christmas Island and he discovered a thong on the beach. He came back to Australia and complained bitterly about pollution of the environment because he had discovered a thong that had floated up on the beach. The environment is a legitimate concern, but that sent the Premier of Victoria, Mr Kennett, into a rage. He said that if the discovery of a thong on the beach was the only contribution that Senator McGauran could make to public 
 debate in Australia, then his preselection should be removed.</para><para>But the National Party decided, in its wisdom, that Senator McGauran should be sent to Tasmania. Why was Senator McGauran sent down to Tasmania? The National Party do not exist in Tasmania. They made an attempt about 20-25 years ago. Weâand this is one area where I am sure Senator Calvert would agree with meâare happy the National Party does not exist in Tasmania. They sent Senator McGauran down there as the Tasmanian liaison officer to re-form the National Party and to advise them in the state election in early 1983. It was a magnificent triumph! Senator McGauran was down in Tasmania rebuilding the Nationals, and I do not think they got more than 300 or 400 votes in any seat. They might have got a few more votes, but they got less than one or two per cent of the vote. Senator McGauran was sent down to Tasmania to re-form the National Party for the state election. It was an dismal failure. What has happened to the National Party in Tasmania? It is not surprising. I do not know whether Senator Boswell has been talking to Senator McGauran, but what was left of the old National Partyâ</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5F4</name.id><name role="metadata">CALVERT</name><name role="display">Senator Calvert</name></talker><para>âDo you mean Chester?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name></talker><para>âIn fact, I was going to get onto Chester Summerville, Senator Calvert. Chester Summerville, the former head of the National Party in Tasmania, has joined One Nation. That is a sign of the times. I have to admit to some slight embarrassment. One or two former members of the National Party, who were signed up by Senator McGauran, have actually joined the Labor Party.

We have had Senator Sandy Macdonald saying, `We will not allow more than 16 per cent of Telstra to be sold.' We will be interested to see his vote. We have had Senator McGauran making a lot of noise about it. My colleague Shayne Murphy has referred to a very interesting article in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> âtime does not allow me to go through itâwritten by Finola Burke.

But it will not work. People out in rural and regional Australiaâeverywhere for that matterâare not silly. They know that the National Party no longer represents rural and regional Australia.

Senator Carr has raised some very relevant points. Yes, we do have a challenge; we certainly do have a challenge in the bush. We can walk away from that challenge and say that we will not take our people forward; we will not give them the communications that they need; we will not listen to the NFF, the people of isolated children and the country women who have all made representations to a Senate inquiry about their need for communication technology which they want.</para></talk.start></continue><para>And yes, we can get spooked, if we allow ourselves to, with the One Nation invasion coming over us. But that would be the very wrong thing to doâto react against what is not right, what is not in the best interests of the NFF, who represent the farmers through their commodity groups like the sugar group, the united graziers, the wool people, the grain growers. They all meet and they know what they want; they have a communications committee that has put their shopping list to us.</para><para>So, too, did the parents of isolated children. About three weeks ago they came down here and said to the National Party, `Please allow us to educate our kids through this technology that is availableâbut not to us; we cannot get it.'

But that is not the way to do it. You could try to outflank the One Nation Party by driving out past it further to the right and leading people back into the 1950s. Yes, it has some electoral appeal; it is what you call `populist politics'. You can do that. It is not hard to do what Pauline Hanson does. Anyone opposite can do it, and anyone on this side can do itâgo out, listen to what people tell you, repeat it back to them, and your vote will go up. But it is not leading in the right direction.</para><para>This is something that I will continually repeat: the people who represent the bush through the commodity organisationsâthe United Graziers Association, the Cane Growers Association, the Cattlemen's Unionâknow what they need out there. So they come down here and make representations to us, and they then expect us to perform. That is what we are doing; we are performing.

It was a vain hope, but I thought we might at least try to do that. However, I cannot let some of Senator Boswell's comments go unanswered. I begin by agreeing with him that there were lots of people that came before not only this committee hearing but also the committee that I chaired on the first sale. On the first occasion many people from the bush pleaded with us to listen to them about their appalling communications. I do not think anyone in this chamber will argue with that. It should have been done many years ago. We sat through all of that and then had to deliberate on whether or not selling this huge organisation was the way to fix the problems. I think at best, looking at all we can look at, which are the results of the sale of the first third, we can say that it has not delivered.</para></talk.start><para>The people that came before the committee that I chaired explained everythingâfrom their lack of access full stop to the breakdown problems and all the difficulties they had. They then listened to all the promises that the government made about how wonderful things would be. The government promised that things would get better once Telstra was privatised. In a moment I will go through some of the figures that I mentioned in my speech during the second reading debate. It 
 does not matter what measurement you takeâwhether you take the length of time to fix a fault, the length of time to get a phone connected in rural Australiaâwe have gone steadily and rapidly backwards in the last couple of years.</para><para>How this government believes that selling the rest is going to make things suddenly enormously better I do not know. One of the amendments I will deal with in a moment looks at preventing the sale until such time as we get the service levels back up to where they were three years agoâin other words, putting the sale on hold until such time as there is at least a basic service for the existing quality in the bush, and then reconsidering whether or not we do want to sell the rest.</para><para>The package, which we do not know anything aboutâpresumably it has at least a billion dollars in it, by the sound of itâmay, for some people in rural areas, finally get them a service that is at least reliable. Maybe some people will have better Internet access. Senator Boswell was right, again, when he talked about bringing some people in the bush up to dateâin other words, 1998-99.</para><para>When this pork-barrelling exercise is over, the money has run out, Telstra has been sold and we are in 2004 or 2005, who knows what is over the horizon? By the look of itâwe are on the verge of a whole raft of new technologyâthe private company is going to make exactly the same decision as it has in the last couple of years: `Sorry, it's too expensive.'</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>LD4</name.id><name role="metadata">ALSTON</name><name role="display">Senator Alston</name></talker><para>âThat is why you have customer service guarantees.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>8U4</name.id><name role="metadata">Lees, Sen Meg</name><name role="display">Senator LEES</name></talker><para>âAnd that service guarantee is not worth the paper that it is written on, Minister.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>LD4</name.id><name role="metadata">ALSTON</name><name role="display">Senator Alston</name></talker><para>âThat is why you have fines, if necessary.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>8U4</name.id><name role="metadata">Lees, Sen Meg</name><name role="display">Senator LEES</name></talker><para>âThis is why we have fines!

 to trigger the bigger fines. The company is going to say, `We can pay that.' Of course, we have to remember that individuals actually have to know where to get the forms they need to actually go and complain and then maybe be eligible for some of the payments. So I think that Senator Boswell is very misguided to believe that this really is in the long-term benefit of the people his party claims to represent.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Let us try to get back to the preamble and start looking through some of the amendments that we have, as we are able to do at this time. By the sound of it, the preamble is going to disappear. I am very pleased to note that not just Senator Harradine but also the government seems to now agree that it is basically a political statement, that it has got some real minefields in it and that we simply cannot make some of these outrageous claims about what the benefits of a full privatisation are.</para><para>I would like to move on and start looking at what we are trying to do in some of the rest of our amendments. We have, after all, only six hours left and some 50-odd amendments to deal with. I would like to look at the second Democrat amendment, which I understand will be the next one put because a couple of Senator Bourne's amendments, which she will explain shortly, are either lapsing or being moved further down the list. Our second amendment seeks to amend the most undemocratic and, indeed, constitutionally suspect aspect of this bill. This amendment seeks to modify the proclamation date for the legislation so that it falls after the new parliament takes effect, which is 1 July 1999. Remember, as we go to this next election, presuming it is a half-Senate electionâif we have got rid of the double dissolution possibilitiesâthe new Senate does not take its place until then.</para><para>This amendment assures that we actually test the mandate. In other words, we do not just look to the House of Representatives but we test the mandate in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. We believe that this is essential, because we really do not know how the next parliament will be constituted. If the Howard government is re-elected, 
 the polls tell us very clearly that it will not have a majority in this House.</para><para>We have to ask the government why the value of the Senate vote is discounted by simply putting the proclamation only in the House of Representatives. What happens if, as the polls suggest, the House of Representatives produces a party that does not actually have a majority? Who knows? We could see, hopefully, a couple of Democrats down there. We would, I would think, have Mr Andren back and maybe Mr Paul Zammit as well. We see in the South Australian parliament now a number of Independents in the lower house. We believe that it is simply not good enough to just push it through the House of Representatives. If we are to keep Mr Howard to his promise that Telstra will be sold only if the people approve it, then it must be tested in both houses.</para><para>We have had some undertakings from the Labor Party. Perhaps Senator Schacht would like to develop these further in terms of the promises from the Labor Party. They have talked about actually getting rid of this bill. We are seeking to hear, too, further commitments that the Labor Party will not move at any time while they are in government, if that is what the situation is after the election, to put this issue back before us. Also, by testing this issue in both houses of parliament after the election, it gives the oppositionâwhoever that isâan opportunity to make their points of view as well.</para><para>The Clerk Assistant (Procedure) has advised the Democrats that this clause actually breaches the separation of powers enshrined in the constitution. Section 51 makes it clear that this parliament is supposed to make the laws, yet this bill basically leaves the final decision to the Executive Council, to the cabinet, and it therefore breaches the constitution. It is dubious on political grounds, but it is also dubious on constitutional grounds.</para><para>My amendment is similar to the one which was accepted by all parties in the digital television bill last week; this is nothing new. It says that the proclamation date must be approved by the resolution of both houses. This will test the mandate properly. The National Party, hopefully, will have had the 
 opportunity to go back to their electorate and have further input from rural people, not just about the sorts of services they want but how they believe they can be delivered. Therefore, as we get further on in this debate, I will be moving, effectively, that we take the date out to 1 July 1999, which is when the new Senate is constituted, and then we make sure that this proposition is put before both houses. Hopefully we will not let the government do what this one is unceremoniously trying to doâthat is, to stomp on the rights of the Senate.</para><para>I want to touch on a couple of other Democrat amendments which, when we get to those sections of the bill, will speed up the process. The Democrats' third amendment simply opposes the entire clause that lets the Commonwealth sell the rest of Telstra. We will oppose it absolutely. I remind the government here that the long-term picture is not the one that they paint. If you look at the forecast of where Telstra is goingâand, yes, you do all your sums and you take off the debt repaymentsâif you put all the figures on the table, you will see that we will have a $4 billion black hole in the public purse six years out from now.</para><para>The next time I seek the call I will read some of the full budget impacts of the Telstra sale because the government conveniently leaves out things such as franking credits. It likes to put on the table only the sets of figures that it wants to talk about. I would also like to look at the enormous pressure that is going to be put on the regulators because of the profitability of Telstra. This is going to be Australia's largest company if this bill goes through, if this government comes back and if it is then proclaimed. It is going to be twice the size of BHP; it is going to be the size of BHP and the National Australia Bank all rolled into one. If this government thinks that it can do better than Jeff Kennett, who has not been able to resist the Crown Casino pressures and keep the regulations strong, I think everybody will be amazed. We have only to look at international examples to know the pressure that companies can bring on.</para><para>My colleague Senator Murray will be moving an amendment later on that will stop 
 Telstra, as a privatised entity, accepting any encouragement to make political donations. One of the worst scenarios that we could see is a very large company that spends a few hundred thousand dollars here, a few hundred dollars there, $10,000 here or there, and so, perhaps for $400,000 or $500,000, keeps political parties happy in a financial sense, and then expects whoever gets into government not to press regulation, because these regulationsâthese customer service guaranteesâwill need to be changed over time, as they would if it remained in public hands.</para><para>If it is in private hands, the pressure will be to leave it, `Do not make a fuss. Let us interpret it in the narrowest way we possibly can to maximise our profits,' because the profits of this company, if it is privatised, will hinge on weak regulationâthe weaker the regulations, the less service they have to provide to the bush and the bigger the profits. It is a simple balance. It is a simple equation. We can throw into that mix the possibility of substantial donations which, I am sure, will be across the political board. They will be to all political parties to keep everybody onside and everybody happy. For political parties these days, struggling to afford the level of campaign that we will be going into, a $10,000 donation is substantial, and a $100,000 donation is more than a bit welcome.</para><para>Let us look again at the customer service guarantee in the bush. It will be pretty easy for new technologyâand who knows what it will be beyond the year 2000âto be introduced into the cities. The market is there and the profits are there. That is not the case as we move outâand not too far out. Indeed, East Gippsland, which is not exactly the back of beyond, has no mobile service now. There is very poor access, particularly if we get bad weather conditions out in East Gippsland. That is not an area that anyone is going to be particularly concerned about. A few thousand voters out there are just written off. Some of the southern areas of New South Wales along the coast are popular holiday destinations, but who really cares if the people who have retired down there do not have a service?</para><para>It should not just be people who consider themselves rural and remote who should be 
 worried about what is happening. It should also be people who live off the major routes, away from the key capital cities, who require an extra service and, in particular, faults to be fixed. Just one example: the transmitter for the ABC in Albury-Wodonga keeps breaking down. They used to have someone on site. In summer sometimes it was something as simple as putting a fan in front of the cooling systems and keeping them on line. The last time they broke down, it was not for a couple of seconds or minutes, it was for hours. They were referred to someone in Newcastle, and they tried to point out to the intermediary on the phone that Wodonga was not next door to Newcastle. So I believe centres as big as Albury will be looking around in the future for adequate services. We should not just consider that people out around Broken Hill or people north of Oodnadatta are the ones who are going to be hit by this.</para><para>Away from the capital cities, there will be extreme difficultiesâmaybe not within 12 months, Minister; maybe the big barrel that you are going to roll out will cushion them for three yearsâbut let us look to the future. Let us look to the new technology that is undoubtedly over the horizon, and then ask, `How on earth are we going to bother? How on earth are we ever going to get services out into anywhere other than our capital cities?'</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>5620</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN MACDONALD</name><name.id>YW4</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to support my Queensland colleague and friend Senator Boswell in the remarks he made in this particular debate.

We have spent seven hours on the preamble. In that circumstance, the points have been made again and again. My conclusion at the end of the debate so far is the following: the Australian Democrats, the Labor Party and the two Greens are vigorously opposed to the sale of Telstra, and the Liberal Party, the National Party and the two Independents support the sale of Telstra. The result is that we are going to lose Telstra and that we are going to lose the bill.</para></talk.start><para>There are 50 amendments on the running sheet. Only two of them are Labor's. If we are going to lose the bill, we should do our very best to improve it. I urge everyone who feels passionately about this, including us, to move on with the amendments so that we can do our best to make it a better company for Australians generally.</para><para>I wanted to make a contribution to this debate and take up an important comment from Senator Harradine during the debate on the preamble. Senator Harradine did confirm his comments at the time that Telstra was debated in 1996 pointing out that he was opposed at that point to the sale of all of Telstra because it was a natural monopoly. I understand Senator Harradine to now say that things have changed, and that Telstra is subject to intense competition and is no longer a natural monopoly.</para><para>I think it would be helpful if he expanded on this statement. While it is true that Telstra has competition in a number of areas, Telstra is still unquestionably the dominant player in the telecommunications market. According to the most recent report I have seen from the IBIS Business Information Bureau, Telstra still enjoys 82 per cent of the telecommunications market, Optus has only 13 per cent and AAPT just two per cent. That is hardly significant competition to Telstra at this time. In anticompetition law and practice worldwide, around 30 per cent is seen to indicate a dominant player.</para><para>Even those figures ignore Telstra's strength in key markets. On local calls and exchange line rentalsâ26 per cent of all telecommunications servicesâTelstra has a 100 per cent monopoly. On domestic long distance calls, Telstra has 73 per cent of the market while Optus has only 12.5 per cent. On international calls, Telstra has 66 per cent while Optus has 24 per cent. Telstra has 64 per cent of mobile services while Optus has 29 per cent. Telstra has 82 per cent of data services, 74 per cent of directory services, 80 per cent of customer premises equipment and 100 per cent of pay phones, but only 30 per cent of Internet service provision. That is a swag of market power which is extremely dangerous to put into private hands. I would be happy to provide a copy of that IBIS report to Senator Harradine and any other interested senator, if they wish.</para><para>This week we saw Telstra obtain another monopoly service with the CSDA mobile announcement. This new technology, new service and new market is a 100 per cent Telstra monopoly, with no scope for switching between carriers. In all, these figures show that Telstra, if not a monopoly player, is certainly close to an effective monopoly in many areas. In rural Australia it is a monopoly player. Most Australians, probably all Australians, know that unless monopolies are in public hands they are a danger. When you have excessive power in private hands, it will be abused.</para><para>Telstra still has an absolute monopoly over local calls. There has been a much heralded entry of Optus into this market, but it has not happened yet. Indeed, if Optus is forced to pay the prices demanded by Telstra for access to the network, it never will happen. That issue, of course, is currently before the ACCC, along with other inquiries into various aspects of its operations. There Telstra is fighting tooth and nail, giving some idea of just how hard a fully privatised Telstra will fight. That is natural; it will look after its self-interest, and its self-interest will be to remain as big and as dominant and as much in control as possible. It is only the government and the public sector restraints which can hold back that natural urge.</para><para>The Telstra Chief Executive Officer warned in May that, if too many changes were made in favour of consumers and new companies, Telstra may not be able to be floated. Telstra's public relations department has been fighting this and other ACCC inquiries hard. All this is the kind of natural aggression that such a big beast will display. In May, Telstra released a statement warning against further regulation of transmission capacity, arguing that it would be harmful, was unnecessary and would choke further investment. It is warning us yet again of the style that it will adopt, which will be far more vigorous, when it is fully privatised. Even in the most competitive area of telecommunications, Internet service provisionâthe only area where Telstra is not dominantâit is now on the way to becoming so, with a reciprocal data alliance announced in May with OzEmail. That is hardly a move towards more competition, and comes among continuing claims about Telstra's pricing policies for Internet service providers.</para><para>For the Democrats, the picture is coming through of an increasingly aggressive corporate entity which could become more of a bully than a partner in our lives. It will aggressively defend its dominant market share and be prepared to do whatever it takes to expand its market share. That is not competition in the true sense; it is the natural attitude of a monopoly. The only thing standing between Telstra and total market dominance, apart from the ACCCâand the ACCC is testing many of its powers for the first timeâis this parliament. We are about to give up that power. I wonder how effective the ACCC could be in controlling Telstra. Judging by the weakness of the British regulators in controlling British Telecom post-privatisation, I am not optimistic that Telstra's market dominance will not grow with privatisation rather than be reduced under competition.</para><para>I ask Senator Harradine, the National Party and the Liberal Party and Senator Colston to think carefully about these issues. Telecommunications is the fastest growing segment of the Australian economy. Telstra controls 82 per cent of it now and is very well placed to defend and even increase that share. It is to the credit of the Labor government previously 
 that it was under them that competition was introduced in the telecommunications arena. It is them we have to thank for at least the modicum of competition that exists at present. But now is not the time to give up Telstra from public ownership.</para><para>If Telstra is a natural monopoly, particularly in the local class area in the provision of the best basic network, it will take advantage of that position to maximise shareholder returns. Any private companyâand any public companyânaturally and correctly sees as its principal objective maximising profit and shareholder returns. The Democrats do not have the absolute confidence that the government and the two Independents seem to have that the ACCC and the ACA have sufficient regulatory means, rules and resources to take on Australia's biggest company and win. Telstra and its shareholders should note that, if it is to pass out of the hands of all Australians, this parliament should look carefully in the future at introducing an anti-trust regime and breaking it up.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>5626</page.no><name role="metadata">Murphy, Sen Shayne</name><name role="display">Senator MURPHY</name><name.id>FX5</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âWe are debating the preamble of the bill, and I want to refer to the part which says that the sale of the Commonwealth's remaining two-thirds equity interest in Telstra will benefit the Australian community. It is interesting that Senator Ian Macdonald, Liberal senator from Queensland, had to be dragooned into here to defend the National Party leader, Senator Boswell. What I want to know is: where are Senator Boswell's colleagues?  Where are Senator O'Chee, Senator Sandy Macdonald, Senator Brownhill and, of course, Senator McGauran?  Why aren't they in here arguing the case, to defend Senator Boswell for the deal they have done with this government?</para></talk.start><para>Senator Macdonald was saying that he was going to tour the outback of Australia. The last time he toured the outback was when he was a frontbencher, and he lost his frontbench position. So, if there is going to be another tour around the outback for Ian Macdonald, the outback had better be careful. Of course there is plenty of wide open space out there, but I am sure it will do them no good at all.</para><para> The deal that has been done and is being sung on such high moral acclaim by Tim Fischer, the Deputy Prime Minister, is this $150 million deal to deliver a better service. This is what it is really about: a benefit to the Australian community, that some 37,000 households in the remote areas of Australia will get a better service.</para><para>I was looking at the <inline font-style="italic">Herald Sun</inline> today and I think nothing more epitomises the view of the bush with regard to that deal than the cartoon on page 24 beside the editorial entitled `The bush telegraph'. It shows the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Fischer, with his little toy mobile phone, saying, `Tim Fischer calling . . . How clear is the success of this Telstra privatisation policy with rural voters?' You then see him, still with his little toy mobile phone, saying, `Hello?' and the phone is going, `Beep, beep, beep.' Obviously the people in the bush do not buy it. They never have bought it and they will not buy it in the future.</para><para>Senator Boswell said, `Look, we were not spooked, we were not walking away.' I have to say that if they were not spooked they have certainly let the horses bolt. I want to go back to when this bill first came into the House of Representatives. Did the Deputy Prime Minister raise anything at that time?  Did Mr Anderson or any of the other Nationals, including De-Anne Kelly, raise anything in the debate with regard to the full privatisation of Telstra in so far as achieving better outcomes for people in the bush? No; not one thing.</para><para>We come to the report that has been referred to by Senator Macdonald. Was Senator Boswell a member of the committee?  No. A participating member? Yes. Is there a minority report from the Nationals in the committee's report about the full privatisation of Telstra? No, not one word. There was not one word about what they were requiring, even though a lot of supposed National Party voters gave submissions to the committee. There was not one word. There was no minority report. There was absolutely nothing.</para><para>It just goes to show how these people have been conned by the trinketry and the tricks of the minister and the Prime Minister. This is 
 the real trap that the Nationals find themselves in: the only way that they are going to get to deliver to the bush is for the full privatisation of Telstra to proceed. And that is why the people will not buy it. So they have to go out there and urge the voters to vote for them to get the full privatisation up. What a stupid position to be in.</para><para>Why have they not done anything about it before? I go back to the preamble where it says `will benefit the Australian community'. Why wasn't this done before?  We have already had a one-third sale. What did the Nationals say then with regard to services in the bush?  They said it would bring better services. Why is it that it has taken a One Nation success in Queensland to force these people out of their holes in the ground to try to represent the people that they claim to represent? It took a One Nation electoral success, and the record proves that.</para><para>You can go through the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> in the House of Representatives. Indeed, you can go right back to November and December 1996 when we debated the first one-third Telstra privatisation bill. Did they say anything then? Were the services better then than they are now?  No. So why didn't the National Party senators seek these sorts of guarantees then? Of course, they did not even seek a guarantee from the government by way of amendment to this bill as to the deal for the expenditure of $150 million that they have now struck.</para><para>It took us to highlight the fact that there was no protection for their deal. There was no guarantee that their deal would benefit the community, be it in the outback or anywhere else. There was not a single line in the bill about that.

Is he going to try to extend the deal? What the Deputy Prime Minister has said is really a question of integrity as well. The Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts, Senator Alston, were big on announcements yesterday. They announced the expenditure of $176 million, but Telstra had already planned to spend that. That was already in their budget. It was already partly spent. How much of that is going to be spent in the bush? The report says $5 million to $6 million. I have to say that the Nationals are doing really well here! They cannot even negotiate. They cannot even get 10 per cent of the money spent in the bush, and they say they are performing. Senator Boswell said in here this morning that he was performing. Is that his best performance? I have seen some performances like that, and do you know where I go to see them? Punch and Judy, the puppets. Here we have the National Party puppets. That is what we have got. The minister and the Prime Minister are there with Senator Boswell and Tim Fischer. They have got them beating one another around the bush. That is all they have ever been doing.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The poor old National Party voters, particularly in Queensland, had no alternative. They have been deserted by those they elected to represent them in this parliament. Is this deal going to deliver anything to them? Not one little bit. All it does is provide for a few people in the back blocks, and that should have been done after the sale of one-third of Telstra. It should have been done for the people then, because we talked about delivering a community benefit at the same time. But there has been no community benefit.</para><para>Senator Ian Macdonald raised with me the issue of Tasmania. Tasmania was supposed to get $58 million, but this is very interesting because the money is very hard to track through the estimates process. As I said, what has essentially happened in Tasmania is that, prior to the one-third sale, 1,450 people worked for Telstra in Tasmania. We have got far fewer than that now and the number is going down. It would seem to me that the 
 only thing the money is being used for is to pay for the shipment of Telstra jobs across Bass Strait to Victoria. If that is what the money was intended for, so be it, but we should not mislead the Tasmanian people. I do not want the Tasmanian people misled again with regard to what is going to be the outcome of this piece of legislation.</para><para>It appears, for all intents and purposes, that Senator Harradine has said he will support this legislation. Senator Harradine is, in his words and the words of others, a man of principle. He is a man of principle on the basis that he says so himself. He has spoken on a number of occasions about mandates that governments have. If Senator Harradine is going to support this legislation, I think the Tasmanian people have a right to know what he will be doing when we go into the election. Will he be supporting the sale of Telstra or will he not? That is a very clear and unequivocal question.</para><para>Senator Harradine says that, if this bill is passed, it does not necessarily provide for the sale of Telstra. You could argue that it is an enabling piece of legislation, but if this legislation is passed before the next election and the coalition win that election with sufficient seats in the House of Representatives to form government but not the numbers in the Senateâbut they are highly unlikely to win government again, given the stuff-ups they have madeâthen this bill will still become law because the Prime Minister just has to ring up the Governor-General and say, `Proclaim the bill.' That is why we are debating this bill right now. That is the question that Senator Harradine has to answer and has to make clear to the Tasmanian people. I also want Senator Harradine to tell the Tasmanian public whether part of the deal he has done to make him support this bill relates to Liberal Party preferences.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Sitting suspended from 1.00 p.m. to 1.45 p.m.</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>5629</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI wanted to begin my remarks by referring to the comments of Senator Andrew Murray earlier in this committee stage of the debate. He expressed 
 concern that there were at least 50 amendments to be dealt with as part of this legislation. At least 41 of those are Democrat amendments, and we are very keen to turn our comments to debate some of those amendments. Once again, on behalf of the Democrats, I reiterate the lunacy of the time that has been allocated for this debate not only on this particularly important piece of legislation in relation to the privatisation of Telstra but also on the remaining legislationânamely, the copyright bills, which deserve more than two hours apiece in debate later this afternoon.</para></talk.start><para>The lunacy of this debate is that, even if we treat this legislation as enabling legislation or dealing with the so-called hypothetical scenario in relation to the sale of Telstra, we are actually not being given enough time to debate or to discuss what we would consider an appropriate regulatory framework for this legislation. So, even if the governmentâand it looks like the government has the numbers to pass this piece of legislationâhas the so-called will of the chamber, if not of the community, to support the sale of the remaining two-thirds of Telstra, we are not being given the opportunity to debate how we could improve or better the bill in some way, or certainly insist that there be an appropriate regulatory framework within the legislation to make sure that the needs of consumers and customers are dealt with.</para><para>That is a concern that Senator Andrew Murray raised earlier, and it is one that I reiterate, as will my colleagues throughout this debate as we try to get on record some of our amendments and the rationale behind them. I understand those amendments will be moved later on today by the government on our behalfâagain, with minimal debate, and I think that is very sad. It is a shameful debate and a shameful day.</para><para>First of all, I would like to draw attention to issues raised in the debate on the second reading by Senator Brian Harradine when he claimed that massive job losses in Telstra were caused by the former government, the Australian Labor Party, and Kim Beazley. I am not quite sure where those statistics or that particular argument came from, but I suspect 
 it came from the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts (Senator Alston). As Senator Harradine and perhaps others in this chamber know, we do not always rely on Senator Alston for accurate and factual statements.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Senator Schacht interjecting</inline>â</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3I6</name.id><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name></talker><para>âParticularly where the Labor Party's performance is concerned.</para></talk.start></continue><para><inline font-style="italic">Senator Kemp interjecting</inline>â</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3I6</name.id><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name></talker><para>âDo not worry, we have our own concerns with the former government's policies, but we would like to put some facts on the record for the purpose of this debate in relation to job losses and Telstra, in particular the privatisation of the remaining two-thirds of Telstra and what that means for employment or unemployment. So we want to place on record the history of telecommunications deregulation and Telstra's work force.</para></talk.start></continue><para>All of these figures come from the IBIS Business Information and the Telstra annual reports. We do note that the deregulation of telecommunications in this country was launched by Kim Beazley back in 1991, with the selling of Aussat to became the basis of Optus. From June 1990 to June 1994, we saw massive slashes taking place in the work force. Kim Beazley and the former government slashed the work force of Telstra by a quarter from 87,000 to 65,000âa loss of around 22,000 jobs. But then Telstra started to put workers back on again, rising to 76,500 workers in June 1996.</para><para>By then, it was becoming apparent that Telstra was heading for privatisation, that peopleâcertainly under this governmentâwere keen to see Telstra privatised, at least partially. Of course, that is when a lot of financial commentators started saying that staff and jobs had to be shed if it was going to be more competitive, so-called. There was a claim that, essentially, it was overstaffed and, therefore, bodies needed to go.</para><para>BZW Australia, for example, who produced the first analysis of what sort of a body count was needed at Telstra if it was to be an attractive buy, suggested that around 7,000 
 staff needed to be cut between 1996 and 1998 to deliver a 27 per cent profit increase. Then, the day that Telstra announced a record profitâa $2.3 billion profitâit also announced that it would shed 22,000 workers.</para><para>The Democrats acknowledge that Frank Blount is not necessarily a cutter of staffâin fact, he put 10,000 new workers on. But the criticism of the Telstra staffing policy came from the task force scoping study, commissioned by the finance department to prepare Telstra for sale. As the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> reported in September 1996:</para><para>The task force has been worrying not just about Frank Blount's known reluctance to cut, but his instinct to build . . .</para><para>That clearly identifies that, if you are going to be competitive, staff have to go, that the bottom line is clearly about profits and competition, not necessarily about the protection of Australian jobs and workers. The article went on to say that the setting of a 22,000-person headcount target, if you like, by Blount contradicted his attack on `management by headcount'. Frank Blount also noted that Telstra was engaging in a significant change in industrial relations policies, clearly because of a change of federal government. Blount's comment was, `Everyone knows about it, they write about it, so I may as well say it: a Labor government's different from the current government.'</para><para>So the picture that we see is that, without the pressure of privatisation, without the criticism of the scoping study task force appointed by the Minister for Finance and Administration (Mr Fahey) and Minister Richard Alston, Frank Blount would not have changed a management practice of, I believe, a lifetime and, therefore, retrenched 22,000 workers. He would not have moved in that direction had he not had the pressures of a looming privatisation, of changing industrial relations policies and of that scoping study.</para><para>It is not as though Telstra is losing market share. Optus has not challenged Telstra's market share in the way that was presumed. They are not as effective a competitor as was presumed. Telstra has 82 per cent of the largest growing market in Australia. Optus has around only 13 per cent. But retrenching 
 is the very first action taken by privatised Telstra. Telecom New Zealand reduced its work force by two-thirds from 24,500 to 8,500 in its first eight years as a private company. British Telecom is another example. It cut staff by 120,000 or 45 per cent from 1981 to 1994 as it was being privatised. Telstra management is now boasting that its retrenchments are ahead of scheduleâ18,000 staff of the now enlarged 25,000 target are gone just two years into a three-year program. And people are boasting about this?</para><para>During the last Telstra debate, I note that Senator Harradine expressed deep concern about the impact of Telstra job losses, particularly the impact on regional Australia. I draw to the attention of Senator Harradine and the chamber figures that were released quite recently in a return to order from Senator Vicki Bourne of the Democrats in relation to Telstra staffing levels. These figures show that in the year to March 1998 a quarter of all staff leaving Telstra came from regional Australia.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>4J4</name.id><name role="metadata">SCHACHT</name><name role="display">Senator Schacht</name></talker><para>âTwenty-five per cent.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3I6</name.id><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name></talker><para>âThat is about 3,000 of the 12,000 separations.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>4J4</name.id><name role="metadata">SCHACHT</name><name role="display">Senator Schacht</name></talker><para>âWhere were Senator Boswell and the National Party?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3I6</name.id><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name></talker><para>âThat includes 248 Telstra workers who had to leave in Tasmaniaâone of the states for which Senator Harradine presumably is very concerned, as he represents itâand 617 in regional Queensland. I will take on board Senator Schacht's interjection. I wonder how Senator Boswell felt about that particular notion that those two regional areas were suffering the adverse impact of job losses and job reductions in the Telstra work force.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Senator Harradine's argument in relation to privatisation having no impact on Telstra employment is simply wrong. The facts and figures dispute that very premise. The evidence is there that quite clearly if Telstra was not sold there would be a lot more Telstra workers in regional Australia, a lot more faults would be cleared on time, a lot more connections would be made on time, and a lot fewer workers would be on the dole queues 
 under this government. If you think that the 25,000 job losses we are seeing now are somehow the end of the job losses that we will see in Telstra, then you are indeed naive, because the facts suggest otherwise. The experience in both New Zealand and Britain show that shareholders will demand that tens of thousands more jobs go in order to boost shareholder values.</para><para>I remind everyone, in particular Senator Harradine, that the day BHP announced it was closing its Newcastle steelworks, a loss of 10,000 jobs, the stock market cheered and the BHP share price rose. The day Patrick sacked 2,000 waterfront workers the share price of Lang Corporation leaped through the roof. So there are demands from shareholders if we are treating a company as simply a company that is making profits and not necessarily looking after consumer and client needs, not just in the bush but all over Australia. Private shareholders demand body counts. Telstra had to deliver them in order to be an attractive float prospect. Telstra in the future will be expected to deliver thousands more to the insatiable demands of the share market. So if people in this chamber back the sale, the loss of 10s of thousands of jobs will be on their heads, not just in regional and remote parts of this country but all over Australia.</para><para>I end with the point with which I began, that is, once again, the lunacy of this debate, not just the concocted timetable in which we are operating but the fact that even if this government gets what it wantsâand it is looking very clear that the government will get the numbers in this place to pass this legislation, whether you call it enabling or hypothetical legislation or whatever you want to call itâwe are not being given the appropriate and adequate time in which to debate in detail the amendments that are before us. I remind the Senate that 41 of those amendments are from the Australian Democrats. We not being given the opportunity to not only develop a regulatory framework in this legislation that will hopefully improve it but also ensure that consumer needs and the needs of all Australians are protected and improved under this bill. I look forward to debating in more detail some of the other amendments 
 that the Democrats will move if we are given the opportunity.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>5632</page.no><name role="metadata">Hogg, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HOGG</name><name.id>7L6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIn view of the comments that were made by Senator Boswell in this debate earlier, I feel that I have to respond. Before so doing, I think it is worth commenting on the point just made by Senator Stott Despojaâthat is, the issue of jobs and jobs in Telstra. I have it on fairly good authorityâand this might interest the Democratsâthat the near 2,000 jobs that were to go in Telstra have been put on hold at the direction of Telstra management. They were told not to shed any jobs in rural and regional areas for the next four months.</para></talk.start><para>One wonders why that directive has gone out. It will be interesting to hear the government deny it. I am told very reliably that this is what has happened. The government has given the directive that none of these 1,783 jobs, to be precise, are to be lost over the next four months. That is a very cynical approach, indeed, to the issue of employment, particularly at this time in the run-up to the election and while debating this bill in this chamber.</para><para>Turning to what Senator Boswell had to say, one must feel sorry for Senator Boswell because one does not know whether he is really in touch with what is happening in Queensland. If one looks at the performance of the coalition parties in the recent Queensland state election, one sees the real answer as to why we are seeing what is happening on this bill in this chamber. Clearly, the coalition, and in particular the National Party, was devastated at the last election in Queensland. One only needs to look at the figures to see that. I will come to that in a few moments.</para><para>The cat was let out of the bag many months ago, in the first instance, when the Prime Minister failed to kill off One Nation. Of course, One Nation has not only established itself but been legitimised by the actions of the coalition in Queensland. The Prime Minister missed the opportunity to say that the coalition would put One Nation last in the Queensland electionâthat was undoubtedly done for cynical reasonsâand they are now wearing the consequence, which is that the 
 Liberal Party is less than a cricket team in the Queensland parliament.</para><para>What has happened to the National Party? It has been decimated. The vote of the National Party in Queensland has been ripped asunder because of the way they sidled up to the One Nation party. Their federal colleagues are now trying to get them out of that hole by pork barrelling. Clearly, this is something that will be rejected by the electorate when this government faces the electorate in the not too distant future.</para><para>The performance of the Queensland coalition government was pathetic in its own right. They have failed to understand, firstly, that were rejected by the people of Queensland because of their performance, and, secondly, that many of their supporters failed to find any faith or any trust in continuing their support of the National Party in Queensland. So what did they do? They deserted the National Party. They went across and they voted for One Nation.</para><para>If you listened to Senator Boswell, you would have taken the view that all of this was out in the very remote, very distant, parts of Queensland. But if one looks at some of the electorates one finds that National Party people who were in electorates within 50-60 kilometres of Brisbane, not even as much as 80 kilometres away, were affected by the impact of One Nationâthe very cat that they let out of the bag.</para><para>It is interesting to look, for example, at the seat of Lockyer. Those who know Lockyer will know that it is a rural-cum-semirural area. It is interesting to look at the electoral results in Queensland on a polling booth basis. In some of the booths there, dramatic changes took place for the National Party because they had done themselves in.</para><para>Look at Boonahâthey went from 69.92 per cent of the first preference vote down to 30.13. No wonder they are here pork barrelling, trying to get this bill through to try to win some of those votes back. The government have got the problem that no-one believes them. They have deserted them. This is a vain attempt to win back some of that support. Look at Laidleyâ61.62 per cent down to 23.11 per cent of the first preference 
 vote. In both instances, the One Nation vote was high. Senator Boswell can put across whatever view he likes, but he cannot make out that these places are isolated and remote. Boonah and Laidley are relatively close to Brisbane.</para><para>Look at some of their stronger booths and you will really understand why the panic set in. At the booth of Rosevale they went from 92.25 per cent of the vote down to 36.62 per cent of the vote. No wonder the National Party are worried. That is in the seat of Lockyer.</para><para>Go to the seat of Crows Nest in the so-called National Party heartlandâwhich, coincidentally, was won on Labor Party preferences because Labor put One Nation last; that was our policy and we saw it all the way throughâgo to one of their polling booths, where you would hardly put anyone on to hand out how-to-vote cards because in 1995 they got 95.11 per cent of the vote, and you will see that that dropped to 57.4 per cent in 1998. The disillusionment out in the country is widespread, and not just on the issue of Telstra. Pork barrelling on Telstra will not resolve the problem for the government. In my speech in the second reading debate yesterday I mentioned an article by Paul Pickering in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of 7 July. He said, and I think it was very well put:</para><para>Surely it did not need Pauline Hanson to remind National Party backbenchers that it is the state that has provided and maintained infrastructure in the bush.</para><para>The people in the rural and regional areas trust the state. They are looking to the state to do that. In the state of Queensland, they were deserted by the then National Party dominated government. They deserted the National Party in droves. These people were not west of the Dividing Range; these people were along the coastal strip. What we are hearing today from the National Party and from Senator Boswell does not add up. They have lost votes everywhere: they have lost them in their heartland, they have lost them in the areas that they duchessed over a long period of time. Clearly, those people have faith and trust in the state providing infra 
 structure. The article in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline>  goes on to say:</para><para>They simply needed to look to their own past to understand that the only way to guarantee a continuing cross-subsidy for rural telephone services is through public ownership.</para><para>What the National Party is doing here todayâand some of my other colleagues have alluded to this quite clearlyâis putting forward its own death sentence. If it cannot rely on the figures that are there already in the bush in Queensland, then what can it rely on? It is no use for the National Party to come in here and talk up the fact that it will pork barrel and that that will resolve the problems in the countryâbecause the belief in the country has gone.</para><para>As for the deal that the National Party claims to have done, through Senator Boswell, with the Liberal Party, we have already seen here today an amendment tabled on behalf of Senator Boswell. That amendment says `to avoid doubt'. Whilst that is not pertinent here, one wonders what other things the National Party has overlooked in its deal. What faith, what trust can the people of Queensland and the people of Australia put in the National Party: little or none? The answer is none, because it has blown its chances, it has blown its credibility</para><para>The new party that they have established and given credibility to in the state of Queenslandâ`they' being the National Party and the Liberal Partyâis One Nation; that has been done not by the Labor Party but by the coalition parties. Whilst Senator Boswell and Senator O'Chee in this chamber have rightfully condemned the One Nation Party and its policies, they have been absolutely unable to convince their colleagues in Queensland, as we saw in the state election, to put One Nation last. They are now trying to shut the gate after the horse has bolted. What they have is an electoral calamity. The Australian public should understand quite clearly that the only reason for their pursuing this bill now and not in some months time is so that they can try to duchess some of the support they have lost out in the rural and regional communities. </para><para>The fact that the government seemingly issued an instruction yesterday to Telstra management to put a hold on the cut to rural and regional jobs speaks volumes: hold the rural and regional job cuts for four monthsâ</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>6L6</name.id><name role="metadata">GIBBS</name><name role="display">Senator Gibbs</name></talker><para>âAnd then sack them afterwards.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>7L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Hogg, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HOGG</name></talker><para>âand then sack them; sack them after we have had an election. In this day and age people see through this sort of cynicism. They are fed up with it. You wonder why they are fed up with politicians. When you see that sort of performance from the National Party, it leaves one in no doubt at all as to why people have deserted the National Party in droves and, unfortunately, the National Party has just started to wake up to it.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The way to redress the problem is not to hasten this bill through. The government could have put this bill on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline> and debated it from 10 August. But no, the government wants it there so that it can call the election within the next few weeks. Meanwhile, what do we see? We see National Party supporters leaving the party in their droves.</para><para>Senator Boswell tried to create the impression that there is a large mass of people still warmly embracing the National Party out there in its heartland. If they are, then the figures belie that, no matter what electorate one looks at. This is the case even in close city electorates, like the seat of Redlands.</para><para>People throughout the rest of Australia might think Senator Boswell is talking about remote places, as I said earlier. Look at the seat of Redlands, a bayside area within 15 to 20 kilometres of the central part of Brisbane. What do we find? Just look at the figures. Kimberly Park: in 1995 the National Party got 53.26 per cent, and in 1998 it dropped to 36.73 per cent. Mount Cotton: in 1995 it got 51.39 per cent, and in 1998 it dropped to 34.95 per cent. Shailer Park: in 1995 it got 48.05, and in 1998 it dropped to 33.15. Thornlands: in 1995 it got 44.16, and in 1998 it dropped to 30.84âand that is in a near metropolitan area which was a National Party seat and still is a National Party seat for one 
 reason: the distribution of One Nation preferences.</para><para>It was One Nation preferences that got the National Party across the lineâand just across itâin the seat of Redlands. We are not talking about people who are disenfranchised. We are not talking about people who are remote, who are living in desolate places. We are talking about people living within 15 to 20 kilometres of the central part of Brisbane. These people who previously, for whatever reasons, supported the National Party have deserted them. So Senator Boswell should not come in here and paint a picture that we are talking about people in remote Queensland alone, because we are not; we are talking about people right throughout the state of Queensland. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>5634</page.no><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator ABETZ</name><name.id>N26</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe Labor Party has submitted this Senate and the people of Australia to a spray of accusations and rhetoric against the Liberal Party, the National Party, Senator Harradine, Senator Colston, and anybody else that it could think of on the way through. Its economic use of the truth has finally persuaded me to partake in this debate. The people of Australia will undoubtedly remember that the Labor Party gave an iron clad guaranteeâas Ralph Willis put itâin relation to the sale of the Commonwealth Bank. Remember the Commonwealth Bank?</para></talk.start><para>The Commonwealth Bank was sold by the Australian Labor Party. On 31 October 1993 the then Treasurer was asked:</para><para>So unlike before, this time your commitment is iron clad?</para><para>Ralph Willis: Absolutely yes.</para><para>So that is the credibility with which Labor comes to this debate on privatisation: promise one thing before an election, and then do another thing after it. That was with the Commonwealth Bank. Labor did exactly the same with Qantas.</para><para>This is one of the few times that I would even bother quoting the new Labor candidate for Dickson, the former Democrat leader, but this is a very telling point. She said this: `I think Labor in opposition won't sell Telstra, but I am more worried about Labor in govern 
 ment.' It is a very telling comment, isn't it? In opposition they will try to defend the indefensible, yet their actions in government speak so much louder than their rhetoric in opposition. Cheryl Kernot did put her finger on it when she said, `If Labor remains in opposition, they will vote against every privatisation that comes along but, as soon as they get into governmentâlike they did with Qantas, like they did with the Commonwealth Bank, like they did with the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, and the list goes onâthey would privatise them all.'</para><para>Indeed, at the time Mr Keating was asked on the ABC's <inline font-style="italic">Lateline</inline> program whether it mattered if Telstra was publicly or privately owned, and Mr Keating said, `Of its essence, no.' Now all of a sudden the Labor Party have gone very quiet, haven't they? When they are reminded of the record of the Australian Labor Party on privatisation, those opposite realise that they do not come to this debate with clean hands. The significant difference is this: when we privatise something, we do not use it to pay for recurrent expenditure; we use that money either as another capital investment in our country or to pay off the huge debt.</para><para>That brings me on to another point. Before the last election, what did Mr Beazley, the then Minister for Finance, promise the Australian people? Indeed, that promise was repeated by people such as Senator Faulkner and Senator Ray who partook in this debate. They gave us the solemn assurance `The budget is in surplus.' We now know that that was absolutely and utterly wrong; we were left with a $10.5 billion deficit. That has now finally been admitted by none other than the shadow Treasurer, Mr Gareth Evans, and the new Labor star, Cheryl Kernot. She also admitted the fact of this $10.5 billion deficit.</para><para>Therefore, it is vitally important that we as a nation address the problem of debt. That is what we are doing with this sale. It is to pay off the $96 billion worth of debt that accrued up until Labor lost government in 1996. With the sale of the remaining part of Telstra, we will be able to repay 40 per cent of that debt. The recurrent expenditure by Australian taxpayers on servicing that debt is in the 
 billions of dollars each year. If you pay off the debt, you will not have to keep on paying the huge interest rates on servicing that debt.</para><para>If it comes to credibility, before the last election in my home state of Tasmania, the Labor Party circulated a nasty little numberâthat is the only way that it can be describedâin the form of a letter addressed to `The Resident' that was circulated in the electorate of Lyons by the Labor member. It was in the form of a fake Telstra bill asserting that the Liberal government would sell 33 per cent of Telstra. This is the allegation that they made. They said, `How much your telephone bill would rise in Lyons if John Howard was allowed to sell Telstra.' They had the map of Tasmania with towns marked on it and with a price underneath them. They claimed that in Queenstown the telephone bill would rise by $1,250. If you cross over to St Marys on the east cost it would rise by $910. Smack bang in the middle of Tasmania is Oatlands which would increase by $680. Ouse, $950; Deloraine, $680âand so the nonsense went on.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>6H4</name.id><name role="metadata">HARRADINE</name><name role="display">Senator Harradine</name></talker><para>âMay we have a copy of that?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>N26</name.id><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator ABETZ</name></talker><para>âYes, Senator Harradine, you may have a copy of that. What the electorate of Lyons in Tasmania has now come to realise is that, whilst they were very scaredâindeed, my office was inundated with phone callsâthe interesting thing is whether these messages were correct. I tried to contact the people in the electorate two days before election day, which was impossible, to try to disabuse them of this.</para></talk.start></continue><para>But I do not have to any more now, because one-third of Telstra has been sold. The people of Queenstown now know they have better telecommunications facilities than they ever had under Labor and, what is more, the price has not gone up one cent. Indeed, it has gone down. So much for the big Labor lie of a $1,250 increase in Queenstown, for instance, and trying to scare people in remote areas that they would be facing increased costs in telecommunications if the one-third sale of Telstra went through. That accusation has been completely and utterly debunked by the experience of the electors of Lyons. They now do not rely on me to tell them that that 
 is untrue. They can now read their own Telstra bills and know that the document circulated by the Labor member for Lyonsâonly three days before the election so it could not be effectively answeredâwas wrong. It was false; it was misleading. Of course, the dire predictions of that document never, ever came into being.</para><para> Can I quickly turn to some spurious comments made by Senator Hogg in relation to One Nation and somehow the coalition's role in One Nation. I am not sure how it is relevant but, seeing that we were allowed to hear from Senator Hogg about One Nation, let me just remind the chamber and the people of Australia that at the last election in the electorate of Brand, which is Mr Beazley's electorate, who did he put before the Liberal candidate on the how-to-vote card?  None other than the candidate that was standing for Australians Against Further Immigration. And in Kalgoorlie, where the member is Graeme Campbellâmost people describe him as `Pauline Hanson without a dress' because they have exactly the same policiesâLabor put Mr Campbell at No. 2 on their how-to-vote card. That was their second choice in Kalgoorlie.</para><para>After the last federal election there was a by-election in Lindsay. The Labor Party, in their desperation to win that seat, put the Shooters Party first and Australians Against Further Immigration before the Liberal candidate. Now they claim that they come to the issue of the allocation of preferences with clean hands. They could have done so had Mr Beazley, in his own seat, put the Liberal candidate ahead of the Australians Against Further Immigration candidate. But they did not do so. They could have come with clean hands had they put, in Kalgoorlie, the Liberal candidate before Mr Campbell. But they did not so.

The upshot, 
 in summary, is that telecommunications is a very high growth industry. Whilst its services are very capital intensive, the companies involved, particularly Telstra, are significant employers. But, as the industry becomes more capital intensive through elimination of manual exchanges and reduced dependence on traditional copper wire infrastructure, it is to be expected that employment growth will ease or actually decline.

When I came into this place, I was told a couple of things by the likes of former senator John Button, who led the Labor Party in the Senate when it was in government with distinction and a lot of decorum. He always played the game properly. He did not lead Labor senators to the sin bin as much as these people should have gone to it in the last little while. Former senator Gareth Evans was actually not that bad a person. He played it tough, but he played it a bit better than the current Labor Senate leader now is.</para></talk.start></continue><para>It is time we got this debate back to the Telstra bill. After 13 years of Labor mismanagement, the Australian taxpayers were left with about $96 billion of debt by the Labor Party. The interest on the debt is over $8 billion. That money could be spent on health, roads and education, et cetera. The Howard-Fischer government committed themselves to using the proceeds of this Telstra sale to wipe out 40 per cent of that debt. Isn't that good? Why do you not want that to happen? Why did you create the debt in the first instance? Why did the Labor Party really want to perpetuate that debt on the Australian people? It is one reason why Telstra needs to be sold. I want it to be sold. I have always fully supported the sale of Telstra.</para><para>The Australian people flocked to the sale of the first third of Telstra. Something like 1.5 million people have bought shares in Telstra. You cannot tell me that they are all wrong. More people will own it and benefit from it, including both the users and the investors; that is the most important thing about this bill. There will be cheaper services from Telstra, and that will happen. Give it time to happen. By law, Telstra is required to reduce the price of a basket of its main services currently by 7.5 per cent in real terms, and you know it. Why not admit it and get on with the debate?</para><para>Labor, including those opposite, says that Telstra should not be sold as it is a monopoly. This is untrue. It is not a fact. This is an intensely competitive industry. Telstra has Optus, AAPT and Primus and other competi 
 tors. It is the real world out there, you monopolists.</para><para>What about the rural safeguards and the universal service obligations, which state that all Australians must have access to the standard telephone service and pay phones regardless of where they live in Australia? The sale will not change this. There will be subsidised connection costs. By law, residential connection costs must decrease every year by one per cent in real terms. As to local price call gaps, the Howard-Fischer government has introduced a scheme to ensure that local call prices in regional areas do not exceed the average local call cost in the major cities. This will stay no matter who owns Telstra.</para><para>Thanks to the Howard-Fischer government, the most remote 17,000 Telstra customers now receive a rebate on their pastoral calls of up to $160 per year. Last year, the government spent $250 billion on a regional telecommunications infrastructure fund to ensure that rural and regional phone users have access to the latest technology. To date, 93 rural and regional projects worth $49 million have been approved.</para><para>There is also $60 million additional to the RTIF from the social bonus, including $20 million for remote island communities such as the Torres Strait islands and Christmas Island. But you people do not care about them either. The customer service guarantee states that the level of service will not be affected by the sale of Telstra. This is a legislated standard binding all telecommunications companies. Get the facts. Talk a bit about the facts instead of having a diatribe against the National Party.</para><para>Why are you so worried about the National Party that you want to have a diatribe against us the whole time? You condemn Senator Boswell for the job that he has done. He has done a great thing for rural communities. If the service does fail, the customers are entitled to compensation from the company. The government has introduced legislation to strengthen that guarantee.</para><para>What about untimed local calls? These are here to stay. Under the previous government, the only guarantee covered residential customer calls. This government has extended this 
 guarantee to cover voice and data calls for residential customers and voice calls for business customers. An amount of $150 million is provided to abolish Telstra's pastoral call rate and provide untimed local calls in extended zones in remote Australia. That was announced just a couple of days ago. As to the price gaps, currently Telstra cannot increase the price of untimed local calls above 25c for local residential and business calls and 40c for local public phone calls. Look at a few of the facts and figures on what is happening rather than have a diatribe all the time.</para><para>Why does Senator Schacht not make some comments about the telecommunications ombudsman, for example? He has been a good debater over the years. Why filibuster and go through this diatribe? Labor should also take into account what we did with the CDMA in the analog-digital changeover, which was also announced during the week. The sale of Telstra will take our telecommunications systems into the 21st century in the way I want, living in a country area.</para><para>You people all talk about what you will do for the bush.

Senator Brownhill is quite right; we need to get back to the debate. It was not only Senator Brownhill who said this but there were some earlier comments from Senator Boswell regarding this whole idea that we will be better off as far as debt is concerned if we retire some of the public debt. That is a nonsense. Australia's net public debt is the second lowest in the developed world, the second lowest in the OECD. The only country that has a lower public sector debt is South Korea. Our problem is our current account deficit. If we go ahead and sell Telstra, particularly looking at the amount that you will let go offshore, all it will do is increase our problems because of the repatriated profit to overseas companies. If Senator Brownhill read the transcripts of the committee hearings, he would find that our net public worth will fall if we sell this. Keeping Telstra in public ownership, if we look at our total worth, is far 
 better for this country, particularly for future generations.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I want to try to get back to some of what we should be debating in this bill. Because I suspect that, by the time the guillotine comes down, we may never have got past the preamble stages, I have been progressively discussing Australian Democrat amendments. We do have a large number of amendments to this bill. Presuming that it is going to be sold, we want to make sure that what is sold is going to be reasonably workable. It is by no means going to be reasonable in terms of the situation as far as rural people are concerned. That point has been made more than enough this morning.</para><para>I want to run through, for the benefit of those who are continuing the filibuster, what we are trying to achieve in our amendments. To start with, one of our amendments looks at preventing Telstra from being sold until the Australian Communications Authority has certified that it has restored the levels of service back to 1996 performance. In other words, we want to ensure that they are repairing our phones when they break down and that they are putting on new services. We seek to put a hold on the sale, if it has to go ahead, until we have at least got services back to where they were before the first one-third was sold.</para><para>Secondly, our amendments require the indicative share price to be approved by parliament. This is Democrat amendment No. 5. We have seen time and time again that when shares are sold in a public entity there is a huge windfall gain to those who are buying the shares compared with those of us who do not buy. It is appalling that this government is so intent on selling that it is basically going to do it in a rush. Let us look at what happened when the first third was sold. It was sold for $3.30 per share. Within a day, the price shot up to $4. At the moment, the shares are just under $6. This is great for the 10 per cent of Australians that can afford it, but what about the rest of us? What we have now is an $11 billion windfall going to those who bought inâand that is the first third. Imagine what we could do with $11 
 billion in our public hospital system, in our schools, in our roads, et cetera.</para><para>We should look at the way that the Department of Finance handled previous sales. A wide range of stockbrokers have had some involvement, but none of that ever seems to register on the department. HSBC James Capel was one firm saying that it had to be at $4 per share. Look at what was happening in New Zealand with its float. An amount of $4 per share was again indicated. The finance department set an indicative range the first time of $2.80 to $3.40âwell below any reasonable estimate. I have not heard anything from this government to explain the $11 billion windfall that it handed over with the first one-third sale. It must never happen again.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>4J4</name.id><name role="metadata">SCHACHT</name><name role="display">Senator Schacht</name></talker><para>âTheir mates the stockbrokers got it.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>8U4</name.id><name role="metadata">Lees, Sen Meg</name><name role="display">Senator LEES</name></talker><para>âIt has not just happened with Telstra. If we look, Senator Schacht, at what Labor unfortunately did with the Commonwealth Bank, those shares were sold at 58 per cent less than they were worth. By the time the government received its final instalments, those shares were worth $2.8 billion more than what the government sold them for. In both cases, the finance department and its advisers delivered windfall gains to 10 per cent of Australians at the expense of the rest of us. In other words, we have seen the community ripped off time and time again. It should not happen again.</para></talk.start></continue><para>We need to move on. One of the amendments I mentioned before, which Senator Murray will be moving, is to prevent Telstra making donations to any political party. As we have been discussing, regulations are going to be critically important. If we are going to see a situation where $100,000 goes here and $100,000 goes there to different political parties, the incentive will be to keep on the right side of Telstra. But its profits are almost totally dependent now on regulation. We have to go into this debate now presuming that it is going to be sold. Senator Murray will develop the arguments as to why we should not have political parties involved at all with any potential donations from what will be Australia's biggest company.</para><para>Let us look at Democrat amendment No. 10. This is another accountability measure. The Department of Finance management of the first sale of Telstra, as I said, was an accountability disaster. At the very least, we believe that it demands that any decision involving public money and public revenue must be made by senior public servants. The way this bill is structured at the moment, basically anybody can be involved. It simply allows cabinet to appoint anyone. Your stockbroking firm could handle the sale. It could be handed over to one of our banks. We are arguing that it really could be a junior public servant with absolutely no skills whatsoever. So the Democrat amendment is trying to get at least back to the situation in the current act, which is that people are appointed on merit from the senior ranks of the senior executive service. I do not believe that something as important as this sale should be delegated any lower than that.</para><para>Amendment 11, which I discussed in my speech on the second reading, deals with foreign ownership. We believe that Australians are becoming more concerned and more aware of the dangers of foreign ownership when it is not necessary and when it has nothing productive to offer. If we are trying to set up new businesses and industries, there may be a case for encouraging foreign ownership up to that 49 per cent level and getting them to work jointly with Australians.</para><para>This is an established company. We do not need to hand over half, a third or whatever of the additional profits. I would just like to put on the record what happened with the first tranche. Foreign investors were allocated about 19 per cent of shares. Most of these were re-sold within a month, delivering windfall capital gains to foreign investors at the expense of the Australian taxpayers. The total windfall gain to foreign investors was around $1 billion. As one example, the Bank of Ireland was allocated the fourth largest shareholding in Telstra last December. It lasted in the market less than three weeks. It stayed on the register less than three weeks, and it went out pocketing $26 million in profit. Why are we letting that happen? Where is the commonsense? Where is the 
 logic in handing $26 million to the Bank of Ireland for an investment in Australia that lasted less than three weeks? I am sure they would have been very pleased, but there is absolutely no benefit in that for us.</para><para>We are asking this government to think yet again. We are asking the opposition and we are especially asking Senator Harradine to really look at why we have to privatise Telstra when the company is established and it is an extremely valuable company. If we have to privatise it, then let us at least leave the windfall gains and the profits here in Australia. As I said before, public debt is not the problem. It is the second lowest in the OECD; indeed, it is about two-thirds of what the average is in the OECD.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">SHERRY</name><name role="display">Senator Sherry</name></talker><para>âIt is half of Germany's and the UK's.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>8U4</name.id><name role="metadata">Lees, Sen Meg</name><name role="display">Senator LEES</name></talker><para>âIf we want to look at some of the countries, Senator, it only about a quarter of Italy's debt.

The vote in this chamber will not reflect the will of the Australian electorate, and it will not reflect the Australian electorate because the Howard government has done a slimy backdoor deal with Senator Colston to buy his support. A deal was done to upgrade a staff member of Senator Colston's to ensure that the one-third privatisation of Telstra went through this parliament. The will of the electorate is not reflected in these votes on the floor of the chamber. We know, anyway, that we are debating a preamble and a bill that Mr How 
 ard, the Prime Minister, categorically stated in 1996 would not be a matter brought before this parliament because he gave one of his non-core commitments, one of the Howard-type promises not to fully privatise Telstra.

But there, of course, is the rub.

 Harradine, the two Greens and the Labor Party have all agreed should go. However, we are still on this matter. Whilst dealing with this matter we should refer to a section which says that legislation providing for comprehensive community and regulatory safeguards has already been enacted. That may sound like a protective device for consumers, but there is a danger that the interest of Telstra in the regulations, which government will continue to pursue, may result in their being tempted to exercise undue influence on the political process.</para></talk.start><para>At schedule 2, after item 21, the Democrats do intend to move amendment No. 9 on sheet 1124. That directly relates to the preamble in this sense. It relates to the fact that Telstra must not make political donations. The amendment says:</para><para>Telstra, or any Telstra body, or any director or employee of Telstra or a Telstra body on behalf of Telstra, must not make, directly or indirectly, any donation, gift or related payment to any political party, candidate or member of parliament within Australia.</para><para>Why would the Australian Democrats be moving that amendment, and why is it relevant to the preamble? It is relevant to the preamble because it sets the tone for this bill, and the bill does provide for making Telstra particularly interested in the actions of political parties in this place. Our amendment will seek to introduce yet another fundamentally important accountability measure. It will ban Telstra directly or indirectly making any donations to any politician or political party. We think that would be fundamentally essential to the better functioning and the continuing better functioning of our political process.</para><para>Telstra, if it is privatised, will be Australia's biggest company. It will be twice the size of BHP or NAB. As such, it will have enormous financial strength. Anyone who thinks that Telstra will be some passive, gentle giant which will be nice to all Australians is not understanding the aggressiveness that comes from a monopolist. As a private company, with directors dedicated to making a profit for their shareholders, its commercial and competitive aggressiveness will increase fourfold, as will its desire to make more money.</para><para>Telstra's profitability depends totally on the extent of regulation provided by this parliament. If this parliament imposes service standards or universal service obligations or infrastructure requirements, Telstra's profitability will be affected. The Democrats do not think that Telstra will take that lying down. We expect this place, once Telstra is privatised, to be inundated with Telstra's lobbyists against any form of regulation, wanting to argue and confine and read down every single clause of the Telecommunications Act that imposes a duty or obligation on them.</para><para>I do not think Telstra will be backward about coming forward in the donations department. We have seen in Victoria, where the Crown casino monopoly depends entirely on the nature of regulation and revenue rules, just what can happen when a government and a captive company get too close. Telstra will be in a similar category. This will be Australia's biggest company, but it does control 82 per cent of the market, which is a substantial and aggressive near monopoly. The only thing standing between Telstra and monopolistic profits will be the powers of the regulator, which is the Australian Communications Authority, and this parliament. That is why, more than any other company, Telstra must be precluded from being involved in the political process.</para><para>We will be seeking this unusual amendment later on. It is set by the preamble, which says that regulation is vital to this company. We say that, if you have such a large company, you have to be careful of its political power. As a company, it will be too big. The direct impact of our decisions on its profits will be too direct. Accountability will demand that Telstra not be a political player. It must be precluded from making deals with politicians or political parties. It must be banned completely from making any donations or gifts. It would be an unusual ban, but Telstra's dominant position, size and unique regulatory position are unusual. I urge the government and Senator Harradine to show good faith by regarding this amendment favourablyâto keep Telstra out of the political arena once it is privatised.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>5652</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âWe are debating the preamble of the bill to amend the Telstra Corporation Act 1991.

It is a bit like saying to someone you are going to buy them a birthday present, asking for the money to do it, then buying them something really small and saying, 
 `Aren't I a good person?' That is basically the process we are likely to see during this election campaign.</para><para>The next paragraph looks at the legislation authorising the sale not having effect until after the first general election for the House of Representatives. That creates quite a few problems. We would have preferred that it pass through both Houses of parliament. There are amendments to be considered, but nobody really thinks that the government is going to take many of these amendments seriously at all because the deal has been done.</para><para>We have an amendment proposed by Senator Harradine that, in effect, says, `The faster you proclaim this legislation, the better.' How does that create any protection? Basically, it is a threat on the government: if you happen to be re-elected and you do not proclaim really quickly, you will have to put the legislation again. It is not an inhibition. Basically, it stops the ability to deal with a very strong message coming out during the election campaign. If, for some strange reason, this government were to get over the line in one way or the other, or in a very odd coalition at the end of the process, the impetus is that they should proclaim it as quickly as possible. If the coalition gets back in, that does not mean that they would actually put it to a vote necessarily. It just means they would give it a tick and proclaim it as soon as possibleâno matter what the numbers were in the parliament and no matter what was said to them by the community, and not just by rural and regional Australia.</para><para>These concerns are not simply those of rural and regional Australia, though obviously rural and regional Australia feels more strongly in relation to competition policy and the new so-called competitive environment. They feel that they cut out. We have already heard the way the National Party were used in the committee stage processes to savage and monster people from the bush who gave evidence to the inquiry and expressed their concerns about the lack of consultation and the lack of accountability as a result of the privatisation in each tranche.</para><para>However, here we see the accountability of the parliament being threatened by the executive; it is undermining the legislative function of the parliament. We would have liked to give serious attention to an amendment. But there is no point now in having these kinds of amendments because the deal has been done.</para><para>We believe that pushing through with an unproclaimed bill in this fashionâ`Don't worry, there's an election in the meantime; don't worry, we'll look for a mandate'âis a nonsense and a travesty. It undermines the legislative function of the parliament and erodes the accountability of the executive to the parliament. Basically, it means that the executive is not accountable. If we come back after the election, after the government has said that it is going to listen to the Australian people and the Australian people quite clearly tell it about Telstra during this time, the executive will not have to deal with it. Nothing in this legislation says that it will have to deal with that opinion which might be clearly expressed during any election campaign.</para><para>The open proclamation is at odds with the legislation handbook and the current drafting rules. It is inconsistent with the concerns about open-ended commencement provisions expressed by the Senate as long ago as 1988 and which are now reflected in standing order 139. It is at odds with the conclusion of the forward estimates in the 1998-99 budget papers. They are not saying the same things in relation to the proceeds of the Telstra sale; so that means that the last budget was incorrect.</para><para>It wastes significant public funds. We certainly have seen the spending of significant public funds already in forcing the Senate to deal with something which we were promised would not happen. Not only do we have to look at the cost to the Senate, but we have to look at the cost of the Senate inquiries that have taken placeâthe two Senate inquiries in particular. Add to that the three still outstanding inquiries: the digital data review, under subsection 481 of the Telecommunications Act; the AMPS regional coverage, under section 5103 of the Telecommunications Act; and alsoâand most importantly, because it 
 has been mentioned on a number of occasionsâthe Australian Communications Authority inquiry on review of the customer service guarantee.</para><para>So much of this debate now, and even in the previous tranche of this legislation, was dealing with the customer service guarantee. We still have an inquiry outstanding on the customer service guarantee. Yet although public funds have been put into that inquiry, we also have had public funds involved in two Senate inquiries at which strong concerns have been expressed but which the government has ignored. All of that has been ignored in this dingy process.</para><para>Returning to the substance of the bill, a lot has been saidâand it is in the preambleâabout telephone services being reasonable and about guarantees. Quite frankly, it has been established by many people in inquiries that the penalties are not necessarily enforceable and, on occasions, the amounts of penalties do not mean that people will comply. We have no real concept, as with many aspects of competition and privatisation we have seen lately, of how public interest is applied.</para><para>Let us go back to the basic question, if we are talking about preamble: what do we have a Telstra for? I would contendâand perhaps it is a naive conceptâthat a telecommunications company is there to provide telecommunications services. People expect that, when governments provide those services, there is some element of integration of public policy and public interest into that provision.</para><para>Yet, all throughout the preamble, we look at the gleeful benefits of commercial flexibility and profitability. Then you have to ask: profitability for whom? The answer of course is the shareholders. We have had very strong arguments during all of the inquiries in relation to what happens under corporate law, and that was argued strongly during the first tranche.</para><para>But we only have to look back in the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> to see the false assurances we were given at that time. We were told that we were overreacting, and that this simply did not mean there was to be a next tranche and that the rest would be sold off. We know that was not true. We know that was not true because 
 Senator Harradine made the same argument, Senator Alston made the same argumentâ`What are you making this fuss about? It's only the first tranche. This isn't the selling of the whole of Telstra; it is still in majority government ownership.'</para><para>Here we go. We are in the same parliament, the same Senate, and we are arguing now about the legislation for the sale of Telstra. Senator Harradine has said, `That does not mean it has to be sold.' We know that. But he has told the government that, if it does not proclaim this legislation straight away on getting back into governmentâif that is to happenâit will lose it.</para><para>So it does not really matter. According to that amendment, the government does not have to come back into this place to see whether or not the public view is still the same. It does not have to listen to anything that is said on this issue during the election. If the government happens to scrape together a mangy coalition as a result of all of this, if it happens to scrape over the line, whatever the community says during that election campaign means diddly-squatânothingâbecause the bill will be proclaimed.</para><para>Senator Harradine has assured us that it will be proclaimed, because he has put a penalty in which will apply if it is not proclaimed immediately. The government will lose the legislation if it does not proclaim it immediately. No matter what else comes out in these other inquiries, no matter what comes out with the community, no matter what comes out in public polling; no matter what, there is a penalty if this government, in the event it gets over the line, does not proclaim this bill immediately.</para><para>I do not believe there is any point in our going through the detail of what is wrong with the legislation or what is right with the amendments that have been proposed. The deal has been done. To the detriment of Australia, and not just of regional and rural Australia, the deal has been signed. In the end, I guess it will be one of those issues on which members of the community will have a chance to speak, and they will do that by way of their vote during the election campaign. </para><para>However, as the government knows, in election campaigns there are many things that the community comments on. Mandates are a false concept. This process is a sham and a disgrace to the parliament. But more than that; it is a disgrace not just to the parliament but to the people of Australia.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN (Senator Crowley)</name></talker><para>âI call Senator Stott Despoja.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3I6</name.id><name role="metadata">STOTT DESPOJA</name><name role="display">Senator Stott Despoja</name></talker><para>âI am happy to defer to Senator Harradine for three minutes as requested.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>âWell, the next person on the rough list that I have in the back of my head is Senator Schacht.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>YE4</name.id><name role="metadata">BOSWELL</name><name role="display">Senator Boswell</name></talker><para>âMadam Temporary Chairman, don't we go from side to side?

People should know the reason why we want to move so many. In the limited time available, we have to ensure that if Telstra is going to be soldâwhether you call this enabling, hypothetical or other legislationâand the numbers are certainly looking that way, then we are at least trying to develop some kind of framework and regulatory environment that is accountable, as Senator Murray has remarked in his amendments, so that we have workable legislation before us. For that reason, the Democrats will be moving amendments and not simply filibustering on this bill.

So why are we here on a Saturday afternoon giving this bill the tag of urgency which not only does not allow us time to develop debates on the rationale and detail that a bill of this nature and a bill that is this important deserves, but also does not give us time to investigate those particular amendments before us?</para></talk.start></continue><para>I will deal briefly with Senator Harradine's comments in response to my earlier remarks about the consequences of privatisation on employment and specifically unemployment. Senator Harradine, I take your point that deregulation of the telecommunications industry played a role in seeing jobs lost in that sector. Certainly, the deregulation process was launched by Kim Beazley in the former government.</para><para>But I put on the record once again that, while that deregulated environment did result in job losses, this did not preclude jobs being created. We saw jobs originally slashed from 87,000 down to 65,000 from June 1990 to June 1994. We saw those 22,000 jobs being lost, but then we saw the number of jobs rising to 76,500 by June 1996. What we then saw was job losses in the light of looming privatisationâthis is in 1996. When it became clear that Telstra was going to be privatised and that profit was the key issue on the agenda, we saw the pressures and the push come from financial commentators. We saw this run directly contrary to the agenda of Frank Blount who, we have acknowledged, is not necessarily a cutter of staff. We note that the pressures of privatisation, along with the pressures outlined in the scoping study conducted by the work force that was appointed by Minister Alston and Minister Fahey, changed a management practice that Frank Blount had used for his lifetime so that, contrary to increasing staff numbers, he was looking to cut them. This was in the interests of the bottom lineâprofits, shareholders interests, privatisation.</para><para>We can see a direct link between privatisation and job losses specifically in rural areas. I draw the Senate's attention to a submission presented to the Senate Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts Legislation Committee on this topic from the Communications, Electrical and Plumbing Union. In that submission they point to not only a reduction in jobsâin particular a lot of outsourcing of work that was no longer considered either appropriate to or profitable for the telecommunications carrierâbut also a direct reflection on rural areas as a consequence of privatisation. We have seen rural 
 and remote areas losing jobs and losing services.</para><para>I turn my attention in the time remaining to the amendment that was previously circulated in my name relating to Internet access, a key issue that has not been explored to the necessary degree in this debate and, guess what, we are not going to have enough time to explore it in the detail that I believe is required. The amendments, which I understand will now be moved by the government on behalf of the Democrats, will change the Telecommunications Act 1997 to exclude B-party charging of Internet service providers, or ISPs, by the carrier.</para><para>In February this year, the Australian Bureau of Statistics released statistics on household use of information technology. These statistics demonstrate that just under three millionâ2.9 millionâhouseholds in Australia now have a computer. That is about 42 per cent of all households in this nation. They also found in February this year that 850,000 households had access to the Internet, which is 13 per cent of all households.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>UW4</name.id><name role="metadata">CRANE</name><name role="display">Senator Crane</name></talker><para>âDid you include mine?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3I6</name.id><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name></talker><para>âI think I am including yours, Senator Crane. We will make sure that statistic is included. Indeed, I would hope that most senators in this place have ready access to the Internet so that they can hear the concerns and read the e-mails from their constituents when they come to them directly and so that they can respond to them personally, I hope, too. An additional 470,000 householders indicated that they would be connecting to the Internet by February 1999.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In April 1998, the report entitled <inline font-style="italic">Electronic commerce in Australia</inline> by the Department of Industry, Science and Technology showed that 1.5 billion of the 21 billion transactions in Australia in 1997 were electronic. That has a value ofâbelieve it or notâ$16 trillion. This report also showed a dramatic increase in the number of commercial users and a significant presence of ISPs as hosts of active business websites. On the shopping front, this report also found steadily increasing on-line shopping, with 43 per cent of regular Internet users having shopped and a further 30 per cent who are willing to try. Clearly, an in 
 creasing part of our consumer interests and certainly our household life.</para><para>What was most significant was the finding that the amount of time spent on-line by dial-up users was closely related to the pricing plan of ISPs. These findings clearly show that the cost of access has a direct effect on the amount of access. However, as a hurdle to participation on-line, cost was listed third behind lack of defined need and availability. That is worth noting.</para><para>The Australian Democrats strongly believe that the Internet should be accessible and affordable for all. Access to the Internet is fundamentally important to the whole new communications environment that we are endeavouring to discuss here. For this reason, we believe that the costs of access should be limited to ensure they are not a barrier to access. We think cost goes to both access and availability. That is one of the reasons that we are moving amendments to the legislation today.</para><para>As the scope of on-line services grows, access to them will become an ever more pressing issue. The Internet already offers a means for accessing information which is vital for enabling participation in our society. For example, information on government services, policies and activities is already readily available on-line. The relevant minister has announced increasing awareness programs and, of course, created a single point of access for the Commonwealth.</para><para>There are plans for leading the delivery of government services via the Internet and increasing the levels of education on-lineâthings that we strongly support. The projected growth of health and educational services will also contribute to the growth of the Internet as a critical tool for students and families, and our broader community. These are all significant steps, but they all depend on availability and access and, of course, they are all very closely associated with costs.</para><para>The cost of accessing the Internet is, therefore, rapidly becoming a factor for an ever increasing number of families. In time, this is likely to become a cost that is virtually unavoidableâmuch like the telephone, if you like, in our society. The parliament, therefore, 
 in this debate today on our telecommunications legislation, has a duty to ensure that access to the Internet remains affordable. Putting safeguards in place now is one way of ensuring that we do not create an information underclass in the near future. We do not want a society divided into the information rich and the information poor. We must have this equity, and this is closely associated to costs. Moreover, preserving low cost access to the Internet is also an important means of entrenching the dynamic growth in the industry.</para><para>Despite the efforts of the Democrats, under the Telecommunications Act 1997 business customers will not be guaranteed ongoing provision of untimed local calls for data. This means that business users may be forced to accept timed charges for the Internet and other data calls. This decision, which rests with the telecommunications carriers, would add significantly to those costs already faced by small businesses and their consumers and add an unnecessary barrier to access to and availability of the Internet. Fortunately, residential customers, charitable bodies, welfare organisations, et cetera, are guaranteed ongoing provision of untimed local voice and data calls. This means that these customers are able to connect to an ISP in their local call zone for the purpose of accessing the Internet at the cost of an untimed local call.</para><para>Telecommunications carriers, however, are not prohibited from charging ISPs a separate timed levy for receiving calls, known as B-party charging. This opens the way for all customers, including residential customers and charitable bodies or welfare organisations, to be indirectly charged on a timed basis for accessing the Internet. The Democrats oppose this. We do not believe an imposition of this kind of charge is warranted. If ISPs are charged a timed levy for receiving a call to connect to the Internet, they will be forced to pass these additional costs on to their customers, presumably through increased fees. It could also be used by larger telecommunications companies to crush their competitors. The minister for communications has said that the government will not allow B-party charging. This is a decision the Democrats welcome. However, the government has not ruled 
 in legislation that such charges will not be allowed. So what we are looking for now is a legislative guarantee.</para><para>The purpose of the amendments before us, originally circulated and moved by the Australian Democrats, is to preserve the status quo by preventing carriers from charging the receiver of a telephone call where the receiver is the provider of an Internet service and where the call is for the purpose of connecting to the Internet. I consider this, as do my colleagues, a significant issue and worthy of commitment by government and amendment to the Telecommunications Act. We have set out figures demonstrating the rapidly expanding on-line economy and the considerable value of this area to Australia's economy and society. A significant barrier to this on-line economy is the cost of access and this amendment will go a long way towards fixing this.</para><para>I have outlined the rationale behind the amendment. I am sorry that it has to be done so speedily in this environment, when we have another 40-odd amendments being moved by the Australian Democrats, but it highlights what a farce this whole process is.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="metadata">KEMP</name><name role="display">Senator Kemp</name></talker><para>âIt highlights the amount of time the Labor Party has wasted on it.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3I6</name.id><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name></talker><para>âI accept that acinterjection. Certainly, there has been filibustering on both sides. On the one hand, there has been a lot of filibustering from the opposition, which has given undue publicity to the likes of One Nation and has had a good go at the National Partyâwhich is not something that I personally object toâand, on the other hand, from the government there has been a lack of information. And that is the problem. We have an important piece of legislation before us with a mammoth array of amendments and we have no idea what deals have been done. We cannot debate the specifics of what is before is. We cannot debate the specific impact, adverse or otherwise, of the deals that may or may not have been done in any part of Australiaâregional, rural; who knows?âbecause we have no accountability with this legislation.</para></talk.start></continue><para>What the Democrats are aiming for is reasonable debating time on legislation and amendments, and not just in relation to this 
 piece of legislation, because we know we are moving on to two rather important copyright bills after dinner and we have been allocated two hours apiece. It is absolutely ridiculous. I do not know how this chamber can operate as a house of review, a proper house of scrutiny, without allowing adequate time for analysis of government and opposition parties amendments.</para><para>Once again, I reiterate our concern, on behalf of our party and the many members of the community who have been ringing our offices, e-mailing and faxing us today saying, `Why on earth are you here debating this legislation? Why is this being rushed through by the government when you are not even allowed to debate the amendments?' Do you know that Senator Vicki Bourne, our whip, calculated that at this rate the amendments are allowed less than 10 minutes each for debate. We have to do it in the preamble stage of the bill because there will be no other opportunities, as I understand it, available. That is a sham. That is an absolute sham and the Democrats resent it.

I suppose most of us here when we get into this game can take the rough and the tumble and live with it. It gets hurtful occasionally, but you can stand up and it does not worry you. But you started moving onto party officers. People like David Russell, your president and the presidents of the state Liberal and National Party branches give their time because they believe they are doing something for Australia. They do not get paid. They get a lot of flak. They are always in trouble, but they take it on as a community interest. I have had my disagreements with David Russell on many occasions, but I do not want to see those people denigrated in this House. The most thankless job that you could ever ask anyone to do is to be the president of a political party. You are open to all sorts of flak. But to then bring up their names in here under parliamentary privilege and attack their character and ability is stretching things too far.</para></talk.start></continue><para>We could go through your previous leaders one by one and ask how they got $3 million houses. I have been in business all my life, and I ask myself: how on earth can you afford $5 million worth of real estate? How can Mr 
 Keating and Mr Hawke afford it when they have basically been on union salaries all their lives and then parliamentary salaries? But I do not do that sort of thing; I walk away from it. I discourage people that bring in those sorts of rumours because it denigrates this place. It lowers the tone of the place and it says to the people out there, `You know, you really shouldn't trust parliamentarians.' But you have made an open go of it today, and you should be condemned.</para><para>I reiterate: for a party to be relevant, it has to change. It cannot lock itself into the 1950s.

We all had a quarter acre block and lived in beautiful three-bedroom homes with fireplaces, and that was on fairly modest wages. We cannot lock ourselves into that. That is when we had six million people and 180 million sheep. We rode on the sheep's back and the sheep underwrote the Australian economy. Those days are gone; these are different days.</para><para>Then we moved into the Anthony days. He changed with the times. He was a man relevant to the needs of that day, and he was a great leader. So was McEwen and so was Page. They were great leaders, and they took the party forward.

That might have been rightâit probably was rightâin those days, but we cannot lock ourselves in. We have moved forward. Telecommunications are a major requirement.

I am not enjoying this for one minute, but I have to make a decision. I have thought this through, and I have even prayed about it. I have to make a decision whether I take this National Party constituency forwardâtake it into the futureâor say, `I am going to leave the technology where it is at the moment.' There will be only one chanceâprobably never another chance. There is a huge amount of money required to put that latest telecommunication infrastructure out there. This is going to be the only chance to do it. We are going to have to do it. We are going to have to bite the bullet. People cannot live out there without this communication.</para><para>As I said, gone are the days when you sent your cattle down to the local abattoirâor your milk into the local cooperativeâand hoped for the best.

You cannot deny that.</para><para>Some of the people are saying, `Look, we have had Telstra out there, and the service cannot get any worse.' I know that. I cannot see that the service can get any worse than people being without a phone for three weeks or a month.

They do not want to connect only when the sun is up because it is charging and energising the batteries, and it will not work when there is a bit of overcast weather. That is taking your chance.

In view of the fact that the government has gagged the debate and limited it so that many of the amendments proposed by various parties might not get debated before the government guillotines the vote later this afternoon or earlier this evening, I will take briefly an opportunity to mention a couple of the opposition amendments.</para></talk.start><para>First of all, we make it clear that, no matter what amendments are moved to this bill, the bill deserves to be defeated outright on the third reading and should not go through this parliament by the time it finishes sitting today. We make that very clear. No amendment, no matter how good its purpose, will overcome the major deficiency of this bill, which is to privatise Telstra and to do it in a way that means the Prime Ministerâif he can scrape back into office at the next electionâcan privatise Telstra after the next election with no reference back to the parliament after the people have voted. That is what the Prime Minister is up to. No matter how good these amendments are, they will not overcome the evil of this bill.</para><para>I want to reiterate that, in the first week of the election of the Beazley Labor government and the first week of the sitting of that new Beazley Labor government in this place, we will repeal this legislation to make it clear that Telstra will not be further privatised by any government, particularly a Labor government. I also want to point out what the two amendments we put forward in the debate relate to, although I suspect the government will oppose them.</para><para>Firstly, even with a fully privatised Telstra, we believe the power of the minister to direct the board in the national interest must be maintained. Why? Because, for the foreseeable future, Telstra will provide 85 to 90 per cent of the telephone connections in this country for 10 million Australian households. In the bush areas of Australia, it will provide 100 per cent of those. When it is providing 
 that essential service we believe, from time to time, the minister should have and use the power in the national interest. So we will move an amendment to have that power maintained even if, unfortunately, Telstra is fully privatised.</para><para>Our second amendment, because of the near monopoly of Telstra, is to maintain parliamentary scrutiny of this organisation. In the last 12 months the minister, Senator Alston, has written on behalf of Telstra to the Senate Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts Committee, which oversees Telstra, asking that they be excused from attending a number of the hearings of the committee where questions can be asked by senators from any political party about the operation of Telstra. I have to say the response was unanimous; even Liberal senators did not want to give up the right to ask questions of Telstra. So we told Telstra and the minister to go jump. All members of that committeeâLabor, Liberal, Democrat and National Partyâsaid no. Telstra must turn up at parliament, face the music and answer the questions about what they are doing in Australia because of this near monopoly position.</para><para>Telstra and its Chief Executive, Mr Frank Blount, are saying, `Of course, when we are fully privatised, we only have one group of people we are responsible to, and that is our 1Â½ million shareholders'ânot to the 18 million Australian citizens who all rely on Telstra for some form of telecommunications. He does not want public or parliamentary scrutiny because some of the questions that may be asked, even by Senator Boswell from the National Party, may be embarrassing to the performance of Telstra. We believe that those are very important amendments.</para><para>I also want to turn to a couple of things that Senator Harradine has raised. He said that the job losses in Telstra would have occurred irrespective of the privatisation process, because of technological change, et cetera. By the end of this year, 27,000 jobs will have gone from Telstra over the last two years. It is the biggest single downsizing in corporate history in Australiaâ27,000 jobs. No other company or public service has sacked as 
 many workers as Telstra has in the last two years.</para><para>Some of those jobs, I concede, may have gone because of technological change. But the real reason is that this has been driven by the senior management who say, `We want to prove to the financial analysts both in Australia and overseas that, on the measures that show we are a profitable and efficient company, we have the employee ratio per connected telephone line down to the same level as it is in America.' That is the reason why it has taken place. It is so that, when they get down to about 50,000 people rather than 75,000 people, they will be able to say, `We have the same number of employees per telephone line connected as they do in the United States.'</para><para>What they fail to mention is that, in continental Australia, which is the same size as continental America, we have 18 million people whereas they have 268 million people. That is the fundamental difference. That is why you cannot compare Telstra and its operation in Australia with an operation in an American market or a western European market or a Japanese market. Japan has 130 million people in an area a little larger than the size of Victoria. That is why we argue that Telstra is an essential service to all Australians in our vast continent and, in particular, why people outside the major cities have to be treated equally.</para><para>Senator Harradine, that is the reason why the jobs have gone. It is because the management of Telstra want to be able to get a pat on the back from the international analysts, the stockbrokers and the share owners for having the number of employees, on average, down to the same level as an American telecommunications company. We do not think that is going to deliver the service to the bush. That is why, in the last 12 months, there has been on average a 15 per cent decline in the bush in fixing telephones, in connecting telephones and in fixing pay telephones when they break down. It has declined in the first full year of privatisation. You cannot tell the Australian people that full privatisation of the service is going to make it better, because it will not. They will contin 
 ually sack and reduce staff to make the place look more profitable and to improve the bottom line.</para><para>Mr Blount has been honest about this. He says already that they are only concerned about the bottom line and the profit. If that means 27,000 workers lose their jobs, so be it. If that means people in the bush take longer to get a telephone connected, so be it. He is only driven by one thing, and that is the profit. No matter what legislation we try to fix on the side here, it will not work.</para><para>In the end, the only way you and the community can guarantee getting Telstra to do things in the national interest is through this parliament and through the ministerâin this case a weak minister who does not have the guts to tell Telstra anything. That is why Frank Blount today, in the paper, is quoted as saying:</para><para>'You know, this Government has not even said boo to me.'</para><para>What a damning indictment! Yesterday this same minister was in here saying that he was hairy-chested because he told Telstra what to do. He said that they did not like him because he argued with them. Well, Frank Blount has killed him today. He has knocked him right over and said, `He doesn't even say boo to me.' What a weak, spineless minister, when this organisation has to provide communications to all Australians no matter where they live.</para><para>Senator Boswell has been in here complaining that we have been unfair on him and the National Party in claiming that they have sold out the bush on the deal. He is not the only one. Senator Harradine and Senator Colston have done it, as my other colleagues have said. It was astonishing last night to see Senator Colston come into this place. He had apparently been away to Brisbane to meet the Prime Minister. He came in here through the back door and slowly walked around and got to his seat. He was there for a few seconds and then went out that door. He was in the place for about two minutes. Why did he do that trick? He wanted to claim the $145 per night TA to come back to Canberra. That is the reason; there can be no other.</para><para>Senator Colston did not speak, and I do not believe he voted. He went to Brisbane to see the Prime Minister. No wonder politicians get a poor reputation when that sort of attitude exists. Senator Colston voted for the parliament to sit all day yesterdayâhe voted for us to sit hereâbut he was not here himself because he went to see the Prime Minister. He then came back just in time to claim the TA.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>6H4</name.id><name role="metadata">HARRADINE</name><name role="display">Senator Harradine</name></talker><para>âMr Temporary Chairman, I raise a point of order.

Senator Boswell has come in here three times today defending the National Party deal. Each time he has come in, he has become weaker and weaker and more embarrassed and self-humiliated. I cannot recollect any other National Party senatorâI may be wrongâall during today jumping up and speaking. They may have been gagged or they may be too embarrassed to speak et cetera. Senator Boswell then claimed great credit for an amendment circulated in his name. He said, `Senator Schacht, yesterday you said that we did not lock up the new arrangements for 
 lower call charges in the outback areas in extended zones et cetera.' He said, `As a result of what you have raised, I saw Senator Alston, the Minister for Communications, and he has agreed to an amendment, which has been circulated.'</para><para>That is the whole point. Yesterday we examined the deal over the new call charge rates for outlying areas in the outback. If I could point out that there was a fundamental flaw in the deal and Senator Boswell could not point out the weakness in his own deal in the previous three weeks of negotiations with the Prime Minister, for goodness sake, what else have they given away in the deal they have not yet announced? This is extraordinary.</para><para>The amendment on this piece of white paper is the final death notice of the National Party. It shows that they cannot negotiate. They have to rely on us in opposition reading the bill in a matter of a few seconds to point out the error, the gap, the obvious. Senator Boswell was listening to me, and I could see him starting to frown. He got up, went around and spoke to Senator Alston with a worried look on his face. He clearly knew that we had hit pay dirt and that he had not locked up the deal. Now they are scrambling to get the deal locked up and to make an amendment on that part of the deal.</para><para>I again point out to Senator Boswell that the only thing he has so far announced is $150 million expenditure over the next two or three years for capital works in the bush. Telstra spends $800 million each year every year on capital works in the bush, and even with all that there is a deficiency. So $150 million extra over the next two or three years will not make much difference.</para><para>To get $150 million, Senator Boswell has put his hand up to sell a company worth $40 billion that is paying a dividend of $1.5 to $2 billion per year every year to all Australians by way of revenue. What an extraordinary deal. I hope his accountant can do his taxes better than this. How could you sell a company worth $40 billion that already provides up to nearly $2 billion in dividends to get in return a one-off $150 million payment in three or four years? That deal could have 
 been fixed by changing the community service obligation to provide a charge on all the carriers.</para><para>Telstra laughed, took the money and said, `Thank you very much.' That is our complaint. If that is the negotiating ability of the National Party, no wonder it is being chopped apart out in the bush. That is why we have said that today is the day in which the National Party died across Australia. The one thing the bush wants is to keep Telstra in public ownership to provide the ongoing delivery of goods to them.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>EU4</name.id><name role="metadata">O'CHEE</name><name role="display">Senator O'Chee</name></talker><para>âYour socialist principles never let you understand.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>4J4</name.id><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator SCHACHT</name></talker><para>âSenator O'Chee is the man who said that if One Nation won one seat in the Queensland election he would walk backwards from Brisbane to the Gold Coast.

It reads:</para></talk.start></continue><para>While its services are very capital intensive, the companies involved, particularly Telstra, are significant employers. As the industry becomes more capital intensive through the elimination of manual exchanges and reduced dependence on traditional copper wire infrastructure, it is to be expected that employment growth will ease and/or actually decline. There has been easing off in Telstra's employment growth since 1996 in response to deregulation to the extent that Telstra has lost market share in the long distance markets. It is too early to say what impact privatisation has had on Telstra employment, but the predominant influences on Telstra employment have been the 
 impact of deregulation and the labour shedding effects of technological change.</para><para>As I indicated before, deregulation was, rightly or wrongly, a policy of the Labor Party and of the current government. I want to advert again to a point I made previously, which is a point that was also made by Senator Stott Despoja and by the CEPU, and that is the effect that the workplace relations legislation is having on employment.

I say this as a person who comes from a remote area. Not so long ago I had to pay $8,000 to get a telephone line to my place, and I know that the technology we will need out in the bush will come from the skies. Unless Telstra gets the capital base to finance that, it will be forced out of the competition stakes, and you people have to realise that. The people out in the bush put a lot of capital into what they do, and they realise that Telstra needs a capital base and they need satellites circling around to send us down the signals for digital faxes and all the  other things that are required if they are going to get the same technology as you get in the city. They need technology that will not be interfered with by electric fences. How many people on the other side of the chamber have heard of an electric fence? Not very many of you. How many of you know the devastation they cause when you put in telecommunications equipment? You would not have a clue. You do not understand the situation.</para><para>I am going to try to explain a couple of things, to people listening here and to people in the gallery, as to why telecommunications has to be advanced, and I speak, as I have already said, as someone who comes from a rural area.

You should listen to a little bit about the phasing out of analog and their performance. Mr Beazley, the current leader, was minister for communications and he never had a clue.

You got into your car at Esperance, pressed the button and away it went beautifully. But, all of a sudden, when you came to the top of a hill and started driving down, you could not hear anymore. You would be talking away and all of a sudden your phone would go, `Brp, brp, brp,' and you would not hear anymore. So you would drive down the hill and come up again, pressing the button all the time and, bingo, on it comes again.

Unlike the people on the other side of the chamberâwho have rabbited on all day about regional and remote Australia but who generally come from electorates deep in the heart of metropolitan cities and would not know anything about remote and regional AustraliaâI do know something about remote and regional Australia because I come from the north-west of Western Australia, which is not only regional but also remote and the distances are very, very big.</para></talk.start><para>I know what people in these areas think about the proposed sale of Telstra, and I can say here to the chamber and to the people of Australia listening on the broadcast that people in remote areas support the sale of Telstra because they know that the sale of Telstra is going to bring better and improved telecommunications services and it is going to bring them the benefits of competition. People in regional and remote areas feel that they have been let down, particularly by the previous government in terms of the technology provided to them for telecommunications. This government is certainly going a long way towards improving the level of services provided to remote areas.</para><para>A few weeks ago, I attended the Kalgoorlie central conference of the Liberal Party in Exmouth, where there was a very long debate about the need for improved telecommunica 
 tions services in the regions of Australia. People in regional Australia want access to fax. They want to join the modern world and have fast fax. They want to be able to access the Internet and all that has to offer. There is no doubt that this sale of Telstra is going to bring them those sorts of services through improved communications. It was the Labor Party which proposed to leave them back in the Dark Ages, a little better than the days of pedal wireless, because none of those services are there at the moment and all of those deficiencies can be sheeted back to the record of the Keating government.</para><para>One of the questions that has been constantly asked today by those on the other side is, `Why sell Telstra?' The answer to that is that we no longer have governments around the world owning telecommunications companies. As Senator Boswell quite clearly pointed out for the information of the Labor Party senators here today, the only country in the world which owns its national telecommunications service today is North Korea. North Korea would have to be one of the most backward and least developed of all the Third World countries of the world. From the amount of fuss that has been made on the other side today about the proposal to sell Telstra, it would seem logical to conclude that the ALP would like to keep Australia back to the standard of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, with their probable pedal wireless level technology.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>N26</name.id><name role="metadata">ABETZ</name><name role="display">Senator Abetz</name></talker><para>âEven Fidel Castro has got one.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>4L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Eggleston, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">Senator EGGLESTON</name></talker><para>âEven Fidel Castro, as Senator Abetz said, has got a privatised telecommunications company.

This jokeâthe customer service guaranteeâmeans that every person in Australia using a telephone from Telstra or any other telecommunications company will be protected by a customer service guarantee which will ensure that the level of services provided to all Australians will not be affected by any further increase in private ownership of Telstra or by the fact that any other communications service is privately owned. The government is, in other words, setting a level of service as a minimum which must be provided to people all over this country. If the level of service provided does fall below the legislated standard in any area, including the most remote areas of the Kimberley, since Senator Schacht has referred to them, customers will be eligible for compensation from the telecommunications carrier. The coalition government recently introduced legislation into the federal parliament which is aimed to strengthen that customer service guarantee.</para></talk.start></continue><para>This means that the Australian Communications Authority will be able to enforce customer service performance standards and fine companies up to $10 million for breaches of those standards. There are not going to be, I would suspect, too many breaches when a few $10 million fines are thrown around. One could almost predict with 100 per cent certainty that, after the first $10 million fine or anything like it is imposed on a telecommunications company, the companies concerned will honour the customer service guarantee. The fines are so heavy, the penalties are so 
 great and the bad publicity which will flow from having such a fine imposed on them will be so bad for the company's business that they will ensure that in future the customer service guarantees are met.</para><para>Some people have asked today what the benefits of the privatisation of Telstra will be. The first was mentioned the other day when Mr Tim Fischer, the Deputy Prime Minister, announced that there would be untimed local calls in what used to be called the pastoral zone, which meant that areas in remote Australia between stations and small towns would no longer have to pay for timed calls to call each other, but would enjoy the same benefits enjoyed by people in the cities. Even though the areas between these stations and small communities are very large, they would have untimed local calls as people do in the cities. That is a major benefit and it is the first one of several which will be announced in coming days and weeks about the benefits to regional Australia of the sale of Telstra.</para><para>Also announced was that the cost of a call from these remote communities to a regional service centre would be reduced by more than 60 per cent. That means that calls to remote towns from pastoral stations, roadhouses, mining camps and such will be now at a new preferential or standard rate of 25c for 12 minutes. That means that these people will now be able to call in a doctor, contact the police or some other essential service, or just order groceries from a supermarket at a very low rate. That affects some 37,000 households and farming families all over Australia, a major benefitâand that will only happen with the sale of Telstra. It is one of the first benefits which will flow from the sale of Telstra and will mean that the government will allocate $150 million to enable this service to occur.</para><para>Senator Crane has referred to the absolutely disgusting event which occurred a few years ago when the Keating government decided to phase out analog phones, which was an enormous disadvantage to the people of regional Australia. Again this week, the federal government has announced a plan to get around the legally binding agreement which the Keating government made with 
 total disregard to the interests of people in regional Australia to phase out analog and just have digital services in this country. The federal government will sponsor through Telstra the establishment of a new mobile phone service altogether, which will mean that people in remote, regional and country Australia in general will have the benefit of being able to continue to use analog phone services with their broader coverage.</para><para>Finally, the general benefit of the sale of Telstra will be that the government of Australia will be able to reduce the debt of this nation by some 40 per cent. After 13 years of a federal Labor government, Australians were left with the legacy of a Commonwealth government debt of some $96 billion. That is a measure of the total financial irresponsibility which the previous Labor government exercised while they held the reins of power in this country. The most compelling reason for the sale of Telstra is to reduce that debt, which will be of enormous benefit to the people of Australia. One does not need to hear any more or any other reason beyond that to justify the full sale of Telstra in the national interests of this country.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>5671</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âEarlier when I was sitting here I sent a pleading note to the chair.

It says:</para><para>Telstra's Chair, and the majority of Telstra's directors, will be Australian citizens.</para><para>When a company moves out of public hands into private hands, effectively control goes into the hands of its senior management and its board. As we have remarked several times in this debate, and as other senators who are contributing to the debate have remarked, this is going to be a very powerful corporate beast, twice the size of the next largest Australian company. In that sense, you have to be particularly careful about the powers and ability of that board to deal with matters of its corporate responsibilities appropriately.</para><para>In relation to that element in the preamble, I will be moving circulated amendment 1105, which refers to the issues of corporate governance, and which envisages a corporate governance board. As senators would know, this is not a new idea. Some companies in Australia do have such boards, although senators would be aware that the Corporations Law itself does not refer to boards; it just refers to directors. The concept of a corporate governance board is between a body that conducts the normal operational and managerial functions of a main board and another board which deals with accountability issues.</para><para>This may seem a somewhat dry topic, but when we are talking about how a company of that size will be managed and how it is going to disburse its power and moneys, we have to realise that we have to be sure that the directors are governed by the company constitution under the most accountable and democratic system possible.</para><para>Company directors have extensive powers regarding the management of a company's business and internal organisation. Some of those internal management powers which may be termed corporate governance powers include the following. Envisage the average board as having a majority of executive directors and a minority of non-executive directors. This is what those people with a material interest in the matters at hand can determine. This is what the Telstra board members can determine. They can decide their own remuneration. So those members of 
 the managerial class and directors class sit around that board and decide how much they are going to be paid. I bet some workers would like to have that same ability. They can appoint and remunerate auditors and other experts. But the auditors are the people who are supposed to be making sure they are accountable. So they can appoint the people who are supposed to be their own watchdogs. What happens if the auditors fail? So there is a direct conflict of interest there.</para><para>Those directors can adopt any accounting practices they see fit within accepted accounting standards. Those directors can nominate themselves for re-election. It is like us all being able to fix up our own pre-selections. I think there may be one or two who can, but most of us cannot. They can appoint casual vacancies for directors, so they can perpetuate themselves. They can initiate changes in the corporate constitution. They can control the conduct of shareholders' meetings and voting procedures.</para><para>In instances where the interests of the shareholders do not coincide with the interests of the directors and the management of the company, the directors of the main board, having those powers, can make decisions which may lead to some very serious conflicts of interest.</para><para>Directors also possess the power to manage conflicts of interest with related parties. Shann Turnbull, who is somewhat of an expert in this area, in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> on 14 November 1996, in an article entitled `Dictatorship of the boardroom', stated:</para><para>Many of our largest companies have directors who represent shareholders with related party trading interests. Examples are Arnotts, Cadbury Schweppes, Caltex, Coca-Cola Amatil, Coles-Myer and Qantas to name a few.</para><para>Existing practices concentrate powers with directors and provide them with absolute power to manage their own conflicts of self-interest and it can result in corruption and corruption of their duties.</para><para>I am not suggesting that the Telstra board as it is presently constituted is of that kind, but I am saying it is going to be given extraordinary powers. The fact that the members are Australian citizens is going to be a great 
 advantage, but the fact that this board is not constrained sufficiently is to the detriment of the proposed new operation.</para><para>A sure way to increase the independence and accountability of a company is therefore to have two boards, one concerned with managerial and operational issuesâwhich is the main boardâand one solely concerned with governance issues. The former should quite properly continue to have directors elected relative to shareholdings. That means those people with a financial weight have it reflected on the main board, but to protect minorities, minimise conflict of interest issues, avoid board capture and ensure accountability the corporate governance board should be elected by shareholdersâin other words, by the shareholders en masse as opposed to those who have the most shares.</para><para>I am talking here of two classes of board, one having the main power and comprising the directors who are elected relative to shareholdingsâso there might be a few very large shareholders controlling the board, as they do at presentâand the other being the governance board, the accountability board, elected by shareholders. We believe that that creation, which has been developed in other countries and is already in practice in a number of companies in this country and worldwide, will result in a favourable creative tension within the company and will enable the boards to resolve very difficult issues of conflict of interest.</para><para>In listed companies such as Telstra, a separate board should exercise these internal governance powers, leaving the main board directors to concentrate on the management of the company's business operations while the second board would provide the valuable introduction of a system of checks and balances into corporate governance proceduresâa separation of powers, in other words. This proposal has the added virtue of introducing a greater measure of self-regulation. The Australian Democrats believe this is a much less costly method of arriving at a remedy for conflict of interest or any issue of malfeasance.</para><para>The proposal we are putting here is a proactive one designed to prevent problems. 
 There are those who argue that the stock market is the proper arbiter of these things, but the stock market acts after the event and if things are going wrong in the company it means the shares will decline in value and the shareholders are therefore punished because there is not an appropriate constitutional mechanism to prevent these matters.</para><para>Independent directors, as presently constituted, are often anything but. If not recommended in the first place by the other directors in the control group that they are supposed to be independent of, they can be subject to board capture anyway unless, as is fortunately sometimes the case, they are exceptional individuals.</para><para>The corporate governance board proposal will both simplify and reduce the role, responsibilities and workload of Telstra's main board directors as well as increase their credibility by removing the powers which permit the perception or actuality of a conflict of interest. This should thereby improve the accountability of directors and the internal governance of companies and lead to better business management decisions by directors. Ultimately, this re-establishes the balance of company governance in favour of shareholders rather than management.</para><para>When we look at that preamble and those sections on page 2 we should refer to the powers and functions of Telstra's corporate governance board that I have itemised at 7D on my sheet 1105. The functions of the corporate governance board would be: to determine the remuneration of company directors; to appoint auditors and determine their remuneration; to review the appointment, remuneration and functions of independent agents, such as valuers, who provide material information to shareholders; to appoint persons to fill casual vacancies of directors; to determine whether amendments should be made to the company's constitution, whether at the request of the company's directors or on the board's own initiative; to decide issues of conflict of interest on the part of the company's directors and determine how those conflicts will be managed; and to control the conduct of general meetings and determine voting procedures. That list of functions 
 would deal with the major accountability issues which main boards at present find conflict with their own duties in the management and organisation of the company.</para><para>It is essential in our view that the separate governance board be elected on the democratic basis of one vote per shareholder than one vote per share. We have gone on in that amendment, which we hoped we will get to when this preamble is finally dealt with, to express how the preferential election of directors and the annual election of directors can enhance the power of shareholders. My great fear, as reflected in this preambleâand I doubt it is from a lack of willingness; I suspect it is from a lack of foresight and a lack of understandingâis that the government is going to end up giving too much power to a few individuals who will then distort the operation of this company and it will not work even as a company owned by shareholders in the full interest of all Australians.</para><para>I should point out that the Australian Democrats wish to also indicate with regard to the preamble that there are a number of areas which we have hoped that our amendments would deal with if this committee gets to them. Those amendments include maintaining the ministerial power to direct Telstra and to request reports. In terms of what I have been saying, it is important that there is an outside authority capable of doing that. We also wish to include in Telstra's universal service obligations low cost access of untimed calls to the Internet. Senator Stott Despoja spoke about that earlier.</para><para>We wish to strengthen the universal service obligations on Telstra's definition of standard telephone service to include high speed digital services. We wish to increase the powers of the Australian Telecommunications Authority to review and upgrade the universal service obligations and customer service guarantee to include new telecommunications services as they come online. We wish to extend the option of untimed local calls to a wider category of metropolitan and rural customers than that which is presently offered by the government. We wish to provide for civil damages as well as pecuniary penalties 
 against Telstra for breaches of performance standards.</para><para>The Australian Democrats have accepted that the numbers are against them on this bill. We have been utterly opposed to the privatisation of assets in this country over many yearsâtwo decades, in factâand we continue to be opposed to the privatisation of Telstra. But if the numbers are against us, this committee should endeavour through amendments to at least make the new Telstra capable of serving Australia as well as possible. It is in that regard that we would like the committee to please give due attention to our amendments. They are the bulk of the amendments before you. It is obviously your privilege and ability to either agree or disagree with them, but they certainly should be heard.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:25:00</time.stamp><page.no>5674</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI want to deal with the matters that Senator Murray has raised in this debate on the preamble.

I am a little bit perplexed as to why, when the Senate had agreed and I think you had agreed, matters such as the corporate governance board conceptâvery much something that has been promoted by my friend Shann Turnbullâand some of these other corporate governance concepts would be referred to the Joint Statu

Commentators in the United States of America tend to look to Australia in relation to corporate governance structures at board level. We lead the world in the appointment of non-executive directors to boards. We lead the world in the percentage of our public companies that have non-executive chairmen. We lead the world in many respects even on matters such as directors' remuneration. We were one of the first countries to require in our law disclosure of directors' remuneration. So I do get a little bit frustrated when people in Australia start saying that we are behind the eight ball when almost all international commentators say we are ahead of the game when it comes to corporate governance.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The government has referred, I think, each one of these issues to the joint statutory committee not only from the floor of this chamber but in a letter from the Treasurer (Mr Costello), which certainly has gone or is about to go, to the chairman of that committee making a quite specific reference of these matters to the committee.</para><para>I think the point that needs to be made in response to the interjection from Senator Murray was that Telstra is a special case. I think it is fair to say it is a majority public owned company at the moment. It is one-third owned by private shareholders. Senator Murray, if you listened to his last intervention as well as his interjection, would say it is a special company because it needs to serve all 
 the Australian community, its customers and it also obviously has a Corporations Law duty and fiduciary duty to its shareholder. It has to do both. I think Senator Murray and I would both understand that, if it does not serve its customers, it will not be serving its shareholders either. There is a nexus between the two. You have to ensure that in both the Corporations Law and in this privatisation bill you seek to do that properly.</para><para>The question I would askâand I think it is a very important questionâis: is it appropriate to try what is, without being flippant and without treating it lightly, a corporate governance experiment on what will be one of Australia's top two or three companies? Would you try what is effectively an experiment that will not be applied to any other top 500 company in Australia? Or would you proceed down the sensible public policy path which we have proposed and look at these proposals for what is a significant, if not radical, reform to the legislation on corporate governance in Australia, and that is to have the joint statutory committee receive public evidence from expertsâeven from directors of companies like Telstraâon relevant structures?</para><para>My own view, and the government's view, is that a corporate governance board tends to dissipate the responsibility of the board to its shareholders. The government believes that the proposal to have two boards reduces the responsibility of the members of the board to their shareholders. We believe that, if you want a dynamic corporate governance culture in Australia, directors of companies like Telstra need to be concerned about corporate governance and not be able to say, `That is the corporate governance board's role. They are the corporate governance people and we are the managers. We are going to get on with the hard job of managing.'</para><para>If you want good corporate governance, you need each director of every Australian companyâbe it Telstra, which serve such a massive majority of Australian customers, public listed companies or small private companies which have to fight in a far more competitive environmentâto understand what corporate governance should be about. They 
 need to understand how the dynamics of corporate governance should be there to improve the way companies are governed, to improve outputs and to improve information flows to shareholders. Corporate governance should not be something about which we say, `Let's put it in a box and give it to this other group.'</para><para>I believeâand it has been reinforced by independent international commentators on company structures in Australia, including the recent OECD report and the Russell Reynolds report, which I quoted from in a previous debateâthat Australia has led the world in setting up corporate governance committees, which are subcommittees of boards as Senator Murray would know, and having independent directors and independent chairmen. I have enormous respect for Shann Turnbull, who promotes these ideas, and I know Senator Murray has taken a close personal interest in Shann's ideas and is developing those ideas himself. They do deserve further expert consideration, because if we can improve corporate governance, through changes to voting structures and board structures we will be the first ones to applaud it. But I do not want to have a corporate governance experiment with a company the size of Telstra. I would rather have expert consideration of these proposals and, if they are good proposals, apply them to all of our public companies for the benefit of all Australian citizens.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>5675</page.no><name role="metadata">Crane, Sen Winston</name><name role="display">Senator CRANE</name><name.id>UW4</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI need to make a declaration.

I deliberately do not involve myself with the investments of my family, and I was therefore not aware of this until I 
 was kindly advised by the opposition yesterday.</para></talk.start><para>Third, as I was unable to be present for the second reading debate, I shall make some comments now during the committee stage. There are several matters relating to this bill which are of some concern to me. One of my concerns is the standard of telecommunications services in Queensland, especially in rural and regional areas. I am also concerned about stable employment opportunities for Telstra workers.</para><para>At the time of the one-third sale, I was given assurances by the government and the Chief Executive Officer of Telstra about the employment levels of Telstra staff in certain areas of Queensland. Figures given to me recently indicate that these assurances have not been fulfilled. Indeed, an examination of the figures for 013 and similar operators in nine regional centres in Queensland shows an overall decline of some 12 per cent of the full-time staff. In other areas, figures from the Community and Public Sector Union indicate that, between March 1997 and March this year, 1,313 Telstra staff lost their jobs in Queensland. About half of these came from the commercial and consumer area, that part of Telstra responsible for looking after the needs of residential and small business customers.</para><para>During the debate in December 1996, I accepted the assurances given to me, but with some qualification. Indeed, I indicated then, and I will quote from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>:</para><para>. . . if assurances following negotiations are not kept, future negotiations would be of no avail.</para><para>I was conscious of this statement as I examined this legislation and, indeed, conscious of it as I reviewed disappointing staff levels.</para><para>Over recent years, the Telstra work force has been required to endure endless uncertainty and insecurity. Indeed, in some respects, the work force has been treated abominably. But we are talking about much more than mere statistics when we examine staff reductions and redeployments. Beyond statistics and beyond the fact that assurances have not been kept, we are talking about actual people and their families. I remind Telstra management of the impact its actions have had on the 
 staff. It appears that management has acted with little realisation that Telstra could not operate without its highly skilled, competent and conscientious workers.</para><para>Many staff members have not been treated well and, if morale is low, the atmosphere created by management means that morale must be at less than an optimal level. We hear Telstra consumers complain of falling service standards. While the impact on front-line service is far from quantifiable, surely the lack of high morale partially contributes to these falling standards. Many customers are quick to accuse the staff, but perhaps we need to reflect that the cause is far deeper. Telstra management needs to examine this issue. It needs to cooperate with its work force.</para><para>We need to reverse the now almost invisible social costs that have resulted since partial privatisation. We need to look at people, not numbers. The impact of staff cutbacks on small rural communities is enormous and goes beyond the telecommunications industry. It impacts on all levels of the community from the corner shop to the local schools.</para><para>In 1996 I was prepared to support the one-third privatisation of Telstra because it left two-thirds of Telstra in the hands of the government, but it is a quantum leap to move from one-third to 100 per cent privatisation. We are told that, through the government, we as Australians could realise some $50 billion as a result of complete privatisation. But what then? What could we do if we sold Telstra and then discovered that it was not the best course of action after all? There would be no remedying this situation. Our hands would be tied.</para><para>There has been the suggestion that many billions of dollars from the sale could go towards expanding networks in rural areas. Of course, if this occurred, it would be of immense value to those who deserve the same quality of service as those who live in urban areas. But there is some concern from regional areas that such an upgrade would be a one-off effort to placate growing regional disquiet. And, while the funds might be available in the short term, what of the medium- to long-term future of the telecommunications indus 
 try? What would happen to upgrading regional services in 20 or 30 years time? Indeed, given the rapid development of the telecommunication industry, who can judge what the medium-  to long-term will mean? Within a decade, will today's state-of-the-art technology be the equivalent of a piece of string between two tin cans?</para><para>At this stage, and without the benefit of a crystal ball, a continuing government interest in Telstra can provide some reassurance for regional customers that their long-term service requirements can be maintained. We can so easily forget that Australia, beyond the urban fringe, is an expansive land and provision of high-class telecommunication services is essential.</para><para>As I considered my list of concerns, I regretted that there has not been sufficient time to negotiate and debate the ramifications of the full sale of Telstra. Indeed, that was evident in the insupportably limited time given to a Senate committee which was examining the matter. We seem to be pushing this passage to a timetable which, given the importance of the issues at hand, can scarcely be justified. For example, only next month, we expect to have handed down in this place the report on community service obligations. Surely it is incumbent upon us as senators to examine the ramifications of the sale of Telstra in the light of this report.</para><para>In the context of my deliberations, I willingly acknowledge the extensive assistance provided by Senator Alston and his staff. The minister and his staff have been particularly helpful, but given the time available it has not been possible to arrive at an acceptable understanding of the effects of full privatisation.</para><para>It is possible that my vote on this bill will be decisive. On an important issue such as this, it is not an enviable position, but I am not going to abrogate my responsibility to arrive at a definite conclusion about how my vote should be cast. While it is incumbent upon each senator to examine the ramifications of the bill, so it is with me personally that I should weigh up all matters very carefully. Should I vote with the government, or even abstain, the bill will probably be passed. Should I vote against the bill, it will probably 
 not proceed. This is perhaps an obvious statement of fact for most in this chamber, but one with far more gravity when such a key vote is one's own.</para><para>On balance, I find at this stage I am unable to support the bill and thus will be voting against it. Overall, there remain too many question marks over services and employment, but particularly in regional Queensland. The potential ramifications of this bill, its impact on people and the social costs which may be involved deserve to be examined in a context not driven by political or electoral timetables. For us to do otherwise would be to short-change our future for short-term political gains.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>5677</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI would like to respond to the comments of Senator Colston. I think he appreciates above all else that his vote in this respect is critical and that there have been a number of matters of concern which have been raised with us by a number of senators which the government has at all times done its best to address. We believe that the bill does contain more than sufficient ongoing protections but, most importantly, that there is separate legislation, the Telecommunications Act, which looks after the interests of customers and consumers in a way that is unparalleled in any other country.</para></talk.start><para>As far as the work force of Telstra is concerned, one can understand that if you are a Telstra employee you may be very comfortable in that position. But, in this day and age, no company can offer lifetime employment. Certainly, a company involved in the telecommunications arena knows that, unless it performs, it goes backwards. Indeed, when it is 30 per cent off world's best practice, it ultimately has to shape up or it will find that its competitors are simply eating up its market share.</para><para>It is therefore very disappointing that these concerns have not been reflected in Senator Colston's remarks. As Senator Harradine and the government have pointed out on a number of occasions, Telstra has been shedding staff now for several years. It is not a function of privatisation; it is a function of open markets, 
 which were deregulated as long ago as 1991 by the Labor government. Privatisation will not stem continuing moves to derive efficiencies from telecommunications services. It will not provide employment in the bush if there is not a demand for it. It is not possible, in this day and age, for anyone to tell Telstra how to run its business. To think that Labor is still arguing that it effectively wants to exercise a power of direction to tell Telstra what to do and how to do it simply defies the whole notion of commercial activity. There are, of course, ways in which an efficient Telstra can maximise its performance and in that way generate greater volumes of business. To the extent that there is higher demand, there is a greater level of need to service that demand.</para><para>What is critically important is that it is a matter of great regret to the government that the concerns that Senator Colston has now expressed, particularly in relation to what he sees as Telstra non-compliance, were not matters that he brought to the attention of the government over recent weeks. There has been every opportunity to have had exhaustive discussions on these matters. We have, at all times, been more than willing to learn of concerns and to do our best to address them to the extent that they involve policy matters within the control of the government or, if they are matters within the control of Telstra, refer them to the company. At all times, we were prepared to do that.</para><para>If I had thought that Senator Colston had the view that Telstra was in breach of undertakings, I certainly would have referred that matter to Telstra.

If Senator Colston is of the view that those undertakings were breached, we would have expected that he would have brought that matter to our attention. We would then have raised it with Telstra. There was nothing to stop Senator Colston from addressing those matters direct with Telstra. Certainly, to the extent that Senator Colston does have concerns that can be addressed over the next couple of hours, we would still be prepared to look at those because we have never ignored concerns that have been brought to our attention that have merit. If Senator Colston, even at this late hour, is indicating that there are matters within the control of Telstra that require attention or that there are undertakings that have not been met, I would certainly be more than willing to revisit those issues.</para></talk.start></continue><para>It makes it very difficult if the first time we learn about them is now. If there are specific matters of concern, the government has always stood willing to address them. We do not want to see anyone welshing on undertakings. We certainly do not want to see anyone impact it adversely if it is within the control of government or within the control of the corporation. There are a number of matters that have been raised that clearly have to be seen in a macro-economic context, in a deregulation context and in a competition context.</para><para>If Senator Colston is still prepared to have those matters discussed and addressed and to take them into account when it does come to a vote on these issues, the government would be more than willing to pursue that path. If not, it is a matter of great regret to us that we are not in a position, at this very late hour, to give attention to matters which could have been raised over a matter of weeks and certainly in recent days.

 shortcomings in the government's argument are ones that have been cogently put here over the last two days. If the government has not been able to answer them, it has nobody but itself to blame. The fact is that there is enormous concern about the privatisation of Telstra and the inability of government to look after consumers throughout this country, not just in the bush, as well as the shedding of jobs which Senator Colston nailed as being one of the particular concerns he has.</para></talk.start><para>They are real concerns and I do not see how the government can possibly think it is going to deal with issues of that magnitude in the next two hours.

Whatever else, Senator Colston has stood where most Australians stand on this issue, where the opposition stands on this issue, and where the Democrats and the Greens stand on this issue.

This amendment seeks to modify the proclamation date for this legislation so that it takes account of what happens at the election. In other words, it goes out to July next year and it needs a vote of both the Senate and the House of Representatives, 
 which is in line with the constitution.

It quite rightly reflects the fact that if we are going to see whether there is any agreement within the community the parliament is the means by which that can be decided. In July of next year we will have the make-up of the new parliament rather than the old, and I think that is a very important aspect and an improvement. I indicate that I will support the Democrats' amendment. Of course, if that is defeated, I will hope they support mine as the next best amendment. The reality is, I believe, that it is better than the one proposed by Senator Harradine, which would indicate that the most important aspect 
 of the timing is that it be done while the Senate is still in its current situation. I do not really think that that is necessarily giving us the means of listening to the people and a reflection of what the electorate is saying. That is what the government is saying, that it is going to the election to hear the people. Quite clearly, it might be able to close its ears altogether and still abide by what is in Senator Harradine's amendment.</para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>5680</page.no><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator SCHACHT</name><name.id>4J4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe opposition supports the Democrats' amendment. It is clearly much superior to the amendment moved by Senator Harradine in that it would be a vote of the parliament elected at the next electionâit would be half a new Senate and a full new House of Representatives deciding the issue. Senator Harradine's amendment, which is better than the government's position, but only marginally so, says that the government gets two months to proclaim it. If it does not proclaim it within two months, it automatically lapses. It means that a minority government in the House of Representativesâand there is quite a possibility in the present political circumstances of Australia that you could have a minority Howard government, with One Nation members replacing National Party members on the crossbenchesâ</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>AW5</name.id><name role="metadata">CARR</name><name role="display">Senator Carr</name></talker><para>âIt's odds on.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>4J4</name.id><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator SCHACHT</name></talker><para>âI think that is clearly odds onâstill, without an absolute majority vote of the House of Representatives, hanging on to a negotiated minority government position for at least a month before the parliament meets. Even before the new parliament with a minority government met, it could then proclaim the bill. I have to say that that may bring people into the streets in Australia for the first time in a long time. It would be a shameful thing if that is the loophole that Senator Harradine's amendment still allows. It is not as bad as the government position completely allows. But the Democrats' amendment says, `You can't do it until you get a vote of both houses.' As the new Senate, whenever the election is held, will not come in and take their seats until 1 July next year, that means that if the Howard government is elected as a minority or a majority it 
 then has to seek a vote of both houses, with an up-to-date elected parliament.

That, of course, means that a bill is proclaimed when the government of the day chooses to submit it for royal assent. As we know, sometimes bills are dealt with very expeditiously after they pass through the parliament. There might be very good reasons why other legislation might not be seen as so important. There might be timing issues, even 
 in relation to the legislation itself. There may be different start-up dates. In other words, the government of the day has been authorised by the parliament to act on a decision of both houses. In other words, once you have got to the point where you have the parliament endorsing the legislation, it is then the government's call.

I think there has been a recent experience in this chamber which has probably been considered in detail by one of the Senate standing committees, which has identified that there is a need to cleanse the statute books of legislation that is effectively languishingâeven though passed by both houses of parliamentâby not in fact having been proclaimed.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>4J4</name.id><name role="metadata">SCHACHT</name><name role="display">Senator Schacht</name></talker><para>âWhy did you propose the legislation in its present form?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>LD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name></talker><para>âI am in the process of explaining that. There is nothing untoward about leaving it to the discretion of the government, because the fact that the parliament has passed a bill then enables the government to make a decision at any time that suits it, unless that power is limited in some way. You are seeking, of course, to impose the ultimate limitation, which I will come to in a moment. In the normal course of events, either you have an open-ended capacity to have the bill proclaimed or, as Senator Harradine would propose, you put a time limit on that, and then it is a question of what is a reasonable period of time to allow.</para></talk.start></continue><para>There may be certain circumstances in relation to a particular piece of legislation that would warrant having a very tight time limit. I could understand someone saying six months would be a reasonable period. In this instance, because of the particular circumstances, Senator Harradine's proposition is that it ought to be acted on expeditiously or it ought to lapse and, therefore, a period of two months is a reasonable time.</para><para>In these circumstances, I would not quarrel with that, but I would quarrel with the notion that you can make proclamations subject to a resolution by both houses of parliament. Let us just say that this legislation passed through the parliament, that you had a double dissolution and you had an immediate change in the constitution of the Senate and that Senate was then asked to consider the matter all over again. In other words, you would be asking the government of the day to run the gauntlet of a differently structured house of parliament from the one that actually passed the bill and to run the very real risk that that second body might say no. That is an extraordinary proposition, because otherwise there is no point in legislation being passed by the parliament.</para><para>It may be a different matter in relation to delegated or subordinate legislation where we have disallowable instruments, where the legislation empowers the government to introduce regulations which can be considered and, in some circumstances, disallowed by either or both houses of parliament. But that is subordinate to the legislation itself. The notion that the legislation can be passed by both houses of parliament in good faith and then find that a differently constituted Senate or, indeed, House of Representatives could say that it did not favour the very legislation that had just been passed by the parliament is making a farce of the normal procedures and, indeed, all of the established arrangements that enable legislation to pass through this parliament.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>4J4</name.id><name role="metadata">SCHACHT</name><name role="display">Senator Schacht</name></talker><para>âYou will never get that stuff through unless you bring it back to the parliament.

In fact, as I have indicated, if you did have a change in the constitution of the Senate a very short time after the bill had been passed by both chambers, you could have the farcical situation where a bill that had passed through both houses, that was treated as legislation enacted by the parliament, was then not allowed to be taken any further.

One of the problems that we have always experienced down thereâwe have about 200 expeditioners in the territory every yearâis that, to get in touch with their loved ones back home, people have to communicate by telecommunications back to the mainland of Australia. The division spends about $350,000 on telecommunications between Australia's Antarctic territories and the mainland of Australia.</para><para>This announcement today of an extra $20 million for the regional telecommunications infrastructure fund was specifically mentioned by the minister to apply to Australia's Antarctic Territory. There are many very good, very courageous, Australians down in the Antarctic Territory who do work in the wild frontiers of Australia, doing good work for Australia, looking after Australia's science, looking after Australia's interests in the Antarctic. But I would submit that they are entitledâas Australian pioneers, one might almost call themâto communicate back with loved ones at home: children, family, spouses, parents. At the present time, they pay a fee of 90c per minute to communicate via satellite from Australia's Antarctic territories back to their loved ones in Australia.</para><para>By contrast, those Australians living on the Cocos (Keeling) Islands or on Christmas Island currently get that service at about 30c per minute. That, of course, means that Australians working in the Antarctic have to pay three times that amount.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Opposition senators interjecting</inline>â</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>âOrder, Senator Schacht.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>YW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN MACDONALD</name></talker><para>âI am sure Senator Schacht would agree with me that those Australians who do that work in the Antarctic should not be disadvantaged. Currentlyâand I want to emphasise that because I will be seeking some support from Senator Schacht on this particular matterâthose Australians pay that 90c a minute, but it does not seem to me to be fair.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I think the minister has recognised this today, because he did issue a media release indicating that $20 million in additional funds would be made available for the regional telecommunications infrastructure fund. That fund is in addition to the announcement that the minister made yesterday of something of the order of $150 million out of the sale of two-thirds of Telstra to enable people living in remote mainland Australia to communicate with their neighbours five or 10 kilometres away. In the past, those people living in remote Australia had to pay trunk line rates. That means that not only did they pay a lot of money but also they were timed calls. That was a situation that existed under the 13 years of Labor, and we wanted to cure that. So the minister announced that, upon the sale of two-thirds of Telstra, there will be sufficient funds to enable those people living in remote Australia to communicate with their neighbours at a local call rate and their calls will be untimed. That is the first time it has ever happened. It is a tremendous deal for remote and regional Australians.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>4J4</name.id><name role="metadata">SCHACHT</name><name role="display">Senator Schacht</name></talker><para>âMadam Chairman, I raise a point of order.

That is my interpretation of it; it has another description. It is a town closest to people living in remote and regional Australia which has normal services: a doctor, a pharmacy and that sort of thing.</para><para>In the past, under Labor, you could ring there at 25c for four minutes. Senator Alston announced yesterday that we are extending that to 12 minutes. You can get a 12-minute call for a 25c fee. Calls average about six minutes, they tell me, in these areas, so for the first time people in regional Australia who want to ring into their nearest town that has normal services are going to get that for 25c a call, and that is the same as Senator Schacht gets living in the leafy suburbs of Adelaide. It puts people out in Barry Wakelin's electorate in the north of South Australia on the same plane as Senator Schacht. Senator Schacht is not interested in that. He is not at all interested in people in regional Australia; he is only interested in those living in the leafy suburbs of Adelaide.</para><para>These are two tremendous initiatives announced by the minister yesterday, but they are dependent on the sale of two-thirds of Telstra. There are those two elements which I just reinforce, but I come back to the matter I wanted to raise in speaking to this amendment, which is just how that would affect Australia's Antarctic territory. Some of my colleagues in this place have actually been to Australia's Antarctic territory and they have seen the remoteness. They have been on a trip down and back. I think Senator Lees from the Australian Democrats has been down there. She would understand just how remote they are and how much these expeditioners miss their spouses, their partners, their familiesâin many cases with young childrenâand their parents. We here in this building are away from our families for a long time, and most of us ring our spouses or our children every night just to keep in touch.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>DX5</name.id><name role="metadata">MARGETTS</name><name role="display">Senator Margetts</name></talker><para>âMadam Chair, I raise a point of order.

 including their performance over this bill in the last few days. But One Nation have a real prospect, on all the opinion polls at the present time, of holding the balance of power by taking a number of seats off the National Party in rural Australia. Although we do not have any brook with One Nation, they have indicated recently that they now support the policy of the Labor Party in opposing the privatisation of Telstra.</para></talk.start></continue><para>So, after the counting of preferences, you would have a minority Howard government. The Prime Minister of that minority government could say, `Well, I am not going to call parliament together for three months. I may have an opportunity to convince some newly elected One Nation members to come and join the coalition.' In doing so, he could keep parliament from sitting during that three-month period and, since the government has accepted Senator Harradine's amendment, he could proclaim the bill to privatise Telstraâeven though a clear majority of Australians at that election for the House of Representatives had voted for the Labor Party, the Democrats, One Nation and, I would imagine, a number of Independents, including some people who had already left the National Party over the issue, such as Mrs De-Anne Kelly, the member for Dawson. There would be a combined vote of well over 50 per cent opposed to the privatisation of Telstra.</para><para>Because of the way the numbers worked out Mr Howard could say, `I am not going to the Governor-General a week after the election to hand in my resignation; I am going to test the confidence in my government on the floor of the House of Representatives when I call it together.' I think he can wait at least three months before he has to do so. So, while we wait three months for that test of confidence on the floor of the House of Representatives, the Prime Minister can, under Senator Harradine's amendment which the government supports, say, `We privatise Telstra,' and it is proclaimed.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>AW5</name.id><name role="metadata">CARR</name><name role="display">Senator Carr</name></talker><para>âJust like that.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>4J4</name.id><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator SCHACHT</name></talker><para>âJust like that.

I have a different view about it. The real issue for us is that this legislation is totally unnecessary. It will give the Prime Minister an opportunity to get this legislation through on the numbers in the Senate at present rather than taking a chance on what the numbers will be after 1 July next year. That is the what the sham, that is what the political trickery, has been about from the very beginning. It is a finely designed rort.</para></talk.start></continue><para>We all remember the way in which the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, congratulated himself when he made his announcement at the Liberal Party conference that this is how the legislation would be designed. He said that, firstly, it did not break his promise that he would never move to fully privatise Telstra during the first term of his government and, secondly, it gave the people the opportunity to voteâand then, if he lost the election, 
 presumably the legislation would not be proclaimed. Normal, ordinary Australians would say, `That is a stunt. Why don't you win the election first and then bring the legislation in?'</para><para>The other stunt is that, by having the legislation now, you can actually adjust the figures and say, `We have got a pot of money for various bribes to the electorate. We can say now what it is and use that money to mislead the National Party,' who believe it is an extraordinary pot of gold but, in fact, so far it is only $150 million. That is what the real issue is here: it gave the Prime Minister and the Treasurer the ability to say, `We can fund a whole range of promises on legislation passed but not proclaimed until after the election.' It means the Prime Minister does not have to be tough about preparing his election manifesto of how to pay for all his promises. If he had to put that up front, a lot of this magic puddingâthe sale of Telstraâwould not be available to him. That is why it is being done this way.</para><para>The political point we have made today is that we find it extraordinary that the magic pudding for the National Party has been very small. It is only $150 million. As for the new mobile telephone network, Frank Blount is on television tonight confirming what I said three times in this debate today, that is, Telstra were doing the new telephone network as a commercial decision. It was reported again that he said, `This government, this minister, has never said boo to me.' This was happening anyway. The $400 million for the new mobile telephone network, which has been sold to the National Party as part of the magic pudding, was going to happen anyway. You can't have that.</para><para>All the National Party has is $150 million. But the Liberal Party is going to have a big bag of money from the sale that they can offer their voters in the cities to bribe them over the line at the next election. That is what we have found so extraordinary. We believe that the Democrats' amendment will keep the government absolutely honest. The parliament elected at the next electionâthe new House of Representatives and the new Senateâwill have the decision to decide whether this goes 
 through, even if Mr Howard wins the election. We believe that is a much more honest and ethical way to handle this issue.</para><para>Again, I am surprised that Senator Harradine would put such a proposition. He said he disagreed with my interpretation. If that is the case, I think the real issue, Senator Harradine, is for you to forget your amendment altogether. If there is a dispute about what it means, vote for the Democrat amendment, which we are voting for. It makes it clear that there can be no misunderstanding by the Australian people that they have the final opportunity to vote in a new parliament and a new government, whichever it may be, to continue with a proper arrangement to ensure that Telstra is dealt with in that way and not in this background, back-handed, sneaky deal.</para><para>Not all the detail of the deal has been out but we think we know what some of it is. Some of it is not as good as the National Party first proclaimed. We have had that embarrassment for Mr Tim Fischer exposed today. We have had Senator Boswell having to move an amendment, on my suggestion, to try to protect his own electors, and the minister has had to accept it because the minister found that he had not covered all the bases in his own deal making.

I do not want to prolong the time of the Senate unduly. There are a number of amendments that will be considered. I do certainly express the hope that we will be able to achieve a package which will constitute a substantial step forward in copyright reform. I think it ought to be clear from the public debate that has been conducted in recent times that the refusal of the ALP to support a workable moral rights regime has led the government at this stage to withdraw this element of the bill pending further consideration and consultations.</para></talk.start><para>The bill, when introduced, did contain provisions that would have vested the moral rights of integrity and attribution in the authors of works and the makers of films. The government remains committed to introducing a workable moral rights regime. It will be a regime that ensures that Australia meets its international obligations and, importantly, one that is fair to creators, producers and users of 
 copyright material. The original impetus for the establishment of moral rights came from visual artists whose lack of bargaining power sometimes leads to exploitation and mistreatment of their works. This is particularly so in the case of indigenous artists. However, once this bill was introduced the justification for comprehensive moral rights protection became obscured by a debate over a provision to allow an up-front waiver for contracted works and films principally led by elements of the film industry.</para><para>Following the release of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee report in October 1997, where the majority recommended the extension of waiver at the time of commissioning a work or film, the government has held lengthy discussions over several months with the participants to try to broker an acceptable compromise on this issue that would satisfy all interests and maintain certainty and confidence in the industry. This has not proved possible to date. The government is therefore withdrawing the moral rights provisions from the bill.</para><para>However, we will continue to consult in an attempt to develop a consensus on a workable provision on waiver, and we remain committed to resubmitting the moral rights regime as a stand-alone bill in three months time or as soon as possible thereafter. It is a matter of regret to the government that this delay has been forced upon it, deferring the time that creators who most need protection will receive it. That is probably the most contentious aspect of the copyright legislation. I should, in passing, point to the hypocrisy of the Labor Party who now say that they are not in favour of a waiver for moral rights, yet prior to the last election they were. That, no doubt, will be well understood by those who have taken a keen interest in the subject.</para><para>There are particular factors that operate in relation to creative film workers, producers and directors. We have certainly endeavoured to ensure that all of those rights are respected. The moral rights regime would last as long as the copyright in a work or film, which would normally be 50 years from the death of an author of a work or 50 years from the making of a film. Where there are two or more joint 
 creators of a work or film they would each have moral rights. The majority and minority committee reports recommended that the bill be amended to provide that an author's right was not infringed when his or her joint authorship was misattributed.</para><para>Journalists' copyright is another important aspect of this legislation. The copyright in works produced by an employee usually vests with the employer. The exception to this is where the employee is a journalist. Employed journalists have retained copyright in their work except where it is published in a newspaper or magazine or is broadcast. The bill will leave journalists with copyright in their works when reproduced in books or photocopied for media monitoring services but transfer all other copyright to newspaper proprietors permitting them to develop on-line newspapers. The change reflects an agreement between the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance and some publishers. The proposed changes will leave employed journalists with their traditional rights to reproduce their articles in book form and to benefit from the photocopying of their articles.</para><para>The existing provisions of the Copyright Act give newspaper proprietors copyright in articles written by employed journalists for the purposes of publication in a newspaper or magazine or for broadcasting. The amendment will preserve existing employed journalists' rights but leave newspaper proprietors free to develop new modes of distribution, such as the Internet, for their publications.</para><para>We have taken account of the impact on media monitors. There will be a series of amendments to reflect the fact that media monitoring businesses will need to negotiate with publishers in relation to licensing the digital uses of newspapers to facilitate delivery of on-line media monitoring devices.</para><para>Media monitoring business has sought the introduction of a statutory licence to copy publishers' copyright material without their permission, subject to the Copyright Tribunal being able to arbitrate potential disputes about royalties for copying. The government rejected this proposal as it would have introduced a qualification of exclusive rights for which there is no demonstrated justification and 
 which might be inconsistent with Australia's international copyright obligations. The majority report and the ALP minority report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee on the Copyright Amendment Bill 1997 did not support the proposal put forward by media monitoring businesses.</para><para>The journalists union, the MEAA, has been consulted by the Attorney-General's Department in the development of the journalists' copyright proposals and, among other interests, the Australian Copyright Council, a peak body representing copyright interests, including the MEAA, was consulted in the final stages of drafting the bill and made no complaint about the extent of the consultation with journalists on this matter.</para><para>The National Competition Council considered a complaint from Media Monitors that the journalists' provisions breached the competition principles agreement which requires governments to consider the public interest in introducing anti-competitive legislation. In July 1997, the National Competition Council secretariat advised Media Monitors that the Commonwealth had complied with its obligations out of the competition principles agreement, and it did not intend to pursue Media Monitors complaint any further.</para><para>The objective of the journalists' copyright amendments is to ensure that publishers are able to use employed journalists works in the electronic publication and delivery of newspapers. Without the proposed amendments, proprietors will not be able to take advantage of these new technologies in the publication and delivery of newspapers and magazines. If publishers were impeded from taking advantage of new technologies, this could lead to limits on the access that consumers have to newspapers and magazines.</para><para>The Copyright Act does permit braille, large print and photographic versions of a work to be made for the benefit of print handicapped persons without infringing copyright. The Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee recommended that the Attorney-General consider whether restricting works for the print handicapped to these formats disadvantaged the print handicapped by denying them access to electronic copies. The government 
 has considered the matter and has some sympathy for the committee's recommendations. However, the proposed change would be a substantial change in the statutory licence which would require consultation with the copyright owners, whereas what is being done by the current amendments is simply replacing the expression `handicapped reader' with `persons with a print disability' and expanding the purposes for which copies may be made. The Copyright Law Revision Committee may recommend such a change when reporting on its simplification reference, but there would need to be consultation with copyright owners. The government will consider this issue after it receives the CLRC's report.</para><para>Photographers' copyright is also a very important issue that will be addressed in this legislation, and I will provide detail of that during the committee stages. We have also taken account of the Copyright Law Review Committee's consideration of provisions in relation to the protection of sculptures. Again there are some positive aspects. There are also recommendations of the Australian Law Reform Commission in relation to the creation of a right of adaptation for owners of copyright in artistic works. The government is in an advanced stage in its consideration of the ALRC report on designs, including the recommendation that the owners of copyright in artistic works be granted an adaptation right. The results of the government's consideration should be known shortly.</para><para>The government is also committed to introducing a new communications right. A discussion paper on this issue <inline font-style="italic">Copyright Reform and the Digital Agenda</inline> was released in July last year. The paper proposed, amongst other things, the creation of a technology neutral right of communication to the public. The government is considering submissions in response to that paper and will release an exposure draft of proposed changes to the Copyright Act in due course.</para><para>Turning to indigenous copyright, the final report arising from the ATSIC funded discussions paper on <inline font-style="italic">Indigenous Culture and Intellectual Property: Our Future</inline> is yet to be considered by the ATSIC board. When it is 
 considered, it is likely that the board will make recommendations to the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs and to the government as a whole arising from that report. When and if such recommendations are made they will be carefully considered by the government. In the interim, the government strongly supports the development of a mark of authenticity to assist in the marketing of authentic indigenous products. The introduction of moral rights requiring the proper attribution of creative effort and the maintenance of the integrity of artists' work will be of particular relevance and benefit to indigenous creators.</para><para>The Senate committee majority report also recommended that consideration be given to removing the one per cent ceiling on broadcasting royalties payable by commercial broadcasters for the broadcasting of recorded music. The question of whether the government should remove the current ceiling of one per cent of a broadcaster's income on the royalties payable by a commercial radio station for the broadcasting of recorded music is complex. As well as the interests of the owner of copyright on recorded music, the government has to consider the likely impact on the broadcasting industry and any likely flow-on effects a decision might have on the make up of music played on radio stations, bearing in mind that music recorded in America is not subject to any royalty for broadcasting.</para><para>There are also trade practices and competition issues to be considered. Consequently, while the government is giving consideration to this issue, it would not be appropriate to move an amendment on this issue as part of the current bill.</para><para>Another very important aspect of this legislation relates to parallel import barriers. The Copyright Act can be used by the owners of copyright in a label or packaging to prevent the import of otherwise non-infringing goods bearing the copyright label or in copyright packaging. This allows the importers of brand name goods to protect their franchises and to charge higher prices than would otherwise be the case. The removal of the parallel import restriction is expected to lead 
 to lower prices for the brand name goods in question.</para><para>The use of the Copyright Act to restrict the import of non-infringing goods has enabled the owners of the copyright and the labelling of such goods to charge higher prices than would otherwise be the case. The proposed changes will make it impossible to use copyright law to prevent the importation of goods which could otherwise be legally imported except for their copyright labelling or packaging. This misuse of the Copyright Act to restrict legitimate trade is beyond the purpose of the act which exists to protect intellectual property, not maintain non-tariff barriers. The removal of parallel import barriers should lead to a fall in prices of these goods and, to the extent that prices fall, the beneficiaries will be the public who would have had access otherwise to a wider range of cheaper goods. The only losers will be those who currently do very well from the high prices of brand name imports.</para><para>However, the government does realise that businesses have entered in good faith into arrangements based on the current provisions of the Copyright Act and, consequently, has moved to ensure that the new arrangements will not enter into force until 18 months after the commencement of this bill, giving businesses time to adjust to the new arrangements. Australia's actions in this regard are consistent with international trade law and Australia would not be alone, as senators may recall New Zealand's recent decision announced in its May budget to lift all restrictions on parallel imports.</para><para>Another important matter relates to the copying of art work. The Copyright Act permits educational institutions to copy an artistic work when this is incidental to the copying of text in a book. The relevant section 135ZM is ambiguous as to whether the owner of copyright in the artistic work is to receive remuneration for the copying. Both the majority and minority ALP and Democrat committee reports recommended repeal of the section apparently in the belief that this would ensure artists were paid if their work was copied. </para><para>Under the Copyright Act as it currently stands, section 135ZM permits the incidental copying of copyright artistic works during the copying of texts by educational institutions. However, there has been some dispute about whether this means that the owners of copyright in these artistic works are to be paid for this copying, and the government understands to date that they have not received any remuneration for copying under this provision of the licence.</para><para>The Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee recommended that the section be repealed. It is arguable that artists are already entitled, however, to payment under the section, but the current provision is unclear and needs to be made unambiguous. If the section were to be repealed, it would be left to the courts to decide whether artists should receive remuneration. The government's amendments will ensure that artists receive remuneration without imposing additional costs on educational institutions. The proposed amendment has the support of VI$COPY.</para><para>Finally, I foreshadow an amendment in relation to photographers' rights. The bill presently provides in section 35A that newspaper proprietors may restrain the photocopying of more than 15 per cent of a newspaper or magazine in  relation to the reform of the employed journalists' copyright. All parties agree that the provision is impractical and unworkable and should be deleted. There are also further amendments which propose that the photographer and not the commissioner should own the copyright of the work, except for photographs taken for private or domestic purposesâfor example, weddings, family portraits, et ceteraâwhich will remain with the commissioner.</para><para>I know from my own experience that photographers have been agitating on this matter for very many years. The reflection of the outcome that I have indicated is something that I think should go a considerable distance to us waging their concerns. The bill presently provides for the commissioner of the photograph to own the copyright. I certainly acknowledge that there are a significant number of very important but discrete ele 
 ments in this legislation which I think do constitute a very significant step forward in copyright reform. I commend the bill to the Senate.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para><para>Bill read a second time.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>In Committee</title><page.no>5713</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The bill.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>5713</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âWe do have a running sheet with quite a number of amendments but, as a result of the discussions that have been going on between offices, the opposition either will not be proposing the amendments that were circulated or else the government will be proposing amendments which cover the field that we were trying to tackle.</para></talk.start><para>I also suggest at this stage that in respect of schedule 3 and its implementation, on which I suspect the major debate will take place, there are different approaches proposed by the opposition. It might be appropriate when we get to the first item to debate all those options together rather than at the two or three different places as is indicated on the running sheet. For instance, our starting position is that we would like schedule 3 dropped altogether. The government of course opposes that. If the indication of the committee was that there is insufficient support for that position to get up, then we have a bundle of amendments that will go to the object of achieving a review of the impact of schedule 3 and deferred implementation pending that review.</para><para>Once again, if the committee was not disposed to support that, we also have a batch of amendments that allow for an industry by industry opting in of the application of the principles of schedule 3. The government has an amendment to differ implementation of it for 18 months. If that were to be carried by the committee, then we have a subsequent amendment to stretch that 18 months to two years. What I am suggesting at this stage is that when we get to the first of those items it might be appropriate to have the debate then and make a decision with all those options on the table rather than to proceed with the three or four pages of amendments.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>5713</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI indicate that we will not be moving the two amendments in my name to schedule 2 for many of the same reasons as Senator Bolkus has outlined.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN (Senator Watson)</name></talker><para>âHow does the committee therefore wish to proceed?

It is also of major concern to a broad cross-section of industry. We are talking here of parallel imports being goods manufactured outside the jurisdiction by or under the authority of the owner of an industrial property right relating to these goods but imported by someone other than the authorised importer or distributor. At present, sections 37, 38, 102 and 103 of the Copyright Act go towards protecting the rights of the authorised importer.</para><para>The issue before us in the context of this debate is the issue of copyright for packaging and labelling. This first became an issue in 1986-87 following the 1986 decision of Justice Young in the New South Wales Supreme Court in the case of Bailey v. Boccacio. In that case, the plaintiff was an overseas manufacturer of Bailey's Irish Cream liqueur and held the copyright in Australia for the bottle label. The plaintiff entered into an exclusive agreement with another company, a company that imported and distributed the product within Australia. The defendant, Boccacio, obtained bottles of the imported liqueur in the Netherlands and imported them into Australia.</para><para>In that case, Justice Young held that this infringed the plaintiff's copyright in the label. In 1988, soon after that case, the Copyright Law Reform Committee objected to the use of the Copyright Act in this way. In 1992, and admittedly without sufficient previous consultation, the previous Labor government introduced the Copyright Amendment Bill 1992, which included a provision similar to the present schedule 3. It lapsed at the time of the 1993 election. In 1995, once again without sufficient preparation, we urged reconsideration and introduced similar amendments. At that stage we decided not to proceed any further with them because it was acknowledged that there needed to be further consideration of the impact of the measure.</para><para>Schedule 3 of this legislation proposes amendments designed to prevent importers from blocking parallel imports on the basis of a copyright in the accessory items that are, in fact, peripheral to the substantive goods. Schedule 3 also inserts a definition of a non-infringing accessory and there are some government amendments in relation to that.</para><para>The government's justification for these amendments contained in schedule 3 is that the use of copyright to ban parallel imports is, as they say, an inappropriate and improper restraint on trade. Evidence before the parliamentary committee argued very strongly that the current provisions of the bill support monopolistic practices and would prevent the operation of competition. In essence, the 
 argument is that they have a deleterious effect on the concept of free trade.</para><para>There are issues and arguments running both ways. It is fair to say that this issue was quite extensively canvassed by the parliamentary committee. The government has argued that the provisions of the Copyright Act, for instance, should be used to address only issues of copyright and should not be used to help to address issues such as product safety. That is an issue that has been raised by the opposition and by industry. It is an issue that is quite important for the parliament to consider at this stage.</para><para>Before I go to the issue of product safety, let me say that the government can be commended for seeking enhanced competition in this area. Its attempts to try to limit monopoly in a product is also an objective which the Labor Party has concurred with for quite some time. We do not dispute that some malpractices may occur. In fact, there are some well documented examples where importers and distributors have misused mechanisms available to them under the Copyright Act.</para><para>There is some relief available to parallel importers through the use of the anticompetition provisions of the Trade Practices Act. For example, section 46B of the act prevents an abuse of market power, seemingly used by some parallel importers to ward off the use of the Copyright Act in this way. We maintain that it is a long way from acknowledging an abuse and from recognising the need to overcome that abuse and schedule 3 being passed at this stage. The government's argument ignores the fact that the market in one way or another does subject itself to some vigorous competition. The competition is not in relation to a particular brand of goods sold, but because the branded goods sold are often of a generic kind there is quite often competition from other branded and non-branded goods that perform precisely the same function.</para><para>For example, Billabong Australia produces branded clothing, principally beach or surf wear. No-one would doubt that the market for this clothing is highly competitive. Whilst Billabong would like to control the use of its 
 name in order to, amongst other things, protect its image, it could hardly be said that it extracts monopoly profits as a result. There are a whole range of other beach or surf wear products that are highly competitive with Billabong. So we do not say that that competition argument can be argued consistently and generally in this case.</para><para>We are concerned that a broad measure such as schedule 3 does have both direct and indirect impacts that this parliament should not be embracing without some full consideration of them. We are concerned, for instance, about consumer issues. We are concerned by a number of arguments raised that the imports of branded goods may be of an inferior quality. You could be talking about pirate products; you could be talking about another range of products coming in under the same brand name.</para><para>This argument has been argued in relation to items such as toys and foodstuffs. This argument directly throws up issues of health and safety. As a former consumer affairs minister, can I say that it was almost impossible for the federal and state governments to act in a global market, a market where an increasing number of the products were made not just in one location in another part of the world but in a whole range of locations. In those circumstances it is becoming increasingly difficult, if not impossible, for governments to be able to protect adequately on health and safety grounds.</para><para>It could be argued that copyright legislation is not the proper way to go to offer such protection, but we on this side would argue that were you to do away with such copyright protection then it is important that one pay attention to the direct consequences of health, safety and quality of product and ensure that they are picked up one way or another. The mechanisms, broad though they might be at the moment, are not there.</para><para>The last thing we should be looking for is a situation where consumers have to take their own action after the injury or damage has taken place before they can protect other people from similar consequences of inferior goods. A proactive regime, a pre-emptive regime, is important. To the extent that brand 
 name control offers that, it is something that should be factored into any impact of this legislation.</para><para>The important issue which has been raised by industry, and one that is most striking in that it has not been taken into account by government, is the impact on jobs and on particular industry sectors. This government has introduced this legislation without consultation. As I said earlier, we made that mistake, but we realise it was a mistake and that we should not have proceeded with it and, as a consequence, we withdrew the second bill. You would have thought the bureaucracy, having gone down this road twice before, would have advised this government, or you would have thought this government on the advice of the bureaucracy, would have ensured that there was extensive consultation before this measure was actually produced to the parliament.</para><para>It is important to note that government has not done an economic assessment on jobs and industry of this schedule. It is important to note that the study by the industry itself clearly stated that the employment losses arising from the passage of schedule 3 would be over 9,000 jobs. It is amazing that in the current environment the government seems to care very little about these jobs and is attempting to assert that the companies complaining about schedule 3 are merely multinational companies.</para><para>If you look closely at the numbers in the Price Waterhouse study, you would see that the average employment per business involved in the 1,456 businessesâand that is a broad sweepâwith a total employment of 15,843 people was only 12 employees per business. I would have thought that belies the fact that we are not talking here about what the government is arguing about, we are not talking about the so-called evil multinationals, but talking about small to medium sized Australian businesses. The impact of the changes in schedule 3 will be hard on Australian owned and operated companies. That is something that not just the government should recognise but also the Australian Democrats, who are going down the same 
 road as the government on this issue, although a little bit more hesitantly .</para><para>Let both the government and the Democrats prove that the benefits exist because, in essence, this is another example of the government blindly following the path of the armchair economists, the economic rationalists. As I said earlier, the consumer has quite a number of interests in respect of health and safety that need to be taken into account.</para><para>I say to the government at this stage, as we seem to be steamrolling towards an election, despite what happened earlier this evening, that it should start to worry about the impact of this bill on Australian workers. The initial study showed some 9,000 workers potentially losing their jobs. Additional studies have pointed to the adverse impact of schedule 3 on employment in several marginal seats. I say to the member for Parramatta that in his seat about 2,000 job losses can be anticipated by the impact of this legislation, as has been advised by the Price Waterhouse survey. Paul Elliott, the Labor candidate for Parramatta, is certainly aware of this. He is concerned, but unfortunately the local member for Parramatta does not seem to be concerned that some 2,000 jobs may go in his electorate.</para><para>In the Gosford area, in the seat of Robertson, there are almost 1,200 jobs that the Price Waterhouse survey warns us could be lost. Senator Belinda Neal, who was in here earlier on this evening, will be running for Labor in that seat, and can I say to anyone listening that she has been a strong lobbyist for the opposition's position here.</para><para>These are just two examples of the impact on jobs from this legislation. Can I say to the government that you may dismiss this, you may be in the grips of the armchair economists who seem to dictate policy on a national level, but it will affect jobs. Even if you maintain strongly that it does not, you have not done the work, you have not done the homework, you have not done the surveys, you have not done the assessments and you have not done the economic impact statements to assure not just the community but also yourselves that the road you are going down is the right road.</para><para>The opposition says that we should defer implementation of schedule 3. There is no need for the government to have schedule 3 at this stage. The government has had an opportunity to do an economic assessmentâI say this to Senator Murray in particularâand it is basically heading down this road with its eyes almost closed as to its impact. Your eyes are not totally closed because you have been warned by an economic assessment from a reputable national company, if not international company.</para><para>Drop schedule 3, but if you are not going to go down that road let us have a review. Let us defer implementation of schedule 3. Let us have a review. Let us have a study on the impact of this particular schedule. That, in a sense, is our option B in our amendments.</para><para>The third option that we are putting forward this evening is the industry by industry option. If the government is concerned about a particular industry and monopolistic practices and lack of competition in that industry, let it by regulationâand we have floated and circulated an amendment to this effectâincorporate that industry under the ambit of schedule 3. That is, as I say, an option available to us.</para><para>Finally, it is my view and the view of the opposition that you are talking here about a wide diversity of industries and companies. Give them time to accommodate this new regime. If, for instance, a company in the last couple of years has invested, as some have, up to $20 million to promote products that they have under exclusive licence, give them enough time to be able to absorb the impact of this decision on their industry and company. We say 18 months is not enough and we would like to extend that to two years.</para><para>Our basic point to the government, and particularly to the Australian Democrats, is that you do not know the impact of this study. You have been warned about it. Now is a good time to drop the schedule.

It is an important distinction, the Democrats feel, and highlights the important objectives of copyright laws generally in Australia and the ways these objectives are being skewed.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I know that we have other bills of a comparable nature that are supposedly to be discussed this evening, albeit in a very restricted time frame, and once again I put on the record the Democrats' objection to the way debate has been gagged on a number of issues today and also the fact that we are dealing with copyright laws of reasonable significance now and later on this evening in a very short period. For those reasons, because we are dealing with another copyright bill after this, I would like to get some of the distinctions clearly on the record.</para><para>The packaging and labelling provisions in the  Copyright Amendment Bill 1997  propose to remove the parallel import restrictions on copyright works attached to products. Certainly Senator Bolkus referred in his comments in the committee stage to the New South Wales Supreme Court case of Bailey v. Boccacio. That case involved a legally purchased and imported bottle of Bailey's Irish Cream being sold for a lower price by the unauthorised importer than that by the Australian distributor and authorised by the trademark and product owner.</para><para>The case turned on the argument that the lower priced import infringed copyright in the artistic work on the bottle's label. The effect of this case is to say that if you own the copyright in the package or label you can 
 control the import and distribution of whatever that package or label is attached too. In these circumstances the product becomes secondary to the packaging. The government's bill, we believe, is fixing up this particular anomaly and will allow products which have a copyright package or label to be parallel imported.</para><para>The Australian Democrats believe the benefit of removing the restrictions will actually lead to better business practices in Australia because the Copyright Act should not be used to compensate for contractual inadequacies in arrangements between owners, manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers. On balance, we think in this circumstance that the community will benefit from parallel importing through cheaper prices, better services, et cetera. Further, the existing trademark laws are specifically addressed at brands and of course logos, and that is the relevant law for brands' protection.</para><para>In contrast to proposals, for example, that may deal with sound recordings, a proposal such as that being put forward by the government where you propose the removal of parallel import restrictions on sound recordings so that a legally purchased sound recording can be imported into Australia for commercial purposes and sold without the permission of the Australian copyright owner, we find there are very strong distinctions and differences in these two copyright arguments. We say that, on balance, the removal of parallel import restrictions on sound recordings will have a detrimental impact on the Australian music industry by reducing artists' royalties and will result in lost jobs and increased levels of piracy.</para><para>The issue of parallel importing restrictions in packaging and labelling is different. We say that packaging and labelling covers attachments to products and controls their distribution; they are best addressed by trade marks and contracts; they are not required by international convention; and they are very likely to bring reduced prices as the price differences are significant. One example that has been drawn to our attention is that a Coleman 45-litre cooler is approximately 110 per cent more expensive in Australia than, 
 say, the United States. This is even taking into account the on average 30 to 65 per cent increased cost of goods in Australia compared to the United States.</para><para>In relation to sound recordings, the Democrats say that this issue is about the product and the unique Australian culture in Australian music. The analysis is about weighing the benefits and detriments from allowing parallel importing, which is supposed to fix market failure in the production of creative works. Removing parallel import restrictions will detrimentally affect the Australian music industry by reducing royalties, reducing job opportunities and, as I mentioned earlier, increasing piracy.</para><para>The government claims, in relation to removing the parallel import restrictions from sound recordings, that this is necessary and will somehow result in cheaper CDs. We all want cheaper CDs; there is no debate about that. But we have said on many occasions that the policies put forward by the government fail to take into account in achieving that particular measure some of the negative impacts that policy may bring with it. We have always said that this claim deserves further attention and highlights the differencesâand we are talking about parallel importingâbetween packaging and labelling and sound recordings. It is very important to get that distinction on record.</para><para>I could elaborate further but I will choose to do so in another debate on prices in the sound recording markets and the differentiation in prices not only within the domestic music market but on an international scale. Suffice it to say that an analysis of the concentration of a range of Australian industries showed that the music industry in Australia is not as concentrated as other industries, some of whichâfor example, everything from cinemas to tea and toothpasteâhave been considered to be sufficiently competitive even though they are less competitive than the music industry.</para><para>As for packaging and labelling, the price data shows quite clearly some substantial differences between Australian prices and United States prices. We accept the usual differences of between 30 and 50 per cent, 
 but even here the price differences are considerable. I will set out these differences in a later debate if we get to that. I am not sure that we are going to have enough time to get through second readings, let alone pursue other policy in relation to copyright law.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>FX5</name.id><name role="metadata">MURPHY</name><name role="display">Senator Murphy</name></talker><para>âIf you keep it short we will.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3I6</name.id><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name></talker><para>âI am happy to be short and I will end my remarks shortly. Mr Chairman, this is exactly the constraint that we should not be faced with tonight. We are dealing with important matters at law. I am being very careful not to anticipate the bill that is on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline> . But how we are going to deal in two hours with the future and the potentially devastating impact of a bill on the Australian music industry is beyond me. I put on the record that the gags and the procedural decisions that have taken place over the last 24 hours have been shameful and outrageous.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I will conclude by saying that the recommendation of the Australian Democrats to oppose the government's policy on sound recordings was a complex decision. It was a decision reached after comprehensive debate, discussion, committee investigation and after weighing up the facts, the figures, the economics et cetera. After considering all of that material before the Senate committee, we were persuaded that the billâthe intent of the policyâwould adversely impact on the Australian music industry by reducing artists' royalties and increasing levels of piracy. These are significant issues which do not have a similar effect for the packaging and labelling bill. For these reasons we will support this bill on packaging and labelling, and reject the government's sound recording proposals. The issues are different and our decision reflects these differences.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>5720</page.no><name role="metadata">Lundy, Sen Kate</name><name role="display">Senator LUNDY</name><name.id>7G6</name.id><electorate>ACT</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI would like to add a few comments with respect to schedule 3. Certainly, in regard to the items at hand and the issues addressed with reference to non-infringing copies in the definition required in the bill, the relationship between those definitions and the implications upon the government's consideration of how to con 
 struct the Copyright Amendment Bill (No. 2) that we are going to be debating forthwith are one and the same in the sense that this clause pre-empts a requirement of copyright No. 2 bill to conform with international obligations. I say to the Democrats that the links are definitely there and we certainly view this clause as one of pre-empting a later debate and therefore that contributes obviously to our position on it.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>5720</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Schools, Vocational Education and Training</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIn simple terms, the government is opposed to the practice of using copyright in artistic works on packages and labels to prevent businesses from importing and distributing legitimate products. Senator Bolkus has referred to the case of Bailey v. Boccacio in 1986 and that is how long this problem has been festering. The former government introduced legislation in the Copyright Amendment Bill 1992 in order to address that and the provisions of that bill are somewhat close to what is being proposed by the government here today.</para></talk.start><para>The amendment allows the opening up of competition in relation to this matter, because what we have here is the use of copyright in relation to packaging and labelling to restrict trade and thereby to cause an impediment to the reduction in prices of those goods. As a former minister for consumer affairs, I can say that anything which reduces the prices of goods is good for the consumer. That is what this government is about.</para><para>There are also those who say that the removal of this protection would also infringe upon things such as misleading conduct, deception, use of wrong or illegal ingredients and unsafe goods. Those aspects are clearly covered by other pieces of legislation such as the Trade Practices Act, the Fair Trading Act, the Trademarks Act and the Commerce (Trade Descriptions) Act. It is really not correct to say that the removal of this will in any way have some deleterious effect on consumers. Quite the contraryâby opening up competition, it will in this area have a flow-on to the consumer in reduced prices.</para><para>The case of Bailey v. Boccacio clearly showed that there was a problem; that, by 
 having this control over the labelling, you could restrict importation. I thank the Democrats for their support in this issue, and I would support, in part, the comments made by Senator Stott Despoja. Therefore, the government cannot accept the position of the opposition. We will be standing by schedule 3 as proposed.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>5721</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âCould I say something before Senator Murray speaks. It is in response to Senator Stott Despoja, whose contribution, I must say, is quite amazing in its inadequacy. I do not know where she has been in the last few months, I do not know what she has been listening to and I do not know what she has addressed before she came in here, but for her to say that schedule 3 is nothing more than an issue about an anomaly shows an amazing degree not just of ignorance but of disregard of a whole range of issues that have been before this Senate, this parliament and parliamentary committees for quite some time now. She just cannot call an anomaly something which may in fact cost 9,000 Australian workers their jobs. She just cannot come in here and dismiss, in one glib word, something that may have an impact on the quality of consumer items in this country.</para></talk.start><para>I must admit that I have been bewildered and stunned by Senator Stott Despoja's contribution on this particular issue. We are not talking here about an anomaly. We are talking here about an issue that has been on the public agenda for some six or seven years and which was withdrawn once before by the previous government, as it should have withdrawn it. It is a proposal which has not had sufficient working through by this government, a proposal which this government did not discuss with industry, though it deeply affects the rights and the future of so many companies in this country, and a proposal which Price Waterhouse has warned us could cost some 9,000 jobs.</para><para>For Senator Stott Despoja to come in and say that it is just an anomaly basically shows that, once again, she has not done her homework. I just wish she would take Australian jobs as seriously as she takes Australian music. `Give them circuses but forget about 
 the bread' seems to be the line here tonight. She told us, in terms of  Copyright Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997 , that there is detailed consideration of all the facts and figures and extensive assessment by the Australian Democrats and that they were treating it seriously. Why hasn't she done the same thing with respect to schedule 3? It is something that I am really concerned about. If she is going to go ahead and make a decision on schedule 3 thinking it is just a minor technical anomaly along the way, she has got it wrong.</para><para>Could I say to her again that this is, and should be, an issue of concern. The Bailey case came through in 1986, some 12 or 13 years ago. The Australian marketplace has been opened up extensively in that 13 years, not just through changes to the Trade Practices Act but through the total globalisation of many parts of our economy. There is a lot more competition in the marketplace now. What we have saidâand what the Australian Democrats have said up until this debateâis that when you do globalise, when you do open up, you have to have an assessment made of the impact on Australian industry. You also have to see how you handle the impact on individuals who may lose their jobs or lose some property rights in the process.</para><para>Senator Murray has spent a bit more time on this issue. I do not agree with Senator Murray's position, but I am very deeply concerned about Senator Stott Despoja. She should have spent more time before she came in here and made a very poor contribution.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>5721</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI would like to deal with two senators' contributions. Senator Bolkus, I will get to the serious questions you have asked second, if I may. Firstly, I will briefly deal with Senator Lundy's remarks. We do consider the two issues to be separate. The question is whether we should vote against them both. Perhaps I can draw an analogy like this: if you took a recording of Midnight Oil and put 10 different labels on it, it would still be Midnight Oil. If you take the issue of non-infringing accessories, the attention is to the label, not the product. That is the difference. Where you are dealing with music or books, you are dealing with the product and 
 not the packaging. In schedule 3, we are dealing with non-infringing accessories, the copyright which attaches to the packaging.</para></talk.start><para>I think the really serious question is not whether it is a separate issue, although I strongly believe it is, but the point that Senator Bolkus has raised as to what the potential effects of changing law on copyright and non-infringing accessories are. Senator Bolkus, if I miss any of your questions, please draw my attention to it. If I may respond to your remarks, you have indicated that this problem has been around a long time; I think you mentioned seven or eight years. My count is 15 years. I think it was first referred to a committee in 1983 by the newly elected Labor government at that time. It certainly has a long history. The fact that it has not yet come to resolution, if you like, may indicate the strengths of the competing arguments. You are without doubt correct in stating that there is a strong competing argument on either side. That being so, we are in a situation here where we are having to assess the evidence before us.</para><para>The group that is opposed to schedule 3âloosely termed the brands coalitionâdoes, as you know, include some of the most powerful brand forces in the world. Brand protectors like that are often accused of buying the best lobbying that money can buy. That group has contracted Price Waterhouse, which is an internationally reputed organisation. If you look at the survey of Price Waterhouse, it is subjective. By that I mean that the company went out and asked a series of business people what the effects would be. If I were a business person and I have something which is worth something to me and somebody comes and asks me what the effect would be, I would put the most negative side on it, naturally. I think that is an appropriate reaction.</para><para>I am inclined to think that the Price Waterhouse survey shows the very worst consequences. I would not automatically accept all its findings, but I am not so naive as to think that there will not be negative downsides. Of course, if there is a negative downside with a business, there is a danger of losing jobs. Having seen the job programs that the Labor 
 Party put in in its last years of government, I think that it became a government which was concerned in this areaâand all of us do concern ourselves with that issue. Of course those businesses which will grow as a result of this change will create jobs. I am not in a position where I am able to judge, quite frankly, whether the net effect will balance out or not.</para><para>Of course the best lobbying money can buy has put the best picture before us. The government were, I suppose, foolish enough not to commission their own counteracting assessment. So I think Senator Bolkus has correctly painted the picture of the downside, but we should respect the fact that there is an upside. For those businesses that grow as a result of this, there will be job creation, sales growth, profits growth, lower prices and greater competition. In my minority report way back in October 1997 I outlined clearly the two opposing cases.</para><para>There is another point we need to makeâand I am not going to refer in detail to the speech I made during the second reading debate, which filled up the full 20 minutes and was enlivened by an exchange with my good friend Senator Murphy. We have put our position as clearly as we could there. I think in all this we should recognise we are not doing away with copyright and we are not doing away with the protection that is afforded by copyright; we are doing away with a device of using Customs quickly and cheaply to interact where there are contractual inadequacies with any distributor's arrangements.</para><para>If we have arrived at this decision, Senator Bolkus, we now really need to come to what you have spelt out, which are a set of precautionary principles. I should advise you that we will not vote for the withdrawal of schedule 3. We do, however, think that your idea of there being exemption by regulation for any industries by the minister was a good one. However, the actual device you proposed to usâand you were kind enough to show it to us in advance of this debateâwe felt did not do the job and, as you know, we have circulated an amendment which attempts the same approach from a different direction. You will 
 of course argue that it is not as strong, but we will argue that it is appropriate.</para><para>The second precautionary principle you have introduced is to recognise that, if the government puts an 18-month delay until such time as these provisions become contractually binding, you should use the intervening period successfully and credibly for an appropriate reference. You have circulated for the committee your amendment No. 1083. I would like to add a little to that because I think it is a little narrow. I think that is a first-rate idea because that reporting date in August 1999 is well before the 18 months.</para><para>This government tells us it is seriously concerned about jobs and economic downsides. If the result of that references committee evaluation was extraordinarily down-classed, the government would no doubt assess it and make adjustments to its law appropriately. I would expect that. If, on the other hand, Labor are returned as the government after the election, I would expect them to take the same approach. So certainly we would have no objection to a further detailed examination, but I would suggest that this reference be enlarged somewhat. I hope that, Senator Bolkus, covers the necessary response to the questions you asked.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>5723</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise briefly to respond to the rather personal and I thought patronising comments made by Senator Bolkus. The Australian Democrats' position has been outlined by Senator Murray during the second reading debate. The position that I put forward is no different from that of Senator Murray's. What I did tonight was put on record the difference between packaging and labelling and the sound recording issue when it came to parallel imports. In the interests of facilitating debate, partly requested by Senator Murphy, I restricted my comments to that issue.

He was implying that we have not done our home 
 work. We have, and what we are doing is trying to explain and put on record the importance of not only considering this issue but recognising the distinctions in relation to parallel importing and various effects, be it in relation to packaging, labelling or sound recordings. We have agreed to the 18-month delay and we are expecting you to support our amendments in relation to regulations.</para></talk.start></continue><para>With these two measures, we believe that your concerns, as you have outlined them, will be addressed. We also think, as a result of doing so, that the minister will be in a position to exclude those industries you have referred to which you suspect will be adversely affected or have been adversely affected in some way. We recognise that there are going to be some of those effects to which you have referred and we have addressed them. My position is no different from Senator Murray's, but I sought to make very clear this debate in relation to another debate and I emphasised the differences in those particular copyright laws. I do not understand how mine is a goose of a position, but you do not say the same thing of my male colleague.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>5723</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI have just a few things, and I will start with Senator Murray's comments about the big difference between music and T-shirts. I can tell Senator Murray that I have come across Midnight Oil CDs and CDs from quite a number of Australian performers in some parts of the world. I have bought them and brought them home and they are either not Midnight Oil or a very scratchy version of Peter Garrett. If that is what you base your distinction on, I think you need to think again. Think about it in terms of T-shirts. You can buy a dozen or so Billabong T-shirts all over the world. In fact, you can go to Patpong in Thailand and buy all the number you like. You might have the Billabong label, if they spell it properly and sometimes they do, but you will not have the same T-shirt, you will not have the same material. To try to draw a distinction on those grounds is something which really does not take you all that far.</para></talk.start><para>You are in a sense blinded by this competition argument. You said that the assessment of the evidence has been done by one side of 
 the debate, and you also say that they would be pushing their particular side of the argument aggressively and may not be given the full impact of the argument. I do not disagree with that at all. I am sure that some of the positive consequences may not have been taken into account, but the point that both you and I have been concerned about for some time now is that we are asked to open up an area but we are asked to do so without a full and proper analysis of the impact.</para><para>You have recognised that potentially there could be all sorts of dire consequences in terms of jobs, but you also said in your contribution that you do not find yourself in a position to judge the relative merits, and that is exactly the point that we are making. We are not in a position to judge the relative merits because the government are pushing the cart before the horse. They have not done the inquiry. They have not done the economic study.</para><para>When I was in the cabinet, and it was for quite a number of years, we were required to do economic assessments and produce economic impact statements for cabinet. If this government are going down the same road, they must have one available to them. If they have one available to them, then they should produce it to us. If they are not going down that road, they should be. Whether they are or not within their cabinet process, in a process like this when we are talking about a potential big impact on people's lives and corporate lives, don't you think there is a responsibility for them to come to us before they deregulate this area?</para><para>The government have not commissioned a survey. You say that you are not in a position to judge, but we say that you should not just follow the blind script of economic rationalism. Don't just say to us that there will be greater competition and greater job growth when, in so many of these industries, there is a lot more competition than there was in 1986 at the time of the Bailey's case, but the impact may be great on industry after industry. You do not address the issues of quality and product safety which we think are still important. This is a mechanism through which, if the government wants to proceed 
 with it, we could force through some pretty important protections for consumers, but that could only happen if there was a full process of analysing the impact of this decision.</para><para>I suppose what I am saying at this particular part of the debate is that we did discuss an opting in approach for regulation to allow industries to be brought under the umbrella of schedule 3 and its impact only if the government can prove that they should be so brought in. We see your opting out proposal, I must say, as an unworkable one, so we are not going to support that. Can I just say in passing that Senator Stott Despoja did address the music issue.

The review of intellectual property legislation, which will include the Copyright Act, will look at the costs, benefits and the likely effects on competition and the economy generally, amongst other things.

Back to the serious matters on hand. Senator Bolkus, let me try again to explain the difference between the two bills we are dealing with. If you get Midnight Oil pirated or copied, it is still Midnight Oil; it is just a battered, corrupted and scratched version of it. It is a bit like if you have been through a soccer game: you do not look the same as when you began. If you took Midnight Oil manufactured in Australia and put 10 different labels on it, it would not be an infringement of the product; it would be an infringement of the label because the product itself would remain the same. If you take 10 different bottles of perfume and you put the same label on each of them, they are not the same product.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The argument that is put on the label problem is that different products can come in with the same label, but it is the label to which you must attach the importance. We merely say it is the product which is most important. I do not think we should argue about that. I think the issue is that which Senator Bolkus and Senator Murphy rightly raisedâwhether or not the net effect of this would be to the economic and social benefit of Australia. You argue that it will not; we 
 argue that it will. We clearly distinguish between those two things and I think we should not get side-tracked with them.</para><para>You did say to me that we had not dealt with the arguments of those who are against the government amendments. But we have dealt with them at length not only in our speeches during the second reading debate but also in our minority reports. Just for the purpose of this committee stage, let us say the following things to you. Firstly, the arguments offered against the government amendments were that the parallel imported product may not be of the same quality or standard as the authorised imported product. That is true; of course that is true. The problem we are dealing with is not whether or not that is so but whether the remedy that is being used is appropriate.</para><para>The view of the previous government in their report and the view of this government is that the customs mechanism on non-infringing accessories is being used in a perverted fashion for something that should not be its purpose. If a product is imported which is not of the same quality or standard as the authorised imported product, it either breaches the distributor agreement with the brand owner and manufacturer and becomes their problem or it breaches trademark, patent or copyright. The problem is that the remedy may be a little more costly, and we accept that.</para><para>The second issue is whether parallel imported products get a free ride on advertising and marketing by the authorised distributor. That argument is well put, but as soon as you deal with those arguments you have to deal with the problems of similar goods which are easily substitutable or highly differentiated goods which you have difficulty in substituting. The free ride arguments again arise on whether brand owners and manufacturers are allowing other persons who receive their goods to embark on sending these goods into other markets.</para><para>The third argument is that Australian jobs will be at risk. You misrepresented or misunderstood my response to you. I said we were not in a position to evaluate the competing arguments about jobs. That is because 
 those are subjective assessments. Senator Murphy is quite right, neither he nor I could know whether it is 9,000 jobs or 4,500 jobs. He is also quite right in saying that, if it were 4,500 jobs, that would be a serious matter. I cannot assess where the line falls. It is our view that the job improvement will be greater than the job loss, but that is a subjective assessment.</para><para>The next area is that parallel imports will not necessarily be significantly cheaper. That is true. Some will not be and some will be. We have several pages which indicate that they will be substantially cheaper.</para><para>The next case that the opponents have is that parallel importing will inhibit the development of future markets in Australia. I must say I find that a very difficult one to swallow, but it may be so with one or two industries. They then go on to say a strong case has not been made for the changes. I thought that the Labor government in 1992 did make a strong case and I think that the government has made a strong case, but I recognise the countervailing arguments. They also say that alternative Australian legal remedies for preventing product imports on grounds of misrepresentation, health and safety and different constituents are slow, costly, ineffective, impractical and inadequate in comparison to copyright law.</para><para>That is the list of arguments against those things. They are not saying that health and safety protection does not exist. It does. They are saying that going to Customs just made it easier than going to the government and saying, `Here's a problem.' They are not saying that the legal remedies on misrepresentation do not exist. They are just saying that going to Customs is much easier than going to court. They are not saying that, if the product has been distorted in some fashion, they do not have legal remedy. They are saying that not going to Customs makes it harder to attack.</para><para>We are saying that the whole process of non-infringing accessories being dealt with by using the labels and the Customs provisions to prevent competitive imports is a distortion of copyright and patent law. That is our understanding of the case. The whole issue 
 revolves around whether there be a net economic detriment or a net economic benefit. Neither of us, frankly, in this argument is going to be able to prove that one way or the other. We are simply going to show a different position.</para><para>So my response to you, Senator Bolkus, is to suggest that, yes, we do have to allow provision for ministers to make exception by regulation. You have an amendment to that effect and so do we, just from different directions. Yes, you do have to have a review. The minister has indicated he will conduct a review, which we welcome, and you have proposed a separate Senate review. That is very welcome too because you might get two similar views or you might get two competing views. Once again, the parliament can determine these matters.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>5728</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI want to touch on a couple of issues that arise from Senator Murray's contribution, and they basically show that we really have not had enough analysis of this particular proposal before us.

You can come up with a whole range of arguments. For instance, if you had a particular mini disc recorder imported into Australia under exclusive importing but someone else was able to import another mini disc recorderâthe same label, the same brand name, the same model, the same model numberâit may look on the surface as being a reasonable thing to do. But anyone who has bought mini disc recorders overseas knows that, when they come back to Australia, they have to spend virtually another $60 or $70 buying adaptors, double adaptors and all sorts of other accessories to ensure that they can work under our voltage system. In some circumstances, they do not.</para></talk.start></continue><para>It is the same with buying videos overseas. If you were to allow the import of videos suitable to the American market into AustraliaâI do not mean the video players but the actual videos themselvesâyou would pretty soon find that they would be moving at a 
 much faster or a much slower rate than the ones that work in our video machines.</para><para>The fact that there are such differences in the impact on consumer protection, quality standards and safety in this country is something which you just cannot dismiss. I started this week trying to explain to Senator Harradine that X equals Y equals ABC one day and then something different the next day. I am finishing the week trying to explain to you that a mini disc recorder may not be a mini disc recorder, depending on where you buy it. It may be a mini disc recorder, but it may not be the one that will work for you in Australia. So the quality of those sorts of issues is still alive.</para><para>Once again, I say to you: do not lose this opportunity to have that economic assessment. When we talk about economic assessments here, we are not just talking about the number of jobs that may be affectedâand there are arguments on both sides there. We are also talking, for instance, about what you do with the workers who may miss out. What do you do with a company that may have had a massive investment in the few months before this particular decision, before this legislation takes place?</para><para>A company, for instance, that may have invested, as one has, $20 million over the last six to 12 months or so may have made that decision on a projected income flow from having an exclusive licence. They may have to cop an opening up of the market, but should the government have some responsibility? Should there be some slower rate of implementation with respect to them? All of these issues have not really been addressed by this parliament. They are not anomalies; they are actually quite fundamental under the umbrella of economic issues.</para><para>I honestly believe that we do need more time to consider this. What is the relevance of that sort of review that the minister is promising if we have one side of the parliament, the Democrats, saying that any such review would be subjective, any assessment would be subjective? I would like for us to have custody and control of that review so that it does look at the sorts of things we are concerned about rather than leave it to this government, 
 dry and deregulatory as it is, to have not a public review but a more limited one.</para><para>I have had lots of experience with the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) running reviews out of his department.

Senator Campbell this morning undertook to ensure that all amendments which had been effectively in circulation this morning would be able to be considered and that they would be recirculated in the name of the government if they were in the names of other parties. That applied in relation to Telstra as we have recently seen, but I think there has been some technical problem that did not ensure that that happened in respect of non-government amendments.

This bill proposes to amend the Copyright Act 1968 in a number of ways. The net effect is to allow the parallel importation of CDs.</para></talk.start><para>The Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee held an inquiry into this bill. We received a significant number of submissions. The government's argument for the bill, as set out in the proposalsâand I am taking some of this from the explanatory memorandumâis essentially that there would be a reduction in the price of CDs to the Australian public. Those estimates by the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics vary from $1.60 to $3 and, of course, the ACCC, which certainly seems not 
 to be the consumer's friend, says somewhere between $3 and $10.</para><para>The government also put a proposition that there would be, somehow, an increased availability of sound recording titles to Australian consumers; that retail sales would be more competitive with Internet purchasers; and that retailers would have a choice of suppliers due to competition between local and overseas manufacturers and wholesalers. Last but not least, the government said, `To offer some protection for what is going to be a decimated music industry if this legislation is passed, we will have increased penalties for sound recording piracy, et cetera.'</para><para>The arguments against the bill are clearly those that go to the effects on the music industry, not the least of which is employment in the industry. Studies have shown that the industry employs a significant number of people. Submissions given to the committee during the conduct of its inquiry estimated that some 5,055 people were employed in live performance and merchandising while somewhere in the order of 4,350 people were employed in music retail, a further 33,500 were artists and some 13,300 were song writers. That is not a small number in terms of employment.</para><para>If you look at that in an overall sense, consider the fact that 95 per cent of the CDs sold in Australia are actually produced here. As I say, we have had many arguments put by the government and backed upâI don't know whyâby the ACCC, the supposed consumer's friend. The ACCC has really done absolutely nothing to ingratiate itself with the Australian public by its arguments here.</para><para>If we go to the legal and constitutional committee's inquiry and deal, in the first instance, with the issue of price, we see the government produced no evidenceânot one single scrap of evidenceâthat would support its argument for a price reduction. But, of course, we did receive many submissions that clearly demonstrated that, at best, we could hope that the prices would remain the same but, at worst, in some instances they may even go up.</para><para>No viewpoint was put better than Professor Ron Bewley's. In a submission to the com 
 mittee, he made a very good point with some good examples, saying that there was no evidence that a reduction in import restrictions would increase competition and reduce prices. He said we should consider price comparisons between the US and Australian markets of similar goods. The Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts has come in here on many occasions and said, `Look, it's about the US prices and it's about the prices somewhere else.' When we really look at some goodsâand this is what Professor Bewley adequately pointed outâwe see similar goods that are available in this country without import restrictions.</para><para> Everybody buys torch batteries. I will quote the prices that relate to the small, AA-size Energiser four pack of batteries. In the US they cost $US3.69 which, converted into Australian dollars in February 1998âit would be a bit more now given the exchange rate and the dollarâwas $5.65. But the price in Australia at that time was $7.95. In fact, I bought some the other day and they were about $8.50 or $8.60. Zip disks in a 10 pack cost $US129.99; in Australia, they cost $269. As I said, there are no import restrictions on any of the goods that Professor Bewley compared. All are more expensive, ranging from a low of 30.57 per cent to 40.62 per cent and up as high as 65 per cent.</para><para>Did the government endeavour to actually repudiate that? Did it offer any evidence to the contrary? No. In submissions received from CD retailers who import CDs they said the same thing. Did the government counter that? No. Did the ACCC counter it? No. They just maintained the position that somehow we would get cheaper CDs and that, because of the large retailers and more flexibility for retailers, there would be cheaper CDs.</para><para>Because of the late hour I do not want to take up too much of the Senate's time, but there are three important points that we need to deal with. Firstly, the government was never able to provide any evidence on prices. Secondly, as to protection for the music industryâwhich I will go back to in terms of the effect on employment and loss of incomeâthere were many submissions, none of 
 which the government countered on the basis of how you promote the industry, how you look after the artists, how you look after royalties, et cetera.</para><para>Another very important aspect, which the government clearly seemed to want to hang its hat on in defence of its taking this move, is its capacity to protect the industry through legislative meansâhaving new laws that applied new penalties. We found a fundamental flaw in this first up. Proposed section 130A, which was supposed to provide protection with regard to infringing copyright, goes to the matter of where CDs may be manufactured overseas and of pirated CDs exported to this country and sold on the market in competition with locally produced goods for which there has been no copyright agreement reached.</para><para>The ministerâthis is even picked up in the library's research documentâhad convinced those in the industry about the protection mechanism. The <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest</inline>, which is from the library's Information Research Service, states:</para><para>Proposed section 130A reverses the onus of proof . . . </para><para>That is just how much the minister for communications had convinced the library that that was what he was going to do. He went about the country trying to convince the public. He made a number of radio interviews on a number of occasions. In one interview, John Laws asked him:</para><para>Is it true that the Australian Federal Police have advised the Government that there's no way they could cope with the flood of pirated records if the changes were made?</para><para>He replied:</para><para>No. . . You can increase penalties and you can reverse the onus of proof. . . </para><para>He then goes on ABC Radio National and says:</para><para>If anything we will strengthen it, and the reversal of the onus of proof just makes it easier to track down the source of any illegal imports.</para><para>Then he says on Sydney 2BL:</para><para>We'll be tightening the rules, increasing the penalties, reversing the onus of proof, making it absolutely clear that we won't have a bar of pirated imports.  
</para><para>Again, in a recent doorstop interview at Treasury Place in Melbourne, he says, while talking about copyright laws:</para><para>. . . we will be strengthening them by . . . reversing the onus of proof. . . </para><para>He goes on to make those comments any number of times.	 You may remember that when I asked Senator Alston, who is generally only too willing to give advice when it comes to legal matters, a question in this place about what he means by the reversal of onus of proofâthe Attorney-General's Department said that the government will not reverse the onus of proofâhe stood up in here and said, `I do not know what you mean by the reversal of onus of proof.' It can be found in the <inline font-style="italic">Oxford Dictionary</inline> . It is fairly clear.</para><para>But, that aside, if you go to this issue of the reversal of onus of proof, as is acknowledged by the Attorney-General's Department, in the bill you still have to prove a case. How do we deal with this issue when we get to the rules of evidence? Again, has the government responded to and answered those questions? No. Currently the music industry, with the laws we have in place, spends millions of dollars. It can be said that those laws are restrictive, but they are restrictive for a very good reason. The only way the music industry has any capacity to really protect itself and to protect the Australian artists, composers and all the people who are employed in this industry is through good, sound copyright laws, which we have, and it still spends millions of dollars defending that industry.</para><para>If we remove the parallel import restrictions, we will have imports flooding into this country. We know from Customs the problems that a country like this confronts already in a whole host of areas, let alone the illegal importation of CDs. There is a huge problem. But has the government responded to that, except for Senator Alston to say, `We'll reverse the onus of proof'? He has never acknowledged that, nor has the government. The Attorney-General's Department has because they are contradicting Senator Alston. I am pleased that the Minister for Justice (Senator Vanstone) is in the chamber. She might like to get up and explain how Senator 
 Alston got it so wrong. There is absolutely no capacity for the music industry to protect itself once you remove these laws.</para><para>The ACCC did its usual trick. Alan Fels seems to have become an officer of the government to the extent that we may as well not have an ACCC that is supposed to be a competition and consumer council. He does absolutely nothing with regard to that. I raised the question with him about the closure of small business and the impact on small business this will have in terms of distribution. He said, `Oh, no, no impact at all.' He made another suggestion about how you would fund artists. He said, `We'd get Woolworths and Coles and Myers. They'd provide some money for artists.' Yeah, and pigs might fly too!</para><para>The minister, the ACCC and that other wonderful organisation that is supposed to support consumers made another claim about the removal of the parallel import restrictions. They kept referring to a US Supreme Court case. I said to the minister, `Look what's happened. Look what has happened in the US. There's been a court case that has overturned their laws.' What they failed to tell the people and what they failed to address was the fact that that court case had nothing to do with the laws that we are proposing to remove here. It was a totally different issue. But of course we did not hear the people who champion the cause such as Alan Fels come out and say, `Oh, no, we were wrong.' No. They wanted to continue the myth that they had perpetrated.</para><para>The potential for pirated imports to come into this country is huge. Even Customs admittedâalbeit they did not want to admit it but they did admit itâthat they will have difficulty covering all of the bases. We know that, as is the case now, whether it is CDs or whether it is other matters. In fact, Customs have actually picked up and stopped very few. They said that they rely totally on the existing music industry for the tracking down of illegal imports. That statement alone says it all. Customs will have no hope.</para><para>Why does the government really want to change these laws, apart from the fact that it thinks it is a popular move with the general 
 public over the provision of cheaper CDs? Everybody agrees we would all like cheaper CDs. Nobody would dispute that. But the facts are that there is no evidence that we would get them. Indeed, the indications are that exactly the opposite would happen. There would not be cheaper CDs. We would wipe out our own music industry, which is a valuable export earner for this country, something we should be very proud of and something we should be promoting to a greater extent. But, no, not this government. Give it the old ABC treatment. That is what it wants to do. Here we are at 10 to 11 on a Saturday night. It really does show the disdain that this government has for the music industry, no less than it has for the ABC.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>C16</name.id><name role="metadata">HEFFERNAN</name><name role="display">Senator Heffernan</name></talker><para>âIf you're a farmer you are working all the time.

Before I begin my remarks on this bill and explain the Democrats' rationale for not supporting the government's agenda in this case, I acknowledge the comments by Senator Murphy and the fact that we are debating this bill at five minutes to 11 on a Saturday night. This bill has been rushed through with undue haste, and I do not know if we will get through the second reading speeches, let alone any kind of analysis or comprehensive debate about the ensuing amendments. So, Senator 
 Murphy, I am with you on that one. It is not my idea of a fun night out, and it is probably a bit ironic, considering some of the issues we are debating.</para></talk.start><para>The Senate is considering provisions which would remove copyright control over importation of legitimate copies of sound recordings. The government has claimed, in pursuing its policy agenda, that it has sought a wide range of views through a cross-section of the Australian music industry and copyright industries, including representatives of performers, record producers, music publishers and consumers. The Senate referred this bill to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, which duly inquired and reported in April this year, and we have paid close attention to the findings and the recommendations of that committee.</para><para>The Democrats acknowledge that parallel import restrictions are an ongoing debate in this country, dating back to the Copyright Law Review Committee in 1988. That report was followed by the Prices Surveillance Authority report back in 1990. The Labor government of the day initiated this debate and they courted the issue before deciding to leave it for another time. That was partly due to something that we have readily acknowledged, and that is the complexity of the issue before us.</para><para>The Australian Democrats have welcomed at all stages a debate, a discussion and a review of the intellectual property laws in this country and also the participation of Australians in the international debate about property laws. I have said a number of times in this place that our intellectual property laws generally need to be refined to meet the modern day changes, demands and technologies, whether in relation to copyrights, patents or copyright designs, et cetera.</para><para>The United States case of Quality King Distributors and L'anza Research International and the Australian case of APRA and Telstra highlight the need for ongoing debate and discussion, and they highlight some of the conflicts within our existing copyright laws. I look forward to the opportunity, perhaps at another time, to discuss the digital agenda issues which, I believe, will expose some of 
 these further problems and provide us with opportunities to fix up our laws for the benefit of the community.</para><para>The Democrats position on parallel import provisions in the Copyright Act was put by Senator Andrew Murray in his minority report for the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee considering the Copyright Amendment Bill. He stated:</para><para>The Australian Democrats are opposed to oppressive, unnecessarily restrictive, predatory, monopolistic, oligopolistic or cartel-like market behaviour which can result from abuse of the protection afforded by copyright law.</para><para>Since then, the sound recording bill was also referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. In that report, I concluded on behalf of the Democrats:</para><para>The Australian Democrats recommend this legislation be rejected on the grounds that the projected benefits have not been established or are unlikely to be achieved.</para><para>I acknowledge this was a complex decision because the Democrats are very conscious of the need for territorial distinctions in a number of areas and the specific advantages of being Australian and having a distinctly Australian culture. However, we are also aware that we have to balance that up with the potential benefits that can follow globalisation of our economy through cheaper imports and more efficient allocation of the world's resourcesâhopefully for a greener and sustainable future.</para><para>The Democrats are also aware of the potential adverse effects of globalisation on some sections of our community and, often, the failure of governments to equitably share the benefits of globalisation. When this issue came to the Senate, we observed the opposition's position, which seemed a very simple one at the time. It was to simply oppose the legislation, but the Democrats confronted this with an open mind. We endeavoured to get to the bottom of this debate and worked very hard to expand it into the broader community.</para><para>It was a very wide-ranging consultation process which attracted considerable community attention. We also opened this up through an on-line consultation process, and 
 the responses here were quite significant and exposed what people considered were good and bad aspects of the bill. We were particularly sensitive in this process to the number of responses, on all sides of the debate, which said that they want to see more of an emphasis on new Australian music, whether it is rock-and-roll or whether it is country, and of course there were many laurels for the ABC's Triple J in promoting Australian music.</para><para>We made our offices accessibleâSenator Bartlett and I in particularâfor anyone who wanted to discuss this issue, and the result was quite overwhelming on all sides. We have spoken to just about everyone involved in this area, whether it be the ACA, the ACCC or the range of small, large or independent companies, and I defy anyone to suggest otherwise. This extensive process did highlight the complexity of this debate and the significant effectâand this is something that has not been recognised enough in this is debateâthat  new technology is likely to have, not only on the music industry but on other sound recordings. I cannot say this enough: new technology will make this debate potentially redundant in the near future. So those who are relying on parallel import restrictions of sound recordings to make their businesses work need to recognise that this may change in the future, and they will have to work hard to get ready for the future.</para><para>I would like to turn now to some general issues in relation to copyright. Firstly, copyright can be argued to be a right but it is also an economic tool to correct market failure. Basically, the legislative theory behind the granting of a temporary copyright monopoly can only be justified to overcome the market failure and ensure the efficient production of more copyright materials. Of course, as with most theories, the reality is a lot more complex. The blind applicationâand this is what we have seen in most circumstancesâof this simple theory can have effects across the Australian community and in the existing Australian music industry. It is these effects that we must consider to justify the grant of a parallel import restriction on sound recordings. </para><para>The Democrats are concerned with balancing the public interests in having cheaper sound recordings and making sure that copyright owners, both authors and others, have adequate protection to encourage them and ensure that new materials can be made. The guiding principles should be that the benefits to the community in the granting of the monopoly must outweigh the detriment to the community. We have balanced and weighed up those particular arguments. After considerable thought, the Democrats believe the analysis supporting the government's bill has not taken into account the likely adverse impacts of changing the parallel import restrictions.</para><para>From a range of submissions from individuals and representative organisations, both small and large and including independents, particularly in the Australian music industry, it is apparent that Australian artists, record companies, manufacturers and retailers are likely to be adversely affected by this legislation. The government has recognised some of these consequences and identified local manufacturers, sound recording companies and composers as possible losers in this process.</para><para>It is also worth noting the recent decision in New Zealand to remove their parallel import restrictions. The New Zealand Institute of Economic Research recognised that there were likely to be significant detrimental impacts as a result of this policy change. For example, they specifically noted the adverse effects on creators by reducing the return to creators, the disincentive to invest in new creations and, of course, the legitimate concern about piracyâan issue which has come through this debate in Australia as well. At the end of the day we say these detriments outweigh the potential benefits.</para><para>Other areas of concern for the Democrats include free riding and circumvention of copyright laws, both of which are likely to be detrimental to the Australian music industry. These are all valid concerns and I am sure the government would agree. We do not believe that they have been addressed in this bill.</para><para>We believe that strong and enforceable intellectual property laws are necessary. They 
 can attract technology and foreign investment as a basis for economic development. But, where there are no strict international obligations to meet minimum standards, Australians should carefully consider each circumstance and, of course, look to our national interest. That is what we should be looking to. We understand and we have considered these arguments, but we also believe strongly that we should be looking out for ourselves in that marketplace and dealing fairly and equitably with all comers in the marketplace.</para><para>The premise of the government's legislation, as referred to by the former speaker, was that removing parallel import provisions will reduce sound recording prices. In relation to CD prices, the Democrats are not satisfied that there is any evidence which conclusively establishes that the price of sound recordings will fall if parallel import restrictions are removed. In fact, the data that was presented to the committee was obscured by different comparisons, the age of the data and a whole range of inconsistencies. This analysis is made more difficult, of course, because of the changing global music industry and pricing differences in different intraterritory regions, as well as discounting across age and music styles. These complexitiesâand they are complexitiesâmake any assessment of price difference inconclusive. That is certainly something that was very obvious to us in the committee's deliberations and is reflected in the Democrats' dissenting report.</para><para>The government seems to be relying on the Prices Surveillance Authority report from 1990 to support the bill. But, unfortunately, the major focus of the PSA report was sound recordings made up mostly of cassette tapes. In 1989 cassette tapes made up 56 per cent of the market compared to 29 per cent for CDs. Of course, in 1998 CDs make up 94 per cent of the market. This is significant, given that the PSA report concluded that Australia remain towards the top of the price range for sound recordings, except in the case of CDs. We also consider that it is significant that the PSA report attracted considerable disagreement about its analysis and findings at the time. So it is by no means a reliable study for this bill.</para><para>Interestingly, data presented to the committee showed considerable CD price variation within the Australian market for top-40 release CDs. By way of example, the Spice Girls' <inline font-style="italic">Spiceworld</inline> could be purchased at Brashs Miranda for $19.95, while the same sound recording at HMV City Sydney was $26.95 and at Sanity Roselands it was $29.95. Similarly, Savage Garden's CD was available at Sanity Roselands for $30.95, CC Music Preston for $29.95 and JB HiFi Heidelberg for only $23.95. So the claimed price drops by government and others of up to $7 seem quite unlikely when you can see the absolute differentiation in prices, not only on an international level, but within the domestic market. If price was the only or the most significant factor in this debate, we believe that consumers would be ringing around for the best prices, and the $10 differences would be crippling those most expensive stores already. So, clearly, price is not the only issue here.</para><para>Other data presented to the committee showed price comparisons between Australia and the United States across a range of products, and actually showed that Australian products were generally 30 to 65 per cent more expensive. The significant issue here, of course, is that the United States does have parallel import restrictions in place. Therefore, factors other than parallel import restrictions are involved in the so-called higher prices in Australia compared to the US.</para><para>The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission suggested there was price discrimination, that increased competition would reduce prices and that present prices were the result of monopoly rents. Ron Bewley provided an analysis of the concentration of some Australian industries which showed that the music industry in Australia is not as concentrated as other industries, such asâand I referred to them earlier tonightâthe cinema, tea and toothpaste industries which have been considered to be sufficiently competitive even though they are so-called less competitive than the music industry.</para><para>The ACCC also referred to the findings of the PSA report in relation to `exceptionally high' company profits of an average return to 
 shareholders' funds of 55.2 per cent in 1989, compared to the company average of 10.9 per cent that year. The ABS actually found that operating profit before tax for record companies as a percentage of total income was in fact 6.1 per cent.</para><para>If monopoly profits are being taken, this, yet again, was not established by the committee. The evidence was not definitive because the existing reporting requirements for corporations are not sufficient to give us a clear picture. We acknowledge that. Greater accountability and transparency in corporate accounting is something that the Democrats call for to clear up some of these claims and perhaps give us an insight into the real turnover, profits and finances.</para><para>Perhaps the most significant issue in this debate has been Australian culture. We are a distinct group, with the benefits of multiculturalism and a diversity that makes us unique, interesting and creative. The Democrats believe the Australian music industry makes a significant and valuable contribution to our unique culture. But increasing globalisation and the predominance of entertainment from just a few overseas countries is having a direct effect on our culture. We have to balance these effects by promoting Australian culture, including the Australian music industry.</para><para>Promoting Australian culture with parallel import restrictions alone clearly is not enough. It is not satisfactory. Other forms of direct industry assistance are needed. This might be assistance targeted at those areas which have a particular need. The Australian content requirements should be reviewed, with the possible introduction of recent release Australian music content requirements. We believe that would be a start. We also advocate touring support, Internet set-ups, point of promotion distribution and anything else which can actually produce effective promotion of Australian music. That is something the Democrats strongly promote.</para><para>We are also concerned about the contraction of radio station ownership and the move to syndicated formats, which tend to adversely affect Australian music. I am happy to hear that the government is considering some of 
 these matters now. I assure them that the Democrats are more than happy to provide them with some good ideas on this topic.</para><para>The other big issue here is piracy. The Australian Democrats accept that piracy is detrimental to sound recording copyrights. An issue before the committee was the level of piracy and how parallel import restrictions actually reduced piracy. I am concerned that the new technology which allows sound recordings to be stored and reproduced means that copying is likely to become easier to do and harder to detect. This is significant because the bundle of rights that is copyright is not the same as the traded good. The Australian Democrats support measures directed at reducing piracy, particularly electronic piracy.</para><para>Royalties are another significant issue. Royalties are the only financial return to Australian artists for their sound recordings. Therefore, the adverse affects on royalties are a serious issue. The Democrats concluded that this is another issue on which this legislation should be rejected. Even though the majority of Australian artists record, manufacture and sell their music in Australia, we are concerned that the removal of parallel import restrictions will open the way for their music to be taken offshore and imported back into Australia. This will undermine their royalty flows. The Australian Consumers Association showed royalties to be around 24 per cent of the cost of a CD in 1997. This is a substantial proportion of the value of a sale and is likely to provide considerable cost benefits if the royalty payment can be reduced or avoided. This bill does not address this issue.</para><para>The impact of this bill on jobs remains unclear. The committee heard a high mark of jobsâ50,000 jobsâpotentially being affected, but we also heard a low mark of around 3,886 jobs. Of course, the true level is somewhere in between. This is an important issue. We know perfectly well that we should not be squandering jobs for the sake of untried economic theories. We should make sure that we are not left with low paid, low skilled jobs when we could have access to better paid, high skilled jobs which will benefit all Australians. </para><para>As a sweetener for this bill, the government has proposed reversing the onus of proof. The evidence before the committee raised considerable doubt as to whether or not this measure would achieve its desired ends.</para><para>I have set out the major concerns that the Democrats have with this bill in relation to costs, piracy, royalties and Australian culture. It has been a complex decision, but we have made the correct one. We have concerned ourselves with the likely impacts of technology which will make our decision potentially redundant or irrelevant in the near future. We believe that, on balance, this bill in its present form will not achieve the aims set out by this government. The impact on Australian artists, possible royalty reductions and piracy are significant. For those reasons, we strongly oppose the bill before us and the economic theory on which it is based. I seek leave to incorporate the last remaining paragraphs of my speech if that is acceptable to the chamber.</para><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The speech read as follows</inline>â</para><para>The specific market conditions, the bill's increased piracy measures and the global actions to reduce piracy are not sufficient, in my opinion, to protect Australian artists' sound recording copyrights and the existing delicate balance relied on by Australian artists to reap the rewards of their copyright are threatened by piracy.</para><para>I am concerned that even though the majority of Australian artists record, manufacture and sell their music in Australia, the removal of parallel import restrictions will open the way for their music to be taken offshore and imported back into Australia. This will undermine their royalty flows. The Australian Consumers' Association showed royalties as proportion of the cost of a CD in 1997 to be 24%. This is a substantial proportion of the value of a sale and is likely to provide considerable costs benefits if the royalty payment can be reduced or avoided. This bill does not address this issue.</para><para>The Australian Democrats are always reluctant to reverse the onus of proof without some very good reasons. We have not been convinced this measure will stop piracy and we think the plaintiff will still be required to make a case, and will be open to significant penalty for the slightest evidence from the defendant. This does not appear to assist possible plaintiffs.</para><para>However, artists and those employed in the Australian music industry need to re-assess their industry 
 in light of the evolving technology to deal with substantial changes just around the corner. I believe these advances will impose change and reform on this industry. These reforms are not distant and the industry at every level must address these changes. The Government has a role in assisting this change, and I hope there will be positive and collaborative move to make Australian music, as a key element of our distinct and unique culture, a success for the future.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>23:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>5744</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe Greens are opposed to the <inline ref="r378">Copyright Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997</inline> . I am not going to elaborate greatly on the words of the speaker before me or the speaker after me. Being sandwiched between Senator Stott Despoja and Senator Lundy frees me up to be a little bit self-indulgent rather than explanatory. Members opposite will agree that the argument that Senator Stott Despoja has put was extremely enlightening, and I think, from the looks on faces opposite, it may have changed a few minds. I have no doubt that it will be followed by an equally enlightening dissertation from Senator Lundy.</para></talk.start><para>I, like Senator Stott Despoja, was very open minded about this legislation when it hit the decks here last year. We knew it was complex and we knew that it was not the first round. I decided to keep a completely open mind about it, recognising that at the two ends of the debate were, firstly, the carrot of a drop in prices for CDs if the legislation went through, and, secondly, the stick belting the Australian music industry around the head if the legislation went through. It was with those two things in mind that we set out to find out what to do.</para><para>The Australian Consumers Association was off the mark very quickly. I find few people more impressive in lobbying than Mara Bun and her associates. They do a phenomenal job for consumers right around this country. They did produce a very compelling case for a fall in prices of CDs were this legislation to get through.</para><para>Politics being a matter of the short term, something has happened since then to knock some of the stuffing out of that argumentâthat is, the fall in the Australian dollar. This means that the comparative gain they were able to put to us in terms of prices if this 
 legislation went through has been somewhat whittled away in the meantime. I recognise that if the dollar goes back up, and if the so-called floodgates are opened and imports are allowed into the country, so the gain to consumers may well increase, too.</para><para>On the other hand the very compelling arguments from the music industryâincluding my good and long-term friend Peter Garrett, but many others, both performers and creators, not to speak of some small retailers as wellâthat this legislation would have a devastating effect on the home-grown industry had to be taken into account. I was extraordinarily impressed by the genuineness of Mr Ross Gengos, who has Abels Music here in the ACT, and the arguments he put forward against this legislation. They were genuine, they were very compelling and they gave me reassurance that the right thing to do was to block this legislation.</para><para>Here was a retailer who felt that the government had got it wrong. Here was a retailer, moreover a home-grown business which puts its money back into the local market, that was not frightened by the argument that to oppose this legislation was simply to support the multinationals. From Peter Garrettâif I can truncate his argumentâcame the news that performers like him, or bands like Midnight Oil, may get up to $1.70 in royalties per CD under the current circumstances. In other countries it is different. If the CDs were to be produced in Malaysia or Singapore or, more particularly, the Philippines, the return to the Australian performer might be as low as 30c, or even lower. Now that is a dramatic difference.</para><para>If we have the imported CDs competing with the Australian CDs successfully, obviously what we are faced with is that the local performers and the creators behind them are going to lose out dramatically. Add to that the concern about piracy and the potential for large numbers of CDs to come into the country, with no stipend at all going to the performers who create the music in this countryânone at all. You can see why the home-grown music industry is very worried indeed. </para><para>The argument about multinationals was one that worried me quite a bit, because I am no defender of multinationals. There are too many woodchipping corporations ripping the heartland out of the world heritage forests of Tasmaniaâand one in particular, North, is about to push into the Jabiluka valley with a uranium mine in the north of this countryâfor me to want to get very close to corporations with those sorts of scruples. However, we cannot tar them all with the one brush. But when Senator Alston, the minister in charge of this legislation, started to criticise me for lining up on the side of the multinationals, I recognised that the argument might have been very hollow indeed.</para><para>We had to try to find somewhere in the world where this issue might already have been run. Norway was the case in point. In between 1963 and 1993, Norway dropped the protection of the local industry. It was found that the local industry did get knocked about, but that the prices did not necessarily fall. So in 1993 Norway reintroduced the prohibition on the easy import of music from elsewhere other than from the European Union.</para><para>The proof of the pudding there is that the parliament in Norway, a country with similar circumstances to our own, voted just a couple of months ago to defend the parallel importing arrangements they have in that country and not to change them. The experience they had had in the past did create problems for the industry.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="metadata">KEMP</name><name role="display">Senator Kemp</name></talker><para>âYou're wrong, Bob.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>QD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name></talker><para>âI am sure the minister, who did not know before but has just checked with his advisers, is the one who is wrong, not me.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="metadata">KEMP</name><name role="display">Senator Kemp</name></talker><para>âNo, you are inventing arguments to support multinationals.

In the approach we made to Senator Alston's office we said, `We think we are listening to the arguments of the local music industry. We'd like the consumers to have the potential for lower prices, but you come up with a package that is going to help the music industry in this countryâthat really is going to help them. Don't come up with something like those multinationals are talking about, flagged when the Keating government tried this legislation, because they welshed on that. Come up with something that we can see has got teeth in it and is really going to protect the local industry.'</para></talk.start></continue><para>But the government did not; Senator Alston's office has still to come out with such a package. You would have thought that if the government really wanted to win this debate they would have come out with a package that was going to stimulate the Australian music industry which could have, amongst other things, raised the mandatory content of Australian made music going out on the airwaves from radio around this country. But, of course, they did not.</para><para>I do not know how Senator Alston runs his office. Maybe he is too busy beating the ABC around the head and trying to scare people about the ABC. I do not know why the office failed to come up with a package. I thought to myself: if Senator Alston, with all the 
 backing of government, really wants this, the government could come up with a package that is going to reassure people like me about the music industry. They did not really try. They came around and asked, `Have you got some ideas, Senator Brown?' and I said, `Well, I have, but I really do not know the industry well enough. You come up with the package that is going to convince us.' But it did not arrive. I can honestly say that that was the clincher. I suspect that Senator Alston simply came up with the economic rationalist doctrine: get rid of any protection, throw it open to the market and, at the same time, pull the rug from under the home-grown industry.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="metadata">KEMP</name><name role="display">Senator Kemp</name></talker><para>âBut you are the ones supporting the multinationals.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>QD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name></talker><para>âThe senator opposite says, `You are supporting the multinationals.' Who is going to make the profits from imported CDs if we open the floodgates? The answer is the multinationalsâthe ones who operate branches elsewhere as well as those they operate here in Australia. That argument does not hold water.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I want to thank everybody who lobbied me on this. It has been a very difficult matter. From the Australian Consumers Association through to the people in the industryâin all its diversityâthe lobbying has been clear and concise. It has been very heartfelt at times, but it was done in good spirit, and it has left me with the very clear idea at the end of the day that I am making the right decision here.</para><para>I also want to comment on my home newspaper, the <inline font-style="italic">Mercury</inline>. A couple of weeks ago, it printed a full-page article against my stand on this issue. A number of letters were sent to the <inline font-style="italic">Mercury</inline> responding to that article. None of them have been printed. If that were to become the even-handedness with which debates in this country are run, then none of us would be adequately informed or would get a fair go when trying to determine the facts on which to make decisions on important issues like this. As it is, I feel good about backing the Australian industry. I feel good about having made a tough decision which is going to ensure that music and the creative artsâthe things that help to make Australia different and that give us pride in this coun 
 tryâwill be defended. I oppose this legislation and hope that other members of the chamber who may not have made up their minds will go the same way.</para><para>Finally, I have discovered that Australian consumers do not mind paying a dollar or two extra to support their industry. They really do not. They can think beyond the dollar being the only measure that is important to this country. It is a pity that Senator Alston and the government were not a little closer to these consumers. They would find out that there are other values in this country besides an open market and the lowest dollar being the determinant of everything that is good, true or valuable for Australians.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>23:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>5746</page.no><name role="metadata">Lundy, Sen Kate</name><name role="display">Senator LUNDY</name><name.id>7G6</name.id><electorate>ACT</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI also rise to indicate that the opposition will be opposing the <inline ref="r378">Copyright Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997</inline> . One of the more interesting observations throughout this debate has been the sheer procrastination of the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts (Senator Alston) in presenting this bill. Time after time, we have seen it turn up on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline>  before being shifted down the legislative program. The reason for this is of course that the government did not get it right the first time around, and they are still not getting it right. They are still trying to find ways to make this flawed and faultyâand, in fact, irretrievably badâpolicy work. We have watched this legislation moving down the government's program of business to the point where at 11.30 on a Saturday night, on the last day of this sitting, we finally have the opportunity to debate the Copyright Amendment Bill (No. 2).</para></talk.start><para>I want to canvass a couple of the features of the legislation. Firstly, there was the shameful attempt by the government to utilise taxpayers' money to fund an information campaign prior to this legislation even being dealt with in this place. The government knew that, if people were asked how they felt about the future of the Australian music industry as compared with the government's unprovable claim that somehow CD prices would drop, a $750,000 campaign would be needed to prop up their assertion. The government needed to 
 spend that amount of taxpayers' money just to give this bill some credibility upon bringing it to this place. The minister has consistently been unable to demonstrate the facts in this debateâeven to gain credibility with his own backbench. Who else do we find in the list of people within this information strategy that the government had to target? Senator Kemp, you are on the front bench, but all your backbench members were actually listed by this minister as targets in this information strategy to be funded by taxpayers. Where is the credibility of the policy they are putting forward?</para><para>Let us look at who else was targeted within this information strategy: editorial staff of major newspapers and of radio and television stations. There is nothing like running a taxpayer funded campaign to target the means by which we communicate in this country. All this was necessary because this is a flawed policy and it needs all the help it can get.</para><para>As we have just heard from Senator Brown in his due consideration of this matter, there was an attempt at negotiations between him and the minister concerning a contemporary music fund and, perhaps, a little bit of industry support designed to offset the more negative effects of parallel importation.</para><para>I have no doubt that those discussions were in good faith on both parts, but, once again, the minister failed to deliver. Even his own frontbench, the cabinet, did not find it within their hearts to support a boost to industry development with respect to contemporary music. The minister failed to deliver. Hence, you have already heard from Senator Brown the implications of that failure to deliver. The issue goes on.</para><para>As the last vestiges of credibility for Minister Alston slip away, we find now a series of amendments put forward by the minister which seek to address one of the fundamental flaws within the legislation, and I will turn to those throughout my contribution. The fact that these amendments have come up at this point that address some of the highly critical implications of the effect of this bill on our international obligations only serves to highlight once again the fact that it 
 is unworkable and bad for the Australian contemporary music industry.</para><para>Turning to the report, as with most contentious bills, we were afforded an opportunityâin fact, it does not always happen with this government; they tend to gag and guillotine debatesâto conduct a Senate inquiry with respect to this bill. It is very important to note that the report arising from that inquiry did not enjoy bipartisan support. In fact, the government chose to stand alone with respect to that report. The Labor Party and the Australian Democrats prepared their own report. Some 192 submissions were received by the Senate committee and over 160 opposed the bill. The only real supporters of changing the Copyright Act to allow parallel imports of recorded music were major retail chains like Woolworths, Professor Fels from the ACCC and, not surprisingly, the suitable government departments that were the proponents of this policy shift in the first instance.</para><para>There is no broad community or industry support. The majority of submissions expressed the view that this policy is harmful to the industry. What is most critical to understand is that this bill will wipe out the private property rights that exist on hundreds and thousands of musical works. The restriction on parallel imports ensures that those Australians who write and perform unique and original works receive the royalty payments to which they are entitled. This is the principle being undermined with respect to this bill. Despite the simplistic arguments by the ministerâthe minister for irrelevance on priceâour opposition to parallel imports is based on protecting our cultural identity. Along with protecting our cultural identity is the protection of thousands of jobs and thousands of small businesses that rely on that industry.</para><para>In challenging the minister's assertions, I would like to first turn to the claim that there is some sort of monopoly. In fact, there are five multinational companies operating. Unlike other areas of distribution of content, at least the parent companies of those five major companies are spread across five different countries. Regardless of that, there are well over 250 independent Australian 
 owned record companies. What sort of monopoly is that? I do not believe one exists. It is a reflection on the minister's adherence to very simplistic mantras. We heard Senator Kemp interjecting earlier. In fact, he sat there and said it is about monopolies. How can it possibly be about monopolies, Minister? It is extremely misleading for you to describe five multinational subsidiaries and 250 Australian record companies as representing a monopoly.</para><para>There is also the issue of our international obligations. Australia is a signatory to the Bern convention for the protection of literary and artistic works. We are also signatories to the Rome convention that protects performers and producers of sound recordings. As a member of the World Trade Organisation, we signed the TRIPS agreement on intellectual property rights. I must stress that most other countries have sought stronger controls over intellectual property and copyright. The members of the European Union and North American free trade agreement have already ruled out parallel imports of CDs. Yet this government is going the other way. It is going backwards by trying to wind back copyright protection.</para><para>In their scrabbled attempt to try to address the concerns raised, I am sure that, if they were doing their job by the Attorney-General's Department about the potential infringement upon these international conventions, we would see pulled together a series of amendments which would make some pitiful attempt to sharpen up the sanctions in the bill and sharpen up the references to these international conventions to try to, again, scrabble together a bill that has any hope of not being completely torn apart by subsequent legal challenges, if they are successful in getting it through.</para><para>This government wants to repeal a system that has allowed Australia to develop an internationally respected music culture. This is what the Australian Music Publishers Association informed the Senate committee:</para><para>Copyright cannot be viewed through the narrow perspective of industry protection. It is the lawfully established, internationally accepted way of defining and protecting creative intellectual products . . . the Australian music industry is not seeking protection in the sense of special treatment. It is 
 seeking to operate on exactly the same basis as our competitors in the English speaking world.</para><para>In considering the implications of this legislation, the Labor Party looked carefully at inquiries conducted in other nations. In England the Monopolies and Mergers Commission concluded that uncontrolled importation of CDs would result in a worse situation for consumers. They found that the removal of parallel import provisions in the UK would be damaging because of the increased risks of piracy and the threat that weakened copyright protection would cause. A report to the Irish government also concluded that parallel imports would erode the share of revenues returned to local composers, publishers, venues, recording and production companies and record retailers. If this was to happen, then their music industry `will wither and die'.</para><para>Most importantly, jobs and prosperity in Ireland were found to be dependent on the protection of intellectual property rights. It is worth pointing out that Irelandâlike Australiaâhas one of the most recognised and respected music industries in the world. It is also worth noting that Ireland looked to Australia for inspiration and guidance on what type of regime to put in place with respect to intellectual property.</para><para>I also want to mention Norway. After experimenting with parallel imports, they recently reversed their decision after a trial period which saw a 40 per cent rise in music piracy and the virtual collapse of their industry. Australia must learn from these examples. This government has shown that they will not. They instead choose to remind blind to overwhelming international evidence that this is bad policy.</para><para>These examples demonstrate that a number of recognised government inquiries have concluded that strong copyright laws are required in order for music industries to survive and thrive. That is the conclusion. Copyright laws also protect those who have invested in and nurture cultural industries. Major record companies do enjoy a level of prosperity; however, Australia benefits in numerous ways from having internationally successful entertainers and performers.</para><para>Then there is the issue of music piracy arising from the uncontrolled imports of CDs. Pirated CDs mean no income for artists, composers or record companies. The Senate inquiries with the Australian Customs Service and the Australasian Mechanical Copyright Owners Society confirmed that parallel imports would make identification and prosecution of pirated music virtually impossible.</para><para>To demonstrate the point, in the explanation circulated with the government amendments, they actually try to address the concerns of this nature raised in the Senate inquiry report, but in the pitiful way of propping up the sanctions by a mere 10 per cent in the vain hope that increasing sanctions in what is effectively an unenforceable law will somehow slow what will be a tidal wave of pirated CDs if this legislation is passed.</para><para>We know CD piracy is particularly rife in Asia, and Emmanuel Candi from ARIA has pointed out that the sophistication of pirates is so advanced that they the facilities to manufacture CDs in container ships that move up and down coastlines. Yet we are told that this does not pose a threat here.</para><para>The Office of Strategic Crime Assessment has forecast an increase in CD piracy due to technological advances and increased skills in avoiding detection. They have told the Minister for Justice and the Attorney-General that there will be an increased demand for criminal enforcement of copyright offences. They also stress that, as piracy is such a lucrative business, the cost of civil action is factored into these people's illegal operations.</para><para>The Australian Copyright Council stated that, if this bill proceeds:</para><para>It will be much more difficult for copyright owners to initiate a customs seizure of pirate recordings because it will be very difficult to differentiate pirate recordings from non-pirate recordings.</para><para>An estimated 20,000 consignments of CDs enter Australia each year. However, the Customs Service does not open or check every container that arrives. Customs inspect an average of two per cent of all cargoes entering Australia. They might check invoices, but they do not have the resources to actually check the containers or boxes.</para><para>Senior police officers advised the music industry piracy investigations that `they will not undertake copyright investigations in any circumstances'. If they found any serious breaches, they would refer them to the vastly underresourced Australian Federal Police, whose job it is to investigate major criminal activities. None of these are viable solutions or viable proposals on behalf of the government to deal with the piracy problem.</para><para>Music industry piracy investigations have seized 270,000 illegal units. By contrast, the Australian Customs Service seized only 1,000. In fairness, the job of Australian Customs is not to check each and every CD to ascertain if it infringes on licensing agreements. Furthermore, the US administration has urged the Howard government not to allow parallel imports because of the piracy problem, but in true arrogant fashion they are still proceeding.</para><para>Before the Senate votes on this issue, we should look very closely at who are the winners and who are the losers from allowing parallel imports of CDs into Australia. The losers list is a long one. It includes the thousands of musicians who play in bands or perform live. Without industry support, the live sceneâwhich employs thousands of Australians directly and indirectlyâwill suffer. The result is massive job losses, and included are the managers, crew members and roadies who support this industry.</para><para>Australian composers and writers of original works need a strong record industry to nurture their intellectual talent. The result of this bill will be less Australian music on the radio and in music stores, and more generic overseas music. Live music venues will suffer. Many of them  will close down as fewer local bands are available and this will in turn force even more people into unemployment.</para><para>Manufacturers of compact discs are the losers because 95 per cent of CDs sold here are made here. These manufacturing jobs will go, along with those people employed in graphic design, negative making, printing and the whole chain of events that occurs in the production of a CD. The advertising and marketing of recorded music brings in millions of dollars, and the future of many 
 music publications, video shows and a host of related industries will be at risk.</para><para>Then there are record stores. The music retail sector employs thousands of Australians, many of whom are specialist sales people. If this bill is passed, Woolies might add another checkout lane, but it will be at the expense of small and family owned businesses right round the country.</para><para>Who are the winners? We know Woolworths will win and a few major retail chains that have the buying power to directly import stock from overseas warehouses. I cannot actually find any other winners. They are the only ones I know. We will just leave it at that.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="metadata">KEMP</name><name role="display">Senator Kemp</name></talker><para>âWhat does the Australian Consumer Association say?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>7G6</name.id><name role="metadata">Lundy, Sen Kate</name><name role="display">Senator LUNDY</name></talker><para>âIt is a short list. The government interjects across the chamber and comes out with its litanies of monopolies, multinationals and things like that, but let us ask who the winners are in this legislation. We know who it is. It will be Woolies and other major chain stores which have the earning power and capacity to buy the quantities that will allow them theoretically to reduce their prices.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I have deliberately left the issue of CD prices until last, because this debate is about copyright protection and ensuring that composers and performers are not ripped off. As the Australian dollar continues to slide, it is now more expensive to buy CDs from Europe and America than it is to purchase an Australian manufactured CD. If imported CDs are so cheap, perhaps Senator Alston can explain why US and European CDs are selling for between $35 and $40 in Sydney.</para><para>While Senator Alston is answering that one, perhaps he could retract the statement that Australians pay more than consumers in Europe and North America for CDs. The claim by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) that under this amendment imported CDs will sell in Woolies for around $24 is patently ignorant and demonstrates a complete lack of understanding of this issue and the economics that traverse it.</para><para>The Liberal member for Sturt, Christopher Pyne, let slip on Foxtel on 14 May the real agenda when I asked him what evidence he had to support the claim that CD prices would drop by up to $7. He said that the government's guarantee was based on the fact that Woolies told them so. That is it; that is all the evidence they have. That is what this legislation is based on, and the whole credibility of the government's claim that somehow the  Copyright Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997  will result in some benefit for consumers is based on a Woolies say-so to the PM. Well, well, well! Once again we have very sophisticated policy making on behalf of this intellectually deficient Minister Alston.</para><para>There will be no winners from the government's proposals. Consumers will not enjoy cheaper prices. Small retailers will be squeezed out and investment in Australian music will decline and jobs will be lost. Like musicians and composers in New Zealand, Australian musicians and composers will migrate to countries that reward creativity with strong and effective intellectual property laws. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>23:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>5750</page.no><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name><name.id>SF4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI have been listening to the contributions on the <inline ref="r378">Copyright Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997</inline> , including those made by Senator Lundy, Senator Brown, Senator Stott Despoja and Senator Murphy. They have put forward the case why this bill should not be passed, because the evidence quite clearly is against the passing of this bill. If you look at the argument put against that made by the senators I have mentioned, you have to go to the second reading speech. The second reading speech, as you know, Mr Acting Deputy President, is that speech which underpins this billâit sets out the logic, if you like; it sets out the reasons; it sets out the basis upon which the government is putting forward its caseâand on the first page it states:</para></talk.start><para>At present, the provisions of the Copyright Act can be used by the owners of copyright in sound recordings to stop anyone else importing copies of their sound recordings.</para><para>What is wrong with having an ability to stop somebody else from selling your goods? Is the government's proposition that the present 
 law which stops people from selling cars belonging to other people should be repealed, that people should be able to sell the cars of others?</para><para>We are looking in this bill at people who write music, who discover music and who add music to our culture. They also expect to get a return from their efforts. They have to go and earn their money. Their money is not determined beforehand, as is the pay of everybody in the well of this chamber. Everybody here gets a regular pay from the resources of the Commonwealth, and that gives a bedding to those people who are in the well of this chamber. We do not feel the cold hand of doubt as to whether or not we are going to earn some money from the abilities that we may have.</para><para>This bill must be approached on the basis that we are people who are well paid, regularly paid and paid according to an act and that we do not have to worry about going out and earning our own living. The Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts (Senator Alston) will remember those hard days when his ability, which was considerable, was the basis upon which he earned his fees, not a regular payment according to a program set down by a tribunal.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>656</name.id><name role="metadata">FORSHAW</name><name role="display">Senator Forshaw</name></talker><para>âHe has had a hard day today.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>SF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name></talker><para>âHe has had a very hard day.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>LD4</name.id><name role="metadata">ALSTON</name><name role="display">Senator Alston</name></talker><para>âI made real money in those days.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>SF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name></talker><para>âI quoted Charles Dickens the other night, and I think it is proper that I quote him again tonight, because he points out the tragedy where people are not able to get a full return for the efforts they have put into their writing.</para></talk.start></continue><para><inline font-style="italic">Senator Sherry interjecting</inline>â</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>SF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name></talker><para>âPerhaps the Romans and the Greeks denied them this. This was the speech that Charles Dickens madeâand I referred to this the other nightâwhen a banquet was held in honour of the great man at Hartford on 7 February 1842 when copyright law was not as progressive as it is now and when people were not seeking to turn it 
 back, as this bill attempts to do tonight. Charles Dickens had this to say when he was talking about Sir Walter Scott, who was a great writer:</para></talk.start></continue><para>It was well observed the other night by a beautiful speaker, whose words went to the heart of every man who heard him, that if there had existed any law in this respect, Scott might not have sunk beneath the mighty pressure on his brain, but might have lived to add new creatures of his fancy to the crowd which swarm about you in your summer walks and gather round your winter evening hearths.</para><para>That is what we are protecting here. Those people who will listen to music written by Australians, as they take their summer walks and gather round their winter hearths, and those people who have that mighty pressure imposed on their brains, as Charles Dickens would say, and who give us those pleasures should be properly rewarded.</para><para>The minister might well find on re-reading this second reading speech that this harsh statement should be put aside. The statement says, and I will repeat it:</para><para>At present, the provisions of the Copyright Act can be used by the owners of copyright in sound recordings to stop anyone else importing copies of their sound recordings.</para><para>It seems to me to be very reasonable that people should be able to earn money from their intellectual efforts. They do not have the comfort of being paid under a system which returns them a salary, no matter how and to what degree they use their brains. Intellectual property is perhaps the most need of protection in this day and age as new technology comes on board and it is only proper that we have every regard we can for it.</para><para>Further on in the second reading speech the government goes into its justification for this bill when it says:</para><para>Concerns have long been held that the importation provisions of the Copyright Act have been used to obtain higher prices for records and CDs than those prevailing in some other countries, notably the USA.</para><para>As has been said tonight by many speakers, nobody can resist and oppose a system that returns lower prices for anything, as long as all other relevant matters are taken into account. For example, in the Telstra bill that 
 we discussed earlier in the day, this was said on page 14 of the second reading speech:</para><para>Telstra has a vital continuing strategic role in the national economy. Australia's long term national interest therefore demands that it not simply be sold off to the highest bidder but that it remains an Australian owned and Australian controlled corporation.</para><para>The government is saying there that there is more to be taken into account than simply matters of price and that matters such as the strategic interests of the national economy temper the enthusiasm we all have to get lower prices in. And it is the same here. Simply looking at price is not sufficient. The evidence quoted in the second reading speech is that concerns were raised by the Copyright Law Review Committee on which it reported in 1988. That is a decade ago.</para><para>In a matter as vital as this, you would expect more recent evidence than that, so you look for what this more recent evidence is. The second reading speech goes on to say that the Copyright Law Review Committee was followed by an inquiry into the prices of sound recordings by the then Prices Surveillance Authority in 1990âeight years ago. It says:</para><para>The PSA found that prices of sound recordings were unreasonably high in Australia and recommended either partial or full removal of copyright control over importation of legitimate copies, thereby introducing direct competition as a mechanism for reducing prices.</para><para>That is eight years ago. The second reading speech goes on to say that in the meantime the Labor government did not do anything and that that took up some time. And now we come to the present position. The government faces up to that and says it will do something about it, but it will not do anything without regard to possible changes in market behaviour since 1990, which is a reasonable point. There is no evidence produced, except the comment that:</para><para>In our election commitments we said we would consult the industry and the community on the most effective means of lowering prices for music CDs, and we have done so.</para><para>The result of that is it is not detailed, except in terms of conclusions without any evidence to support those conclusions.</para><para>What happened, amongst other things, is that the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee conducted an inquiry into this. As you know, Mr Acting Deputy President, that is perhaps one of the most prestigious committees in this parliament. The majority came back with a report which says that this bill ought be passed. That is a reasonable proposition, if the evidence is there. But if you look at the conclusion and recommendations in chapter 5 of the majority report you will find a couple of comments that give some concern. For example, one is in paragraph 5.18 which says:</para><para>Nevertheless, the Committeeâ</para><para>that is, the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committeeâ</para><para>sees the possible merit in an inquiry which establishes the economics and `work practices' of the industry more definitively and in more detail. Such an inquiry, by an organisation such as the Productivity Commission, would provide useful information in any discussion of the need for a music industry policy as advocated by some who provided evidence to the committee.</para><para>So here we have a report which says that we really need more evidence but which then, having said that, goes ahead and draws a conclusion. The majority report has this to say at paragraph 5.19:</para><para>The Committee received much evidence on the potential effect of the Bill on Australian composers.</para><para>I love my Australian music, Mr Acting Deputy President, and I take it that you do too.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>BH4</name.id><name role="metadata">HILL</name><name role="display">Senator Hill</name></talker><para>âWhat's your favourite, Barney?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>SF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name></talker><para>âI have a lot of favourites, but I mention two of our national songs, the national anthem and <inline font-style="italic">Waltzing Matilda</inline> .

It goes on:</para><para>With some exceptions, the majority of royalties received by Australian composers are derived from recordings of their work by Australian artists, usually the bands of which they are members. These recordings will usually not be internationally released. In only a small number of cases will Australian recordings be made overseas and then imported into Australia.</para><para>The point that was made by the people who gave evidence to the committee was that, unless you had a local music industry that was able to make CDs on which their music was recorded, they were not able to get time on the air, whether through radio or television, and then perhaps go on to be known as great artists around the world. That is the point that was made. Yet this conclusion by the majority does not address that point. It simply gets over it by going on to say in the next paragraph, 5.20:</para><para>Falls in royalty income as a result of lower-priced CDs are likely to be compensated through increased sales.</para><para>The difficulty with all this is that what is being looked at here is policy and a particular attitude to things, and that is fair enough. Paragraph 5.2 of the conclusions of the majority says this:</para><para>In principle and in practice, competitive markets yield the best possible prices for consumers.</para><para>Then it quotes the Australian Chamber of Commerce. Of course the Australian Chamber of Commerce is going to take a particular approach and of course there is a principle that people might want to follow. If you want to follow a particular economic theory, or a theory in anything, fair enough. But the test should be applied, and the test is the evidence. How does the principle face up in the light of the evidence?</para><para>The United States is a place from which music, art, films and matters of the soul generally pour in great abundance. It is very interesting to look at what they say. The chairman of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, Senator Eric 
 Abetz, received a letter from Genta Hawkins Holmes, the US ambassador. She addressed it to `Senator the Right Honourable Eric Abetz, Chairman, Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee.' She made some comments and she said she would circulate a statement, which she did. She gave the committee a statement that has this to say about copyright holders:</para><para>In the view of the United States, elimination of the ability of the copyright holder to control parallel importation of their work is contrary to the basic structure of international copyright protection where protection within each country is granted by the country's laws and limited geographically to its borders.</para><para>She is saying, `Don't go down the path that this bill goes down.' The statement continues:</para><para>The United States maintains that price-distorting practices in the manufacturing, distribution and retail industries that are based on anti-competitive practices should be addressed through anti-competition laws rather than through the unrelated act of lowering the level of protection provided to the copyright holders.</para><para>That is from what is clearly the most successful country in the world, the country that dominates culture, and that is its approach. It says, `Don't go down the path of this bill.'</para><para>In the closing minutes of my address, I would like to say something about the people from the Attorney-General's Department who have worked hard on this for many years now. I see some of them here. They are deserving of great commendation for the work they have done. They have not had success in the sense of getting the bill on the statute books, and I hope they do not tonight. I know they are simply carrying out policy and they have done a lot of work, but in the end, in spite of all that good work and in spite of all the deeply felt and deeply held beliefs that the government has, the evidence in this matter is against this bill going through. If it did go through, it would be unfair on those people who have to face the uncertainty of earning their living. In a certain sense, we earn our living in a very easy way. Perhaps it is not so easy over the last couple of days, but at least it is regular.

It is not a very large bill. As bills go it is a very short bill, but it is a bill which has generated a great deal of community concern, especially from young people and from the music industry. It deals with issues of cultural importance and these often get left out of the economic rationalist equation. Economic rationalism deals with free trade, competition policy and all those things that are pushing a lot of people's buttons at the moment. One example in recent times has been the level of concern and the furore that occurred as a result of a decision in the courts relating to the New Zealand trade treaty agreement. It was not a furore caused by the court decision but rather a concern about the impact of those treaty decisions on legal frameworks within Australia and New Zealand and the impact on local content and so on.</para><para>I bring this up because culture really does get left out in a lot of these considerations of so-called free trade. We know that in the negotiations currently for the Multilateral Agreement on Investment, culture does not get a guernsey. Theoretically, if the Multilateral Agreement on Investment is signed then we may find that on issues of culture, music, theatre and other forms of culture in Australia we are unable to come to a situation where we can continue to develop and nurture Australian culture and Australian industry in cultural areas.</para><para>I am not going to go into the history of this issue of parallel imports and CDs over the last 10 years. I am sure my ALP Senate colleagues have the ability to do so and have covered this area in far more detail than I have or would be able to. Suffice to say that no government has yet found an adequate way to address the parallel import issue of 
 sound recordings. Other people, as we know, have tried.</para><para>In a nutshell, the copyright regime currently provides that in Australia, under the parallel import restrictions found in sections 37 and 38 of the Copyright Act for musical and literary works, and in sections 102 and 103 for sound recordings, it is illegal to buy copies of CDs from an overseas outlet and market these copies in Australia unless a licence is obtained from the person or company in Australia authorised to assert copyright.</para><para>What is the argument under free trade? The free trade argument is that the current system creates a concentration in the market which does not benefit consumers in terms of more open competition. The free trade people also argue that lower prices may stimulate a larger volume of sales and therefore maintain profitability for a large number of players in the industry.</para><para>The most consistent argument put forward by competition and consumer lobbies is that, if copyright holders are able to control the distribution chain beyond the factory gate, opportunities are created for monopolistic exploitation. In this way, large multinational record companies can abuse the parallel import restrictions by ensuring that only their subsidiaries in Australia have access to the company's product. Without competition, they are only limited in what they charge by the general price demands of a CD. They are arguing that they might be controlled by the large companies.</para><para>Another argument put forward for a lifting of the restrictions is that major record companies in Australia, with licences to import from overseas companies, are not interested in catering for minority tastes and take a long time to fill orders. It has been suggested that record companies are only interested in the mass market. There may be a level of truth in this.</para><para>It is important to note that this issue has been a particular thorn in the side of Professor Allan Fels, and he pushed strongly for the lifting of parallel import restrictions when he was head of the Prices Surveillance Authority. 
 During the debate on the issue in 1992 he stated:</para><para>The importation provisions of the Copyright Act impose a barrier to free trade. Without such a barrier it would be possible and profitable for parallel importers to import goods into the high price market from the low price market.</para><para>Having acknowledged those arguments and perhaps even conceding that parallel import restrictions are not the most efficient or desirable way to support our domestic contemporary music industry, the fact remains that the impact of removing these restrictions would have a number of damaging effects on our cultural integrity. I will give some examples.</para><para>There is real concern over the issue of royalties and intellectual property for Australian artists. Royalty payments in Australia tend to be a lot higher than, for example, in the United States. Thus, if an Australian artist's product was sold overseas by the copyright holder and then imported back into Australia, the artist's royalties could be cut by more than half. Things are much worse with overseas remaindered or deleted stock for which artists receive no royalties whatsoever. One of the people who rang me to lobby me was a person who likes to sell compilation albums and would prefer not to pay royalties at all.</para><para>Another example was in the 1992 debate on this issue. It was recommended that parallel importation only be permitted from countries which gave adequate copyright protection to address the danger of pirated copies flooding the Australian market. It was accepted that it would be very difficult to distinguish between a legal and an illegal copy. The original government legislation appears to have no restrictions on where imports originate. On the other hand, if the government seeks to amend this bill by restricting the countries from which parallel imports can be received, Australia appears to run the risk of breaching a number of international agreements. Just selecting out countries is obviously going to be a problem.</para><para>Another example is that small music retail businesses undoubtedly will be hurt by these changes. It is unlikely that small retailers will be able to compete with the overseas purchas 
 ing power of large overseas chains such as Blockbuster and HMV. In a way, we could simply be shifting the power of multinationals to control the market from the productions sector to the retail sector and we would have gained nothing. At least in the production sector there exists some obligation to invest in the development of Australian talent. In addition, an increase in pirated copies will have a detrimental impact.</para><para>The savings figure with regard to latest releases appears to be questionable. The minister has said that the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics has predicted prices would fall by around $1.60 to $3. This is a far cry from the $10 savings figure touted earlier in the debate, but even those lower revised figures may be wrong now due to the recent fall in the Australian dollar.</para><para>Comparisons with overseas regimes are often erroneous due to language barriers. For example, Senator Alston has commented that the proposed changes will align us with Japan, our major trading partner. In fact, parallel importation is prohibited from domestically produced sound carriers in Japan which represent over 80 per cent of the market. In Australia, the opposite appliesâ80 per cent of our market comes from overseas English speaking countries. In addition, it appears that quite a few countries have experienced very negative impacts from removing import restrictions. Other countries such as the United States, the UK, Canada and New Zealand do not allow open slather on parallel imports.</para><para>There seems to have been little analysis of the effect of this legislation on Australia's involvement in the World Intellectual Property Organisation, WIPO, or of Australia's international standing as a country with strict copyright laws. There are probably associated international investment issues connected with our reputation as a country which protects intellectual property. There is a real fear that Australia could be used as a platform for copyright fraud.</para><para>At present our law enforcement agencies are finding it difficult to stop pirated material. Unless there is a significant increase in resources, not just fines, this will become 
 even more difficult in a free trade environment. There could well be a significant effect on struggling local artists. Quite aside from the fact that record companies may be less able to promote and nurture local talent, bands which produce their own CDs, now the majority, first of all will have to compete with a flood of cheap deleted stock from overseas and, secondly, will probably have fewer small retailers to stock their material and will find it more difficult to convince music supermarkets to accept their product.</para><para>The live music touring industry will be affected. Touring seldom takes place without product release and recordings are seldom released without live performances to support them. Any reduced level of recording due to reduced record company investment will result in less touring. This will go on to affect pubs, clubs, the music press, printers and royalties from live performances by grassroots performers who do not receive recording royalties. We already know that a lot of these venues are having difficulty now.</para><para>Australia does have a CD manufacturing industry. There are at least eight CD manufacturers in Australia who have invested millions of dollars in plant and equipment. I understand that Sony's plant alone employs 600 people. We have maintained trade barriers to protect other manufacturing sectors. Why are we making an exception here in relation to the music industry? I should make it clear that I have no desire to see oligopolies maintained for multinational record corporations. That has never been my intention. The consultations that I have had with the Western Australian Music Industry Association, with independent musicians and with small recording companies seem to suggest that the multinationals have not done nearly enough to develop the local industry and have benefited more than any other group from the current import restrictions. Various speakers have spoken tonight to mention that they have an obligation to do much better than they are doing now.</para><para>However, the issues that I have raised previously point to the fact that a free trade regime is not overall of benefit to Australian society, either. What is certain is that this debate is ensuing without any coherent music 
 industry policyâzero. For example, the grassroots industry has asked for sensible strategies to free independent musicians from the stranglehold of the multinationals. They have asked for, first of all, the provision of interest free loans for bans to produce CDs, assistance with marketing and promotional plans and provision of funding for quality music which may not necessarily have widespread commercial appeal. They have asked for the facilitation of radio stations and record companies committed to the full-scale production and promotion of 10 to 12 emerging acts each year and increasing Australian content on radioânot a lot to expect, I think most people would agree.</para><para>I am not claiming that the Greens (WA) or indeed the groups we have liaised with are the font of all wisdom on the development of music policy. I am sure that a whole range of music industry policy initiatives would come to light if input was invited from the industry and the community. I acknowledge that the ALP has committed to a number of very positive initiatives in recent weeks. However, one thing is certain: Senator Alston would have spent his time in a far more productive fashion over the last 12 months if he had concentrated on proactively assisting the Australian music industry, rather than waging a full-scale battle against it. We have to work cooperatively with industry. Simply waging a war on it is not going to help. There are some real issues in  relation to assistance for the small players in Australian industry. This bill, unfortunately, does not solve their problems and does not, we believe, bring a net benefit to the Australian music industry.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>00:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>5756</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI have listened to this debate for almost an hour.

Of course, the nature of the subject as such is that people cannot avoid dealing with the particular issues and if they have a particular 
 point of view they will repeat what others have said. I was very interested in Senator Cooney's remarks about the letter that was sent to the chairman of the committee, Senator Eric Abetz, and the view that was taken in that letter about whether the use of copyright law to prohibit parallel importing and give distributors exclusive rights is an inappropriate use of copyright lawâwhether the copyright law should be used as a trade barrier. I wonder whether to use the copyright law for that purpose is an appropriate tool, because copyright law is intended to be used to protect the ideas of the creators. Despite the presentation given by Senator Cooney, the question is whether it was ever intended that copyright law should be used for that purpose.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Time is at a premium, and I believe that Senator Alston wants to respond to a number of matters that have been raised in the debate. I will allow him to do that by not saying much more, other than that I have studied all angles of this matterâfrom the consumer side and from the recording sideâand a number of other aspects as well. I am conscious of the points that have been made by ARIA, for example, but I am particularly conscious of points that have been made by the Consumers Association. Of course I am also conscious of points that were made by Allan Fels. I am not convinced that viewpoints from that source are necessarily all-inclusive. I heard somebody talk about economic rationalismâit might have been Senator Brownâand I understand the point. But I did listen closely to what the Consumers Association and other organisations that have been in touch with me have said. I have also had the opportunity of talking to a number of musicians. On balance at this juncture, unless the minister convinces me otherwise, I will be supporting the bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>00:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>5757</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âGiven the time, I will not speak for long. I would simply like to reiterate how crucial this legislation, the <inline ref="r378">Copyright Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997</inline> , is and that it should be voted against. I am probably one of the few people in this place who has actually signed a recording contract with a record company as a musician. It is no great secret that I did not become an internationally 
 renowned superstar, and that in itself probably gives me good grounds to look for opportunities to kick multinational record companies in the head, because they did not give me the chance to have the fame that was rightfully mine.</para></talk.start><para>In that sense, I probably came to this legislation thinking it was a good ideaâcheaper CDs and wreaking my revenge on the multinationals. But, having sat through almost all the committee hearings and having read every single submission, I was particularly impressed by the evidence from the grassroots musicians, the small record companies and the independent companies. It is not the multinationals that will suffer if this legislation goes through; it will be the grassroots musicians and those who are most responsible for developing music in this country and keeping it fresh, vibrant, growing, earning export dollars and generating a great cultural asset for our nation. The people least likely to suffer are the multinationals. It may be that their overseas arms will get a bit more money than their Australian based sections, but they will be able to adjust. The local industry, the local labels and the local musicians are the ones that will suffer.</para><para>The other part of this is that there are no guarantees that CDs will be cheaper. The suggestion that Australian CDs are dearer than those in most other countries in the world is simply not correct. If this legislation goes through, it is potentially a major disaster for the Australian music industry.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Patterson)</name></talker><para>âSenator Faulkner.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">FAULKNER </name><name role="display">Senator Faulkner</name></talker><para>âYes.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>âYou are walking between me and Senator Bartlett.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">FAULKNER </name><name role="display">Senator Faulkner</name></talker><para>âI know that.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>âSenator Faulkner!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>DT6</name.id><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name></talker><para>âThis isn't the only aspect that is involved, and there are other issues the industry needs to address.

I urge the Senate to make sure that it does not go through.

We do not believe there will be, but, given the ferocity of the scare campaign that has been run by the multinational companies and their propensity to scale back the very meagre assistance that they already give, I simply confirm for the public record that if the legislation is passed the government will introduce a $10 million music industry package. This package will 
 provide initiatives to help distribution of bands on the Internet and development for travelâfor touring and for festivals. We will extend the Contemporary Music Export Fund and there will be a business development support program to assist with business plans, to assist in promotion and to assist in travel to regional areas, and there will be pilot programs conducted in Tasmania and South Australia.

It is the multinationals which have put so little back into the country. There are very many independent artists who will benefit very substantially. There are very many independent record companies as well as retail chains who fervently believe that prices will fall dramatically.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I am amazed to hear that Senator Bartlett could have sat through committee hearings and not taken any notice of people like Phil Dwyer, who acts for very many independent record artists, and heard his stories about the difficulties imposed by the multinationals. You ought to know what happened to Savage Garden. You ought to know that Savage Garden had to rely on independents and got no assistance at all from the multinationals.</para><para>You should also know what the evidence from the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics, the Australian Consumers Association and the ACCC is in relation to the extraordinary high price of CDs in comparison with the rest of the world. I am surprised you have never been outside Australia. It is a great shame that you have not looked at comparative record prices. You ought to know that sales of CDs in this country are falling quite significantly because people are purchasing on the Internet and waiting until they travel overseas.</para><para>There is a lot to be said for freeing up the industry in ways that will completely protect the copyright of Australian artists. Indeed, there is no basis for believing that they will 
 be jeopardised unless they consent to their records being sold offshore and released simultaneously with the domestic release. That simply does not happen. Ninety per cent of sales occur in the first three months and hardly any records are sold overseas in that period of time. Maybe the Peter Garretts of this world are big enough and brash enough to be able to do it, but I can assure you that the vast bulk of Australian artists' work is released domestically and the great bulk of their sales occurs in that first three months.</para><para>So there can be no basis for suggesting that somehow Australian artists will get less copyright. Indeed, we have increased the penalties for piracy. We know that piracy is not a problem in developed countries like Australia in any event. You know, however, we have also reversed the onus of proof in terms of the evidentiary onus. It seems to be completely beyond Senator Murphy's ability to distinguish between evidentiary onus and the ultimate onus.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>âOrder!

Mr Keating's appearance on the <inline font-style="italic">7.30 Report</inline> , however, was significant as much for what he did not say as for what he did say. The same is true of the press release issued by Mr Keating that day. 
 In his press release Mr Keating quotes Mr Coudounaris as saying that the memorandum noting a discussion about a payment of moneys is, `Not an accurate reflection of any meeting I had or of any arrangements that were put in place.' What he does not do is deny the essence of the scheme described or that Coudounaris gave instructions along those lines.</para></talk.start><para>In his interview Mr Keating refused to say how much he received either directly or indirectly for his piggery interests. He refused to say who had introduced Mr Soeryadjaya, he refused to say when the transactions actually took place, and he refused to say categorically that he did not know the piggery would pass into Indonesian hands. Instead he merely rebutted an assertion that he had received money from Mr Suhartoâa suggestion which had never been made.</para><para>When asked about the identity of the buyer and whether he knew that the piggery would end up in the hands of Mr Soeryadjaya, the exchange went like this:</para><para>Kerry O'Brien: Were you aware of the Indonesians' interest when you sold your share in the piggery to your partner, Constantinidis?</para><para>Paul Keating: Yes, I was. But there was no question that there could be any certainty that you would close a transaction on something as complex as this. The same Indonesian group had been looking at the Adelaide piggeries of the Adelaide Steamship groups a year or two earlier. They had looked at the ones I think in Mr Fischer's electorate at Corowa. They've been right around the pork industry.</para><para>It might be true that they had looked at a lot of piggeriesâwe can't tell. It is clear, though, that Mr Keating's version of events is at odds with his former business partner, Mr Constantinidis. In the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline>  article that appeared this week, Mr Constantinidis is on the record as saying that the deal was put together by Mr Keating's advisers and that, `The deal was presented to me as a fait accompli.' Someone is clearly not telling the truth. If Mr Constantinidis is correct, then Mr Keating lied on the <inline font-style="italic">7.30 Report</inline> , and he certainly misled the Registrar of Members' Interests  in  hiding  the  true  identity  of  the buyer.</para><para>In this transaction there is every reason to believe that the truth is being told by Mr Constantinidis and that it is Mr Keating who was not telling the truth. Remember, too, that at this point in time, Mr Constantinidis was more than a mere business partner; he was Mr Keating's accountant and he was also the holder of a power of attorney for Mr Keating. This is a significant fact.</para><para>What was the date on which the alleged transaction took place? This too is unclear. If one is to believe Mr Keating's letter to the Registrar of Members' Interests, the transaction took place on 7 March 1994. This, however, does not explain a number of other occurrences. It was not until 8 July 1994, for example, that Mr Bradley Kerr, the man nominated to represent the interests of Mr William Soeryadjaya, was appointed as a director of the company Euphron Pty Ltd, which Mr Keating claims he sold in March of that year. And who did Mr Kerr replace? It was none other than the man Mr Keating admits in his press release to have been his solicitor, Mr Chris Coudounaris, who had resigned as a director of Euphron on that day.</para><para>Similarly, Mr Kerr was not appointed as a director of Hunter Valley Piggery Pty Ltd or Darling Downs Piggery Pty Ltdâthese were the operating subsidiariesâuntil the same date, that is, 8 July 1994. Surely, given the investment of over $6 million, this is an extraordinary omission by an astute international investor such as Mr Soeryadjaya.</para><para>But there is something even more interesting: the joint secretaries of Pleuron Pty Ltd, Mr Keating's family company, were none other than the former Prime Minister and his brother Mr Greg Keating. They resigned from their positions on 5 July 1994. That was just three days before these other events took place.</para><para>Most importantly, the man who replaced them was none other than Mr Chris Coudounaris and therefore it was Mr Coudounaris, not Mr Keating or his brother, who had the legal obligation to lodge any necessary transfer documents for a sale occurring on 8 July 1994. All the evidenceâthe resignation of Mr Coudounaris as a director, the appointment of Mr Kerr in his place, the replacement by Mr 
 Coudounaris of the then Prime Minister and his brother as joint secretaries of Pleuron Pty Ltdâpoints to persons associated with the then Prime Minister being in control of the company well after the date on which Mr Keating says he sold his interest. That means Mr Keating misled the registrar of members' interests in saying that his share in the piggeries was sold in March. It means that Mr Keating lied.</para><para>Mr Keating also refused to answer the question from Mr Kerry O'Brien on the <inline font-style="italic">7.30 Report</inline> as to how much he was paid for the piggery. Let us look at the disbursement from the now infamous $6 million held in the Gadens Ridgeway trust account.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>C16</name.id><name role="metadata">HEFFERNAN</name><name role="display">Senator Heffernan</name></talker><para>âIn what?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>EU4</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Chee, Sen Bill</name><name role="display">Senator O'CHEE</name></talker><para>âUS dollars.

He has merely denied the facts which have come to light and has offered no evidence to disprove them.</para><para>Mr Keating cannot run away anymore. He must provide the proof to show that his version of events is not a lie, a fiction put together for his own convenience. No doubt, Mr Keating will try to ignore the facts set out here tonight but that will no longer work, and his silence can only be construed as consent.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Telstra</title><page.no>5765</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>01:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>5765</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI want to address the issue of Telstra and the events in the parliament in the Senate over the past few days because I think the Senate has been able tonight not only to expose John Howard's plan for the full privatisation of Telstraâ</para></talk.start><para><inline font-style="italic">Honourable senators interjecting</inline>â</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>âOrder!

What a discredited bunch the Senate Nationals are. What a discredited bunch, and don't they look dopey tonight! After all this debate, they might have got a bit of credit in their own constituency if they had joined Labor in the fight to protect the interests of the bush, but they were missing in action. What has become clear again is that there is only one major political party in this country that will ever stand up for the interests of the bush, that will ever stand up for the interests of regional and rural Australia, and that is the Australian Labor Party. There is only one way that people can be protected and keep their national communications carrier in majority public ownership and that is by voting Labor in the next federal election.</para></talk.start></continue><para>What this debate has exposed is the fact that the National Party and the Liberal Party have an agenda out there in the public for everyone to see.

 Telstra in majority public ownership. It has been a difficult fight. Admittedly, we were up against tactical incompetence, a few dopes on the other side, and that always helps. What genius from the Liberal Party to put in place a guillotine so they actually ensured they did not have enough time to put the fix in! That really takes tactical genius.

Why is it that Mr Keating and his brother were replaced as joint secretaries to Pleuron just three days before his solicitor ceased to be a director of the piggery companies and was replaced by a representative of William Soeryadjaya? But, more importantly, another person was appointed to be a secretary or director of a string of Keating piggery companies in April 1994 only to disappear into thin air shortly after Keating lost the last federal election. That person was one Asimo Hantzis.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>C16</name.id><name role="metadata">HEFFERNAN</name><name role="display">Senator Heffernan</name></talker><para>âWho was that person; are they male or female?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>LD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name></talker><para>âYou may well ask because that is the $64 question.

But the very important thing is that there is absolutely no evidence on the researches that have been undertaken to date to indicate that such a person as Asimo Hantzis even exists.</para><para>That raises the fact that the annual return for Euphron for 1994-95 still has not been lodged. That means that Mr Keating has been able to avoid scrutiny of his actions at the very time when all this devious and dishonest behaviour has been going on. The role of Asimo Hantzis in all these transactions is critical because, particularly, there are statutory obligations to be complied with. If the fact is that Asimo Hantzis does not exist, then that raises very serious questions of fraud, breaches of the Corporations Law; any person associated with the management of the company when appointed or when served could be liable for prosecution.</para><para>Madam President, I think there is a long way to go in this little affair.

</para><para>On 11 February 1998, the ACCC wrote to Patrick seeking their response to those allegations and requesting documents relevant to the ACCC's inquiry.</para><para>(2) (a) The ACCC initiated the inquiry because the comments attributed to Mr Corrigan during the AIRC hearing appeared to raise an issue under the Trade Practices Act 1974 (the Act).</para><para>(b) The inquiry has been progressed in the following manner since the investigation was commenced on 11 February 1998:</para><para>-	 18 February 1998, the ACCC wrote to Patrick requesting that Patrick respond to the allegations by 23 February 1998;</para><para>-	 24 February 1998, the ACCC staff had a telephone conversation with Mr Chris Corrigan of Patrick in which Mr Corrigan undertook to provide the relevant documents and an explanation of the Webb Dock Sub-lease agreement and equipment hire agreement between Patrick and PCS;</para><para>-	 25 February 1998, the Australian Financial Review reported that Mr Steve Bracks, the Victorian Labor Party's Industrial Relations spokesperson, had stated in the Victorian Parliament that an equipment hire agreement between Patrick and PCS could be cancelled by Patrick on seven days' notice;</para><para>-	 26 February 1998, Mr Hank Spier, General Manager, ACCC had a telephone conversation with Mr William Hara, General Counsel, Lang Corporation Limited, in which Mr Hara said he would provide extracts of the relevant documents to the ACCC;</para><para>-	 3 March 1998, the ACCC wrote to Lang Corporation Limited requesting it to provide copies of the relevant documents and advising that, if Lang Corporation Limited's response was not received by 4 March 1998, the General Manager would recommend to the Commission that it exercise its statutory power under section 155 of the Act;</para><para>-	 4 March 1998, the ACCC received Lang Corporation's response to the ACCC's letter of 11 February 1998.

</para><para>In March 1998, New Zealand indicated it was unable to sustain the level of commitment to the PMG that it had provided to the TMG, and that with the commencement of the PMG, it would scale back its contribution. Accordingly on 1 May, Australia took over leadership of the regional monitoring operation, and provided the bulk of the logistic support element. Australia assumed command of the PMG only once it had obtained the agreement of all the parties, and endorsement from the National Security Committee of Cabinet. The transition from the TMG to the PMG, including from New Zealand to Australian command, has proceeded smoothly.</para><para>The number of personnel in the PMG is generally around 303 personnel, though these figures vary slightly from time to time. An indication of the usual break-down in numbers is 231 ADF monitors and support personnel and 18 DFAT, Defence, AusAID and AFP civilian monitors; 30 New Zealand Defence Force personnel; 15 ni-Vanuatu and 9 Fijian military personnel. Therefore, in answer to (1), the number of ADF personnel has increased from approximately 75 in the TMG to 231 in the PMG. This increase was agreed to by all parties to the conflict (including the PNG Government, the BRA/BIG and the BTG). Because the PMG is unarmed, it is vital that its composition has the continued support of the Bougainvillean people, so that its security and operations are assured.</para><para>The Australian personnel are employed by the PMG in a variety of ways. The Australian civilians are deployed to any of the five teamsites (four Peace Monitoring Team sites and one Liaison Team) around the province, except for the Chief Negotiator of the PMG, who works at the PMG Headquarters in Arawa. Some ADF are also deployed to the teamsites, along with military personnel from New Zealand, Fiji and Vanuatu. However, the majority of ADF personnel are stationed at the logistical and PMG headquarters, at Loloho and Arawa respectively, performing a variety of support work including: communications; PMG air, sea and land transport and transport maintenance; offloading, storage and allocation of supplies; production of a peace newsletter and publicity material; and purification of the water supply.</para><para>In answer to (2), ADF personnel taking part in the monitoring operations have never beenâand 
 will never beâarmed. It was the express wish of the parties to the Bougainville conflict (including the PNG Government, the BRA/BIG and the BTG) that the monitoring Group be unarmed. A Treaty signed on 5 December 1997 by PNG and the States participating in the TMGâamended by the 29 April Protocolâspecified the TMG would be unarmed (Article 14). Indeed, the parties to the Bougainville conflict guaranteed the safety of the TMG in the 25 November 1997 Cairns Commitment, in recognition that the Group would be unarmed.</para><para>The Rules of Engagement for the PMG are decided in conjunction with all the States participating in the operation.</para><para>In answer to (3), the Australian Cabinet reviews Australian participation in the PMG every three months. Further, the Protocol to the TMG Treatyâwhich was signed in Port Moresby on 29 April by the PNG Government and PMG participants to enable the deployment of the PMGâsimilarly provides for three-monthly review of the size, composition and role of the PMG (Article 8.c). The unarmed PMG presence is contingent on the agreement of all parties to the Bougainville conflictâif this agreement is revoked, the PMG will withdraw.</para><para>The PMG is doing an excellent job in monitoring the implementation of the ceasefire on the ground, and in disseminating information about the peace process. The operation has played a key role in defusing tension across the province and in the observance (with the odd minor transgression) of the ceasefire. It has increased awareness of the peace process among Bougainvilleans and provided a neutral presence on the island at a time when the parties are discussing important issues regarding the future of Bougainville. Provided the parties continue to agree to its deployment, the PMG will need to remain on Bougainville, fulfilling these roles, for some months.</para><para>Question (4) was forwarded for reply to the Minister for Defence. The Minister for Defence advises that the anticipated annual cost to Defence of maintaining ADF personnel on Bougainville (excluding base salaries) is $25.97m based on the current level of personnel, scope and level of activity being maintained. The majority of this funding will come from existing programs in Support Command, Army, Air Force and Navy. Additional funds will be provided from the Corporate Support Program, Defence Personnel Executive and the Defence Estate Program.</para><para>In answer to (5), all parties (including the BRA/BIG) agreed to an increase in Australian personnel, including the ADF, when the ceasefire was signed. 
</para><para>In answer to (6), the Australian Government has no desire to dominate the peace process, or to dictate its terms to the parties. The Australian Government has not pressured any party (including the BRA/BIG) in respect of the process. The peace process belongs to Papua New Guineans, and as such, it should be conducted by them. That said, Australia is pleased to have contributed to the progress achieved to date on Bougainville, and we are willing to continue to do so, provided all parties to the conflict agree.</para><para>Australia remains the largest donor to Bougainville, having committed $136 million AUD over the next five years to various rehabilitation and reconstruction programs. These include major infrastructure projects, humanitarian assistance and facilitation of meetings between the parties.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Uranium Exports</title><page.no>5785</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 1205)</subtitle><id.no>1205</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>5785</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator Brown</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for the Environment, upon notice, on 19 June 1998:</para></talk.start><para>With reference to the Minister's recent statement that no Australian uranium was used for weapons:</para><para>(1) What was the basis for this statement.</para><para>(2) What was the source of the uranium used by Pakistan, which has no uranium mines, in its recent nuclear tests.</para><para>(3) What has happened to every gram of uranium exported from Australia.</para><para>(4) How can the Minister be confident that Pakistan did not receive any uranium.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>5785</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator Hill</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Environment</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><para>(1) Australia is a Party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (TNPNW), and has entered into an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for the application of safeguards in connection with the treaty.</para><para>Uranium sourced from Australian mines is sold exclusively to other countries which are also parties to the TNPNW, which have also agreed to adopt the IAEA system of safeguards, and which have entered into bi-lateral agreements with Australia regarding the use of Australian obligated nuclear material. These measures are designed to prevent the diversion of nuclear material from the nuclear fuel cycle to nuclear weapons production, and are scrutinised by the IAEA through a regime of routine and surprise inspections of nuclear facilities. Australian uranium must be accounted for, from mining through to the storage, reprocessing or disposal of spent nuclear fuel rods. This system effectively renders the diversion of nuclear materials from the nuclear fuel cycle to nuclear weapons production impossible. There is no evidence to 
 suggest that there has ever been any such diversion since the IAEA system of safeguards was introduced.</para><para>Pakistan is not a Party to the TNPNW. The Commonwealth Government, which regulates the possession of uranium in its jurisdiction, and controls the export of uranium from Australia, does not allow the sale of Australian uranium to Pakistan, or any other country which is not a Party to the TNPNW.</para><para>(2) I am not aware of the source of uranium used by Pakistan for its recent nuclear tests. However, I am advised by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade that Pakistan does mine uranium within its borders. Whilst not commercial operations, they are capable of supplying uranium to Pakistan's nuclear weapons program.</para><para>(3) The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons came into force in Australia in 1974. This regime ensures that all Australian uranium can only be used for peaceful purposes.</para><para>(4) I have confidence in the effectiveness of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and the International Atomic Energy Agency system of safeguards, in preventing the diversion of nuclear material from the nuclear fuel cycle to nuclear weapons production. On that basis I am confident that Pakistan did not receive any uranium from Australia.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>SpringBrook National Park</title><page.no>5786</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 1206)</subtitle><id.no>1206</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>5786</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator Brown</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for the Environment, upon notice, on 19 June 1998:</para></talk.start><para>With reference to the Naturelink Cable Car proposal, Springbrook National Park:</para><para>(1) Does the Minister agree that this proposal has the potential to impact on the world heritage values of the Springbrook area; if so, what are the potential threats it poses.</para><para>(2) What assessment is being made by the Commonwealth of the environmental impacts of this proposal.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>5786</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator Hill</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Environment</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><para>(1) I am committed to ensuring that the outstanding universal values of the Central Eastern Rainforest Reserves (Australia) World Heritage property are adequately protected.

 The duties, powers and functions of the Central Authorities are set out in the Convention and in the Regulations. One of the functions of a Central Authority is to receive from parents in other Convention countries applications for the return of children.</para><para>(2) Regulation 13 of the Family Law (Child Abduction Convention) Regulations requires the Commonwealth Central Authority to satisfy itself that an application is in accordance with the requirements of the Convention before the Central Authority acts to obtain an order from the Family Court for the return of the child. One of the requirements of the Convention is that the overseas applicant pay the expenses to be incurred in implementing the return of the child (Article 26 of the Convention). Thus where the Family Court is likely to order return of the child in the custody of the abducting parent, the Commonwealth Central Authority requires the overseas applicant to satisfy it that arrangements have been made in relation to the payment of airfares for both the child and the abducting parent. Where the abducting parent is impecunious, this will usually mean that the overseas applicant must put in place satisfactory arrangements to meet the cost of the airfares. This requirement dates from 1994 when an overseas applicant refused to pay an airfare for a child taken into care pending return and the relevant Australian Central Authority was left to meet the cost.</para><para>(3) Applications received from applicants in the United Kingdom are dealt with as outlined in answer to question (2) above. Australia has a legal aid scheme of assistance (the Overseas Custody Child Removal Scheme) which pays airfares for impecunious applicants in Australia who seek the return of children from other countries. On a number of occasions the Commonwealth Central Authority has made representations to the English Lord Chancellor's Department about England's failure to adopt such a scheme to assist impecunious English applicants with the payment of airfares. Attempts by the English Lord Chancellor's Department and English solicitors to transfer these costs to Australian taxpayers are unacceptable because the Convention places the liability on the overseas applicant.</para><para>(4) Other Convention countries do not require Australian applicants to make arrangements to pay airfares because Australia's legal aid scheme of assistance (the Overseas Custody Child Removal Scheme) pays airfares for impecunious applicants in Australia who seek the return of children from other countries.</para><para>(5) The Commonwealth Central Authority's handling of Hague Convention applications is consistent with the Convention and the Regulations.

The RCS classification process, as did the classification processes it replaced, draws on the documentation undertaken by professional staff in assessing the care needs of residents and in developing a care plan. This is also the documentation considered by departmental officers in validating funding claims.</para><para>The RCS review noted that concerns over documentation may be a response to uncertainty about change which can be expected to settle as people become more familiar with the arrangements.</para><para>A Documentation and Accountability Manual, used in nursing homes, has been updated and extended to hostels to provide a good practice guide in documentation to support quality care. The manual was produced for professional nursing and other care staff by professional nurses, including 
 representatives of the Australian Nursing Federation and College of Nursing.</para><para>(5) No. The introduction of the RCS has resulted in an increase in funding, not a decrease. Expenditure on residential aged care subsidies has increased by 17.7% from $2.419 billion in 1995-96 to $2.846 billion in 1998-99.</para><para>The new funding and accountability arrangements will increase the flexibility available to providers and unions to negotiate enterprise agreements to fund wage increases and allow providers and staff to retain and share the benefits of efficiency gains achieved through enterprise bargaining.</para><para>(6) The Government has made a commitment to ensure that care funding is appropriate to residents' relative care needs, that care needs are being accurately assessed and that providers are receiving the full amount of funding to which they are entitled to provide that care. Budget estimates provide for expenditure of $2.846 billion on residential aged care subsidies in 1998-99, $2.950 billion in 1999-00, $3.064 billion in 2000-01, and $3.163 billion in 2001-02.</para><para>(7) In introducing the RCS, the Government made a commitment to maintain the aggregate level of funding available under the previous system. The RCS has, in fact, delivered a higher level of funding than the previous system.</para><para>(8) No. There has been no reduction in aged care funding. The Commonwealth indexes the funding rates for aged care services under arrangements were introduced in the 1995 Budget. These arrangements apply not only to residential aged care funding, but to all Commonwealth programs with significant wage costs.</para><para>These arrangements, together with the accreditation requirements, mean that services will have both the financial capacity and requirement to employ quality staffing in order to achieve quality outcomes.</para><para>(9) Funding for residential aged care in Western Australia has increased under the RCS.</para><para>In addition, the Government's aged care reforms have set the industry on a more viable and financially secure footing, well able to offer good conditions to staff. Providers in the industry under enterprise bargaining have been able to offer staff a significant pay rise together with improved productivity, under existing funding arrangements.</para><para>To the extent that registered nurses and residents in aged care services are predominantly female, the increase in Commonwealth spending on aged care has positively discriminated in favour of women.

For the 1996-97 round, the focus of the Program was on assisting those school leavers, who had successfully completed their Year 12 studies and had undertaken vocational education courses as part of their Year 11 and Year 12 studies, to obtain employment, including traineeships and apprenticeships, and provide 
 advice and support over the first year of their placement.</para><para>.	 Given the relatively low numbers of Year 11 and 12 students participating in vocational education courses, the Department adopted a selective tendering process, choosing organisations recommended by its Area Offices as having the potential to become JPP brokers. 
 These organisations were invited to submit tenders.</para><para>.	 The criteria for determining which regions received priority for funding under JPP for 1996-97 were that there should be sufficient numbers of students undertaking a school based vocational education programs and that appropriately qualified brokers existed to deliver the program. Quantification of the numbers of students participating in school based vocational education programs was drawn from the survey performed by the Australian Council for Educational Research on behalf of the Australian Student Traineeship Foundation.</para><para>.	 Tenders were assessed against the objectives of the program and for consistency with the national strategic objectives in vocational education and training. The principle of value for money was applied through this process.</para><para>.	 Contracts were executed with 40 organisations to manage 42 projects.</para><para>1997-98 Jobs Pathway ProgramâTender Process</para><para>.	 For the 1997-98 round, the focus of the program was expanded to providing assistance to school leavers to find and sustain employment as well as to work with those students who would otherwise leave school without completing their year 12 studies, with a view to encouraging them to remain at school.</para><para>.	 An open and competitive tender process was adopted and tenders were called through advertisements in the national and major regional press on 7 and 11 June 1997. Organisations wishing to tender had a six week period to 18 July 1997. Copies of the tender documentation could be downloaded from the DEETYA Home Page on the Internet.</para><para>.	 The tender documentation clearly specified the:</para><para>	 -	 objectives of the program (section 3);</para><para>	 -	 range of services that are expected to be provided by brokers (section 4);</para><para>	 -	 outcomes expected (section 5);</para><para>	 -	 use of placement and retention targets as a measure of performance (section 6);</para><para>	 -	 roles and responsibilities of both DEETYA and brokers (section 7);</para><para>	 -	 funding and reporting arrangements (section 8); and</para><para>	 -	 tender process (section 9).</para><para>.	 Section 9.2 clearly specified the outcomes that we were seeking from the tender process, namely quality brokerage services, quality vocational guidance, open competition, value 
 for money and ethical and fair dealings, accountability and impartiality.</para><para>.	 Section 9.3 specified how tenderers should define a region for JPP for 1997-98. It clearly indicated that the final shape of each region may vary according to a number of factors including the number of schools, numbers of students, level of participation in VET programs, Year 12 completion rates, level of youth unemployment and the broker's capacity to deliver the services. Tenderers were asked to nominate their region by specifying the schools that they intended to work with if successful. The tender document clearly indicated our intention to contract some 70 brokers/regions for 1997-98 and clearly states the intention to rank regions nominated by tenderers. The basis for ranking was stated as youth unemployment and Year 12 completion rate. A typical size region was specified and allowance made for schools in smaller communities (regional and remote) to tender and receive the same level of consideration as tenders from more typical regions.</para><para>.	 Section 9.5 stated that tenders would undergo an initial assessment by DEETYA officers with knowledge of each regionâthis initial assessment took place in the DEETYA State Offices. The ranking of regions and subsequent shortlisting of tenders took place in DEETYA National Office. The final shortlisting took account of value for money and potential overlaps between regions.</para><para>.	 Negotiations with shortlisted tenders were undertaken to confirm the region/s nominated and the targets proposed for job placement and school retention. Contracts were executed with 63 organisations to manage 68 projects.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Australian Defence Force Personnel: Service in Thailand</title><page.no>5800</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 1231)</subtitle><id.no>1231</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>5800</page.no><name role="metadata">Woodley, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator Woodley</name><name.id>HX5</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 2 July 1998:</para></talk.start><para>With reference to the answer to question on notice no. 1062 (Senate <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> , 10 March 1998, p.754):</para><para>(1) Did the decision to build the airstrip result from a request from another power; if so, in what form was the request received.</para><para>(2) What was the objective that was to be fulfilled by the construction of the airstrip.</para><para>(3) What security classification was given to documents and materials pertaining to this matter and what is their current classification.

On 10 August 1964 the Cabinet noted the proposed designs, and on 24 August 1964 the Treasurer announced them, including the frilled lizard design for the 2 cent coin. The coins, he said, would include the new effigy of the Queen being introduced by Commonwealth countries (photographs of this effigy were earlier released; the designer was Mr Arnold Machin).</para><para>On 6 June 1963 Mr Holt announced the denominations and composition of decimal coins, that the effigy of the Queen would appear on the obverse and that procedures for the preparation of these new designs had been established. These procedures included obtaining comments from interested bodies. Subsequently, a small number of artists were commissioned to produce designs. On 18 September 1963 the Treasurer announced that designs for the 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 50 cent coins were already being prepared.</para><para>The Royal Australian Mint has advised that sample coins were struck and that samples of coins struck in different sizes, alloys and configurations are held at the Royal Australian Mint. These were struck at the Royal Mint London and the Royal Mint Melbourne but dates of striking are not clear from the records, which simply indicate that they were acquired in 1966. It is thought that the first strikings were in London and probably late in 1964 or early in 1965. Production of coin commenced about March 1965.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Animal Experimentation</title><page.no>5801</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 1234)</subtitle><id.no>1234</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>5801</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator Bartlett</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism, upon notice, on 3 July 1998:</para></talk.start><para>With reference to the answer to question on notice no.1106 (Senate Hansard, 12 May 1998, p.2608) which stated that there is no Commonwealth legislation regulating animal experimentation, that the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) had reached agreements with New South Wales and Victoria and that an agreement is being developed with the Australian Capital Territory:</para><para>(1) Can copies of the agreements with New South Wales and Victoria and a copy of the draft agreement with the Australian Capital Territory be supplied.

CSIRO used approximately 50205 animals for scientific purposes such as research laboratory settings, livestock herds used in animal health and production research, wildlife tagged and monitored in ecological studies, and those used for testing of animal diseases. The objectives of CSIRO animal-based research includes investigation into infectious diseases of animals, vaccine production, conservation and management of wildlife, control of feral animals, livestock quarantine requirements, the welfare of animals, nutrition, and various fundamental research. A wide variety of species are used including reptiles, fish, birds, mammals, rodents and marsupials.

</para><para>(2) East Timorese, like most visitors to the Embassy, have their identity checked or are escorted by Australian-based Embassy staff. Visitors are also required to state the purpose of their visit to the Embassy. These are standard security precautions. If visitors do not have legitimate business with the Embassy or there are reasons to doubt their bona fides, they will not be granted admission. If security personnel at the entrance gate are unsure of a visitor's bona fides, they may request an Australian-based officer to further investigate the visitors intentions at the Embassy's front entrance.</para><para>(3) It is certainly not the case that screening procedures only apply to East Timorese.

If it is considered that the person's bona fides and stated purpose for visiting the Embassy are genuine, the visitor will be directed to the appropriate section of the Embassy to deal with their business. If the security personnel do not consider the person to have legitimate business in the Embassy, they will be denied permission, while if there is some uncertainty and the security staff do not feel confident about making a judgement, they will request that 
 an appropriate Australia-based member of the staff attend to the visitor at the front gate in order to make their own judgement.</para><para>It is also Embassy procedure to inspect bags of visitors, except where prior courtesy arrangements have been made, in order to protect against acts of terrorism.

The overview Environmental Management Plan (OEMP) is a preliminary planning document outlining environmental management intentions and providing the basis for the Environmental Management Plan (EMP) that will be prepared if the proposal is approved.</para><para>(3) (a) The commitments are described in the publicly available JMA public environment report (PER) and I see no point in reiterating them.</para><para>(b) The assessment of the JMA is still in progress and the Government ha not made a decision as to whether or not the JMA may proceed, and if so under what conditions. For this reason the OEMP for the JMA is not in place and questions about its operation are therefore premature. No work specifically related to the JMA has been undertaken at the Jabiluka mine site.</para><para>(4â7) See answer to 3 (b) above.</para><para>(8â9) The works completed to date at the Jabiluka mine site are: minor cleaning up of the access road; installation of monitoring bores; preparation of a secure site by fencing; commencement of decline; excavation of the box-cut; commencement of water management ponds; and installation of site facilities including office and ablutions buildings.</para><para>Works in progress are: benching of the site for erosion control; completion of a major water management pond; preparation of the face to allow tunnelling of the decline; and the establishment of an on-going monitoring program.</para><para>The work undertaken and in progress on the box cut and decline have been approved through the 1997 EIS process, the Section 43 Agreement under the Aboriginal Lands Rights (Northern Territory) Act and a consequent Deed Poll in favour of the Northern Land Council (NLC), and the Minesite 
 Technical Committee (MTC) which includes the NLC as representatives of the Aboriginal Traditional Owners, all of which led to the formal Jabiluka Authorisation on 2 June 1998âthe Authorisation to Operate (ATO)âunder the NT Uranium Mining (Environment Control) Act 1979.</para><para>(10â12)These are matters best addressed by ERA.</para><para>(13) Liaison has taken place with the NLC (who represent the Traditional Owners). The NLC have a representative on the MTC and as a result of recent meetings of the MTC approval has been given for Stage 1 of the Jabiluka RMA (the box cut and decline plus associated facilities).</para><para>(14) (aâb) A materials balance sheet and the finalisation of material resources is a necessary part of the design phase for the JMA. However, this cannot be done until the exact nature of the JMA proposal is fully delineated after the environmental assessment process is completed.</para><para>(15) ERA advised in the PER that they have conducted some investigations to assess the potential suitability of Jabiluka tailings for the paste fill method. Further investigations and procedures were proposed to be developed as part of the design phase for the JMA, should it be approved.</para><para>(16) (a)The area of disturbance for the Jabiluka Project is small compared with the original Pancontinental proposal. The disturbed area for civil works and construction of the box cut and decline is as approved according to the 1997 EIS, and carried out according to the ATO. Action plans for minimising disturbance for Stage 1 of the Jabiluka Project were specified in the EIS Supplement (Chapter 11).</para><para>(b) Conceptual plans for minimising disturbance for the construction of the JMA are described in the PER and will be completed in the design phase of the JMA, if it is approved.</para><para>(17) No. Stakeholder agencies such as Parks Australia provided input to the 1997 EIS, but Parks Australia is not a regulator of the mining project.</para><para>(18) This is a matter which should be addressed to ERA.</para><para>(19) All approvals for current works have involved consultation with stakeholders, including the NLC which represents Aboriginal Traditional Owners. Proposed land management strategies for the JMA are outlined in the PER.</para><para>(20) All land management matters with respect to current construction works at the Jabiluka mine site are being addressed through the ATO. Land management matters with respect to construction for the JMA are described in the PER.</para><para>(21) For current approved construction works at Jabiluka, land management and clearing strategies have been developed and carried out as outlined in 
 Chapter 11 of the EIS Supplement which at this stage represents the EMP for the Jabiluka site. A clearing strategy is set down for the Jabiluka site and written guidelines are available from ERA. Clearing procedures proposed for the JMA are outlined in the PER and are similar to those in the EIS Supplement.</para><para>(22) See answer to question 21 above. A copy can be provided by ERA.</para><para>(23) Yes. Species suitable for rehabilitation have been confirmed and are as described in studies for the EIS and related documents. Schedule 7 of the ATO also mentions suitable species for rehabilitation. The same species for the JMA are outlined in the PER in the section on rehabilitation and decommissioning.</para><para>(24) Rehabilitation using specific appropriate native species is approved for areas disturbed as part of approved construction works, as per Schedule 7 of the ATO. A similar approach for the JMA is described in the PER in the section on rehabilitation and decommissioning.</para><para>(25) Conceptual design criteria have been developed for waste dump and tailings rehabilitation with respect to the JMA as outlined in the PER. However, construction of the waste dump or tailings facilities for the JMA have not commenced as the proposal has not been approved.</para><para>(26) (aâb) Yes. The Environmental Protection Officer at Jabiluka is Mr Andrew Jackson, Manager of Environment Safety and Health at Ranger. A record of Mr Jackson's qualifications is held by ERA.</para><para>(27) In relation to the environmental investigations recommended by the Minister for Resources and Energy, no species of conservation significance were detected in the vicinity of the current construction works prior to construction. Ongoing monitoring is planned.</para><para>(28) See answer to question 21 above.</para><para>(29) Fauna management strategies have been developed as outlined in Chapter 11 of the EIS Supplement. Disturbance to fauna habitats has been minimised. Fauna management strategies for the JMA are outlined in the PER (Section 4) and embrace similar measures.</para><para>(30) Monitoring strategies for the approved project development have been implemented in accordance with the approved interim EMP as confirmed by the stakeholders (including the NLC) and the Supervising Authority.</para><para>(31) For the Jabiluka Project ERA is in the process of adopting plans that were established for the Ranger Mine with respect to Weed Management, Fire Management, Feral Animal Management and Soil and Land Management. ERA has committed to developing and implementing these plans in 
 consultation with Parks Australia and Traditional Owners. Should the JMA proceed similar strategies will apply, as set out in the PER.</para><para>(32) These matters relate to the approved project development work at Jabiluka. Modifications to these strategies may be implemented in the case of the JMA which is the subject of the PER and has not been approved. As noted above construction has not commenced on any aspect of the JMA.</para><para>(33) The overall water management system (WMS) concept with no release has been confirmed for the approved construction works at Jabiluka. Schedule 6 of the ATO states that no release can occur from the Total Containment Zone (TCZ). The size of the TCZ is different for the JMA and the conceptual WMS for this situation has been developed as described in the PER</para><para>(34) The implications of geotechnical investigations and construction material supplies have been addressed for the currently approved construction works at Jabiluka. Similar investigations for the JMA are being addressed through the PER assessment process.</para><para>(35) Operating protocols for the Jabiluka WMS (including water balance requirements) have been established for the currently approved construction works and are outlined in the ATO. Conceptual operating protocols for the Jabiluka WMS with respect to the JMA are outlined in the PER but are subject to further modelling.</para><para>(36) See answer to question 13 above.</para><para>(37) The design criteria presented in Section 4.9 of the PER for the JMA are based on the most up-to-date information available. Further studies and modelling may be required for the design for the JMA WMS.</para><para>(38) Detailed hydrological and hydrogeological investigations and modelling to allow detailed design of the TCZ and system components has been performed and are continuing in relation to the currently approved construction works. One limitation to progress has been lack of access to critical areas for drilling and testing of boreholes. The Six Monthly Progress Report submitted to the Minister for Resources and Energy by ERA (April 1998) and the JMA PER contain the most recent information with respect to hydrological and hydrogeological investigations.</para><para>(39) Indicators and monitoring requirements to satisfy regulatory reporting requirements and design appropriate modelling systems are outlined in the ATO Annex B (Jabiluka Environmental Monitoring Program). Under the Jabiluka Environmental Requirements (ER's) there is provision for the evolution of environmental monitoring systems. Thus the Jabiluka Environmental Monitoring Program may be altered if approval is given for the JMA, to take into account additional potential 
 environmental effects, as described in Section 10.3 of the JMA PER.</para><para>(40) It is premature to consider how variations to the JMA might be dealt with when the assessment of the JMA outlined in the PER has not been completed. However, if detailed design should result in the need for variations to project layout or management, it is likely that liaison would be undertaken through the MTC with recommendations forwarded to relevant regulatory authorities.</para><para>(41) ERA states in the PER that the preferred version of the JMAâthe so called amended layout interpretationâis the result of re-examining the previous JMA proposal (original concept) and applying best practicable technology (BPT). BPT is required to have been followed in all aspects of the project.</para><para>(42) Contingency plans have been developed for structural failure of water retention structures being utilised for the currently approved site works as outlined in Section 11.6 of the EIS Supplement. Action Plan 4 of Section 10.2 of the PER proposes the development of contingency plans for the event of structural failure of water retention structures for the JMA during the design phase of the JMA. Retention structures constructed for the currently approved site works will not contain any water that has contacted uranium mineralisation because at this stage of the project no uranium-bearing ore is to be extracted.</para><para>(43) Contingency plans for structural failure of water retention structures for the JMA will be developed in the design phase of the JMA as stated in the PER Section 10 2</para><para>(44) Contingency plans for structural failure of water retention structures for the JMA are not complete and therefore were not registered as complete in the PER.</para><para>(45) Construction of the JMA has not commenced and will not commence unless the project is approved. The WMS in the ATO is specific for Stage 1 of the Jabiluka Project and is separate to the requirements for either mill option.</para><para>(46) The most recent results from hydrogeological investigations are outlined in the Six Monthly Progress Report submitted to the Minister for Resources and Energy by ERA and in the JMA PER. Hydrogeological investigations for the currently approved site works are in progress. Hydrogeological monitoring will be carried out in accordance with Annex B of the ATO and as outlined in Action Plan 7 of Section 11.5 of the EIS Supplement. Section 11 of the EIS Supplement has been endorsed as the Draft EMP as outlined in Annex D of the ATO.</para><para>(47) A conceptual design for groundwater management and monitoring for the JMA is outlined in the PER. The final design for the groundwater man 
 agement and monitoring for the JMA will be completed if the JMA is approved.</para><para>(48) ERA will have to confirm ore production schedules for Stage 2 (haul road and underground mining) of the Jabiluka Project. Although these details have not been established, ERA has confirmed that it will ensure that potentially acid-forming ore will not be stored for periods of more than 3 months on the surface at Jabiluka during the wet season.</para><para>(49) Detailed design criteria have been established for the ore stockpile pads and are set out in consultant reports to ERA.</para><para>(50) Indicators have been established to assess the performance of the ore stockpile and drainage management systems. No monitoring program for the ore stockpile will be devised until an authorisation to operate for Stage 2 is issued by the Supervising Authority.</para><para>(51) Issues relating to management and monitoring of the ore stockpile are pre-design and pre-construction issues for the JMA. Construction of the JMA has not commenced. No mineralised ore will be mined unless a milling option is approved and adopted.</para><para>(52) Any outstanding indicators and monitoring requirements for the management and monitoring of the ore stockpiles will be established prior to construction of the JMA. Detailed design of the JMA will take place following approval of the proposal, should this be forthcoming.</para><para>(53) They have not been finally resolved.</para><para>(54) Pre-design and pre-construction matters have not been resolved with respect to the management and monitoring of the ore stockpile (Stage 2). Construction of the JMA has not commenced.</para><para>(55)(a)ERA have advised that direct liaison with Aboriginal Traditional Owners has been denied by the NLC. There has been liaison with the NLC (the representatives of the Traditional Owners) with respect to permits, fences, employee inductions and other issues. Nevertheless, culturally sensitive sites have been identified from previous consultations and are either fenced off or being avoided by mining infrastructure.</para><para>(b) ERA have made it a dismissible offence for any employee to enter areas identified by the Australian Heritage Commission and fenced off without express permission of Aboriginal Traditional Owners.</para><para>(56) ERA is considering adopting Ranger's Cultural Heritage Management Plan in accordance with Action Plan 12 of Section 11.5 of EIS Supplement.</para><para>(57) See answer to question 55(a) above.</para><para>(58) Yes.</para><para>(59) See answer to question 56 above. 
</para><para>(60) Yes.</para><para>(61) See answer to question 13 above.</para><para>(62) Issues relating to management of clearing are pre-design and pre-construction issues for the JMA. The proposal has not been approved and construction of the JMA has not commenced.</para><para>(63) See answer to question 62 above.</para><para>(64) It is not clear to which issues this question refers. There is significant overlap between the OEMP for the RMA and that for the JMA. Both Plans are available for public review and analysis.</para><para>(65) As has been explained in answers to questions 8, 9 and 19 above, ERA has not undertaken any works without approval through formal negotiation mechanisms. The only works complete to date are elements of Stage 1 of the Jabiluka Project (the box cut and decline). Construction specific to the JMA has not commenced.</para><para>(66) No.</para><para>(67â69) Only the first stage of the Jabiluka project is under-way, the box cut and decline. These works are common to both the RMA, which already has approval to proceed from the Commonwealth and Northern Territory governments, and the JMA proposal which is still being assessed. As explained above, particularly in answers to questions 8, 9 and 19, ERA is undertaking this work in accord with government requirements and relevant parts of the RMA OEMP.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Beverley Uranium Mine</title><page.no>5811</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 1244)</subtitle><id.no>1244</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>5811</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator Margetts</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for the Environment, upon notice, on 17 July 1998:</para></talk.start><para>(1) (a) Is the Minister aware of continuing concerns being expressed by a broad range of Aboriginal people in the Gammon and North Flinders Ranges region over the environmental and cultural impacts of development of the proposed Beverley uranium mine site; (b) how are these concerns being addressed; and (c) does the Minister intend to consult with dissenting Aboriginals in the area.</para><para>(2) (a) Is the Minister aware that the proposed mining technique and leaching agent (acid leaching) being proposed for the Beverley site is no longer permitted to be used in commercial operations in the United States of America (USA) because of documented adverse impacts; and (b) can an explanation be provided as to why South Australia should be afforded less environmental protection or regard than in New Mexico.</para><para>(3) (a) Can the volume of uranium extracted to date from the `trial' mining operation at Beverley be clarified; (b) where is the uranium currently

Most uranium mines use the in-situ leach mining technique in conjunction with an alkali leach, because the generally high levels of carbonates make acid leachates inefficient in the groundwater associated with the mines; (b) The environment protection for the Beverley mine is of the highest standard. The geology of US uranium deposits is not suitable for acid leaching and an alkali solution is used instead. Nevertheless ISL mines are required to be carefully monitored and controlled whatever type of leachate is used.</para><para>(3) (a) Approximately 15 tonnes of uranium oxide stored in 200 litre steel drums; (b) In a secure enclosure within the processing area at Beverley; (c) Uranium produced is owned by the South Australian government.</para><para>(4) I understand that the trials at Beverley have been very successful in their stated purpose of determining optimum operating conditions including environmental matters. There have not been any significant difficulties and irregularities in relation to pressure and containment. I understand that the 
 only international personnel involved are engaged by Heathgate Resources which is US owned.</para><para>(5) The groundwater at the Beverley mineralised zone aquifer is highly saline and contains uranium and radon with no potential use for people or stock. In contrast, several US ISL mines operate in or immediately adjacent to aquifers from which nearby communities draw drinking water supplies. Compared to pre-mining levels, radioactivity of the water in the mine zone will not change after mining. However there will be an elevation in the amount of some metals in the aquifer which could take up to 20 years to return to pre-mining levels.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Regional Forest Agreements</title><page.no>5812</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 1247)</subtitle><id.no>1247</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>5812</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator Allison</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for the Environment, upon notice, on 21 July 1998:</para></talk.start><para>(1) (a) What is the total amount of funds being made available for distribution under the Comprehensive Regional Assessments/Regional Forest Agreements Participation and Awareness Grants in the 1998-99 financial year; (b) from which pool of money are these funds being provided; and (c) is the 1998-99 financial year the first year funds for this purpose have been made available under this grants scheme; if not, can a list be provided of grants including which groups of individuals these were made for the previous year.</para><para>(2) Can an explanation obe provided of the perceived need for these grants.</para><para>(3) What was the process by which it was determined there was a need for these grants.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>5812</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator Hill</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Environment</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><para>(1) (a) Total 1998-99 funding for the Comprehensive Regional Assessments/Regional Forest Agreements (CRA/RFA) Participation and Awareness Grants Program is not yet known, as applications closed on July 31 and are now being assessed.</para><para>However, it is expected that the total funding levels under the program in the current financial year would be similar to previous financial years. $113,000 was spent in 1996-97 and $115,450 was spent in 1997-98.</para><para>(b) The costs of this program are being shared between the Department of Primary Industries and Energy and Environment Australia and are provided from program funding to support the RFA process.</para><para>(c) No. Funding was provided under this program in 1996-97 and in 1997-98.

Section 329(5) of the Act provides that it is a defence to a prosecution under section 329(1) if a person proves that he or she did not know, and could not reasonably be expected to have known, that the matter or thing was likely to mislead an elector in relation to the casting of a vote.</para><para>The AEC has moved in advance of the next federal election to counter any ignorance or misunderstanding of the law in relation to misleading and deceptive electoral advertising by publishing an Electoral Backgrounder, entitled "Unofficial HTV Cards". This Backgrounder is freely available from the AEC, has already been distributed to all major political parties, and will be included in the information package provided to all candidates at nomination. The Backgrounder details the legal provisions of the Act, discusses the relevant case law precedents, and warns that any 
 breaches of the law will be prosecuted on advice from the Director of Public Prosecutions.</para><para>A further protection against misleading HTV material is available in section 351(1) of the Act, which makes it an offence to publish material that suggests that first preferences should be distributed otherwise than in accordance with the wishes of a House of Representatives candidate.</para><para>(3) and (5) The proposed Democrat amendments to  the  Commonwealth  Electoral  Act would have 
 required the registration of every HTV card issued at a federal election, and the research and analysis of this material by the AEC. The administration of such a scheme, in the few weeks and days leading up to polling day, involving HTV material issued by individuals and organisations for some 8,000 polling booths across Australia, would be an administrative nightmare, inhibit the free flow of information in the political arena, and create more problems than it would solve.</para></answer></subdebate.1></debate></answers.to.questions></hansard>
