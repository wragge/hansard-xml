 face value what you say. I have not had the opportunity to check what you put forward, but I will take that opportunity. The government has a wide-ranging law enforcement priority. It is always a difficulty deciding where to spend the limited amounts of money that are available. You will be aware of the very good work we are doing with our Tough on Drugs strategy, but make no bones about it, Senator Lundy: public servants who leak documents are breaking the law. If you want to come into this place and suggest that it should be a free-for-all for public servants to release whatever information they like, that they can somehow have access to material of government that the rest of the public do not have, and that when they feel like it they can release it with complete freedom, then you do so.

It is true that the Labor government in 13 years did a few good things. They did actually start the process of opening the Australian economy up—with our support, and I am sure they appreciate the support they received. But they only half did the job. The problem was that they exposed Australian industry to international competition but they left Australian industry with its legs tied together: they did nothing to ensure that Australian businesses could compete in the new world which Labor exposed them to. The two critical areas where they did nothing to ensure Australian 
 industry could compete were labour market reform and tax reform. Those two issues have to be addressed if you are going to expose Australian industry to international competition. Without any help from Labor we have moved on those two fronts—most importantly now on tax reform.</para></talk.start><para>The current wholesale sales tax system which this Labor opposition is standing here to defend to the last drop is without doubt the most hopeless indirect tax system in the world. It is a huge burden on manufacturing, which you say you support and defend. The worst effect is on the car industry—again, an industry you say you support and will defend. It may not be known to many—probably not to the opposition—that the car industry is actually responsible for paying one quarter of all of the wholesale sales tax revenue. One industry, the car industry, pays one quarter of all the wholesale sales tax collected in this country.</para><para>There are a lot of reasons why the Labor Party in South Australia is very unpopular: one of them is the Bolkus Left and its machinations; another is the excellent representation from the Liberal Party. But the burden that this Labor opposition wants to keep on the car industry—your tax, Labor's 22 per cent tax that they want to keep on the industry—is critical to Labor's unpopularity and the reason that Labor's worst state is South Australia.	Of course, Labor's idea of reforming the wholesale sales tax system is to add caviar and Lear jets and take the tax off orange juice. That is brilliant. What a great approach to reforming the wholesale sales tax system. Among the anomalies, I referred to the frozen yoghurt problem with wholesale sales tax. There are a number of others. Paper cups used on commercial premises are taxed at 12 per cent but those used in takeaway stores are taxed at 22 per cent. Chairs used at home are taxed at 12 per cent; chairs used by businesses are taxed at 22 per cent. Filing cabinets are taxed at 22 per cent, but one- or two-drawer timber filing cabinets using materials of less than 17 millimetres are taxed at 12 per cent. You expect Australian industry to keep complying with this sort of nonsense, and you are going to try to vote down a new tax system that will 
 benefit Australian industry in order to defend this absolute nonsense.</para><para>I remind the Senate that under our new tax system Australian industry is going to save $10,000 million a year in costs. Savings to the car manufacturing industry will be $1,150 million every year; savings for the mining industry will be $2,970 million a year; savings for the construction industry will be $3,740 million a year; savings for our exporters will be $4,500 million a year; and changes to the fuel regime will save businesses $3,500 million a year. You lot—the ALP opposition—will stand there to oppose all of these savings, which will be all about creating jobs. You are a policy free zone. You do not believe in creating jobs. You do not believe in helping Australian industry.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Knowles, Senator Sue: Alleged Death Threats</title><page.no>482</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>482</page.no><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name><name.id>RF4</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to Senator Vanstone.

As Senator Lightfoot said, a central plank to the government's tax package was the introduction of the 30 per cent tax rebate for people who take out private health insurance. This initiative will have the added benefit of creating a stronger Australian health care system by alleviating some of the pressure on the public health system. This government is committed to maintaining a strong balance between public and private health sectors so that Australians have a choice when it comes to health care. Our promise includes a stronger public system, retaining Medicare with a record $31.3 billion of funding for public hospitals in the next five years. Part of this commitment includes ensuring the public health sector is complemented by a private sector that is fair, affordable, customer friendly and good value for money.</para><para>We introduced legislation for the 30 per cent rebate in the last sittings.

In the time that the Labor Party was in power, Senator Cook may be interested to know, the proportion of the population covered by private health insurance dropped from 70 per cent to 35 per cent. Senator Cook may also be interested to know that the premiums trebled under Labor. So it was a double whammy under Labor. For Senator Cook to call out `rubbish', it is obvious to me that he has not got a clue what he is talking about—which is consistent with his general approach overall.</para></talk.start></continue><para>This is about continuing to help low income earners who scrimp and save to give themselves the security of private health insurance. I am advised that at least 700,000 Australians earning less than $20,000 a year have private health insurance. A family or an older couple paying $2,500 a year in private health premiums will get back about $750 from the government every year. This is effectively a tax cut, and the Labor Party wants to block it.</para><para>In Queensland, my home state, there are almost one million people covered by private health insurance. In the Queensland electorate of Groom, for example, 20,000 people will benefit if the Senate passes this legislation. It will put $10 million a year directly into the pockets of the people of Groom. This rebate has substantial support in the community. The latest research by Quantum Harris shows 67 per cent of those polled believe the government should do more to encourage people to take out or retain private health insurance. Seventy-three per cent would prefer to choose their own doctor if they go to hospital; an option only available as a private patient. The research also found that 59 per cent believe the best way to support people with private health insurance is to make premiums tax deductible.</para><para>We are giving people what they want. It is about fairness and freedom of choice. Labor does not know about these concepts, and you can understand Senator Cook's interjection in that context. They are ideologically opposed to private health care. They cannot open their minds to what Australians want, and it is a demonstration of why they did not win the last election. It is because they are locked in the politics, rhetoric and ideology of the past.	Their own former health minister Graham Richardson knew this when he was minister, and he is still saying it today.

Labor increased the savings that were to be had from the AFP. This government has put more money in the first three years of its term into the AFP than in the last three years under Labor.

You asked what we are doing about those things. Well, Senator, look at the taxes we are removing as part of our tax reform package. I think that will be widely welcomed by the community.</para></talk.start><para>The government does not determine the policies or guidelines that the banks adopt in levying fees and charges—any more than we determine the price of food in a supermarket. These are a response to increased competition which was necessitated by the removal of past subsidies. Bank customers can maximise the benefits of competition by actively shopping around for the best products, services and prices to satisfy their needs. Many deposit taking institutions continue to offer basic transaction accounts with lower fees and charges. For example, all the four major banks offer basic transaction accounts without monthly account keeping fees, although they do have over-the-counter fees. Building societies and credit unions offer competitive everyday accounts.</para><para>Senator, there is an issue here, and let me assure you the government is not ignoring this matter. A new framework for the Commonwealth regulation of the financial sector commenced on 1 July 1998. The government considers that this package of measures will enhance competition and lead to better services and lower prices than would otherwise have been the case. We are also investigating what can be done to address the difficulties that fees and charges impose on those receiving government transfer payments, which are generally provided by direct credit to a nominated account with a bank, building society or credit union.</para><para>Increased competition has reduced interest rate margins, particularly for housing loans. 
 This has required banks to price services more directly to the cost of their provision and, as I said, previous cross-subsidies have either been reduced or removed.

Sadly, when the facts are not checked or when they are ignored and stories are run and picked up by other media, the reputation of people and organisations can be unfairly and unjustly smeared.</para></talk.start><para>The stories centre on some internal audits done by the AFP, on their own instigation, to keep their practices up to date. The catalyst for these series of audits was an incident in the late 1980s and early 1990s—when Labor was in power—when a relatively small amount of money went missing. So the AFP said, `We'd better keep a constant watch on these practices.' As a consequence of these stories running, some people have been led to believe—and you would, if you read the articles—that these audits discovered that drugs, money and other exhibits had been stolen from the AFP by the AFP. This is simply untrue. It is a gross slur on the Australian Federal Police.</para><para>The stories put into question the ethics of the Australian Federal Police, but I think they question the ethics of the writer, and of Mr Kerr who has been so willing to fuel the flames in this matter. It is hard enough for our law enforcement agencies to fight the crooks, let alone to put up with fighting this kind of rubbish in the media. The facts are these. The auditors did not discover any loss of money or drugs and they found no evidence of corruption. The relevant journalist was invited to attend my office with the auditors to indicate the basis on which his conclusions were drawn, because this is a very serious matter. He declined to do so but provided some quotes from the reports on which he had relied. It is fair to say that he 
 has selectively quoted in order either to create a misunderstanding or an impression which is simply untrue. As an example, he constantly referred in articles to money having been stolen. That is the money that was seized in the 1980s and found not to be there in the 1990s—under Labor—which started the audit process off.

Within six weeks of this government being asked for approval to destroy the notes, the approval was given. That is the end of the story.

They simply are not prepared to take any notice of what is happening in the real world, because the Labor Party is actually dominated by the trade union movement.

But what do we on this side find out about membership of the Labor Party? We find that eight out of the last 10 have been trade union officials, and 17 out of the last 20—65 per cent.

I would have thought that the people of Australia listening in to this debate would have been wondering whether the people on the other side had just engaged in frolics of their own or were genuinely concerned about the issues confronting this nation.</para></talk.start><para>Where were their policy questions today about tax reform, health reform and balancing the budget? What about industrial relations reform? What about getting the unemployment rate down? They are not interested in the issues of the day. They want to go on frolics of their own, to talk about the background of ministers. Might I add that many of the ministers have had very distinguished careers in the law. Others have law degrees but, in fact, have not practised law. So what?</para><para>But there is one important difference: if the Labor Party felt so precious about the numbers on the other side who are, in fact, trade union officials, why didn't they defend that fact? No, they did not defend it; all that Senator Faulkner tried to do was turn the tables and say, `Sure, we have got a lot of trade unionists, but so what? You guys have got a lot of lawyers.' I know that lawyers do not necessarily have the highest rating in the community acceptance polls. But I reckon they might fare a fair bit better than trade union officials of the sort of Senator George Campbell, who—as you would be aware, Madam Deputy President—was credited by the former Labor Prime Minister, Paul Keating, as costing this nation 100,000 jobs. I can tell you that all the lawyers on this side, put together, are responsible for creating jobs in this country, not for costing jobs.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Senator Carr interjecting</inline>—</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>N26</name.id><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator ABETZ</name></talker><para>—Senator Carr, you are so right: we did create jobs for ourselves by 
 winning the last election. We did create jobs for ourselves in that regard—and I am sorry that you're still sitting on that side, but not all that sorry, I must admit. The Labor Party know that, each time we point out the fact that there is such a disproportionate number of failed trade union officials on their side of the chamber, it hits a chord with the people. They feel embarrassed about it. They are unable to defend it. They are unable to say that it adds something to the parliament. So what do they do? They seek to attack Senator Alston but, in doing so, they point out the fact that they are unable to deal with the real issues confronting this nation.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I would have thought the people of Australia would have expected a bit better from somebody who parades as the alternative leader of the government in the Senate, namely Senator Faulkner. Where are their policies on employment? Where are their policies on tax reform? We know where their policies on tax reform are. Within two weeks of the federal election the shadow Treasurer was dumped, as was half the policy. We still do not exactly know where they stand on the Toorak tractor tax. If Senator Robert Ray follows in this debate, he might be good enough and kind enough to advise the people of Australia whether those on that side of the house still abide with the Toorak tractor tax, and whether it was really Ms Macklin who designed that tax policy, or Gareth Evans, who got the chop for it. These are some of the important issues that the people of Australia would like to know about.</para><para>The people would also like to know, in relation to the budget, whether those opposite would be committed to a balanced budget. Would they still want to run up those huge deficits, the results of which we have seen in Asia with the terrible social dislocation that that has occasioned? Where are their policies? There are no policies, Senator Faulkner, so all you can do is launch this absolutely pathetic attack. It has been one of your more dismal performances today, but the good thing is that the people of Australia do not need to rely on you and your side to govern this country.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>498</page.no><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator ROBERT RAY</name><name.id>UI4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Senator Abetz appears to refer to a 
 policy free zone. The great policy free zone in this chamber is when Senator Alston gives answers to questions asked and arranged by his own side that do not actually promote public policy but merely represent his skill in abusing members on this side of the chamber. We all know he is not a detail man and he is not a person that can carry a policy argument; he is a rough and tumble lawyer who specialises in abuse. Again today all we got out of him was that this side of the chamber is not representative of politics. So I think it is quite appropriate for us to put the analysis over to the other side and see just how representative is the coalition.</para></talk.start><para>We cannot talk about any National Party members on the front bench: all of them can hardly read and write and none of them can be promoted to that position. You have the Leader of the National Party in this chamber not even on the front bench because he is not trusted. But we do now have Senator Abetz on the front bench. How did he get there, you might wonder. He is a bit like that cartoon character Bristow, 23rd in line for chief buyer. He made it because of his pathetic showing in Tasmania. Because he helped sell down the drain five House of Representatives seats, there were no competitors left. You have got to have two from Tasmania in the ministry and among the parliamentary secretaries. There are none in the House of Representatives and there are only five potential candidates in the Senate. Senator Newman is already there; Senator Gibson has already been axed; Senator Watson is too principled; and Senator Calvert is too comfortable in the whip's job. Who is left? Poor old Eric. You have got to promote Eric. If in the process you can buttress the Prime Minister's numbers, because he is nothing more than Tony Abbott's Tasmanian stooge, then you actually put him in. That is how he got promoted to being 11th in seniority as a parliamentary secretary in the Senate. Congratulations to another lawyer!</para><para>My colleague suggested that we do have two people on the front bench who are not lawyers. Maybe they got swapped at birth in the hospital and something went wrong; I do not know. But we do have Senator Herron, 
 who is quite a brilliant surgeon, although I don't think I have ever bumped into anyone who is so proud of his own humility as Senator Herron is and exhibits it in this chamber. Then we have Senator Kemp, who has got a PhD from the Pancake Parlour specialising in 20th century waffle.

He was doing the add-up before. There are probably 15 or 16 lawyers on their side. There is nothing wrong with lawyers, but do not come into this chamber with double standards and hypocrisy and talk about representation, because it just won't wash.</para><para>Deep behind these comments by Senator Alston is reflected a degree of arrogance and elitism in that people are denigrated for the job they did prior to getting into this chamber. When you rubbish people in this chamber, you have always got to remember that, no matter what side they sit on, they beat someone to get here, usually hot competition. No-one gets into this chamber on a free ride either within their own party or within the electorate as a whole—they have to earn it. They all should be judged and respected on their performance and their contribution in this parliament and not denigrated for their background.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>499</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">Senator FERGUSON</name><name.id>EP5</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am quite sure that anybody listening to the broadcast of the Senate today would wonder what exactly are the most important things that are confronting this nation today. We had a supposed concerted attack on Senator Vanstone today. Nearly 
 every question was directed to Senator Vanstone on a variety of issues, which Senator Vanstone answered quite well. The tactic was to be to take note of Senator Vanstone's answers, but all of a sudden there was a last-minute change in tactics because Senator Vanstone answered the questions so completely that in fact they had nothing to take note of. So Senator Ray and Senator Faulkner between them thought, `Well, what can we do today to deflect the attack and take all of the concentration away from any questions that were asked of Senator Vanstone? Perhaps we will take Senator Alston's answer when he refers to the trade unionists who sit on the other side of the chamber.'</para></talk.start><para>I am quite sure that those listening to this broadcast and those in the gallery today would be quite dismayed to think that the most important thing that the Labor Party could raise in taking note of answers to questions today is the composition of the Senate because Senator Alston happened to make some remarks about the composition of the opposition. Senator Ray says that Senator Alston smeared the opposition. If being referred to as a trade unionist is a smear, I would have thought that some of the people on the other side ought to change their attitude, because I would have thought that senators opposite would have been proud to be trade union members. In fact, many of them probably should have stayed in the jobs they were in before they came here because they come in here representing only the unions' point of view without looking at what is for the benefit of the bulk of the Australian people when we are considering legislation.</para><para>One of the differences is that when Senator Faulkner refers to the number of people on this side of the chamber with law degrees it is because many of those people have chosen to seek tertiary education in order to further their careers—careers that they know can only be enhanced by their own hard work and their own effort. In the chances that they take in either small business or some enterprise of their own, they need to make sure they have a level of education which gives them a chance to succeed in their chosen professions. Senator Faulkner chooses to denigrate those 
 senators when many of the people that he referred to who have a law degree used that law degree to further their careers in many other fields, because their tertiary qualifications and their knowledge of the law helped them to be able to further their careers in whatever their chosen field is.</para><para>The difference is that there is a wide variety of occupations on this side of the chamber. Many of your trade union members have law degrees. I have worked with Senator Bishop for a considerable time and I understand that he has a law degree. In many of the conversations I have had on committees with Senator Bishop, he has talked about studying for a law degree. I know that other members on that side have them as well.</para><para>On this side of the chamber some people have got law degrees to try to get themselves through their professional careers, to further themselves, to be self-employed, to work for themselves, not to latch on to a trade union so that at some later stage in their career they may find their way into this chamber via the trade union movement. Very few people on this side of the chamber have actually achieved their positions in the Senate because they happen to have a law degree, but many people on that side of the chamber are in the position they are in because they were trade unionists and because they had the support of their trade unions to get here.</para><para>Most of the people on this side of the chamber have had to work their way through the organisation and be selected by their peers, or be selected by their electoral colleges, to make sure that they represent a wide variety of professions and a cross-section of the community in order that they can more widely represent the people in their home states. That is quite different from the people sitting on that side of the chamber.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>500</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I wish to take note of Senator Alston's answer today.

R.A.N. casualties are not yet included on the Roll of Honour at the Australian War Memorial alongside Army and R.A.A.F. casualties;

It establishes and provides limited 
 funding for the new Australian Education International to promote Australia's education exports. It updates funding estimates for special capital projects, various grant programs, superannuation and teaching hospitals in line with government estimates of relevant inflation rates, and adds Notre Dame University to the list of institutions eligible for funding for operating purposes, including teaching, research and capital.</para></talk.start><para>It is noted that this bill has been redrafted to combine two pieces of legislation into a new consolidated bill. Part of the legislation was deal with in the previous parliament, but not passed by the Senate, and the other part was only introduced into the House of Representatives.</para><para>The opposition is especially critical of the haste in which this new bill has been introduced and the lack of time that has been given for scrutiny of the bill. We believe this to be characteristic of the way in which this government has handled its legislative program, and specifically its approach to higher education.</para><para>The Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Dr Kemp, who clawed his way into cabinet over the body of Senator Vanstone, is only too happy to use education as a scapegoat for every national problem that he can think of. But he is now most anxious to avoid public debate on his administration. We saw a clear indication of the lack of will of this government to discuss education during the election campaign when, in a most shabby way, they released the Liberal's education policy at 5 o'clock one evening in such a manner as to ensure that there was no examination of the details of that platform. One can understand why Dr Kemp is anxious to avoid public scrutiny of his policies, because under this government the very nature of tertiary education, the very nature of the creative features of our education system, has been fundamentally changed.</para><para>Australia has seen a contraction in the efforts of its education sector and a greater emphasis within the universities on commercialisation at the expense of the traditional role of providing high quality, broad based education of Australian people. We have seen 
 an underlying position of greater emphasis on vocational education within the university sector which this government believes will create more jobs—an assumption which has yet to be demonstrated in fact. Sadly, the narrowing of the focus of our university sector has impacted on every aspect of university life and has resulted in less choice and an inferior quality of education in our universities across this country.</para><para>The very nature and role of academics has been supplanted by the more market driven approach adopted by the government itself. In the past, academics were proud of the role they played in essential and healthy debate within this country. In the past, academics were proud to be associated with public controversy to stimulate debate and questioning of society and the directions that society was taking. However, our academics are no longer encouraged to espouse views and positions which in the past were essentially the mainstream discourse of public life.</para><para>Under this government there has been a shift whereby there is an overriding atmosphere of fear and intimidation where academics are stifled, morale has plummeted and controversy is feared. Likewise, universities have been bludgeoned into accepting a narrower, market driven criteria for their very operations. What we have seen was recently demonstrated by Barry Jones—I think quite adequately—at the inaugural RMIT student union lecture series in Melbourne in August this year. He pointed out that the failure of Australia's universities to fight for the traditional values of scholarship or to contribute to debates on controversial issues has meant that governments can attack them with impunity. He pointed out that, in his experience as Minister for Science, he saw the precedent for this set, whereby the Liberal Party, which is essentially made up of philistines and various forms of ignoramuses—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—Senator Carr, would you please not reflect like that.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>AW5</name.id><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator CARR</name></talker><para>—What?

Philistine elements within the media have taken up the questions that once were raised by Liberal Party spokespeople in their various waste watch committees and the like, suggesting that government grants singling out humanities and other groups were somehow or another wasteful. According to Barry Jones, the various vice-chancellors, rather than defend the actions of the researchers in their universities at the time, were only too happy, with a few notable exceptions, to maintain an eerie silence in regard to the onslaught by these philistine elements within the conservative political parties and the media of this country.</para></talk.start></continue><para>What followed was that various elements of the bureaucracy itself understood that university administrations were not capable of showing the strength and resolution to defend academic freedom that they so often asserted was their due. In practice, they maintained an eerie silence and were thought to be acquiescing to government attacks, thinking that those attacks would lessen in their brutality. A campus review article of 12-18 August 1998 reveals this and demonstrates that this is the same view being expressed by this government. The article says:</para><para>The Federal Education Minister, Dr David Kemp, appears to share this view.

 phy at Melbourne University. The book was about the idea of university, about the central values that a university should embody and about the various notions which the author thought were integral to the concept of the principles of university life. The book was suppressed by Melbourne University Press on the advice of senior members of the university administration, including the Vice-Chancellor, Mr Alan Gilbert, the Director of Melbourne University Press, who was associated with the deputy vice-chancellor, and the Chairman of Melbourne University Press—who had direct links to the privatised university unit, known as Melbourne University Private—being pursued by the university. It was demonstrated by the statements made by the senior management of Melbourne University that this book was being suppressed because, in their eyes, it represented a traditional view of the university which did not give sufficient weight to opposing views.</para><para>According to an article by Peter Craven in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> on 24 August, the book, which had been edited by an eminent member of the university community, was not being published because in powerful opinions there was not sufficient weight given to the managerial and corporate approach of the university's management itself. So where there are complaints about the directions the universities are taking at the behest of this government, we find that academics are being forced to accept the directions and accept a more narrowly based approach.</para><para>For Australia's 600,000 students, the decline in quality has been most evident in the declining courses and subject options, and we have seen the rapid escalation of fees under this government. Who would have thought a few years ago that there would be some 21,000 fewer fully funded Commonwealth places? This government has sought to force upon universities a proposition which involved charging of fees of up to $100,000 for some courses.</para><para>We have seen a decline in the quality in the choices evident in the arts and the humanities with students being forced to absorb some $840 million worth of budget cuts. Staff-student ratios have risen in the 1990s from 
 16.5 to 18.5 students in the humanities, and from 18 to 20 in the social sciences. Faculties have closed and various language programs are disappearing. Seven arts faculties across the country have ceased to exist.</para><para>For students in my state of Victoria, this has meant the closure of the classics department at Monash, the Greek department at Deakin, the music department at La Trobe and the corresponding sackings of large numbers of arts and humanities staff—120 in the arts faculty at Monash University alone. Under this new regime, unless a university faculty and course can make direct commercial return, it is perceived to be of lesser value and as a consequence must suffer staff cuts and reduced resource allocations within the university itself.</para><para>The grand traditions of Australian universities are now directly under attack by this government. The decline in the emphasis and the quality of provision impacts most strongly throughout university administrations, which have suffered the constant burden of finding new ways to get funds and developing new strategies to get around guidelines, shifting their focus from education to the more narrow commercial focuses that the government is seeking to pursue.</para><para>In the election period, the government claimed that it was about breadth of provision, but in reality we have seen a whole series of bills—now seven bills—dealing with higher education. We are now dealing with the funding base for the next three years, with bills being introduced with very little public debate and in such a manner and with such time pressures as to prevent proper scrutiny of what is being proposed.</para><para>We have also seen various surveys and various empirical research emerging from the universities, indicating that there is a growing problem in the way universities are seeking to get around government regulations and government guidelines in the provisions of the HEFA Act.</para><para>A survey undertaken by the National Union of Students and released last week showed that there were 36 universities sent surveys of which 25 responded. There was a rapid escalation in the use of ancillary fees to 
 counter Commonwealth funding cuts. The survey identified 300 fees charged at a departmental or faculty level for items relating to individual course units or subjects. Many of these fees are in clear breach of the ministerial guidelines and, in my judgment, in clear breach of the HEFA Act. Students were charged for such things as email access from home, access to assignment questions exclusively available from the email, requirement for internal students to purchase course materials designed for external students to substitute for cuts in staffing resources that were no longer available, the charging of students for reading lists, and the requirement for students to attend field trips and then forcing them to pay an associated entry fee. These are quite clearly in breach of the provisions of the act, which said that there should be no charging of fees for the essential components of the courses.</para><para>I put a simple proposition to the minister, and I trust he will be able to respond. Minister, what actions has the government taken to investigate the allegations that are being launched by the universities, which are clearly in breach of the HEFA Act? Is the government prepared to review the guidelines covering ancillary fees? Has the government evaluated the adequacies of the levels of funding which universities are currently expected to cope with?</para><para>These measures that we see operating now demonstrate that for the universities the law means very little, because they are able, as we have seen in the case of Melbourne University, to get around those without any great difficulty. The accountability provisions of the profile processes, in my judgment, are now being abused to the point where the New South Wales Auditor-General, Mr Tony Harris, was able to demonstrate that the published accounts of universities do not record all the financial transactions reported in their financial statements, yet this government relies upon the advice from its department as to the appropriateness of the performance indicators based on advice tendered to the department from the universities themselves. </para><para>What we are seeing are opaque accountability practices being used to drive the new 
 performance indicators that DETYA is currently developing. They are meant to examine university finances, deployment of staff, diversity of courses and the various student outcomes, but they all seem to be totally inadequate because, on the government's own admission, interpretation of these indicators is difficult as accounting conventions vary from university to university. Specifically, universities are making internal decisions regarding the centralisation or devolution of administrative functions to hide the true nature of their cost structures.</para><para>This is an attempt by the universities to cope with the growing crisis that is emerging in our higher education sector, a crisis of confidence that goes to the very issues of the provision of quality education in this country. You cannot possibly have the cuts introduced in this bill imposed on universities and not expect them to have an effect on the quality of services provided. These cuts are being demonstrated in staff morale and in students having to cope with larger class sizes and overcrowding in lectures. Also, capital works programs have fallen way behind what one could reasonably expect from a high quality education system. Fewer and fewer staff are being asked to cope with these changes without the necessary support to provide high quality education.</para><para>Last night at the national teaching university awards in the Great Hall we saw the government placing great emphasis on what it is doing to promote quality education and teaching in this country; that is, the provision of $750,000 for various awards for high quality teachers at university. This is meant to somehow or other compensate for the fact that this government has taken the better part of $2 billion away from this sector and has asked the universities to provide services to the Australian people with considerably less resources. This government thinks that, if there is little debate and public scrutiny about it, then they will be able to get away with their actions in such a way as to fundamentally change the culture of Australian education.</para><para>I do not believe that this measure will ultimately be successful. I concede that the 
 vice-chancellors have not fulfilled their obligations in defending the university sector in the way in which I am sure many Australians would have hoped. They have felt over time that, if they go quietly, things would be easier for them. Quite clearly, that strategy will not work because, as the crisis emerges within universities where they are required to do more and more with less and less, more and more people are going to come forward and say, `Frankly, it's just not good enough to expect us to run our universities as if they are mere businesses.' They are much more than mere businesses; they have a social and cultural function to perform which clearly this government has failed to acknowledge.</para><para>I wish to move a second reading amendment which expresses the concerns of the opposition about the way in which this government is administering the higher education budget of this country. We will, of course, be supporting the bill because the money has to flow through to the universities within 30-odd days. I move:</para><para>At the end of the motion, add:</para><para>"But the Senate condemns the government for damaging Australia's vitally important higher education system by:</para><para>(1)	 slashing funding to universities, resulting in 21,000 fewer, fully-funded Commonwealth places; and</para><para>(2)	 increasing HECS charges and lowering the repayment threshold, thereby driving down university application rates by 3.3 per cent in 1997 and 3.1 per cent in 1998".</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>511</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Australian Democrats will be supporting the <inline ref="r595">Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 1998</inline>  for many of the reasons mentioned by Senator Carr. Funding has to be made available to these institutions and we would not seek to frustrate that process in any way. We acknowledge that universities have faced great periods of funding uncertainty over the last few years, particularly under this government. Therefore, we seek to assure them that their funding, or as much as is being allowed by this government, is going to be safely passed by this parliament.</para></talk.start><para>The Democrats support the second reading amendment moved by the opposition. We also condemn the government for eroding the vitally important higher education system through slashing funding for universities and through additional fees and charges. But I cannot let that go without acknowledging the role of the Australian Labor Party—the opposition and former government—in deregulating the postgraduate market and beginning the process of reintroducing tertiary fees in the form of the Higher Education Contribution Scheme and before that the higher education administration charge and also for playing a role in tightening the eligibility criteria for income support for students in the form of Austudy.</para><para>We cannot support the ALP's second reading amendment without at least acknowledging the role of the Australian Labor Party certainly in expanding the sector but not necessarily in matching that great expansion with the appropriate infrastructure funding for teaching, capital works and funding per full time student unit.</para><para>I also refer, as did Senator Carr, to last night's excellence in teaching awards. It was certainly a lovely occasion, simply because we were able to acknowledge and celebrate in one room excellence in academia. It was wonderful to see people in Parliament House from a range of tertiary education institutions and representing those institutions with enormous pride. There were student representatives at that function as well as the President of the National Union of Students, members of staff, vice-chancellors and deputy chancellors.</para><para>It was a wonderful occasion. I must say it was quite nice to see a minister celebrating academic efforts and excellence and I hope that this is something that is set to continue. I understand that the excellence in teaching awards is a bit of a replacement for an idea that was mooted by the former Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone, when she came up with the dob-in-a-don idea, the notion that instead of using carrots we should use sticks, so that we could punish or expose those members of academia who were not doing 
 their best in academic circles. I think it is much more appropriate to actually reward those who are achieving excellence, setting a higher standard, as opposed to simply seeking to punish those who were not considered to be meeting the appropriate standard.</para><para>Seeing Dr David Kemp up on stage last night presenting awards for innovation and for compassion, and for visionary ideas, whether in science and technology, humanities, arts or health, was quite a nice sight. But I do not forget that this government, and certainly Minister Kemp, are responsible for overseeing massive change—radical, regressive change—to a sector that has lost a lot of its funding over the last couple of years of this government.</para><para>The Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1998, as it was called, varies the maximum amounts of grants that can be made to higher education institutions under a range of grant categories. The major implication of this funding bill is the implementation of this government's cuts to the higher education sector for the current three-year period announced in the 1996-97 budget. Last year that funding was reduced by one per cent. This year the amount was reduced by a further three per cent, and there will be a further one per cent cut to university operating grants in 1999 and the year 2000. The funding levels are determined in this bill for superannuation, teaching hospitals and open learning.</para><para>The bill also provides for expenditure on the international marketing and promotion of education and training services provided by Australian institutions, and allows the minister to determine the maximum amount payable by the Commonwealth for the international promotion of Australian education and training services. In 1998, this amount is to be $1.016 million, increasing to $2.468 million in 1999 and to $3.883 million in 2000. A further amendment recognises the recent name change of the James Cook University.</para><para>This bill is particularly timely, coming within a month of the UNESCO World Conference on Higher Education. That conference was attended by more than 3,000 delegates, including 115 education ministers and legislators, scholars, students and officials 
 from around 180 countries. The UNESCO Director-General called for a major increase in the availability of higher education and lifelong learning. He called for a `radical transformation of the higher education landscape', and the conference backed a world declaration on higher education for the 21st Century which endorsed the right of access to higher education based exclusively on personal merit, in keeping with Article 26.1 of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights—not entry to university based on bank balance, but on brains.</para><para>In Australia, the commitment of the Commonwealth to public funding of higher education has never been so weak. This bill reflects the total abrogation of this government of its responsibility to ensure a quality, accessible and accountable public higher education system. In his second reading speech addressing this bill, the Minister, David Kemp, said that this government was proud of the number of overenrolments in our universities. While I support increased access and the opportunity for many more students, regardless of age or background, to enter and participate in higher education, I was stunned to hear this reference by the minister. But the minister was actually referring not to increased access but to the increased number of students who are funded only at a level of over $2,500 each. Even this paltry amount is only paid to universities at the end of the year. This is not an achievement; this is a travesty. And the government is boasting about overenrolments—I guess they are cheaper for the government.</para><para>Our universities in many cases are at a breaking point, faced with overcrowding, as well as continual underfunding. I note that Dr Kemp states in his second reading speech that funding per EFTSU is an increase on 1996 levels. But what Dr Kemp fails to register is that the 1996 EFTSU levels were shamefully low. In 1996 the EFTSU funding, expressed in 1994 terms, was $12,379. However if you compare this with the EFTSU of $12,580 in 1982, you begin to see that the sector has suffered chronic underfunding under the current and the previous governments.</para><para>Not only has this government managed to cram the most students into the system with 
 the least amount of funding, they have also charged HECS liable and upfront fee paying students the highest tuition fees in our history. Of course, they have decided, as the previous speaker noted, to ignore the proliferation of illegal fees—more politely referred to as `ancillary fees'. I congratulate the National Union of Students for their work in conjunction with the National Tertiary Education Union on this issue. It is certainly recommended reading for anyone who cares about real access to higher education. It can be viewed in the NUS ancillary fee survey that was released last week.</para><para>Ancillary fees were a problem identified, yet largely ignored, under a previous government, the Labor Hawke-Keating government. When free accessible tertiary education was effectively repealed by the Hawke government, with the introduction of the administration charge and HECS, these payments were meant to cover the tuition costs of university students. The current government promised to look at this issue prior to the 1996 election, but this was another broken promise—like so many of their promises to the higher education sector. I presume Senator Robert Hill at that time made that promise to investigate the matter of ancillary fees. These ancillary, or illegal, fees are still spreading because neither the Hawke-Keating government nor the Howard government has met the increased demand for education and the expansion of our higher education system with a commensurate or adequate level of funding.</para><para>Students have always been expected to pay the costs of some photocopying, stationery and textbooks, things that they individually benefit from or keep for their professional development and their careers. As the frequency of ancillary or illegal fees increases, more students are finding it increasingly difficult to meet these additional costs. Ancillary or illegal fees must be paid up-front and often without much notice. The NUS survey found that the most disturbing findings were that institutions were charging for services that should reasonably be considered part and parcel of that student's tuition fee.</para><para>While gone are the days where a faculty could afford to provide from within its own 
 budget photocopies of texts for students—we have to acknowledge the funding constraints on faculties and departments—it now appears that a student is financially disadvantaged if they do not have access to their own computer and printer and their own private Internet access. Fifty-nine per cent of institutions charge students for access to the Internet via the university from home, four per cent already charge for email access on campus—and I understand that this figure is likely to increase dramatically—and 65 per cent reported charging students for the use of computer printers on campus.</para><para>Noting that many lecturers demand that students submit their work in a typed or word processed form, this clearly constitutes a barrier for those students who are less wealthy and who do not have access to a computer or a printer at home. Add to this the scarcity of computer pools on campus, particularly as funding cuts begin to bite harder, and you are applying enormous financial pressure, as well as pressure time-wise, on these students. This can only adversely affect the academic performance of those students without access to money.</para><para>Appealing an assessment on a piece of work is already fraught with emotional and professional stresses. A lack of funding to institutions has added a financial penalty to this process. It is an unacceptable situation when a student has to consider the financial implications of a simple request for a reassessment. Reassessment should reasonably be expected to be a standard practice and not an added extra with extra fees attached. Yet the NUS report documents instances where students are charged $23 to get a piece of work reassessed.</para><para>One of the most disturbing aspects of this survey was the finding that students were actually being charged for access to assignment questions. This is clearly a breach of the policy, in spirit as well as in letter. It is disingenuous for the minister to claim, as he did last week, that the issue of ancillary fees is not worthy of address, while he and his Senate colleagues are pursuing an agenda of voluntary student unionism.</para><para>Funding cuts are hurting institutions around the country. We have only to look at departmental cuts and closures, the removal of subjects and curriculum, general and academic staffing cuts, and other changes to know that. At Monash the Peninsula campus has escaped the threat of closure but has been substantially depleted. The downsizing of this campus puts it in grave danger. The arts faculty has been cut and there is talk of bussing the students from that campus to other campuses. This is not a measure of a healthy higher education sector and it is not an isolated example. The University of Tasmania has been hit by cuts to its arts faculty, as has the Northern Territory University. I suspect that Senator Crossin, with her considerable experience in the tertiary education sector, when she speaks will probably enlarge on some of the funding cuts to that institution. Well she may.</para><para>Staff numbers have also been slashed and the government still refuses to honour its pledge to address the ongoing staff wage claim. I also acknowledge that this staff wage claim was not appropriately addressed under the former Labor government. According to Don DeBats' and Alan Ward's book, <inline font-style="italic">Degrees of Difference</inline>:</para><para>Security of tenure in Australian universities is no longer a meaningful notion in Australia.</para><para>Yet this government continues to peddle the myth that our universities are prospering. The Australian Democrats reject this myth, as do students and staff coping with the funding cuts.</para><para>Again, I refer to the rewards for innovation and expertise at last night's function. I put on record congratulations to all those winners. There were students and staff who went home with awards last night. If that is the vision that we have for higher education in this country, that we continue to reward innovation and excellence, it is going to be increasingly hard, almost impossible, to do with a government that continues to slash and burn when it comes to this sector.</para><para>Senator Carr mentioned the idea of tampering with the Higher Education Funding Act. I note that a press release was circulated in the last few weeks by Chris Pyne, the Liberal member for Sturt in South Australia. He 
 effectively said he was putting student organisations on notice that he was prepared to support a government agenda of tampering with the Higher Education Funding Act that currently sees institutions compensated for loss of income as a consequence of state interference. If states are looking into voluntary student unionism, they will find it is a misnomer. Under voluntary student unionism, currently they are able to receive some degree of compensation to ensure that those vital services that we associate with campus life can continue. That may mean subsidised food, catering, sporting facilities or access to the student newspaper. It may involve student representation as one of the many arms of student services provided through student organisations and their fees.</para><para>I give very clear notice that the Australian Democrats, who helped initiate the reintroduction of those amendments to the Higher Education Funding Act in 1992 and 1993 when Karen Sowado was a member of this chamber, are still very much strong supporters of universal membership of student organisations. We see campus life as a holistic experience that encompasses not only the opportunity to take home a degree and pursue academic studies but also to enjoy all the other aspects of campus life—not just research and analysis and taking home a degree but also ensuring that there is a campus environment that stimulates lifelong learning as well as other opportunities for participation and involvement.</para><para>The Democrats continue to believe—unlike this government and I believe to a degree the former government—that education is an investment in our society and its future. It is not a cost. We do not support the increasing fees and charges for education, be they ancillary or legal fees, the changes to a three-tier system for HECS, the introduction of up-front full cost undergraduate fees or continued deregulation of the postgraduate sector. We continue to oppose those fees and charges.</para><para>We have said many times in this place—unlike the Labor, Liberal or National parties—that fees are a psychological and financial disincentive to enter into and pursue higher education. For that reason, we will 
 continue to oppose not only HECS and the premise behind it, but any additional fees and charges that this, or any other government seeks to impose on students. Not only that, we believe in a livable income for students. We believe in financial support, in the form of Austudy and Abstudy as well as a common youth allowance. This is another lost opportunity by this government to ensure that students—especially those from lower income households and disadvantaged backgrounds—had an opportunity to pursue education and training in a way that did not add to the financial and other pressures on their family members.</para><para>We believe that education is a vital part of achieving an enlightened and democratic society, not only in providing economic benefits to this nation—as it inevitably does—but also in ensuring that people have better employment opportunities and prospects, whether it is through the attainment of a degree or a diploma or through other apprenticeships and traineeships. We believe very strongly that the abolition of fees opened up our tertiary institutions to those groups who had previously been locked out or disadvantaged. That is why we condemn both the old parties for imposing fees and charges.</para><para>We will be supporting the second reading amendment, but with the qualification of our acknowledgment that the former government was also responsible for beginning the process of fee charging and running down our higher education sector when it came to inadequate funding per full-time student unit. We will be supporting this legislation, but we condemn the government for continually starving this sector in a way that will not lead to a more enlightened, democratic and educated society.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>515</page.no><name role="metadata">Crossin, Sen Trish</name><name role="display">Senator CROSSIN</name><name.id>7Y6</name.id><electorate>NT</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The second reading debate on the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill gives me an opportunity to speak about an area in which I have had quite a number of years experience. Let me begin by saying that this is, unfortunately, one of those bills to which we are forced to agree because our hands are tied. It is a bit like throwing crumbs to seagulls—probably dried old crusts, at that—because the bill reflects a continuing 
 slide in and lack of recognition by this government of higher education and, in particular, universities.</para></talk.start><para>Gone are the days when we believed that we would finish our secondary education and go to a university, and that would be it. Education now is not a once-only process: it is a lifelong learning process. People around this country undertake additional study either to improve their careers or because they want a completely different career, a career change. But under the Howard government, we have seen the nature of higher education in this country significantly change. This change has caused untold damage. The slashing of funding has raised the barrier to access that education, as has the doubling of the HECS fees. Overall we have seen a decrease in the number of applications for university places.</para><para>The saddest thing about this bill is that, for the first time, we are seeing the massive cuts which were first announced in 1996 being made by the Howard government to university operating grants. This is the first time that the government has sought to bring such cuts before the chamber by way of legislation. This bill sets out the maximum operating grants for universities in 1999 and the year 2000. As I said, the government has introduced legislation to implement the massive cuts which were announced in 1996.</para><para>Let us go back to 1996. In an election environment, we had a commitment from the Prime Minister that he would maintain levels of funding to universities in terms of operating grants. In 1999 operating grants will fall by $590 million. In the year 2000 they will be slashed by a further $140 million to $730 million less than they were in 1996. So much for the commitment to maintain a level of funding to universities!</para><para>Under the provisions of the Higher Education Funding Act the higher education system is funded on a calendar basis and funding is provided on a rolling triennial basis, which means that the level of funding is known for at least three years. This does, to some extent, provide the universities with some certainty about the level of funding they can expect. It should enable them to look forward to some better planning. This bill appropriates funds 
 for 1999 and the year 2000 and provides supplementation for price movements and additional superannuation expenses incurred by institutions in 1998.</para><para>I want to refer to the funding of institutions by the Commonwealth for a maximum number of student places. The level of Commonwealth funding is negotiated between universities and the Department of Education, Training and Youth Affairs. The framework for this funding was criticised and reviewed in the final report of the West committee's <inline font-style="italic">Review of Higher Education Financing and Policy</inline>, which was published in April of this year. Although we should note that the government has yet to make its formal response to the West committee report, I would like to put it on the record that David Kemp has said, and we welcome his statement, that the federal government has no intention of introducing a voucher system for universities. One would hope that it is a commitment that the minister will uphold, unlike the commitment of the Prime Minister in the 1996 election.</para><para>The major funding decisions for higher education for the current three-year period were announced in the 1996-97 budget. The forward estimates for higher education operating grants were reduced by one per cent in 1997, a further three per cent this year and a further one per cent in each of 1999 and the year 2000. That takes the maximum reduction, over that period, to as high as five per cent.</para><para>This bill gives us an opportunity to highlight the tragic downward trend that the government has failed to recognise. The government has failed to recognise the importance of higher education to individuals and to this nation. In his second reading speech the minister said that this government has a substantial investment in education. But, as I have just outlined, that investment is slowly decreasing by one and two per cent each year.</para><para>He goes on to say:</para><para>Australia already has a good higher education system, but there is always scope for improvement.</para><para>How is that improvement meant to occur when learning institutions and not businesses 
 are subject to the reductions in funds and operating grants to the extent that they are in this day and age?</para><para>The minister goes on to say that the bill:</para><para>. . . aims to continue to increase access to post secondary education, including higher education, so that all who can benefit will have access.</para><para>It is really all those who can afford it these days who will benefit from it and have access to it.</para><para>Mr Kemp goes on to say in his speech:</para><para>The government has created an extra 10,000 Commonwealth funded places for undergraduate students in the past two years.</para><para>But the figures contained in the Higher Education Funding Report compiled by the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs tell a very different story. The total number of fully subsidised Commonwealth university places in 1998 under the federal coalition government is 412,555. The total number of fully subsidised Commonwealth places there would have been in 1998 if we had continued to have had a Labor government for the last two or so years would have been 428,725. That is 16,180 fewer university places than would have existed had Labor won the 1996 election.</para><para>These figures are drawn from the Higher Education Funding Reports for the 1996-98 and the 1998-2000 trienniums. Whose name appears on the front of the Higher Education Funding Report for the 1998-2000 triennium? Dr David Kemp. So is the minister disputing his own figures or has he purposely misled the parliament and the people of Australia? Are these the actions of a government committed to improving and increasing educational opportunities for Australians?</para><para>Tertiary education is the key to future economic growth in this country. All modern economies require a highly skilled and adaptable work force and universities offer this opportunity. The changing economy requires all people to constantly upgrade their skills or even gain skills in new fields. This requires a system which allows people to move in and out of training throughout their lives, described by the OECD as a shift from mass to universal tertiary education. We should 
 recognise that further education is the key to future prosperity.</para><para>But the Howard government has singled out our education system for exceptionally harsh treatment. Universities accounted for over 25 per cent of the total cuts in the 1996 budget and this has resulted in a loss of over 3,000 staff positions. This undermines the ability of university staff to deliver high quality education, research and community services, with staff working harder and longer to support students through their education. Tuition fees charged under the Higher Education Contributions Scheme, or HECS, have increased between 35 and 125 per cent and ex-students are now forced to begin repaying their HECS fees when they are earning as little as $21,000.</para><para>In 1998 we witnessed the enrolment of approximately 600 students across seven universities paying up to $120,000 for a university degree, while students with similar scores but no money missed out.</para><para>The most accurate measure of the educational hopes of the community is the number of applications for admission to higher education. According to DETYA, university applications in 1997 dropped by 3.3 per cent. Applications for university study in 1998 dropped by a further 3.1 per cent. As a result of the funding cuts inflicted by the Howard government there are 5,000 fewer fully publicly subsidised places in our university system. There are also approximately 17,000 fewer HECS liable postgraduate places.</para><para>Senator Stott Despoja was correct in saying that I would stand before this parliament and put on record the effect that this has had on the one and only university in the Northern Territory, the Northern Territory University. The Northern Territory University employs about 650 Territorians and provides educational opportunities for over 11,000 people in remote parts of the Northern Territory and the Top End. The tertiary education system in the Darwin region brings in more than $30 million to the local economy. Territorians have fought long and hard to ensure that they have their own education system and are not forced to go interstate to get an education.</para><para>But the value which universities add to our community is being jeopardised. Due to the Howard budget cuts, government funding to our university has dropped by 5.5 per cent between 1996 and 1998. This has resulted in the loss of hope amongst those who want to study—new university enrolments in the territory dropped by 14 per cent in 1997, by far the largest decrease in the country—and a loss of choice for those who want to study without having to move interstate.</para><para>In this parliament we have heard many times about the loss of the English Department and three dimensional studies in fine arts in the Faculty of Arts at the Northern Territory University. The university is currently undergoing a further restructuring program to reduce its faculties from nine to five. One of those at risk is the Faculty of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies.</para><para>Last week the Northern Territory University was the first university to be recognised by the Australian Quality Council. It was recognised in the Australian Quality Awards for Business Excellence. I guess I should be saying that this is a wonderful achievement and that the university should be proud of its endeavours—and so it should. But let us ask this: why isn't this university gaining awards for its excellence in education outcomes and for its ability to produce world's best practice research? Why is it that the university, in order to survive, to put its name on the map and to continue to excel in rural and regional Australia, needs to be recognised as if it were a business operation, as if it were operating in a world league such as banks or mining companies? It was recognised at the business improvement level.</para><para>The NTU achieved the awards against seven criteria: leadership, information and analysis strategy, planning, processes, products and services, customer focus, and organisational performance. But there is very little amongst those seven categories that actually relates to academic achievement, curriculum development, provision of open learning or access for students who need it in rural and remote Australia.</para><para>The NT University began the quality venture in 1993, at the same time as the federal 
 government's contentious quality assurance exercise was being implemented across the higher education sector. It commenced the process in those days to build upon the funding levels it was getting and to further put its name on the map in relation to northern Australia. After that had finished, the university switched to a framework similar to that of the Quality Council, a move that the Vice-Chancellor, Ron McKay, said dramatically improved its performance. The quality report shows significant growth, particularly in research activity, income and capital infrastructure.</para><para>As well as receiving a number of awards, the NT University has increased efficiency flowing from the use of technologies such as online admissions and enrolments. So, yes, it is an achievement for the NT University, and it is something that we should congratulate the university on. But it is a sad indictment that it has had to look to the Australian Quality Awards for Business Excellence in order to put its name on the map. It is a sad indictment that the Howard government has failed to recognise how much a regional university such as the NT University struggles to maintain student enrolments—and we have seen where that did not happen in 1997, with a 14 per cent reduction—and struggles to sell its courses overseas and look for an expanding market. In order to improve its name the university can longer rely on what support it can get from the federal government but has to turn to quality awards through business excellence. So I would like to put on the record my congratulations to the Northern Territory University. It has done an amazing job in a climate where its funds are in a downward spiral and are being disregarded by the federal parliament.</para><para>As I have said before, this bill legislates for the first time the massive cuts that the government announced for the university sector in 1996. It highlights a government that has failed to realise the importance of higher education to individuals and the nation. It certainly fails to recognise the unique struggle that regional universities such as the Northern Territory University have to go through, and it demonstrates, I think quite remarkably, that 
 the government is treating education simply as a cost measurement to the budget—as a way of balancing the books instead of a way of improving educational outcomes in this country.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>518</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank honourable senators on the other side for their contributions. I say at the outset that the government will be opposing strenuously Senator Carr's amendment to the second reading motion. It does so on the basis that the amendment is completely erroneous in what it says. The proposed amendment alleges that there has been a huge cut in funding to universities which has resulted in some 21,000 fewer fully funded student places. I bring to the Senate's attention the fact that the number of fully funded undergraduate places will increase to just over 650,000 in the year 2000. In fact, fully funded Commonwealth undergraduate places increased by over 10,000 between 1996—Labor's last year in power—and 1998. So what we have is an increase in fully funded Commonwealth undergraduate places. When one looks at all students, including fee-paying students, the total number is projected to increase by over 27,000 between 1996 and the year 2000.</para></talk.start><para>This is hardly a picture of doom and gloom, as the opposition and the Democrats would have the Australian public believe. What we have, and what we went to the people of Australia with recently in the federal election, is a very positive platform in relation to higher education. The coalition stated during the election campaign that it would be increasing the number of fully publicly funded undergraduate places in universities by another 4,000 by the year 2000. The coalition pledged that it would continue to protect the rights of Australian students to enter universities on the same terms as overseas students when all fully publicly funded places had been taken up. As well as that, the coalition pledged that it would increase funding above previously announced levels for research infrastructure by over $90 million over the next three years—again, another measure which is a very positive step in relation to higher education in this country.</para><para>The coalition announced that it would increase funding above previously announced levels for strategic partnerships—that is, the essential partnerships between industry and universities in relation to training and research. Funding for that is to be just over $58 million over three years. In fact research training opportunities will expand, with more than 26,000 research degree student places projected for the year 2000 compared with fewer than 22,000 in 1996. What we have here are very positive steps indeed in relation to higher education in Australia.</para><para>I say to the Australian public that when you have this sort of political stunt, where you have a second reading amendment alleging that this government has slashed funding to universities, resulting in fewer funded places, you need to look at the record of this government over the last two or three years and look at what we have pledged to provide. More importantly, look at the bill that we have here in the Senate today. This is a bill that provides not only for the appropriations for universities next year but also for some important aspects such as extra funding for James Cook University in Queensland, funding for the strategic partnerships—I have mentioned that that involved over $58 million over three years and that it will involve research and research training partnerships between universities and industry—and further funding for Australian Education International, which is involved in the marketing and promoting of Australian education overseas.</para><para>It is perhaps worth while to remind the Senate that the export of education in this country entails some $3.4 billion, which makes it one of our biggest export markets. I do not think many Australians appreciate that. That is hardly likely to occur in a situation where, as the opposition and Democrats say, there is such a terrible state of affairs in relation to higher education. What we have is an increase in intake of overseas students. What we have is Australia enjoying a very high reputation in relation to its tertiary education sector. That can occur only if the environment for that sector is a good one. It can occur only if the government of the day 
 is taking the right steps in relation to that sector, and indeed we are.</para><para>In this bill is another matter which is somewhat close to my heart as a West Australian, and that is funding in relation to the Notre Dame University. For some time now we have provided funding on a discretionary basis, and that will now be set on a recurrent basis. The Notre Dame University in Western Australia has an exceptional history in relation to indigenous education. I have visited the campus in Broome on more than one occasion, and I can recommend to senators, if ever they have the chance, a visit to the campus, and also the one in Fremantle. This is an institution that has not been entirely reliant on taxpayer funding but has been the result of the initiative of individuals who have got together on a voluntary basis to set up what I believe to be one of the finest universities in this country. We as a government believe that there should be flexibility in the tertiary education sector. The point that I have just made in relation to Notre Dame is such a case in point, where there is flexibility and where the efforts of private individuals can result in great value to the community.</para><para>What we have also provided for is the option for fee paying places. Of course, this provides more opportunity for Australians to engage in tertiary education. Senator Stott Despoja attacked the government in relation to the Higher Education Contribution Scheme, and I note also attacked the opposition, which also supported the scheme when it was in government. HECS, as it is commonly known, is not an impediment to access to higher education; in fact, the enrolment data suggests the contrary. When one looks at the Higher Education Council report on HECS between 1996 and 1997, the largest rise in the number of commencing students occurred in law. That rise was 18 per cent, and that was in a discipline which has the highest HECS category. That would suggest that HECS does not act as any impediment to access to higher education.</para><para>Last night we had the Australian awards for university teaching. That was indeed a great innovation, brought in by this government, which celebrates the teaching which occurs in 
 our universities. It recognises the excellent work that is going on in the tertiary sector. I congratulate the University of Queensland and the University of Tasmania, which were joint winners of the institutional award for services to Australian students. That award recognises the focus that those universities place on quality teaching and learning outcomes. I also congratulate the University of Canberra and the University of Melbourne, which were joint winners of the award for services to support the special needs of international students. Again, as a senator for Western Australia I have pleasure in congratulating Murdoch University, which was presented with a special one-off award for educational services to students in the community. These awards recognise the importance of the good work that is taking place in the tertiary education sector. It also demonstrates this government's commitment to this sector, as does this bill. I commend the bill to the Senate.</para><para>	 Question put:</para><para>	 That the amendment (<inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carr's</inline> ) be agreed to.</para></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>16:54:00</time.stamp><para>The Senate divided.	</para></division.header><para>(The President—Senator the Hon.

In speaking to the opposition amendment, you argued that there were now more students in Australian universities and that, if I understood you correctly, more money was now being spent on higher education than had been spent in the past.</para></talk.start><para>This strikes me as an interesting argument. It appears quite contrary to the known facts that are apparent in this matter. The government has cut $2 billion from the forward estimates of the Department of Education, Training and Youth Affairs, has it not? A great bulk of that has come out of the higher education sector. Minister, in the words of the former assistant secretary of the department, David Phillips, has not the government reduced the number of fully funded Commonwealth places in the forward estimates by 21,000?</para><para>Has it not, even in this particular measure, imposed upon this sector further reductions in 
 terms of those forward estimates to give effect to the policy announcements made in 1996? I ask you to answer those questions, Minister, because it seems to me that there can be no fudging on this question. There can be no amount of sophistry and no attempt to confuse the public about these questions. Either there has been a reduction on the forward estimates by those sums or there has not.</para><para>You speak of a total number of students. You conveniently combine in your estimates the number of Commonwealth funded places and the number of privately funded places. You seek to suggest that research infrastructure funding has increased and that the strategic partnership and various other initiatives taken by this government can compensate for the fact that close on $2 billion has been removed from this department. In terms of individual students, this has in itself had serious consequences for the level of quality services provided by Australia's universities.</para><para>In this bill you talk of the measures taken, for instance, in regard to educational exports. You made a commitment some months ago that there should be some $21 million promised for new international marketing. Is it the case that that is new money or old money? Minister, I will return to these themes, but I would be interested to know if you could answer those particular questions to begin with.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>521</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—As I stated at the outset, part of the sector I was addressing concerned the question of places. I stated that the number of fully funded undergraduate places will increase to just over 650,000 by the year 2000. I mentioned that the fully funded Commonwealth undergraduate places have increased by over 10,000 between 1996 and 1998. And the government stands by those figures. That is a statement of the position. If the opposition does not like that, too bad. But that is an indication of the state of good health of the tertiary education sector.</para></talk.start><para>If the opposition is saying that expenditure of money alone is the yardstick, I would venture that such things as research and the number of places available are also aspects 
 which are to be measured in gauging how well a sector such as the tertiary education sector is going. As I said earlier, the total revenue available to higher education institutions from all sources in 1998 will be $8.5 million—the highest level of funding available to that sector so far.</para><para>Of course, I did include the question of fee paying students in the assessment of the increase in places of 27,000 students between 1996 and the year 2000. There was no subterfuge about that, because that is an aspect of flexibility which this government has introduced to the tertiary education sector—an aspect which many Australian students are taking up and something which can only provide opportunities for Australian students. This question of fee paying positions has no mystery about it. It has been something which the government has been up-front about and it is something which I have included in forward estimates of increasing places. So there is no great mystery in that, Senator Carr.</para><para>The department's publication <inline font-style="italic">Selected Higher Education Student Statistics—1998 Preliminary</inline> states that overall domestic student places have increased by 3,897 from the 1997 levels to a total of 464,619 in 1998. That indicates that between this year and last year there has been an increase. So that would answer your question, Senator Carr, as to where this sector is trending in relation to access to higher education, which is after all the very point that you and the Democrats are making.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>521</page.no><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator CARR</name><name.id>AW5</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Minister, you have once again managed to combine the question of publicly funded places with privately funded places. You seem to believe that by some sleight of hand this will not be noticed by the education community. I trust that you would appreciate the view that it is not satisfactory, that there has been in fact a reduction of some 21,000 places on the forward estimates, as indicated by former senior officials of the department when these cuts were announced. No matter how much the government tries to duck this issue, there are in fact 21,000 fewer fully funded places available under this government than otherwise would have been the case. 
 Minister, is it not a fact that university operating grants will fall by  $590 million from the 1998 level? Is it not a fact, Minister, that in the year 2000 under this bill they will decline by a further $140 million to $730 million—below the funding levels in 1998?

</para></entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table><para>(18)	 That the provisions of the bills implementing the proposed new tax system stand referred to the previously mentioned committees for inquiry and report in conjunction with the terms of reference authorised by this resolution, as soon as the bills have been introduced in the House of Representatives.</para><para>(19)	 That when the bills referred to in paragraph (18) are first introduced in the Senate and a motion is moved for the second reading of the bills, debate on that motion shall be adjourned at the conclusion of the speech of the senator moving the motion and resumption of the debate shall be made an order of the day for 19 April 1999 without any question being put.</para><para>I will only speak briefly to this amendment. It has taken quite some time to get an agreement that is eventually very similar to where we started, with a select committee looking at the overarching issues. This committee will be known as the Select Committee on a New Tax System. It is being established to inquire into the government's tax package and to report on or before 18 February on the modelling and the economic theories that underpin that package.</para><para>As well, there will be three references committees, as has been the proposal over the last couple of weeks. I will look briefly at the select committee—which I think, Senator Faulkner, is very similar to the Labor Party's initial proposal for a select committee—and I will run through some of the details of the structure of that committee. It is proposed that there be three Labor Party members—with the Labor Party having the chair—three Liberal 
 Party members and one Democrat member. The difference between this and other select committees is that we will also have participating members, where any of the four other senators in this place—the Greens, Senator Harradine or Senator Colston—may come and participate at any time in the hearings and, of course, in the report writing as far as that committee is concerned.</para><para>Looking at the workload that will be involved with this overarching committee to which the other three references committees report, we have included the ability of parties to substitute. For example, if the committee is travelling to Western Australia and you have members there who may prefer to do that hearing, then it will be possible to substitute members off and on that select committee.</para><para>We can look at some of the other changes to the original motion that was before this chamber today. One of the other changes is to the final reporting date. That is now 19 April. We have come forward some five or six weeks, and the government has dropped to what is middle ground, shall we say. If we can get this up and running tomorrow and we can get advertisements in the weekend papers, I believe we will still have sufficient time for submissions which are due in by the end of January. Of course, the Labor Party, the government and the Democrats will now have to go away and look at who they want on this committee. The Labor Party will have to look at who they wish to chair this committee. Once that is done, hopefully we will be able to start fairly quickly.</para><para>As part of this motion we have the sitting patterns for next year to make sure that the committee has time to work and that the government has time to deal with its legislation. In particular, I refer to the time before Easter where, while we have allowed for four weeks of sitting, we have allowed four weeks for these committees to meet as well as a week for estimates. The compromise there is that, yes, the government has time for its legislation, but we have time for the committees to travel and to do the work that they have to do.</para><para>The report is due on the first sitting day after Easter, on 19 April. As you will see at the very back of this motion—I will just take senators through it, as I know some are picking it up for the first time—the tax bills will be made an order of the day for 19 April so that we can do everything we can to facilitate the six weeks of sittings to deal with this legislation. The sitting pattern will be moved as an amendment in a moment by Senator Kemp. I will just explain why the two Fridays are in there. This is part of the agreement to give the government the full six weeks. The Fridays make up for the Anzac Day holiday and also the fact that we actually run out of time at the end of June and lose another day. In fact, the two Fridays are in there to give us the full six weeks of sitting. Senator Kemp, I presume you are going to circulate the actual calendar.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">CAMPBELL</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Campbell</name></talker><para>—It has been circulated.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>8U4</name.id><name role="metadata">Lees, Sen Meg</name><name role="display">Senator LEES</name></talker><para>—As it has been circulated, I will take senators through it.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Crowley)</name></talker><para>—Senator Lees, I do not want to interrupt you, but it does seem that a lot of colleagues are not clear about exactly what copy you are addressing.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>8U4</name.id><name role="metadata">Lees, Sen Meg</name><name role="display">Senator LEES</name></talker><para>—It is No. 1156 revised.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">FAULKNER </name><name role="display">Senator Faulkner</name></talker><para>—Madam Acting Deputy President, can I make this point of order.

I will just try to ignore the interjections. The Acting Bureau Chief of News Ltd has written to me indicating that his view is that the journalist agreed. I have spoken to my chief of staff about this matter and I want to set the record straight as best I can. My chief of staff rang the journalist and asked whether he could come down and show us where he believed he was justified in making the statements he had. My chief of staff said the journalist declined and said he might be able to come later, but appeared very disinterested in the whole process and indicated he would send down some quotes. The journalist's version of events, as best I can ascertain it from News Ltd, is that he was invited to come down, that he declined to come at the time but indicated he would come at a later time.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I can see a difference between `might be able to come at another time' and `Yes, I will be able to come at another time'. The bottom line is that the journalist was invited to come down and did not do so at that time. There are other matters in the letter that I have received from Mr McPhedran that I could go into but, as a courtesy to him, I will not do that until I have had the opportunity to raise it with him, because I believe he has written to me under a misunderstanding. Suffice to say, there is a simple misunderstanding. The journalist believes he said, `Oh, no, I can't come now but I would love to come at later date.' My chief of staff indicates an entirely different story, which is, `No, I can't come now and I might be able to come later.'</para><para>I conclude with this simple remark: it is very easy when you have a job as a journalist and you can write anything you like, and you can sledge the reputations of other people as much you want. You can twist and turn and misrepresent and not get the facts right and you expect the Federal Police and anybody else to just wear it because it made a good story. You think that if you refuse to come to a function but say you might be able to come later that you should have been reported as saying you could come later, and that you are entitled to create a huge fuss. Therein lies the difference. That is the ends of my personal explanation. It is a personal explanation about a misunderstanding.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>541</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I think what we have heard from Senator Vanstone is an attempt to correct the record in the chamber because of misinformation that was given by her in an answer to a dorothy dix question in question time today. It was done in a most ungenerous spirit by Senator Vanstone. She did not actually use the words, `I misled the Senate.' She did not actually say, `It was a fabrication,' as she was eventually forced to over the Wright family incident.

 brought down—and we do not know whether that code of conduct is still in force—that code of conduct did contain an obligation on the part of ministers to come into this chamber and, at the earliest opportunity, correct the record if they had either deliberately or inadvertly misled the parliament. It is in that spirit, I assume, that Senator Vanstone speaks under standing order 190.</para><para>I received a copy of a letter that went to Senator Vanstone.

Copies of that letter, going through a number of very serious concerns in relation to an answer to a dorothy dixer that Senator Vanstone gave today, went to the Prime Minister and to me as Leader of the Opposition in the Senate. Madam Acting Deputy President, it is appropriate, if Senator Vanstone has misled the Senate, that she correct the record. Next time she does it—it is a very regular occurrence with this particular minister, as all senators on this side of the chamber and, I am sure, the press gallery would know—she should come in and do it a little more graciously.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>7E4</name.id><name role="metadata">VANSTONE</name><name role="display">Senator Vanstone</name></talker><para>—I don't believe I have!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name></talker><para>—If you do, why don't you come in and admit that you misled the Senate a little more graciously than you have managed on this occasion.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>7E4</name.id><name role="metadata">VANSTONE</name><name role="display">Senator Vanstone</name></talker><para>—If I thought I had, I would.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name></talker><para>—After all, you have set a very bad example with the Wright family.

It is very difficult for the opposition to make that assessment because we have only just been provided with a copy of the amendment, which represents, I think it is fair to say, an arrangement that has been agreed between the government and the Australian Democrats. That is fair enough; that is the political process. It may also have involved other senators—I am not aware of that—but I think it is proper to put on the public record that those negotiations did not involve the opposition, though I do appreciate that at times Senator Lees and her colleagues have attempted to keep the opposition apprised of what their negotiations have brought about. I do acknowledge that, but I think it is also very fair to say that we are not in a position to be able to make an assessment as to how many of the concerns of the opposition have been taken account of until we look at the documentation.</para></talk.start><para>The opposition, in its earlier proposal, put forward the concept of a single and comprehensive inquiry into the government's proposals. We suggested originally that that should be conducted by a Senate select committee, which was totally unacceptable to the minor parties and the government. But now there has been a massive switch of position and the opposition's original idea of a select committee is now found to be acceptable, so there has been obviously quite a significant conversion here on the road to Damascus.</para><para>We have maintained that the original reporting date of the last sitting day in May next year was the best possible time frame for a serious committee of inquiry. I am certainly not satisfied with the time frames that are contained in the motion before the chair, but I also indicated a very clear willingness to work through with other parties that particular issue so we could look at trying to achieve 
 majority support for an acceptable reporting date.</para><para>We continue to believe that what the opposition has put forward is the most sensible and logical way to approach this particular issue. We cannot imagine why the government chose to reject our original proposal for a select committee, or the proposal we then moved for an inquiry to be undertaken by one references committee, in favour of an extremely complex, multi-pronged investigation that will obviously take the same amount of time to conduct. I have indicated all the way along the line that the opposition is willing to compromise on this issue. That has been the spirit with which the opposition has approached this debate. We will continue to support a compromise position but we strongly favour a single inquiry by a single committee. I accept that that is unlikely to gain majority support, but the Senate seems to move inexorably closer to some of the views the opposition has expressed from day one in relation to this matter. I  move:</para><para>Omit all words after "That", substitute:</para><para>(1)	 "the following matters be referred to the Economics References Committee for inquiry and report on or before the last sitting day in May 1999 and that in undertaking this inquiry the Committee consult widely, holding hearings in all states and territories:</para><para>(a)	 the measures announced in the document Tax Reform not a new tax a new tax system and the provisions of any bills implementing the measures;</para><para>(b)	 the assumptions, calculations, estimates, projections and modelling concerning the various proposals either separately or jointly including, but not limited to:</para><para>	 (i)	 the distribution of wealth in the Australian community, including the distributional impact on differing household types;</para><para>	 (ii)	 the adequacy of the so-called compensation measures proposed and the possible erosion or withdrawal of compensation;</para><para>	 (iii)	 the impact on services provided by non-government organisations such as charities;</para><para>	 (iv)	 the effects on low and middle income families of taxing the necessities of life;</para><para>	 (v)	 the effect of the GST and other items of the Coalition tax package on wage costs;

Despite those negotiations, nearly all of which the Labor Party has not been involved in, we have always had a bottom line. I want to remind the Senate what the Labor Party's bottom line is. We want a thorough inquiry. We want a properly resourced inquiry. We want an inquiry that has enough time to explore the many issues that are contained in the government's tax proposals, including the important question of the veracity of Treasury's assumptions and modelling and issues such as the impacts on employment, interest rates, inflation and investment. We want an opportunity to address those issues. We want an inquiry that allows organisations, interest groups and the public a capacity to make serious submissions to the inquiry and participate in the processes of the inquiry. Most importantly, we want an inquiry that explores how this makeover of the tax system will affect people on low and average incomes, who are struggling to feed, cloth and educate their families.</para><para>It is almost the end of November. We still await the details of the government's Vos report. Nothing about the Vos report has been made public or tabled. We still await the details of the government's legislative package. The rumblings of the charity sector alone are important enough for us to demand the release of the Vos report and the deliberations of the Vos committee's investigations on the GST.</para><para>Our original proposal was for a single Senate select committee to examine the government's tax proposals. We thought that would be the best and simplest vehicle to examine these important issues. A select committee would have had explicit powers to 
 call for and examine persons and documents. A single select committee would have been a more holistic, efficient and effective approach. Now we have this massive change of view by the government and the minor parties. Having previously canned and bagged the idea of a select committee, they are now willing to embrace at least part of the opposition's original proposal.</para><para>When our proposal for a select committee was voted down by all the non-Labor senators in this chamber, we accepted that that was not the Senate's preferred position. That is why we put forward an approach that made the Economics References Committee the key investigative committee in this particular inquiry. And we did that in a spirit of trying to reach consensus.</para><para>Mr Costello, the federal Treasurer, along with his liegeman here in the Senate, Senator Alston, has made a complete hash of the negotiations that have taken place with the minor parties and Senator Harradine. You would hope by this time that Mr Costello would have woken up to the fact that if you actually want your legislation to go through you have to have a proper inquiry. If there is no inquiry, Mr Costello's beloved GST will not see the light of day. That always seemed to me to be the overriding political priority for the government. The only people who could not see it were the government members themselves. They failed to understand that that was the bottom line politics here.</para><para>But we say that the overriding objective of a parliamentary inquiry should be that it provides proper and thorough parliamentary scrutiny. That is why, at the end of the day, while we know our proposal is better and we will vote for it, in the final analysis we will, if required, support some form of compromise. We do not think that the proposal that Senator Lees moved is the best possible scenario. I hope that it will be adequate to do the task that is so important in this inquiry.</para><para>I want to ensure that this Senate committee does exert maximum scrutiny on Mr Howard's and Mr Costello's proposals. I think that the Economics References Committee can adequately conduct the initial spadework on the Treasury assumptions and modelling of 
 the effect of the tax system, and I think that the three other references committees will be able to explore the effect of these tax changes on issues such as job levels and our health system.</para><para>We are proposing that the Economics References Committee investigates other matters, such as savings and investment, and that, at the end of the day, the Economics References Committee will pull everything together and produce the final report. That was our proposal. Originally, we had a select committee; now, the Democrats and the government are embracing a select committee.</para><para>But I come back to what the Prime Minister said in relation to this issue—what his own words were. He described this as a `most historic and significant reform'. It is surely reasonable that the complexities and effects of this legislation—this massive change to the tax system—need to be teased out. After all, the government seems to be in denial mode about the role of the Senate in relation to legislation before the parliament. I think there is a great expectation—certainly by those who voted for Labor senators—that we ensure that this is a very thorough inquiry, with the capacity for proper scrutiny of the government's proposals.</para><para>I have to say—through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, to Senator Lees—that, from the point of view of the opposition, some of the elements contained in the motion that she has moved are not adequate or acceptable. As I said earlier, the reporting date of 18 February 1999 for the select committee is, in our view, inadequate. It is really just another repeat of the Vos committee, which had a 17-day reporting time frame. So many people were critical of the Vos committee, as having an unrealistic time frame and deadline; and I think the same goes for the proposed Senate select committee.</para><para>Submissions from the public have to be in by the end of January—that is going to be a little restrictive and unfair on the numerous community groups who are rightly concerned about the goods and services tax. I think at least another week or so would be reasonable and ought to be granted or, at least, the committee ought to have some discretion in 
 relation to the acceptance of any late submissions.</para><para>I gather there is an understanding between the minor parties, Senator Harradine and the government about membership of the Senate select committee. As you would recall, Senator Brown, Labor's original proposal for a Senate select committee was broader and, in my view, more representative. Membership here has been restricted to the opposition, the government and the Australian Democrats. I assume there is an agreement amongst the minor parties. It is difficult for me to be able to judge these things, because I am speaking, literally, with a minute's notice of the motion before the chair. I have not even had an opportunity to have a private discussion with any of the other players, as you would appreciate.</para><para>I think Labor's proposal was more sensible. It was fairer. It would have enabled others to participate in this important task as full committee members. As I understand it, and briefly reading the proposition before the chair, you will have a situation where a number of minor party and independent senators can participate, but not vote. So there is obviously a fundamental difference between ourselves and Senator Lees and others in relation to this matter.</para><para>We accept that the Democrats and Senator Harradine prefer to make fuller use of the existing committee resources of the Senate. Labor will fully participate in those processes, of course, once the various committees get under way. But we believe the proposal that I have put before the chamber is a far superior model than the one the government has been arguing for, which, of course, is the lowest common denominator—a half-baked, toothless Senate committee. The government's motivation has always been to hide what it can about the critical aspects of the introduction of a GST.</para><para>I have got to say there is an awful lot of hypocrisy from the government in relation to the approach on Senate committees. In the remaining couple of minutes available to me—and perhaps one my colleagues might care to address this issue later in the debate—let me say that there is a very long history of 
 government senators, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Hill, the minister at the table, Senator Kemp, and other ministers, now ministers in the coalition government, who spent so much time arguing for a role for the then opposition, the coalition when they were in opposition, to chair a range of Senate committees. Many senators on this side of the chamber would recall that, and I hope that other senators might care to canvass it.</para><para>When you hear Senator Alston puffing himself up, getting himself involved in the debate, trying to undermine Senator Hill and trying to do Mr Costello's dirty work for him over here in the Senate, you realise that he does not really understand the history of how the Senate standing legislation and reference committees evolved and developed. Senator Alston does not know any of that history and does not realise what Senator Kemp, Senator Hill and others said on the public record over the years.</para><para>It really beggars belief that the government and the minor parties did not sign on to Labor's original proposition before the Senate, which was a single, purpose-built committee which would have conducted and presented a coherent, thorough and comprehensive examination and report into all of the government's proposals. There is a last chance to do it, and I urge that the Senate support the amendment that stands in my name and get an inquiry that can do the job.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>546</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on the amendment proposed by Senator Lees. As many senators will be aware, negotiations have taken place probably for the best part of two weeks, and I think it is probably fair to say, Senator Lees, that we have had our good days and our less good days in terms of the negotiations. But the negotiations have continued through, and I think that in the end we were able to successfully work through a number of rather difficult and complex issues. I think it was important that we tried to meet, as far as we could, the various demands that were being made by senators.</para></talk.start><para>The government's position has always been that we went to the election on tax reform. 
 The Labor Party said that this was a referendum on tax reform, and this government won that referendum, to pick up the Labor Party's terms. As I have said, we have not seen a need for an inquiry, because the truth of the matter is that we went to the election with a very comprehensive and detailed tax reform package. But we understand that there is a disposition in the Senate, a majority in the Senate, that wants a comprehensive inquiry, and the government will cooperate in the achievement of that goal. We expect, with the program that has been worked out, that we could look for a vote in the Senate on the tax package bills prior to 30 June.</para><para>The government's position has always been that we need sufficient time to ensure a proper debate on these bills. Equally, I think the Democrats position, as expressed by Senator Lees and supported by minor parties, is that they were very anxious to have sufficient time for these committees to sit and consider what I might say are the very extensive terms of reference which have been put before those committees, which I think in many ways go far outside the tax package which has been proposed by the government. Nonetheless, we understand that senators wish to inquire far and wide, and we accept that. We were able in the end to reach a compromise where we believe, as a result of some very effective work by the Manager of Government Business on sitting times, that we can achieve those twin goals of providing sufficient time for what must be really one of the most comprehensive inquiries the Senate has ever undertaken and at the same time provide some six weeks for these bills to be properly debated in this chamber.</para><para>I foreshadow that I will be moving a motion to set out the proposed sitting times for the first half of 1999 in the terms which have been circulated in this chamber. As Senator Lees mentioned in her motion, this will allow the Senate to have some six weeks to sit and consider these bills. I was surprised at Senator Faulkner's comment that the 19 April date was not sufficient time for the Senate to consider the matters which have been referred to it. It is a very long time by any stretch of the imagination. Of course, we are not talking 
 about only one committee here, the Senate select committee. There are three other committees which will also be sitting and reporting at the end of March. If you add up the times at which senators will be working on these bills, this is a very comprehensive inquiry by any standard.</para><para>The government will assist the inquiry in any way we can and we will cooperate in any reasonable way. The government's bottom line is that we want passage of those bills. A compromise has been reached which meets the demands of the non-government senators for a comprehensive inquiry and, equally, it meets our requirement for sufficient time to properly and fairly debate these bills.</para><para>Senator Faulkner, we have no illusions about the attitude of the Labor Party and the approach it has taken to tax reform. The Labor Party is still smarting because it was defeated at the last election. It is essentially refusing to accept the results of that election and the endorsement that the government received for its tax package. It is unfortunate that the Labor Party has come to this debate in that spirit but, as I said, we have no illusions about the attitude of the Labor Party. We hope that, as this inquiry proceeds, the Labor Party will adopt a more sensible and cooperative attitude, but I do not hold out any particular hopes for that.</para><para>Senator Lees, it has been a rather prolonged process of negotiation. As I said, we have had our good days and our bad days, and I think this is a good day in the sense that we have reached an appropriate compromise. I hope that the other senators in this chamber will recognise the effort which has gone into reaching this stage, and accept that account has been taken of the various proposals put to the Senate.</para><para>I think the government has behaved most appropriately in these circumstances. The government has recognised that the majority of the Senate seeks an inquiry, and we believe that no-one could argue that the inquiry set out in Senator Lees's motion is not a comprehensive and detailed inquiry about a very wide range of matters, some of which are not directly related to the tax package.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Opposition senators interjecting</inline>—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">CAMPBELL</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Campbell</name></talker><para>—It is the longest inquiry in Australian Senate history.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name></talker><para>—As my colleague Senator Campbell said, this is probably the longest inquiry in Senate history.

He was dig 
 ging in. He was saying how intransigent the Democrats were and that they would never give in. It is a long day in politics that does not end. As we see, the government has capitulated—and I think fairly substantially—to the demands of the Democrats.</para></talk.start><para>Comments have been made on how long these negotiations have taken and how complex they were. I wonder why the government did not at some stage look at the original Labor Party proposal for a select committee, on which the Labor Party had only three of the nine members, and probably not the chair. The only thing I think they would have found exceptional was the reporting date, which we indicated a degree of flexibility on. Basically, that was the purist position that any sensible government would want, but this government cannot accept that because the Labor Party put it up.</para><para>Why have a select committee? Why not a reference committee or a legislation committee? We are dealing with an issue that has elements of both principle and legislative scrutiny. Neither a legislation committee nor a reference committee could thoroughly do the job. Therefore, a select committee is the obvious alternative. We have select committees to range across a whole range of areas without artificial barriers.</para><para>Two weeks ago I might have sat down and thought, `How can we turn the GST into a grand farce? Why don't we have a select committee doing two different references, with massively tight reporting dates, and have three reference committees going at the same time? That sounds like the full Moscow Circus to me.' But we did not come up with these propositions. We did not try to turn this whole thing into a grand farce. I do not know where the proposition came from or what the arguments are for having three references—originally seven. I do not know. It has never been explained to me.</para><para>The only explanation I can think of is that there were seven reference committees and there are seven Democrats, so each one of them would have had some input on them. But that would mean that I would have to presume that the internal dynamics of the Democrats were ones of divisiveness driven 
 by personality differences and not ones of people who evacuate strawberry ice-cream every night! That would have to be the explanation.</para><para>So I will give the government credit here. If you negotiated them down from seven to three committees, well done. But, for heaven's sake, what is the environment committee doing there?</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Senator Brown interjecting</inline>—</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>UI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator ROBERT RAY</name></talker><para>—I see. Well done, Bob. You got that put in. That was part of your negotiating ploy, no doubt. But basically, in terms of the relevance of the GST, any fair-minded person would probably have ranked that committee fifth or sixth, unless they had a particular interest in the area. So what we are seeing emerge from all this is some sort of gigantic compromise which has very little utilitarian value. As I say, if you could have gone back to the very simple Labor Party proposal—one committee, the Labor Party with only three out of nine members, and comprehensive terms of reference—we could have negotiated the same sort of reporting date of mid-April and you would have had a coherent and sensible report. But, of course, because we put it up, it was dead. Maybe we should have been more subtle. Maybe we should have put up everything but the one select committee, which would have led the government into the killing fields, the killing zone, and they would have automatically accepted it.</para></talk.start></continue><para>So the Labor Party can at least say, `I think we put up a sensible proposal.' This proposal is more sensible than the first one. Having three reference committees going away and working on this rather than seven is more manageable. Having an overarching select committee is as sensible as having the reference committee as the overarching one—I think we can see that.</para><para>But let us have a look at the first problem that I perceive—and that is the reporting date. I can only go from experience of Senate committees. If we are lucky, we will set this committee up tonight or, by the latest, tomorrow, which is about 25 November. In the normal course of events we are expecting submissions—if I read this motion correctly—

I have not been able to give it a full analysis, but it occurs to me that that first time line will be too short and it will be a pity if the committee then had to come back and ask for more time. Everything else is contingent on it completing its work by 18 February, because then this committee goes on and takes an even bigger terms of reference to get its report in—by 19 April, if I read correctly. At the same time, we are to have three other references committees beavering away on extensive terms of reference. So what the government basically has to do is feed material into the select committee twice and into three references committees. Wouldn't it have been a lot easier just to put it into one select committee?</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">FAULKNER </name><name role="display">Senator Faulkner</name></talker><para>—On one occasion.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>UI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator ROBERT RAY</name></talker><para>—On one occasion.

My advice to Mr Costello, as it was to other people in the House of Representatives—I never had to give it to Mr Keating because, let's face it, he never would have thought of negotiating with the Senate—is to leave it to the Senate professionals, leave it to their front bench to negotiate these things and then it is likely to proceed much more apace. Even though he has limited ability, Senator Kemp could have moved these negotiations forward a lot more quickly than Mr Costello ever could have done.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I move on to a couple of other points. Looking at the sitting dates, I worry about the procedural matter that we actually set sitting dates as an amendment to a massive amendment to business of the Senate. In other words, you have a motion that you virtually delete. You replace it with another motion and it becomes business of the Senate. Then you amend on that the future sitting weeks. I think that is an extremely poor process—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>AW5</name.id><name role="metadata">CARR</name><name role="display">Senator Carr</name></talker><para>—It will turn around and bite them.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>UI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator ROBERT RAY</name></talker><para>—Well, I do not know about it turning around and biting anyone, but it is a very poor technical process for this chamber to involve itself in. And one wonders really whether it qualifies as business of the Senate without notice being given. Nevertheless, we want a sensible result here so I will take that objection no further. Essentially the government has dropped out a couple of sitting weeks in what we might call the autumn session to allow these committees to work more strenuously and without the impediment of the Senate sitting and it has added those two sitting weeks to April.</para></talk.start></continue><para>There is no longer the traditional five- or six-week break there, so basically the Senate will be sitting through from 15 February to 30 June. One thing I can guarantee all senators is that we are not going to be sitting past 30 June. You can give up any thoughts of that because the new Senate is due in at one minute after midnight that night. In essence the government has borrowed two weeks from the normal break and occupied them with Senate time to allow the committee more time—so basically it will be through here. I do not think they have added to the potential sitting weeks overall. I think this would have been the number of sitting weeks—Senator Campbell can nod—had we started on 1 February and followed a normal pattern and, as such, it cannot be said that the government has added to the program.</para><para>The next question that comes up, because we have not been consulted on most of these things, is what happens to estimates committees. Most people would be aware that the supplementary estimates due for August this year were cancelled because of the election. We did not insist that they be brought on again in the spring session because of the tightness of time—basically it would have made it very difficult in this current sitting pattern—nevertheless, we have remaining questions coming out of that, and we obviously have additional questions for the additional estimates process.</para><para>I understand there has been no final decision made yet as to when we will do those 
 estimates, but I think the Manager of Government Business has given me an indication of what he thinks is the proper course, and there has been some discussion about one or two necessary spill-over days. I think that can all be resolved to our satisfaction without impacting on any of this. We were of course worried that, in this new series of arrangements, somehow the additional estimates may disappear out of the system. But our concerns in that regard have been assuaged by Senator Campbell's having those matters in hand. I hope Senator Campbell will be able to establish those actual dates in the next week or so before people leave here, so that they will know their timetable for these committees next year.</para><para>In summary, we now have a select committee that has to do an enormous amount of work. I do not know how many other select committees are going to be set up in this parliament. At the moment this will be the only select committee we have because each one of them, I understand, ceases to exist after the prorogation of parliament. I think there should be some discussion over the next week or two about how many of the past select committees will be re-established. I think the ideal number of select committees operating at any one time in this chamber is two. Given the fact that we have about 43 committees around the place, prioritising which ones get re-established will not be an easy task—again, I think that should be addressed in the next two weeks. This just makes it a little harder because, obviously, we think this select committee will get up. Once this one gets up we have a situation of whether we can afford to re-establish the other three.</para><para>From the funding point of view it is going to get more difficult the more committees we have—coming out of, I think, a fair arrangement made with the Department of Finance about 18 months to two years ago. That is another challenge ahead. We have to resolve that, we have to resolve the estimates timetable and we have to resolve who is going to go on this committee. I warn the Senate that I think it is a very ambitious program, and it is going to be extremely difficult to meet the 
 timetables and scope of the inquiries. I think in some ways having one extremely well-resourced committee would have been better than the scattergun approach of having four committees. Nevertheless, four committees are better than no committee, I suspect, not only from our point of view but also from the government's point of view. It is a pity that they took so long to come to the negotiating table. As Senator Kemp said, you have good days and bad days; I suspect today was a pretty bad day for the government. It basically had to run up the white flag to the Democrats and give them everything they wanted.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3L6</name.id><name role="metadata">CONROY</name><name role="display">Senator Conroy</name></talker><para>—And Senator Harradine.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>UI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator ROBERT RAY</name></talker><para>—In the end this proposal hinges on every senator in the Senate, not just the Democrats—I understand that—but they did most of the negotiating.

It is not a trade bloc as such, but it does provide a platform which facilitates trade reform and more. It also provides for the transfer of technology and economic cooperation and, importantly, a commitment to educate people about the benefits of trade liberalisation. One of the great challenges that remain for all of us in politics is to take people with us as we seek to achieve the overall benefits that trade reform brings while always acknowledging that any structural change to an economy, whether it is a national economy or a global one, causes some people and some industries to be hurt.</para><para>A number of key outcomes were achieved in Kuala Lumpur last week. There was a slowing of the reform process, but I think Australia played a good role. In fact, it ensured that APEC focused closely on the regional crisis, having prepared the ground on a number of fronts since October last year.</para><para>Australia's economic governance initiative was acknowledged by APEC ministers and leaders as a key contribution to the region. Leaders agreed to the proposals by the Prime Minister to reaffirm the commitment to APEC's free trade investment goals; to adopt national policies promoting growth; to endorse international best practice codes in transparency in financial sector management; to endorse a future role for the G22 in pursuing initiatives to strengthen the international financial system; and to establish a working group on private sector involvement in crisis management, which Australia has offered to chair. In line with a key trade policy objective for Australia, APEC leaders also stressed the importance of early progress on broad based multilateral negotiations in the World Trade Organisation. Other outcomes were not as high profile but were valuable in groundbreaking. There was further significant liberalisation through APEC economies for individual action plans and China, Indonesia and Korea, in particular, made important new liberalisation commitments.</para><para>The APEC blueprint for action on electronic commerce is a dynamic response to an important regional and global opportunity. Australia also co-chaired the task force which promoted that blueprint. We accelerated regional cooperation on the critical year 2000 computer bug program and will hold a regional crisis planning conference early next year. We secured APEC-wide endorsement for an Australian initiative to improve community understanding of the benefits of open markets, critical to raising understanding of the benefits of open markets and that trade equals jobs. We look forward to working closely with our New Zealand colleagues to achieve a strong outcome under their chairmanship in 1999.</para><para>APEC is a very important regional trade cooperation bloc to Australia. APEC commenced with very strong support from Aus 
 tralia. We were very much part of the Bogor declarations in 1994 which set in place the 2010 and 2020 trade liberalisation timetable. That is important to us. We pushed it hard. It is a forum in which Australia will continue to play a very strong role. It did so last week, and we look forward to the next meeting in New Zealand in 1999.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>554</page.no><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name><name.id>RF4</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I too wish to speak on this document. As has been described by Senator Sandy Macdonald, it relates to APEC and Australia's role in it. What is true is that the performance by Australia at APEC last week was nothing short of a national disgrace. The outcome of the forum last week was disastrous not just for Australia but for the economies in this region.</para></talk.start><para>It is important that the Senate remind itself of what the significance of APEC might be. Should there be success in meeting the goals of APEC, the GDP of member countries will increase by 6.9 per cent. Overall that is an increase of $745 billion going to member countries. For Australia, success with APEC will boost our GDP by 4.4 per cent or—using 1996 dollars—by $22.8 billion flowing into the Australian economy, which will lift Australia's trade performance by 14.6 per cent. They are the goals that Australia is striving for in APEC—genuine goals that create jobs in this economy.</para><para>When you put the figures out there plainly, you can see that, if it is a choice between APEC or the GST, APEC wins every time. APEC creates jobs and wealth for this country; the GST creates a job destroying tax for Australia. What has beset national debate in this country over the last 18 months has been a GST—not the objectives of APEC, which could yield these results for the nation and increase jobs for Australians in almost every industry sector.</para><para>In terms of priority, what does this government do? It puts its priority into a GST. It puts no effort into APEC and it stands back, shocked and horrified, when APEC collapses around its ears. One of the so-called trumpeted successes of APEC last week was that the proposals advanced by the United States in 
 Vancouver last year—the ones under the rubric the Early Voluntary Sectoral Liberalisation Scheme proposals—were referred at Kuala Lumpur to the World Trade Organisation. This is hailed as a way of continuing to try and negotiate progress across a head of areas in trade that are vitally important to Australia. What has happened to them is that, rather than the difficulties being confronted and the problems solved in Kuala Lumpur, they have been pigeonholed in Geneva for dust to collect on them and no progress to be made. If this government were serious about jobs, it would have made a bigger effort.</para><para>The other salutary point that needs to be borne in mind is that, of the 21 APEC nations, China, Russia, Vietnam and Peru are not even members of the World Trade Organisation. So presumably, if these matters referred to the WTO—without a timetable to be addressed and without any commitment to pursue them, but just sent there—miraculously are negotiated and come back to APEC, at least those nations will have no commitment at all to the outcome. This is a disaster for Australian trade negotiations. This government has let this nation down because it regarded APEC as a Labor plot. It besmirched the reputation of APEC in the 1996 election. It has not had the courage to confront the gains that it can produce for this economy and try to put a decent effort into pushing forward the agenda.</para><para>So what did we have? When Vice-President Gore read a homily to some Asian leaders about democracy in their nations, we had a cringing Prime Minister, dressed up in a batik shirt, pulling his forelock to the Prime Minister of Malaysia and saying, `We don't stand with the Americans on those points. We will make those points privately to you, behind closed doors, in an Australian way.' That is not the Australian way. The Australian way is to tell the truth straight from the shoulder, honestly, openly and directly, not behind closed doors, and to let everyone know what you believe and where you stand, and to negotiate a constructive outcome from that position. We cringed. This is a national disgrace. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>554</page.no><name role="metadata">Hogg, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HOGG</name><name.id>7L6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Initially I did not have the report in 
 my possession but, having reached for it, I find that the first thing that hits one's eye is the heading `Australia's Individual Action Plan: Trade Equals Jobs'. As one starts to flick through it, one sees a rudimentary report which outlines specifically the actions that Australia has taken in this area with APEC. There is one thing it does not do: in no way does the report reflect the outcome of trade equalling jobs. The last thing that is mentioned in the report is jobs.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Cook before me mentioned the matter of the early voluntary sectoral liberalisation, which was so eagerly looked forward to. But as he rightly pointed out, that has been put on the backburner. It has been put off the agenda completely to lie in a cupboard somewhere at the WTO. Our hope for success in job creation in Australia is to see the tariff barriers, obstacles to our exporters, being broken down. And at a time when we had great hope and faith that the government would push the early voluntary sectoral liberalisation, which had been agreed at the previous APEC meeting, we find that this now has been withdrawn. So the individual action plan, as I said, gives in a rudimentary style the basic detail of Australia's individual action plan, but it in no way goes to say how that is going to equate to jobs for Australians.</para><para>One of the things that the Australian community is sceptical about in this area is the whole issue of trade liberalisation. Of course, they keep asking themselves: where are the jobs being created? All that mention of trade liberalisation does is create fear in the minds of people, and one can understand that. Here was an opportunity for the government to translate the successes of APEC and to try to push the successes of the trade liberalisation that has taken place in the Australian economy, along with our Asian neighbours, so that in turn we can reap the benefit with greater employment in Australia. But no, that has not happened. Early voluntary sectoral liberalisation has been shelved and that is one of the worst aspects of the most recent meeting of the APEC economies in Kuala Lumpur.</para><para>It gets back to this report whose title says `Trade Equals Jobs'. Unless that can be explained to the Australian people, then 
 scepticism will remain. The claim is that we are basically a low tariff nation, yet our neighbours invariably have a high tariff regime. Whilst they have been through an economic crisis, their reaction to that economic crisis has been to put up the barriers again, not only the tariff barriers, but the non-tariff barriers. So the need for the Australian government to play a proactive role to drive forward the agenda on the early voluntary sectoral liberalisation was terribly important indeed. But, of course, it was too little too late, as always with this government, and we are undoubtedly going to suffer the consequences of that into the future.</para><para>If the government were in any way serious, when they got into government they would not have dropped schemes such as the Development Import Finance Facility. Even when one talks to small business today about APEC and Australia's role in APEC, we still have put to us the collapse of the Development Import Finance Facility. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>555</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The document in relation to Australia's individual action plan is obviously very important for Australia. It is one of the few discussion documents that we get in this chamber on policy issues of trade, about what Australia is going to do and what the rest of the world is saying. We can compare this with what is being achieved within the community.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Hogg has rightly recognised that there is a great deal of cynicism—and I have to say mistrust—about global free trade. This mistrust did not start in the last couple of years. The elements of this mistrust actually occurred and, I believe, manifested themselves partly in the results of the 1996 elections. At that stage Paul Keating was the Prime Minister and was bouncing ahead with the prospect of APEC. Many people in the community wondered what the impacts would be.</para><para>We were still trying to work out what the impacts were of signing the Uruguay Round of GATT. There has been a great deal of concern within the community that the promises proposed by free trade simply have not manifested themselves. It is not just about what tariffs we have and have not reduced or 
 the tariffs that other countries have reduced. Australia is trading more than it ever has before. It is quite clear that we are importing. Our growth in imports generally increases considerably more than our growth in exports. So we and a lot of other countries can be trading, but not necessarily getting net benefit for our countries. If we were to add in, and we do not, environmental and other social costs involved with certain sorts of industries and certain subsidies which we continue to pay to major industries—and I think there is a story to be told in many parts of Australia on that—we might wonder whether or not we are simply trading ourselves either into a standstill or trading ourselves backwards in relation to the benefits within Australian society.</para><para>Senator Hogg has rightly named employment as an issue which is continuing to worry people. Even though we are trading more, we are not necessarily employing more people. We have noticed that in recent years our economy can be growing for several quarters in a row and yet we still are not employing more people. We are failing to recognise that it is not growth or trade per se that makes the difference, it is the way we organise the economy: what kinds of thing we produce, how we organise it, what we use, whether we concentrate on using big capital, whether we concentrate on those goods and services that do not require many people or whether we look at different ways of doing things.</para><para>In recent years people have been the enemy. Employees, human beings, have been seen largely as a cost of production. When we have seen documents come in about international competitiveness, largely they have been about reducing the cost of labour, reducing the number of people employed and reducing the amount of money paid to those people who are being employed on an hourly basis or on a weekly basis, and if possible putting people onto individual contracts. They are about deregulating the labour force and deregulating other issues that are seen to be simply a cost of production for industry, such as environmental standards, social standards and even justice rights for indigenous Australians. </para><para>It seems to me that a lot of issues have been brought up by this report of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Unfortunately, we have never really had this debate in Australia. We have never really done a full assessment of the social outcomes of what happened when Australia signed the Uruguay Round of GATT and then—as all this had started—what the impacts would be of Australia taking on a free trade zone based in the APEC region. Then it was largely a peripheral debate—and still is—about what happened in relation to Australia going along with the suggestion of signing the Multilateral Agreement on Investment, the so-called free trade on steroids.</para><para>We believe, and we are told, that this is now on ice, but there is still no great certainty as to what the outcomes are in relation to the Multilateral Agreement on Investment, all of this outside any kind of concept of authority—I will not talk mandate but moral, ethical or legitimate authority—coming from the ballot box. Most people are concerned about a lot of the changes associated with globalised free trade and the impacts they are having on them. They can see that a lot of the benefits that were promised are not coming to them. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para><para>Leave granted; debate adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Australian Securities and Investment Commission</title><page.no>556</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>556</page.no><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name><name.id>SF4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><para>That the Senate take note of the document.</para><para>Senator Hogg has sought leave to continue his remarks, but I will come back to that later and make a few remarks in the meantime on the annual report of the Australian Securities and Investment Commission, which used to be the Australian Securities Commission. It changed its functions on 1 July this year by adding new tasks to those it already had. It sets out, in a very graphic form, the new people with whom ASIC has to deal. It mentions consumers, banks, insurance agents and consumer organisations. It is good to see that this commission is expanding the very good work it has done under the more than able chairmanship of Mr Alan Cameron. I 
 think he is entitled to say, as he does in his review of operations, that he is proud of `the Australian Securities Commission's contribution to Australia'. He is confident in the Australian Securities and Investment Commission's ability to carry out its expanded role effectively and enthusiastically—and I think that he will.</para><para>In the previous discussion that took place on the issue of Australia's individual action plan which centred on APEC, Senator Margetts and also Senator Hogg mentioned that issues are to be seen not only in economic terms but also in social terms. One additional thing I would have liked the annual report of Australian Securities and Investment Commission to deal with is the issue of the employees of the various companies over which it has jurisdiction—such as meat companies in Wodonga, Grafton and South Australia which have so conducted their operations that their employees have been left short of their pay and remuneration. That is an issue which I will mention to Mr Cameron at the next meeting of the Joint Corporations and Securities Standing Committee, which hopefully will be re-established shortly and with which I hope to continue my association. The parliamentary committee deals with ASIC on a very amicable basis and much useful information is exchanged.</para><para>I will take the opportunity when it next arises to ask Mr Cameron about the way that ASIC intends to look at this issue of employees being denied their rightful pay and remuneration because of a company's failure to trade profitably so that money is available to it. The tragedy is that money is not paid as it becomes due and, when the company goes into liquidation or gets into financial difficulties, those workers are denied their proper reward.

Early last week I had the pleasure of returning to the north-east Arnhem Land community of Yirrkala on the Gove Peninsula. It is the second time in my career in this Senate that I have had the pleasure of speaking about this community. It is a community with which I have had a long ongoing relationship since I first arrived in the Northern Territory nearly 17 years ago.</para></talk.start><para>Last week was the occasion of the celebration of 30 years of operations of the Yirrkala Business Enterprises. In that area it is commonly and affectionately known as YBE. Tonight I want to tell you a bit about Yirrkala Business Enterprises. It is one of those quiet achievers you seldom hear about. It is the first Aboriginal industrial company in Australia to operate without government assistance. It is solely owned, operated and controlled by Aboriginal people, and it has now clocked up 30 years of operations. It is owned and operated by 19 Aboriginal clans from the region. It has grown over the years and now employs a work pool of over 200 people, most of whom are local Yolgnu Aboriginal people. Its annual turnover is now around $9 million.</para><para>Its core business activities include ore haulage at Nabalco's bauxite mining and alumina processing plant. It also has carriage of roadworks for the Northern Territory government, engineering maintenance, horticulture, landscaping, earthmoving, environmental rehabilitation activities such as seed collection and propagation, roadworks, dam construction and waste management services. The company also markets and sells high quality Aboriginal arts and crafts throughout Australia and overseas.</para><para>An important feature of the company's training and working environment, and no doubt a large part of its success, is that it allows Aboriginal people to fulfil cultural obligations and to maintain traditional lifestyles. I am pleased to note that we have the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs in the chamber, so I hope he takes note of that.</para><para>Yirrkala Business Enterprises began life back in 1968. Its founder was Keith Larner, a former Yirrkala missionary. 	As part of the approval to mine in the Gove area, Nabalco, the mining company, agreed to employ Aboriginal people provided their services were commercially competitive. Yirrkala Brickworks started up to supply building materials for the nearby township of Nhulunbuy and Nabalco's alumina refinery. I have been told that it supplied over 1 million bricks during the construction phase.</para><para>Later the Yirrkala Brickworks was incorporated as Yirrkala Business Enterprises. During its 30 years of operations it has provided more than 1,000 local people with training, skills and work experience. Many former employees are now working in other Aboriginal associations or using the training acquired at YBE to work as drivers, equipment operators, gardeners and mechanics in homeland centres. YBE has provided Yolgnu people with employment and allowed them to share the economic benefits of local economic development while at the same time maintaining their traditional lifestyles and meeting the demands of Aboriginal ceremonial obligations.</para><para>An important development came in 1996 when YBE was awarded a Nabalco contract to haul ore from Rocky Bay, which is an inlet on the Gove Peninsula. This boosted the company's annual turnover by some $2.5 million and provided additional work opportunities for about 20 people. Importantly, the mining of the Rocky Bay ore will last about 20 years and provide security of employment and financial stability for YBE and its employees.	Following the start of work on the Rocky Bay project, the former general manager of YBE for 10 years, and now the ATSIC Commissioner, Mr Gatjil Djerrkura, said that the achievements of YBE presented a model for mining companies and Aboriginal communities throughout Australia to work together.</para><para>He said:</para><para>We can work together and understand each other, appreciate each other's culture and so on. If we can do it here, I am sure the rest of Australia and the rest of the world can see that nothing is impossible for us.</para><para>Under Gatjil's guidance the enterprise prospered, undertaking a wide range of work for Nabalco as preferred contractor. This has allowed them to provide employment and training for local Yolgnu people in keeping with YBE's goals, which are to promote the social and economic advancement of the Yirrkala people, to provide training and employment for Aboriginal people, to encourage and implement Aboriginal self-determination and self-management according to their own pace, style and development, and 
 to maximise Aboriginal involvement and enjoy permanent employment.</para><para>YBE and all the Yolgnu people and those Balanda non-Aboriginal people who have been involved over the years should be congratulated for their successes. I know it has not been straightforward. They have had setbacks along the way as most large companies have, but they have persevered.</para><para>It is important to also note that the aspirations of those involved with YBE are similar to many other Aboriginal communities throughout our country and the Territory. Often Aboriginal people are labelled as being anti-development—usually by those people pursuing their own economic agendas or by those seeking to undermine Aboriginal self-determination. However, the amount of economic development on Aboriginal owned land in the Northern Territory clearly demonstrates this sentiment is patently false. Aboriginal people are clearly on the record as wanting development agreements on their land as long as that development takes into account Aboriginal landowners and their concerns over sacred sites, the environment and their cultural practices and provides employment and training opportunities. After all, it is in their interest to develop an economic base which lessens their dependency on the political whims of governments.</para><para>YBE is a long-running example of where Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal economic aspirations can coincide and where there is good will and respect on both sides.</para><para>I would like to finish with the words of Gatjil Djerrkura, who said at the time of his departure to take up the position of ATSIC Commissioner:</para><para>This is our country. We feel responsible to look after it so it will bear fruit. We're looking beyond the present situation to ways to develop security and stability for families. We're looking for survival.</para><para>The achievement that we've made with Nabalco is far too costly to be tokenism or anything that is of detriment to Aboriginal causes, and I think it's an achievement that we all should be proud of.</para><para>I think he is right. The motto for Yirrkala Business Enterprises is, `We stand firm to develop our future.' And the last 30 years 
 have proved that by standing firm together they can achieve this. They have achieved 30 years as a business and an annual turnover of $9 million without any government assistance. Once again, congratulations to all those at YBE for what they have achieved, and congratulations to all those who have been involved in that achievement.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tall Poppy Syndrome</title><page.no>559</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>559</page.no><name role="metadata">Watson, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WATSON</name><name.id>VJ4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Tonight I wish to speak on a peculiarly Australian condition—the tall poppy syndrome. Thomas Spalding Jnr holds an Ambassadorial Scholarship from the United States. As part of his scholarship, Thomas elected to study his MBA at Bond University on the Gold Coast during 1997. The Ambassadorial Scholarship is supported by Rotary International and Thomas addressed Rotary clubs throughout Australia on the differences he perceived between the business attitudes of North Americans and the business attitudes of Australians.</para></talk.start><para>One point that Thomas Spalding Jnr dwelt on and was astonished about was Australia's tall poppy syndrome. He could not understand the Australian pastime of lopping the tall poppies—in North America they are put on pedestals and adored and emulated wherever possible. There is a lot of emphasis on individualism and achievement. In bewilderment, Thomas could only paint a picture of how great this country could be if it followed America's example and supported its high achievers—if it valued competence, individualistic enterprise and accomplishment.</para><para>This problem is so significant that Norman Feather, Professor of Psychology at Flinders University in South Australia, has conducted a series of studies where students respond to hypothetical scenarios in order to research attitudes towards tall poppies. The studies were concerned with value systems, envy, social comparison and other psychological processes.</para><para>Results indicated that negative attitudes were more likely to occur amongst subjects who were low in self-esteem, who assigned less importance to values concerned with achievement and social power, and who were 
 more to the left in their political preference. The Leader of the Opposition, Labor's Mr Kim Beazley, is a testament to this result with the idea, during the last election, that a combined income of $45,000 to $50,000 a year is `rich'. This is absolutely unbelievable.</para><para>So too is Labor's attempt to deny 700,000 Australians with an income of less than $20,000 a year, a 30 per cent rebate on their private health insurance. Mr Beazley thinks the rebate only benefits the high income earners; perhaps he believes that individuals on $20,000 a year are rich.</para><para>Professor Feather tells us that the expression `tall poppy' is unique to Australia. It does, however, have a long history. In ancient Roman history, the elder Tarquinius cut off the heads of poppies as a message to his son on how to deal with his enemies. The term was used in the nineteenth century in the British parliament. In the 1930s, New South Wales Premier Jack Lang referred to `tall poppies' in public office who needed to be cut down to size.</para><para>The historian Hancock notes that a crucial assumption of the Australian society in the 1930s was a `fair and reasonable' standard of living for everyone, accompanied by a distrust of special excellence, a dislike of authority and a dislike of status seekers—perhaps something to do with our convict past.</para><para>Tall poppies may be conspicuously successful in business, the entertainment industry, sport and, of course, politics. Professor Feather believes that, generally, politicians are more likely to be criticised because they are making decisions on people's livelihood. Hard economic times can have disastrous effects on those in the political arena.</para><para>Because of the public attention they attract, tall poppies usually receive a lot of media attention. The media, indeed, has a lot of sway. Reversing people's negative attitudes to tall poppies is an important ingredient in influencing the advancement of society and the achievement of progress.</para><para>My office therefore sought to establish the views of some constituents on the counterpro 
 ductive pastime of lopping tall poppies. Constituents felt that children idolise their sporting heroes and look for leadership; but, as they get older, they become more querying and more susceptible to the comments of their peers, who are influenced by the older generation and negative press. The lack of national pride, or even state pride, and a preoccupation with the press's word as gospel was thought to be unhealthy. One constituent told of her embarrassment about buying a Kylie Minogue record. You do not have to tell Kylie about that—she had to leave Australia in order to get the recognition she so justly deserved. The same constituent would buy a John Farnham record and not feel embarrassed, because he is `a nice guy'. It appears John relates to the young and to the old. On the other hand, it seems Kylie does not.</para><para>It was felt that jealousy, suspicion, innuendo and a tendency to bag people, rather than focus on positive attitudes, contributed largely to the problem. Jealousy plays a significant part in the tall poppy syndrome. The bagging starts when people do not have the same intellect or the same ability to get the same sorts of skills. But somehow this is justified in order to bring the tall poppy down a peg or two. People cannot bring themselves to actually say, `Congratulations on being successful.' Instead they say, `I suppose you'll increase your prices now.'</para><para>Constituents believe the political system does not help and that public slanging matches actually decrease confidence. As politicians, we must be aware of these sorts of attitudes. We must aim to develop positive outlooks. We must encourage and reward achievement. Energy, enthusiasm, self-confidence and self-motivation must be actively promoted and enjoyed. No Australians must ever feel uncomfortable about standing out in a crowd.</para><para>We must turn the negative attitude—the tall poppy syndrome—around, otherwise it will hurt our country. At this time, Australians really need a very positive approach. I believe that the Olympic Games will be good for Australia. It is only the beginning. We must ensure tall poppies are watered and blossom to their full potential.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First International Conference on Drugs and Young People</title><page.no>561</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>561</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is a pleasure to follow on from that contribution by Senator Watson. I say for the record that some of us are not embarrassed to purchase Kylie Minogue records. We like supporting young blonde women in public life—trust me.</para></talk.start><para>On the weekend I was honoured to give the opening address at the First International Conference on Drugs and Young People, which concluded today. I would like to take the opportunity tonight to congratulate the organisers, the Australian Drug Foundation. I want particularly to congratulate them for incorporating into this conference a substream which looked at presentations from young people. Even in the area of youth affairs, it is often not that easy to incorporate young people's participation—even though it is, of course, quite essential.</para><para>When it comes to drugs and young people, the issue is always discussed as a problem. It is not often we hear young people's views on illicit and illegal drugs. Rarely are they going to speak candidly to adults, let alone professionals, their parents or, say, politicians. It is not just young people who are secretive. Recent media reports make it clear that governments seem to be having a lot of trouble in releasing research that has demonstrated high levels of drug abuse amongst young people.</para><para>It is hard to collect information on drug use and why young people would take drugs. Obviously, there are a variety of reasons—whether it is depression, or risk taking or experimentation, to name a few. For some, illegal drug taking will be a stage and they will pass through it, fortunately, without harm. One of the scariest statements I have read on the topic is this:</para><para>As young people move out and into the work force and take on more responsibilities they gradually leave drugs behind.</para><para>We have a teenage unemployment rate of around 27 per cent. Perhaps if we are very serious about tackling illegal drug use then 
 governments, in particular, must consider job creation strategies.</para><para>If politicians, bureaucrats, health workers, teachers, parents and the media head off to the moral high ground, if they blindfold themselves with zero tolerance and ignore the reality, then we do not always get the real picture. I wonder if young people will believe us when we talk about such issues.</para><para>I commend the health department on its harm minimisation resources, such as `Rethinking Drinking' and `Candidly Cannabis' which recognise that some young people do take drugs and that they should be informed as to how to minimise health risks to themselves. There are also some excellent Internet sites such as `Stop Drugs'; some others are not so accurate or helpful. The Prime Minister, of course, is able to see the same research and information as I do, yet we hold different philosophies and advocate different positions on drug law reform.</para><para>The Democrats support harm minimisation over zero tolerance in relation to drugs. We believe that drug abuse is a social and a health problem that should be addressed primarily through medical and social services, not through the law and justice systems.</para><para>I do not doubt that the Prime Minister is committed to reducing drug related deaths and drug related harm in our community. He created the Australian National Council on Drugs and is spending almost $200 million over four years on the Tough on Drugs campaign. First launched in November last year, the Prime Minister described this strategy as a balance between law enforcement and education, treatment and research. I still think that the balance is too far in favour of law enforcement and ignores the real patterns of drug use. A recent Western Australian study reported that marijuana accounts for almost 75 per cent of drug charges and most people charged with drug offences under the Western Australian law are under the age of 25.</para><para>In fact, the biggest drug problems for young people are actually legal drugs, alcohol and tobacco. It is for people over the age of 18, of course, that they are legal drugs. In terms of informed consent about what people are 
 doing when they are using those particular drugs, there is a system in place with tobacco and alcohol. As legal drugs, they are sold in marked containers specifying the associated health risks, content and purity. That system applied to currently illegal drugs will be a step forward towards reducing death by overdose. I guess it is one of the paradoxes in the way that we treat different drugs according to who takes them.</para><para>Alcohol abuse is a serious problem in our community. It is estimated to cost Australians $5 billion a year. An estimated 13 per cent of Australians over the age of 13 years have been physically abused at least once by someone affected by alcohol. We do not want to criminalise alcohol addiction, perhaps better addressed with appropriate community services. However, I do note that particular crimes, drink driving and violent crimes, must attract serious penalties if we are to offset the prevailing mythology that alcohol is an appropriate legal drug.</para><para>In terms of smoking, Australian governments raise about $4.6 billion in tobacco taxes a year but spend less than a third of one per cent on smoking prevention programs. I guess in some respects, while our Prime Minister arms the borders to catch drug smugglers, quite appropriately, he might consider too the customs gates where large numbers of people openly display their drug of choice as they enter the country.</para><para>Between 1988 and 1996, heroin overdose deaths among 15- to 24-year-olds grew by about a third. In 1996, around 200 15- to 24-year-olds died due to heroin overdoses, which is approximately 6.5 per cent of all deaths among young people that year. There are a number of reasons to believe that there has been an increase in the number of heroin users in Australia; there has certainly been an increase in the demand for treatment. Yet the public debate around this issue seems to be stuck in the tiresome legal hoary chestnut of state-Commonwealth relations. Last year the Prime Minister scuttled a heroin trial in the ACT. This year, as you may be aware, Madam President, in your territory overdose deaths overtook road deaths.</para><para>The South Australian parliament in this past week has been debating a motion which could eventually lead to heroin trials in South Australia, my home state. Certainly that is the motion moved by the South Australian Democrat leader, Mike Elliott. As Jaap van der Haar, the Dutch expert who has been in town for the conference on drugs and young people, has said, it is clear that we should not speak of a heroin problem but of an addiction problem. However, in response to Mike Elliott's proposal, on Thursday the Minister for Health and Aged Care reaffirmed the government's firm opposition to heroin trials in Australia. I do note that there is perhaps in-principle support from at least one Premier, Jeff Kennett in Victoria, but he has added a caveat that no state or territory should have trials unless every state and territory is willing, which still seems to be a prime example of Commonwealth-state buck-passing.</para><para>I should note, in light of what was said by the previous speaker, that I find incredibly offensive Jeff Kennett's statement today that he believes the Democrats are the political whores. I state for the record that not only is that an offensive suggestion to all members of the Democrats but also it is perhaps particularly questionable given that we are a party with a majority female representation in this particular chamber and that we have a female leadership team. I urge that premier to reconsider such blatantly sexist and offensive remarks. Referring to Senator Watson's speech, when we use such terminology and abuse in public debate, no wonder we lower the esteem in which politicians are held in the eyes of the community.</para><para>I think heroin is a poison and a pain-killer. By and large, people have always been able to get their hands on drugs, so I do not think we can necessarily prevent supply. Especially in a country like ours, an island, it is very hard to arm all the borders, if you like. But I do believe that we have to try and work hard to reduce demand.</para><para>Marijuana is the most popular illegal drug in almost every advanced industrial society, but it is a drug particularly favoured by the youth population. More than a quarter of 14- to 19-year-olds have used marijuana in the 
 last year, one-third of 20-somethings but only 4 per cent—that is, one in 25—of 40- to 50-year-olds. I have seen marijuana cause apathy, paranoia, giggling and stony silence—and that is only among politicians when we talk about decriminalisation.</para><para>I do commend to the parliament the work being done by the Parliamentary Group for Drug Law Reform. The Democrats support the decriminalisation of  marijuana. There are a number of groups on record who support our policy, including the Law Council of Australia and the Australian Parliamentary Group for Drug Law Reform. Even the AMA are on record supporting drug reform. In my home state of South Australia in 1986, and in the ACT in 1992, we saw the relaxation of laws in relation to marijuana—in effect, decriminalisation for small amounts. It does not appear to have led to an increase in use compared with other states. So we really do need to examine other strategies.</para><para>We do not pretend that marijuana is a harmless substance. Anecdotal evidence suggests that marijuana being used today is a great deal more potent than that used 20 years ago, so one of the reasons we support decriminalisation is because we believe there are potential dangers with marijuana use. In a climate of fear and deception, where the issue of marijuana is swept under the table and where drug debate is taboo, the serious health issues are not been properly addressed. We can help young people avoid drug abuse. Criminalising them is not the way.
