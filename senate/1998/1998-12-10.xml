It is difficult to make that assessment at 9.43 a.m., but obviously managers and whips can discuss this at a later stage.

 on-ground natural resource management. It does so also in a way that is "user friendly", with predictable, transparent, and timely assessment processes.

But it is certainly a possibility that there will need to be a change of membership for certain committees because a number of matters have not quite been finalised in relation to committees' programs and references. There are also one or two issues that are still being dealt with by the House of Representatives. I would hope that, if that is the case, by leave of the Senate we can return to that and deal with those as a matter formally without delaying the Senate unduly. But I think it is proper that I do signal to the Senate that there might be a necessity to do that before the Senate adjourns at the end of the session.</para></talk.start></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Publications Committee</title><page.no>1625</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report</title><page.no>1625</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>1625</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Chee, Sen Bill</name><name role="display">Senator O'CHEE</name><name.id>EU4</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On behalf of Senator Sandy Macdonald, I present the first report of the Standing Committee on Publications.</para></talk.start><para>Ordered that the report be adopted.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Joint Committees</title><page.no>1625</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Membership</title><page.no>1625</page.no></subdebateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—I have received a message from the House of Representatives acquainting the Senate with the appointments to joint committees.

As a result of votes in the Senate yesterday, there is going to be no real scrutiny of the content of the <inline ref="r646">Regional Forest Agreements Bill 1998</inline>  and the ramifications there are for this nation. I will not go over that ground except to say that this is the opportunity for the Labor Party to at least see that there is some scrutiny of the impact of a bill which is aimed to essentially take away the power of the federal or, for that matter, state governments to intervene on what the 
 woodchip corporations have been doing in our forests for 20 years.</para></talk.start></continue><para>We heard yesterday from Senator Murphy that there is gross mismanagement in the forests of Tasmania. To summarise, the woodchip corporations are using Forestry Tasmania as an instrument to rapidly as possible cut down the grand forests of Tasmania and export them for profit, which does not stay in Tasmania but is exported to shareholders of corporations like North Pty Ltd outside the state.</para><para>The small operators in Tasmania lose out. Senator Murphy sited the Cue River sawmill, which has been operating for 100 years, which is now closing at a time when the forests of Tasmania are being cut at the greatest rate in history. When the Green-ALP accord came to an end, because Labor broke its accord commitment, particularly section 9, by lifting the ceiling on woodchip exports in 1991, the rate was 2.7 million tonnes per annum. That is the limit to which woodchip exports had been capped for 10 years. The current rate is 4.6 million tonnes per annum. It is devastating the forests of Tasmania.</para><para>There is an added component, which is very important for the Senate to know, if it does not know already—that is, there is job shedding as the carnage of the forest increases. So in the period between 1991 and now, where the forests have been cut at something like double the rate, there has been job shedding because of automation and glomeration. Big corporations are sending 90 per cent of Tasmania's forests to the woodchip mills and, ultimately, the rubbish dumps of the northern hemisphere, while the small mills continue to close. This is gross mismanagement.</para><para>There is a case to be put for there being corruption in the forest industries of Tasmania. There is a prima facie need for an independent inquiry in Tasmania, if not in the other states. We have seen the uproar in Western Australia in recent days. There is a need, I believe, for a royal commission into the way in which this great resource in Tasmania is being exploited at a loss for Tasmanians. As you will know, Mr Acting Deputy President Watson, the people of Tasmania are getting something like $12 a tonne for the 
 forests; freight on board for the woodchip company, $120 a tonne; when it comes out of the paper mills of Japan, $1,200 a tonne. This is an extraordinary set of figures showing just what an extraordinary loss of value occurs, as far as these forests are concerned, under the mismanagement of serial Labor and Liberal governments in Tasmania and Forestry Tasmania, which is nothing other than an instrument, a handmaiden, of the big woodchip corporations.</para><para>If we look at the job side of it—and the woodchip corporations always weep crocodile tears and say that they are there to defend jobs—we will see that, while some 2,500 jobs were shed in the logging of native forests in Tasmania, 3,500 jobs were created in the service, hospitality and tourism industries thanks to the native forests left standing. Whereas logging is shedding jobs as they cut faster, tourism is putting on extra jobs, even though the forests are dwindling. It is absurd.</para><para>It is irresponsible that this process should be cemented in place—a process which allows the forest to be destroyed by job-shedding, out-of-state industries for 20 years under this legislation and which we, in the Senate, will not send to be scrutinised by the proper committees before we vote on it. I want the Labor Party, if it is going to oppose this, particularly the Tasmanian Labor senators, to get to their feet and explain why they don't want this scrutiny, because they have become part of the problem if that is the way they are going to vote.</para><para>Senator Faulkner has just said to one of his colleagues that they are part of the problem if they do not support this bill going to these committees.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">FAULKNER </name><name role="display">Senator Faulkner</name></talker><para>—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order.

 these committees? Why should there not be scrutiny? Why should the public not have an opportunity to have input before the Senate deliberates on this legislation? I will tell you what I think. I think it is because of the sway of the woodchip corporations. I am very aware of the fact that, for example, North Broken Hill in the last couple of years has put $80,000 into the election baskets of both of the major parties. That is having an untoward effect on the way in which this whole debate is proceeding. You cannot look at matters like this important move to refer the RFA legislation to committees being blocked by the major parties without standing back and asking why.

To say that there is some conspiracy and that senators are being manipulated or bribed to stop reference of these matters not only is patently absurd and contrary to the facts but also reflects on the motives of senators and how they vote in this chamber.

But in relation to the ruling you have made, I think that has adequately been dealt with, and we ought to just get on with it.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—Senator Brown, continue your remarks.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>QD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name></talker><para>—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I must say that the short debate that has just occurred is a very important one, and it is one that I will be coming back to in the future in this place. I was saying that I believe it is very important for the Labor Party—and the same applies to the government—to explain why, if they are going to vote against these motions, we ought not be seeing reference of this extraordinarily important regional forest agreement legislation to these committees so that the public can have the input that I know it wants to have. I think that the Senate is failing that public if it does not allow those committees to go to the places where there is turmoil over the destruction of forests in this country—and that does not just apply to conservationists; that applies to many businesses around this country of ours and many people employed in businesses which depend on forests being kept standing—so that they can have a say.</para></talk.start></continue><para>It is right out of kilter that this legislation will not be subject to far greater scrutiny than what yesterday's motion would on the face of it allow it to have. If these motions go down, I will be one of those who will be trying to bring up constitutional and environmental issues before the committee under yesterday's reference. But it will depend on that committee. As things stand, there could be a total block on such matters being discussed. I do 
 not think it is good enough to leave it to a committee to be good-hearted enough to decide it will accept evidence about the environmental downsides or the potential constitutional problems associated with the regional forest agreement legislation.</para><para>There is something untoward if the Senate does not send this legislation to these committees. I cannot say much more than that. Let those who vote against these references explain why they are going to do that, not only in this place but to the Australian public at large, remembering that opinion polls over the last decade have consistently shown that the great majority of Australians do not want the wild forests of this country further destroyed and they do want the plantation base which we have in this country, which is totally adequate for the country's wood needs, to be the total basis upon which woodchipping as well as other logging pursuits take place in the years ahead.</para><para>There can be a win-win situation. We can keep our wild forests and at the same time have a healthy industry based on plantations. Many people in here will not know that already 80 per cent of the wood products used in Australia come from plantations. There is the wherewithal to make that 100 per cent. The Tumut mill, announced with federal government support in the last week, is an example of that. I do not know why on earth Premier Carr in New South Wales was not, as part of the announcement there, saying, `We are putting an end to the cutting of wild forests in New South Wales.' It was a historic opportunity to say to the public, `Here we have got the end of wild forest cutting, the end of controversy and a mill based totally on plantations,' which is the way of the future. It was a political failure on a grand scale by the Carr government, which is the sort of political failure happening at the state level right around the country as far as forests are concerned.</para><para>That is another good reason why the whole thing should have been opened to much greater public scrutiny. The Senate, ultimately, is not doing itself a good turn if it does not allow that public scrutiny, because I can assure you that this legislation for the regional 
 forest agreements—which is a prescription for wild forest destruction around the country—is going to be a major item for debate when it comes before this chamber some time in the new year.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>1630</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I will briefly put the government's point of view on the reference of the provisions of the <inline ref="r646">Regional Forest Agreements Bill 1998</inline>  to two committees.

We supported a motion yesterday to have this very bill referred to the appropriate legislation committee—the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee—which I understand is chaired very well by Senator Crane, who I think is respected by all sides of the chamber.</para></talk.start><para>I am quite confident that any of the constitutional and environmental matters that Senator Brown has referred to and any submissions made on those matters will be given due consideration; that people making submissions on these matters will be heard by that committee; and that members of the public who want to make submissions or be heard by the committee from now until 15 February, a period in excess of two months, will be heard by this committee—the appropriate committee, an effective committee, a well-chaired committee and a committee on which a number of honourable senators who have given good service to this place sit.</para><para>I think it reflects on the committee, the committee secretariat and the members of that committee to suggest that that committee will not be able do its job. It has certainly done its job on a number of contentious, complex pieces of legislation during the term of the last parliament. I have absolute confidence that the members from various parties on that committee will fulfil their duties to the parliament and the people of Australia in giving proper consideration to, as Senator Brown calls it and the government concurs, this very important piece of legislation, which does seek to create a win-win situation for Australia's forests from a conservation point 
 of view, a biodiversity point of view and a resource security point of view.</para><para>The committee will receive submissions. It will have public hearings. It will have, in effect, over two months to receive those submissions and deliberate on these matters and make a report to this parliament. It will, hopefully, then be a matter for this Senate to deal with when we return in the second half of February. So the coalition will be rejecting these motions.

We, first of all, support the bill being considered by the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee. That is the appropriate committee that should consider the legislation, and that is indeed what will happen.</para></talk.start><para>We do, however, want to make the point, as we did yesterday when the matter was debated, that the ultimate reporting date that was determined by the Senate, by the brutal use of numbers by the government, of 15 February does cause us some concern. There may well be two months between now and then, but everyone knows that it is not that easy to organise public hearings and conduct inspections, if necessary, over the December-January period.</para><para>We also know that work is being done by many other senators in other committees early next year, particularly those related to the GST. We raised that point yesterday. As I understand it, that was why we put forward the suggestion in the Selection of Bills Committee deliberations that the reporting date would more appropriately be a date in late March—22 March was the date we proposed. I understand that, at the time, the government was prepared to accept 8 March as a suitable 
 reporting date but, as there was no agreement within the committee, it was understood that the issue would be ultimately resolved in this chamber.</para><para>We were rather surprised and believe it was pretty dirty pool on the part of the government yesterday to have pushed through, by the use of numbers, the date of 15 February as the  reporting date. But that is an issue with regard to the ultimate reporting date of a reference which is already before the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee. The committee will do everything it can to meet that timetable but, as we know does happen from time to time, if timetables become impossible to meet then it is open for the Senate to revisit that issue on a subsequent occasion. We will be pushing that view strongly in the committee in the hope that we can get more time for consideration of this legislation.</para><para>Putting that aside, on the central issue of Senator Brown's propositions, we reject them. We reject the allegation that we will not be serious about giving this legislation the scrutiny that it deserves and taking into account all the submissions that the committee receives. The bill is already before the appropriate Senate committee and, on that basis, we will be opposing the motions.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>1631</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise in support of Senator Brown's notices of motion Nos 2 and 3 and I will speak briefly, aware that there is business of the Senate people wish to go on with.

Of course, the mechanisms available within the states are the ones that are part of this intrinsic agreement which is coming together to be dealt with in this bill.</para><para>The irony in Western Australia is that Mr Tuckey said that economic consequences should be dealt with as well as environmental consequences. I actually happen to agree. I have always believed that the definition of `environment' should include the impact on the local economy. Having sat in on one unit of environmental law, it seems it was the intention—even if it was not written into the law—that the impacts on the environment, especially the local environment, and the impacts on the local economy should be assessed in the environmental impact assessment.</para><para>But what does that mean? It means that you look at the economy as a whole and not just on one narrow sector. Once you start looking at the economy as a whole—how it works, what fits in and what does not—often you find there are quite different circumstances from what you assumed in the first place. Honourable senators will remember that the Resource Assessment Commission was set up to do just that. It was set up, I suppose, to beat environmentalists around the head on the basis of doing assessments to see what the outcomes would be for communities and for the wider public interest.</para><para>Ironically they did their job too well. They did their job so well that they produced reports which looked at the balance between the environment and the economy and came out with different results from what was assumed. They asked people what they valued in certain areas like Kakadu. If you were to have a Resource Assessment Commission assessment of the Jabiluka proposal, most of us are quite sure of what people would say when asked what their values would be—what they would be prepared to pay not to have Jabiluka mined for uranium. There would probably be a few people throwing in cash from other parts of the world as well, if you were to do that. But that is not what the Resource Assessment Commission did.</para><para>Minister Tuckey says that we have it wrong, but he has not looked at the history of his own state. Unfortunately, we have a situation where there is an agreement between both of the major parties in this chamber that we will deal with this as a rural and regional issue—not deal with it as an environmental issue and not look at the legal issues in context. I will be very pleased if the rural and regional committee is able to look at the legal issues, if they can do it properly. But there is very limited time available, and we cannot be sure that the resources will be made available to that one committee even to be able to hold the hearings that may be necessary for the level of interest there is in this issue right around the country.</para><para>I am disappointed to hear what I have heard today. The numbers are quite clear in what is going to happen. But we have evidence that the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator Hill, is sitting on his hands in relation to action on regional forest agreements already, even before some of them are signed. We can see that even the mechanisms that are available to the Commonwealth now are not being used. We also know that, after this bill is passed, there is no specific action that can or will take place that will guarantee that any agreements must be abided by. So it looks as though we will have a much worse situation than we have experienced up to now, and that is a great disappointment. These issues deserve to be given greater scrutiny. They are being passed over and shoved under the carpet. I am very concerned that this is the process we have come to. I support Senator Brown's motions.</para><para>Question resolved in the negative.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1998</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>1632</page.no><id.no>r640</id.no><cognate><cognateinfo><title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>r639</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate><cognate><cognateinfo><title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT (PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE) BILL 1998</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>r638</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>1632</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 8 December, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Minchin</inline>:</para><para>That the bills be now read a second time.</para><para>upon which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lees</inline>  had moved by way of an amendment:</para><para>Omit all words after "That", substitute:</para><para>"the Senate:</para><para>(a)	 notes the evidence provided to the Community Affairs Legislation Committee that the rebate scheme will not take the pressure off public hospitals and is an inefficient and inequitable use of public funds;</para><para>(b)	 resolves that the bill not be read a second time; and</para><para>(c)	 calls on the Government to:</para><para>	 (i)	 introduce a means test to restrict eligibility for the rebate to hospital insurance for people on low incomes;</para><para>	 (ii)	 implement a review process to evaluate the rebate scheme against defined outcome measures;</para><para>	 (iii)	 require health insurance funds to achieve improved performance outcomes; and</para><para>	 (iv)	 address the key areas of need in the public health sector, including coordinated care for older Australians; waiting lists in public hospitals; public dental health services; rural health services; and the health care needs of indigenous Australians."</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>1632</page.no><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name><name.id>SF4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—These private health insurance bills are of central importance to the way that we run Australian society. Much has been said already about these bills and about the wisdom or otherwise of devoting over $1 million to private health insurance. In talking about these bills and about health services overall, there are certain questions that should be asked, certain prospects that should be discussed and certain perspectives that should be looked at. Those things have been done in debates so far.</para></talk.start><para>This debate is essentially about who should bear the cost of illness and injury in Australia. Once somebody becomes ill or injured, there is a cost. The issue is who will bear the cost. It might be the person who is injured or the person who becomes sick. That person might bear the cost simply by having to suffer for a longer time than otherwise. He or she may 
 have an illness which, if not treated, might be terminal or, at the very least, put people through considerable distress. Society could choose to say that the person who is going to bear the cost of this illness and trauma is the person who suffers it. He or she either bears it by simply going through the pain, distress and torture that illness and trauma can bring or by paying for treatment out of his or her own pocket. That is one alternative that we might take.</para><para>The doctors might bear the cost. In other words, you might have a health system where the doctors get less than they really ought. Indeed, that happens now, particularly with junior doctors in hospitals, who are paid at times less than they should be paid and who have to work overtime that is sometimes not paid. That is the other alternative; the doctors might bear the cost that comes about through illness or injury. Nurses might do it by working for longer hours than they should. Physiotherapists or dietitians or what have you also might. That is another choice that we could make. We could let the health providers bear the cost.</para><para>The hospitals might do it. The private hospitals in particular and the public hospitals are saying that they cannot afford to give the treatment that is needed to people who are injured or who suffer illnesses. The community might bear the cost through insurance schemes. In other words, you spread the cost across the community by having insurance schemes. The function of the insurance schemes is to gather money from the community generally and spread the loss that comes about through illness and injury. Everybody puts in, irrespective of whether they are ill or injured themselves, so that the community, as it were, bears the cost. The community could also bear the cost through taxation, either generally across the board or through specific imposts such as, for example, the Medicare levy.</para><para>They are the choices we face. This legislation must be looked at in that context. It should be looked at not only in the context of who should bear the cost of illness and trauma but also in terms of where the money might come from. That means not only in 
 terms of insurance and taxation but also from other bodies. One thing that seems not to have been looked at in this context is how specialist insurance, if I can call it that, operates in all this. How much, for example, does the Transport Accident Commission in my home state of Victoria contribute to the cost? How much does the Victorian Workcover Authority contribute?</para><para>In looking at this legislation and in listening to the debate about it, that sort of question seems not to have been answered. I wonder why not. What contribution do bodies such as the Victorian Workcover Authority and the Transport Accident Commission make to the costs imposed upon people through injury and illness? There are bodies like them in all the states around Australia. What sort of contribution do they make? That question could be asked in the committee stage of this debate.</para><para>What does occur to people as they go through this debate is that the whole system seems not to be in control. There are institutions that cover people injured at work. There are institutions that cover people injured on the roads. There is private health insurance and private insurance, in any event. There are public and private hospitals. There are people who are underpaid. There are people who suffer and who cannot get proper treatment.</para><para>Those concepts do not seem to be addressed in the bill. What seems to be happening is that we are going to say, `Righto! We will contribute over $1 billion towards helping the private insurance industry.' And no doubt it is argued that, through helping the private insurance industry, a flow-down effect will occur and people will be better looked after. But it seems to me that in this debate that particular approach has been taken without having a wider vision of what it is all about. The explanatory memorandum seems to have ignored the concept of how we can best help health services across the board. It says on page 1, in the `General Outline and Financial Impact' statement:</para><para>The Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 1998 will provide for a financial incentive for people who take out or maintain private health insurance.</para><para>It then tells how the incentive works. On page 56 of the explanatory memorandum, the 
 section headed `Assessment of impact (cost and benefits) of the measures' talks about the particular people who will be affected and the particular funds which will be protected.</para><para>But there is no concept put forward in the explanatory memorandum of what we should be doing in the whole area of health, which is really about trying to get people better after they have become ill or have suffered trauma. It is a bad approach in a policy sense to confine the issue of how we get people better to one particular area. Say that somebody is injured on the road or at work, or gets sick in any particular circumstance. Where does he or she go to get money? To some sort of accident compensation scheme, if they are injured at work? To a fund that is supposed to look after people who are injured on the road? To a private insurance scheme, if they are injured in the home? Do they go straight to a public hospital? Or do they go to the local doctor? Unless we get a concept of what this is all about, we are in trouble.</para><para>There is one other matter I want to raise while we are talking about this, and I hope I have made the point clear. Legislation dealing with issues of health services should have the care of the sick and the maimed as its prime objective. It is not quite clear what weight the legislation before us gives to the sick and the maimed, as distinct from trying to prop up a system of private health insurance. I have read from the explanatory memorandum as an illustration of what I mean by that.</para><para>It does seem that the propping up of private health insurance is the prime objective here, rather than the care of the sick and the maimed. The legislation is an answer to a wrong question; namely, how private insurance can be subsidised. The right question should be who should bear the burden of sickness and injury. You can look at society as either a collection of individuals or a community where every member can benefit to the utmost. The legislation here sees society as a collection of individuals who have each got to get what they can out of the system. Unless we start thinking in a communal way, we will not get a solution to the issues that are raised by those who are sick and injured in our community.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>1634</page.no><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name><name.id>656</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The issue before us today is a choice between playing politics or good health policy. Good health policy demands that the government devote adequate resources to the public health system. It also requires that we endeavour to strike the appropriate balance between the public hospital system, Medicare and the private health insurance industry. The government seems hell-bent on diverting substantial sums of taxpayer funds from the public health system, from public hospitals, from the states—who have the responsibility for managing those hospitals—ultimately into subsidising private health insurance funds.</para></talk.start><para>It has been a disturbing trend of coalition conservative governments over many years that, in their ideological objection to Medicare, they have followed this path. It must be remembered that it was a Labor government back in the 1970s that introduced Medicare—then known as Medibank. It was Malcolm Fraser, when he was Prime Minister and John Howard was his Treasurer, who abolished Medibank. Whilst the government stands up and talks about the levels of private health insurance membership today and how they may have fallen, what they do not say is that, when they were in office between 1975 and 1983, they left 30 per cent of the Australian population totally uninsured. There was no universal health coverage system. There was no Medibank, because they abolished it. So many hundreds of thousands and, indeed, millions of Australians had no health cover at all.</para><para>It was only when the Hawke government came into power in 1983 and Medicare was introduced that once again we had a universal health coverage system, a system whereby all Australians could have access to decent, quality health care, particularly when they most desperately needed it, when illness or accident suddenly struck. It is in those circumstances that you need a decent, high quality, affordable, accessible public health system. Australia today stands, and has done for many years since the introduction of Medicare, as a world leader in providing the best of public health coverage.</para><para>This government, however, in its short 2½ years stripped some $2.6 billion out of funds available for the health system in this country. It took around $800 million out of public hospital funding in its first budget by slashing funds to the states—and the states were forced to find the money to make up that shortfall. It abolished the dental scheme, a scheme worth around $400 million which provided urgent dental care for persons who were unable to afford it. It took an incredible $1.4 billion out of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, making many necessary drugs and treatments far more expensive.</para><para>On top of that, they introduced the health incentive scheme, a scheme, they said, designed to encourage people back into private health insurance. They claimed that it would increase the rate that was declining. In reality, private health insurance membership did not increase at all—despite the $1.6 billion or approximately $650 million a year that was earmarked to be provided for that incentive scheme—but fell even further to its now lowest level ever of just over 30 per cent. That scheme was a failure, which was acknowledged by everybody, whether a Labor supporter or a conservative Premier. Indeed, many experts in the health industry recognise that it was a failure.</para><para>When the last round of Medicare agreements were being negotiated, what were the states unanimously calling for? Whether they were conservative or Labor governments, they were calling for greater funds to be directed into the public health system because needs were not being met through increasing waiting lists as a result of this federal government's failure to provide adequate funds.</para><para>This current proposal would provide a 30 per cent rebate with no means test to persons with private health insurance. So those people who have had to drop out of private health insurance because they were unable to afford the ever increasing premiums or were unable to afford the huge gaps that exist between the level charged by doctors and the amount refunded through private health insurance will suffer even further. This is a scheme which will reward all of those people who can afford 
 to have private health insurance. The high income earners, and many of us in this parliament who are in private health insurance and who have stayed in it, will be rewarded whilst those who cannot afford it will not be in any greater position in terms of being able to access private health insurance. There is no means test and, furthermore, there is no discrimination at all between the types of coverage for which the rebate will be paid.</para><para>Coalition ministers such as Senator Herron have talked about how they believe the previous scheme reached a position where health insurance membership had plateaued and was on the increase. That is what we were constantly being told by Senator Herron, representing the Minister for Health and Aged Care in this chamber. Yet, at the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee's hearing on 4 December, the evidence of Mr Schneider, representing the Australian Health Insurance Association, was that it was declining and was continuing to decline irrespective of the government's measures.</para><para>So one has to ask the logical question: why should throwing more money at this system work? Of course the answer is that it will not. Until we are able to address the fundamental problem of private health insurance in this country—that is, the issue of the gap—these sorts of schemes will simply not work. Whilst it might be very attractive and it might be seen as good politics to pay substantial amounts of money by way of a rebate to the 30-odd per cent of people who have private health insurance, it is certainly not good health policy.</para><para>Everyone knows that the major problem with private health insurance is that you pay your $2,000-odd a year for your family cover and you get your doctor of choice but, after you have had elective surgery in a private hospital, you often find that, whilst your hospital costs may have been met, your medical costs have not been met because the surgeon has charged well in excess of the schedule fee. The private health companies pay a refund of only 25 per cent of the schedule fee. Further, they do not cover the gap between the doctors' fees and the schedule fee. It should be remembered that private 
 hospitals have the benefit of the fact that, for all the medical procedures that are undertaken in private hospitals, 75 per cent of the schedule fee—that is, the costs of the surgeon, the anaesthetist or whomever—are met out of Medicare, they are met out of public funds. So we are already providing substantial support to private hospitals.</para><para>I just want to finish on two other points. Everyone knows that, whilst we do need, and we on this side support, a strong private hospital system that complements the public hospital system, first and foremost the objective of government is to support the public health system. I hear time and time again of situations where after people have gone into a private hospital for an operation, something serious has developed following that procedure and they have been very quickly transferred, in some cases just across the road, to the public hospital.</para><para>It is a fact that many private hospitals do not provide all of the facilities that can be obtained in a public hospital, whether they be crash carts or the sorts of intensive care units that patients in a critical condition may need. Essentially, we are providing huge amounts of money to support private hospitals, profit making enterprises, dealing largely in providing elective surgery at the expense of much needed funds that should be in the public hospital system.</para><para>The final point I wish to make is this: I obtained some information about where in New South Wales private hospitals are located. It is very interesting to note that, of the 85 private hospital licensed establishments in New South Wales, 23 are in the northern Sydney area, eight are in the central Sydney area and 15 are in the south-eastern Sydney area. That is, over 50 per cent of private hospitals in New South Wales are located in areas which are in northern, eastern or central Sydney.</para><para>It is no wonder that people in rural and regional areas, in western Sydney where they only have five private hospitals, in south-western Sydney, or in the far west where there are none, according to this table, are screaming out, saying that they want decent hospital systems in their regions rather than 
 huge amounts of funds being diverted into private hospitals which ultimately will be accessed more by the higher income earners of this country than by the general public.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>1636</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thought I might begin my contribution on the second reading debate on this legislation by quoting from the 1998 platform of the Australian Labor Party, which says this:</para></talk.start><para>Labor remains resolutely committed to universal access to publicly funded health services through Medicare. Labor will work to ensure that health resources are allocated on the basis of need and people are not excluded from necessary services because of their economic circumstances.</para><para>Labor is committed to maintaining the effective integrity of Medicare as a system of universal health insurance that will finance the delivery of high quality, medical and public hospital services to all Australians.</para><para>These are the principles that the Labor Party will honour and will uphold, as we deal with this legislation; they will guide the approach of the Labor Party on this matter that is currently being dealt with by the Senate. Our Labor Party platform, in regard to the private sector, also says this:</para><para>Labor recognises the role of the private health sector and remains committed to a balanced health system making best use of both public and private sectors.</para><para>The private sector must operate under appropriate government regulation. In particular, Labor remains committed to a private health insurance system which does not discriminate on the basis of age, sex or health.</para><para>The critical point of this is balance: we want a balanced health system that makes the best use of both the private and the public health sectors. This legislation before the parliament now is unfair: it does not provide balance, and it certainly, I have to say, is not good policy.</para><para>We think that the best way to boost hospital funding and reduce hospital waiting times for surgery is to directly fund public hospitals. The public hospital system is our priority because that is where the greatest need exists. We believe that spending money directly on treating patients is the most effective way of 
 reducing waiting lists. We encourage people, of course, who wish to take out private health insurance. But we know that for many people in Australia, people on low incomes particularly, the public health system is the only option they have.</para><para>The hundreds of millions of dollars that are being thrown at this rebate in this legislation would go a very long way to improving the public hospital system—and that would be of benefit to all Australians. The rebate being proposed by the government is inherently unfair. It does not provide balance, nor will it achieve its desired objective of increasing the take-up of private health insurance, and therefore reduce pressure on the public health system—and that is very strongly backed up by the National Centre for Epidemiology and Population Health, which I thought put forward some strong and persuasive arguments against the legislation at the Senate committee hearing last Friday. Just look at what it actually said to the Senate committee. It summarised its position as follows:</para><para>First, that it will not fix the problem it seeks to fix, it will probably make the problem worse and it is highly unlikely to do anything to improve the quality of health care available to the Australian people;</para><para>second, that the huge proposed transfer payment would be more efficiently and equitably used in other ways;</para><para>third, that the problem that has led the government to this point should now be the stimulus for real reform of private health insurance, making it supplementary to, not a competitor with, the publicly funded health care system.</para><para>There is no evidence that the private health insurance rebate will take the pressure off public hospitals. If you take the example of the government's existing means tested rebate—which, of course, the proposal before us is supposed to replace—you find that it has not increased the number of people taking up private health insurance. The new rebate will benefit primarily people who have existing private health insurance.</para><para>The government's estimate for increasing the number of people with private health insurance is a mere 2.7 per cent. That is the government's figure—a mere 2.7 per cent increase; up from 30.3 per cent to 33 per cent. 
 That is a 2.7 per cent increase at the cost of $1½ billion. That is what the government is proposing, and we say that it is simply not good enough. Minister Wooldridge, I noticed, boasted an increase to 40 per cent in his second reading speech in the House of Representatives. A private hospital survey has claimed that the rebate would result in a boost to coverage to 45 per cent. Again, you have to ask this question: where is the evidence to back up those sorts of claims?</para><para>I mentioned the evidence of the National Centre for Epidemiology and Population Health given to the Senate committee. I think they presented a very worthwhile and impressive submission to the Senate inquiry. On the question before us, they said:</para><para>. . . this is a clumsy and predictably ineffective way to achieve what the government wants to achieve. This approach would lock the government into an inflexible $7 billion spending program which would not produce the desired offsets in the public sector . . . this subsidy is likely to exacerbate the problem for the private funds of adverse selection and differential risk dropouts, without addressing the underlying problem.</para><para>We say that the government is throwing good money after bad. It is sticking a whopping $1.5 billion into the private health system—money, of course, that is desperately needed in the public health system in public hospitals; money that could really make a difference in the public health system. It is directing this enormous amount of money exclusively to private health insurance owners, and we say that is patently and transparently unfair. It will benefit most those who need it least. It will benefit most high income households, most of whom already have private health insurance. How obviously unfair.</para><para>In May of this year the Australian Bureau of Statistics produced a private health insurance survey which demonstrated a direct correlation between income and private health insurance. It showed that of those earning less than $20,000, 22 per cent have private health insurance; of those earning between $50,000 and $60,000, 60 per cent have private health insurance; and, of those earning over $70,000, 72 per cent have private health insurance. Most low income families in Australia cannot 
 afford private health insurance. They simply cannot afford it, and that is the case with—</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Opposition senators interjecting</inline>—</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name></talker><para>—Exactly, Senator West and Senator Denman. They cannot afford it with or without a rebate. That is the truth of this issue. That is why we say the priority here must rest with the public health system—and that is Labor's priority—because it is the system that most Australians rely on. That is the fundamental principle that guides the Labor Party in its approach on this legislation.</para></talk.start></continue><para>But I do not want to suggest for one minute that the unfairness stops there. Pressure on public hospitals will not be relieved by extending the rebate to all ancillary services. There is no justification at all for doing that. Take the example of what I think is the great injustice on dental health. While abolishing the Commonwealth dental health scheme, which was, as I recall, worth $100 million—a scheme that provided dental health care and treatment to pensioners and low income people—those with private insurance are going to get a 30 per cent rebate on their dental premiums. That is the government's approach. Nearly $200 million of the rebate will go to subsidising private dental treatment. On the other hand, the low income people in our community wait at least a couple of years for treatment.</para><para>We now have, as I say, this open-and-shut case of the unfairness of the legislation that is now before the parliament, but we also have the spectacle of the government trying to turn debate on this legislation into just another typically tawdry Liberal Party political stunt. As far as the government is concerned: forget about the health system and the health issues—the debate really is not about that. There is an election on the horizon in the state of New South Wales. That is an election, of course, that the coalition obviously desperately wants to win. So the debate no longer is about the policy issues, and I am sure that in particular my colleague from New South Wales, Senator West, has noted this. The debate is not about the policy but it is about the politics—the politics of the New South Wales election in March of next year.</para><para>I just want to mention this as I conclude my remarks on this bill. John Howard is now less focused on the January 1999 start-up date for this rebate than he is focused upon realising political advantage in forcing the Senate to reject an unaltered or unamended and unnegotiated piece of legislation which the vast majority of commentators and experts agree is bad policy. Mr Howard, the Prime Minister, is perfectly happy to risk his January 1999 start-up—risk it all—for a bit of politics to play in the New South Wales election in March of next year. Of course, he has his pollsters like the discredited Mark Textor. They have, apparently, predicted significant political advantage to the New South Wales Liberal Party in forcing the Senate into some game of brinkmanship on this legislation. We are told that it would suit the New South Wales Liberal Party if the Senate does not pass the legislation in time for a January 1999 start-up so they can reintroduce this legislation in three months time.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>1X4</name.id><name role="metadata">WEST</name><name role="display">Senator West</name></talker><para>—Anything to take the focus away from their leadership problems.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name></talker><para>—That's true, Senator West. But also, of course, three months time is right on the eve of the New South Wales election. I am glad you raised the issue, Senator West, of the Liberal Party leadership in New South Wales because you have a situation, which has been demonstrated so clearly during the debate on this legislation, where the Prime Minister is far more interested in matters relating to the internal dynamics of the New South Wales Liberal Party than he is in what ought to be his responsibility—the health of Australian families. What he is on about is the health of his stumbling protege in New South Wales, Ms Kerry Chikarovski, and Mr Howard's and Ms Chikarovski's cronies in the New South Wales Liberal Party.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I draw the Senate's attention to last week's article in the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> by Mr Laurie Oakes, who reported that before John Howard committed his government to the 30 per cent rebate on private health insurance premiums he had the concept market tested. The results, as reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline>, were unequivocal 
 in regard to its popularity. According to—and I use this term advisedly—the `researcher', the only proposal he had ever found to be more popular was the reintroduction of the death penalty.</para><para>This policy, this legislation, that we are debating has been poll driven from its conception. I put all my money on who did the research. You can bet your life it was Mark Textor, that grubby, unprincipled push pollster for the Liberal Party. No doubt as has been reported, his most recent polling is inextricably linked to both Ms Chikarovski's leadership coup and the politics of the 30 per cent tax bribe for upper income earners. I assume polling was uppermost in Dr Wooldridge's mind when he threatened on the weekend to bring the legislation back to the Senate for a vote a week before the New South Wales election if it did not pass unamended this week.</para><para>I will be very interested in the Liberals' approach during the committee stage of this debate. I will be very interested to see whether Dr Wooldridge will be delivering on that threat that he made on the weekend or whether it was just a bit of breastbeating and empty rhetoric, as we have come to expect from people like Dr Wooldridge, or whether the Liberals will contemplate no amendment at all to this legislation—whether they happen to consider that that's in their political interest.

I have some insurance that enables me to receive doctor of choice treatment in a public hospital, but I am beginning to wonder about the value and benefit of private health insurance, like so many other people in this country. Let me give an example of why I feel this way. I had my gall bladder removed during the break recently. The doctor's bill was pretty much on par with what I got back from Medicare and Medibank Private, but the anaesthetist's bill took the cake. For two hours of being trundled into the theatre on a trolley and being trundled out of the complex to the ward on a trolley, I scored a bill from the anaesthetist for $500. I had to write a cheque for $223.75, which was the gap.</para></talk.start><para>The gap is not a problem for people on my income, which is around $100,000 a year. The Prime Minister, in answering questions on why this proposal is so wonderful, talked 
 about how people are scrimping and saving to be able to purchase health insurance. They need to do a hell of a lot more scrimping and saving if they are going to cover this gap. This proposal is bad policy. It does nothing to address many of the fundamental problems and issues that need to be addressed in the provision of health care. There is nothing in this proposal that will rein in the activity of some doctors. I say `some doctors' because I can give you an example of my surgeon's bill which was quite close to the mark. Probably the only reason it is not closer to the mark is that I am having a disagreement with the HIC over a small amount of money, in the region of $9 to $10.</para><para>A former neighbour of mine several years ago who had maximum private health insurance and maximum ancillaries—the whole box and dice—had cataracts removed. She wrote cheques for $3,000. She had to have both eyes done, so all in all she ended up writing cheques for $6,000. We are not talking figures that are within the ballpark of being able to be afforded by the average, ordinary person. We are talking figures that can be afforded only by the 70-odd per cent of people earning more than $70,000-odd a year who have private health insurance.</para><para>This is legislation aimed at greed and not need. This is not good policy. Senator Faulkner has pointed out a number of things that have driven this. I want to look at how this will impact upon rural areas. We know from the submissions to the inquiry last week that the Western Australian government raised a concern that there are only two private hospitals outside the metropolitan area in Western Australia. What incentives are there? Why do people in Western Australia outside of Perth require private health insurance? Their only opportunity for health treatment is in the public system.</para><para>If you have an accident or you have a major illness, where are you going to end up? You are going to end up going through casualty or emergency into the public health system. For anybody who disagrees with that, let me remind them, as I have done on many occasions, that my background is nursing. I am a member of the two colleges of nursing 
 in this country. I do not speak in this case on their behalf, but I do speak as somebody who has a background in nursing. I am older than most of the advisers in the box. I can tell them that this has been the case for the last 30-odd years that I know of.</para><para>I can remember working in a public hospital, in a teaching hospital in Sydney, 25 years ago and having somebody who was earning a six-figure sum a year admitted to our ward because he had thrown off a pulmonary embolus from a deep venus thrombosis. He was admitted to a teaching hospital in the middle of the public ward. It was the Royal Prince Alfred that he was admitted to. He eventually moved to the private section in Gloucester House. But for time immemorial that sort of level of acuity has always ended up, and should continue to end up, in our public hospital system because for the most part that is where the best treatment is available.</para><para>I find this piece of legislation obscene. It find it obscene that somebody like me on an income of $100,000 a year is offered a 30 per cent rebate to encourage me to take out private health insurance which I already have. I find it obscene that included in that 30 per cent rebate are ancillaries such as dental. If this legislation is passed, I think it is an obscenity that $200 to $300 million will be spent to give people who have some form of income, and who are on the whole wealthier, access to dental care through ancillaries and to not give that money to lower income people through the state system. It is an injustice.</para><para>We will very shortly, if this legislation is passed, not need to ask a person anything about their income, their occupation or their status. We will be able to line them up behind those boards you see at fairgrounds with a hole for the face and ask them to smile. Because it will be quite apparent who has and who has not got money. If you do not have money, you will have holes in your teeth. If you do have money and you have private health insurance, you will have a perfect smile. That to me is an obscenity.</para><para>I also want to talk about some of the other issues that this legislation does not address. 
 The issues of waiting lists are not addressed. Occupancy in the private health system is very high, as well as in the public health system. This does not address the shortages of doctors in various places and the shortages of specialists. This does not address the fact that a number of colleges that allow access for specialist training have, I would allege, almost monopolistic and cartel-type activities in keeping their numbers restricted. This government is all for competition, but it is not looking at the behaviour of some of those colleges and their restriction of competition. Maybe Professor Fels should look at them and not some of the other areas. It does nothing to address those issues.</para><para>This legislation does nothing to address the shortages of occupational therapists, speech therapists, dietitians, physiotherapists and social workers in rural areas of Australia. It does nothing to address the problems and the shortages of mental health services in rural Australia. This will not help bring one more of these professional people to the bush and maybe even to the outer areas of some of the capital cities, particularly Sydney. This legislation does nothing to address these fundamental problems that we have to address in health.</para><para>This is legislation which, as I said, is an obscene and unjust piece of legislation which gives those of us on my income a bit more money and does not give a service that I consider to be an absolute basic service essential to life and human dignity. It does not give that. This is the most unchristian piece of legislation I think I have seen come into this place in some considerable time. This is about giving to the haves and not sharing with the have-nots, and I find it an obscenity. I find it an obscenity that people can get a rebate to buy a pair of Reeboks or running shoes. That sort of business will not help the public health levels in this country and will not do anything to reduce people's usage of the public health system.</para><para>The money could far better spent in many, many other ways. This, as I said before, is bad policy. It is bad legislation. It has been put forward by a government which is being poll driven and thinking only of political 
 advantage and not the advantage, the benefit and the wellbeing of this country. For that, the government should be roundly condemned.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>1641</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak in this debate briefly today, firstly, to indicate that my family has private health insurance. I suspect that, as a result of that, I am not paying the additional one per cent Medicare levy as one who falls in the higher income levels that attract the levy. I will be opposing this inequitable legislation which proposes to grant me a significant tax concession whilst I am exempt from paying this additional Medicare levy. This legislation will give a person on the income level of a senator, member of parliament or the many higher income earners in the community a significant advantage over the bulk of the constituents of my state of Tasmania, more than 80 per cent of whom have a family income of less than $50,000. I believe that the recent census information distributed by the Parliamentary Library this year points that out very clearly from my examination of the figures.</para></talk.start><para>This legislation will give someone like me a significant financial advantage. I do not propose to canvass figures because I think they have been most eloquently dealt with by my colleagues earlier in the debate. It will give a very small benefit, if any benefit at all, to the bulk of the constituents of my state, and certainly I am talking about those who hold private health insurance. The many thousands of families who do not hold family health insurance, who cannot afford family health insurance or who believe that family health insurance is not attractive because, even if you have the insurance, you still get significant bills—and we have just heard about that from Senator West—are all going to be significantly disadvantaged by this legislation.</para><para>I also oppose this bill because ultimately it threatens the future of the public hospital system in my state. It means that those hospitals will not be receiving the funding in the future that they need to provide the services that everyone—all Tasmanians, whether insured or not—may ultimately rely upon, 
 particularly in relation to critical care issues or complex medical procedure issues which are not provided by the private health system.</para><para>After talking to constituents during the last election campaign who are holders of private health insurance, particularly independent retirees who saw some benefit in this government policy, I was heartened that, when they were confronted by the approach of the Labor Party—that is, we support seeing the public health system funded so that the kind of care that particularly elderly Tasmanians may need in terms of deterioration of health issues and medical procedure issues is provided in preference to rewarding only those who have private health insurance—I received an indication that the representatives of the independent retirees found that to be quite a valid concern and one which they thought very worthy of consideration.</para><para>I am curious about a comment I received from a coalition senator about this legislation. It is an aspect that I had not considered until the point was made to me. The point was that, because members, senators and other higher income earners are paying a higher Medicare levy by virtue of the levy being a percentage of income, the private health insurance rebate was in fact a way of getting back part of that higher Medicare levy that the higher income earners are paying when compared, for example, with the combined effect of paying the Medicare levy and private health insurance between people on lower and higher incomes.</para><para>I found that comment curious at first. Ultimately, I guess it fits in with the Labor Party's view of where the coalition is coming from in relation to this legislation: this is yet another way of undermining the Medicare system. The Medicare system, whatever the government has been saying about it, exists to provide universal medical services for the community, whether insured or not. Labor has always supported a parallel system. If the ultimate effect of this legislation is to undermine the funding of the public health system to bolster the funding of the private health system, then I do not think constituents of my state will see that as anything other than an anathema to their interests.</para><para>At the end of the day, people in Tasmania, if they have major problems, rely on the public hospital system. I am sure that is not just the case in Tasmania but all over Australia. People rely upon the public health system, particularly for critical care, as I said earlier. If the funding of the public health system is sacrificed in the interest of funding private health insurance, which will ultimately, I suspect, bolster the private health system to the detriment of the public health system, then that is against the interests of all of my constituents.</para><para>To the extent that there have been newspaper advertisements and lobbying in my state, I say to the people who placed those advertisements that they should look not at the issue of self-interest but at the interests of the health system for the whole of the population of Tasmania when this matter is considered. I remind my constituents and the Senate that the Labor Party is doing just that in saying that we oppose this legislation as inequitable and a threat to the public health system Australia wide.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>1642</page.no><name role="metadata">McKiernan, Sen James</name><name role="display">Senator McKIERNAN</name><name.id>1I4</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Senate is discussing the <inline ref="r640">Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 1998</inline>  and associated bills.

This bill is not about health care. This bill is blatant politicking on behalf of a government that does not care.</para></talk.start><para>This bill will do nothing to resolve the problem that was headlined in the Perth <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Times</inline> on 29 November this year, just a couple of weeks ago: `97 die awaiting surgery'. Ninety-seven people died awaiting surgery. The $1.7 billion that the government will hand out to people who do not need it, like me on the salary that I have, would be better served going to alleviate the difficulties of Western Australians and their relatives who cannot get hospital treatment. But, no. Mr 
 Howard and Mr Wooldridge are seeking to put money in my pocket. I am on $100,000 a year. I have private health insurance. I do not need an incentive in the form of a tax rebate to remain in health insurance. I have the money to afford it.</para><para>Why are you doing this? Mr Howard, why are you spending $900 million in giving tax rebates to people earning more than $70,000 a year? This is absolutely stupid legislation, particularly so when you get headlines such as: `97 die awaiting surgery'. It is even worse when you get a headline such as the one that appeared on the front page of the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> newspaper on Friday, 27 November 1998: `Health funds reap $300m fee bonanza'. We are going to put more publicly funded money in their direction. What has gone wrong?</para><para>There is obviously a major difficulty in the Prime Minister's office, the cabinet office and in the government party room if they continue to proceed with this bill and not either send it back for a rethink or accept some amendments on the floor at the committee stage. I understand that your party, Mr Acting Deputy President Watson, is not going to negotiate on that. This is absolutely criminal activity on behalf of the government—propping up health funds which actually need a great deal of scrutiny as to how they operate.</para><para>Who said they need scrutiny? The Private Health Insurance Ombudsman's annual report, tabled very recently in this place, said they need scrutiny. Complaints against the private health insurers are up by 60 per cent on the previous year. One can understand that when you see the full-page advertisements that appear in the media. I quote from the <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline> newspaper of Saturday, 28 November:</para><para>An open letter to Members of Federal Parliament</para><para>This is from one Michael Gurry, Managing Director of HBF, Hospital Benefits Fund of Western Australia. Mr Gurry addresses me and my colleagues saying:</para><para>Members of Federal Parliament</para><para>I write on behalf of the 1,056,310 electors and their families in Western Australia who have private health insurance to ask why some of you refuse to allow them a 30% refund . . . 
</para><para>Who gave Mr Gurry the authority to put that letter in on behalf of me and my family as members of a private health fund? Neither he, his organisation nor the individual fund which I am a member of consulted me about putting a letter like that in. Mr Gurry went further, though, he wrote direct letters to members of parliament. He sent a letter by way of fax to me—and, I guess, to my other parliamentary colleagues—on 26 November 1998. He said:</para><para>Dear Senator McKiernan</para><para>I am writing on behalf of the 830,000 members of the Hospital Benefit Fund of Western Australia to express their concern at the attacks the Labor Party is making on private health insurance.</para><para>I read the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>  from the other place, and I did not see any attacks on private health insurance. Perhaps the reason my comments are toned the way they are is because I am replying directly to Mr Gurry about what he did in putting forward that letter to me. I wrote back to him on the same day asking him to confirm the membership. I quote from my letter:</para><para>Your fax says 830,000 members, but the annual report of the Private Health Insurance Administration Council suggests you have a total membership (hospital and ancillary) of 392,489 at June 1998.</para><para>I asked him which was the true figure. A week later, Mr Gurry responded by saying:</para><para>I confirm HBF does have 830,000 individual members. HBF classifies all individuals covered by HBF as members.</para><para>The babies, the infirm—everybody is supposed to be a member according to him. The letter goes on:</para><para>The figures referred to in the PHIAC report for June 1998 are for Health Insurance policies not coverage.</para><para>For your information HBF has 788,000 Health members and 42,000 General Insurance members.</para><para>Mr Gurry is putting forward absolute lies, without the authority of his members, to me as a member of parliament. He asked for a copy of this speech, and I will ensure that he gets it. I hope that in the fullness of time the Department of Health and Aged Care or the Private Health Ombudsman will do something to bring some respectability into the way in which some of the health insurance funds operate. There are many that would appear to 
 be lining their own pockets at the expense of those insured.</para><para>Earlier this year, I, like many others in the community, following the last round of increases, gave very real consideration to whether or not I would remain as a member of my fund. As I said in my earlier comments, I can afford to be in it. On the salary that I earn, I can afford to retain coverage. The reason I considered dropping out was the ever increasing cost of the insurance. This particular bill that is before us now—giving away something like $1.7 billion of taxpayers' money—does nothing to address those ever increasing premiums that I and other members of health funds have to pay.</para><para>The bill does nothing—as previous speakers have said—to address the biggest problem associated with private health insurance, and that is the gap. It does absolutely nothing to address the gap difficulties. Senator West, giving the most recent of the excellent contributions from this side of the chamber, outlined some of the finer details on that and, rather than use the time of the chamber now, I refer people to Senator West's and Senator Faulkner's excellent recent contributions on this. There were other contributions as well.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Senator Forshaw interjecting</inline>—</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>1I4</name.id><name role="metadata">McKiernan, Sen James</name><name role="display">Senator McKIERNAN</name></talker><para>—And Senator Forshaw also made some comments, as I recall. The gap is the major problem associated with the health insurance industry in Australia today, yet we have the government coming into this place presenting legislation which does nothing to address it.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The final thing I want to talk about in the limited time that I have imposed on myself—and that we, on this side of the chamber, have imposed in order to progress the legislation—is the letters that I have received from my constituents in Western Australia. I am quite pleased to receive letters such as those. I am very disappointed to receive letters from doctors, specialists and professors which are rote letters, probably drafted in a public relations office in the Hospital Benefit Fund. I expect a little bit better from professional people than that. The Hospital Benefit Fund have been the main leaders of the campaign 
 in Western Australia, and that is a bit disappointing. All of the individuals who have written to me have got a response. Some of them have asked for copies of my speech and, indeed, those who have asked will get a copy of it. I am very disappointed, as I said, that learned and highly educated people should just take form letters and send them on. The campaign just has not had an effect. They have wasted their time and their energy in sending these letters through.</para><para>It is a crying disgrace that the funds have used the elderly in our society. I have got great sympathy for those who are on pensions who do continue to hold health insurance, who do—as they said in their letters—go without meals in order to keep up their payments because it is something they have always done. The funds have got to be condemned for using people in the way they have used those in Western Australia.</para><para>I would hope, whether this bill passes or does not pass, or whether it passes in an amended form, that the funds themselves sit back and have a look at their own conduct in this whole thing. The way they have managed themselves in order to line their own pockets, in order to get an increase in membership for private hospital cover of a mere 2.7 per cent—from 30.3 per cent to 33 per cent coverage—is not to their credit. It is appalling what they have done. One would hope that they will learn something from this whole escapade. Perhaps next year, when the parliament has more time to look at them in detail, there might not be the damning reports from the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman that we have seen this year.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tambling</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>AUSTRALIAN RADIATION PROTECTION AND NUCLEAR SAFETY BILL 1998</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>1645</page.no><id.no>r614</id.no><cognate><cognateinfo><title>AUSTRALIAN RADIATION PROTECTION AND NUCLEAR SAFETY (LICENCE CHARGES) BILL 1998</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>r615</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate></debateinfo></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>AUSTRALIAN RADIATION PROTECTION AND NUCLEAR SAFETY (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 1998</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>1645</page.no><id.no>r613</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>In Committee</title><page.no>1645</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>AUSTRALIAN RADIATION PROTECTION AND NUCLEAR SAFETY BILL 1998</para><para>Consideration resumed from 9 December.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN (Senator McKiernan)</name></talker><para>—The committee is considering the <inline ref="r614">Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Bill 1998</inline>  and an amendment moved on behalf of the opposition by Senator Forshaw.

 storage facility called for in the Senate select committee report. Indeed, we are certainly prepared to support Senator Margetts's amendment. We believe it ensures that the act will not authorise the construction of any larger facility, having in mind, for instance, one which could deal with imported waste and reprocessing to the enrichment stage. That is really what there has been some public discussion about in recent days.</para></talk.start><para>The ultimate situation is that, whilst the definition of `nuclear installation' includes a nuclear waste storage or disposal facility, the regulations will limit the operation of any such facility. Clearly, if clause 9A(1)(e) is carried, the act would not authorise the construction of such a facility beyond what is set in the regulations. I hope that is clear.

As always with clauses such as these which appear in legislation from time to time, the problem from our perspective is the lack of definition and the consequent broad powers which are then given to the Chief of the Defence Force and the Director-General of Security.</para></talk.start><para>The additional problem is one of perception, particularly international perception. As everyone knows, in foreign affairs, perception counts for a great deal. When those perceptions are intertwined with the often shadowy world of nuclear weapons, then there is cause for concern. As I stated in my speech in the second reading debate, many defence and security analysts acknowledge that the best method for developing nuclear weapons capability is through civilian nuclear technology. This is a great flaw. The great lie that underlies the international nuclear non-prolif 
 eration framework is the belief that you can prevent nuclear weapons proliferation if non-weapon states are provided with assistance to develop so-called peaceful nuclear technology.</para><para>This is especially so in the current world situation with proliferation, re-proliferation and disarmament, and Australia's standing in that debate. I believe we have got to be seen to be not just with the rest of the world but a good example to the rest of the world—and a leading example. I guess Australia could do that by taking a very positive role in the middle powers initiative. But, unfortunately, we are not.</para><para>In this particular instance we are using the powers that are available under the ASIO Act. I believe—perhaps the government can tell me if I am wrong—that it potentially enables ASIO operatives to be exposed to levels of radiation to which they normally would not be, perhaps for spying or whatever. Can the government clarify whether that is the case or whether we potentially have a situation where there is a great deal more power under this act to the Chief of the Defence Force and the Director-General of Security? Can the government tell us what assurances there are that that will not or cannot be misused beyond anything which the public would believe is normally given under this legislation?</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:25:00</time.stamp><page.no>1647</page.no><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name><name.id>656</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I indicate on behalf of the opposition that we are not prepared to support the position put by Senator Margetts on this matter.

As my colleague Senator Cook outlined in his speech in the second reading debate, this bill has unanimous support from all sides of the chamber. It is a real problem in the world which many people probably do not focus on enough. The problem was outlined in a speech by my colleague Mr Brereton last year, and Senator Cook referred to some of the statistics from the International Red Cross outlined by Mr Brereton in that speech, and it is worth traversing those again.</para></talk.start><para>There are an estimated 119 million active landmines in 70 countries. It therefore becomes an issue of mammoth proportions indeed. The report also said that some 15 countries are, in effect, crippled as a result of 
 the placing of landmines. It is interesting to note some of the places that are listed as being crippled: Afghanistan, Angola, Bosnia, Cambodia, Mozambique and Somalia. This is not because of external forces fighting each other but because of internal war, civil war, in many instances. One finds that, once the civil war has been resolved, the mines that were laid are invariably left lying around the place. The effect of that is that they injure, maim and kill innocent people long after the hostility, the internal insurrection, has ceased.</para><para>The International Red Cross report, as my colleague Senator Cook indicated, states that landmines kill or maim some 2,000 people every month. The figures broken down are 800 killed and 1,200 maimed every month. That, again, is something of mammoth proportions and is completely and totally unnecessary. The International Red Cross report went on to say—and this was as of last year—that, if mine clearing were to proceed and no more mines were to be laid, it would take 1,100 years to clear the entire world of mines laid during civil or other wars that have occurred. That really puts into perspective the problem that is confronting many people in many nations. It is not a small problem; it is a problem of great magnitude.</para><para>Antipersonnel landmines are an indiscriminate killer, as I said earlier. Long after peace has been brokered within many of the countries where civil war has occurred, the people who laid the mines have invariably gone onto other pursuits. Of course the minefields were laid without any markings and in peacetime they become an indiscriminate killer, particularly of the young and the old and of women and children. That, in itself, should be completely avoided at all costs. People who had no direct input into the violence, people who invariably had no part to play in the warring that took place, are being injured long after the settlement of the melee. In many instances, as the statistics have shown, death occurs quite wantonly for these people.</para><para>The fact that there are so many landmines out there causes real poverty in some of these nations—nations which really cannot afford to be subjected to additional poverty, because poverty is one of the factors those nations 
 inherit as a result of the protracted and prolonged wars having taken place in them. The existence of vast minefields stops appropriate resettlement within these nations, stops many of their people from being able to return to agriculture to till the land because mines are in the arable land. And all that does is impose further poverty. It also acts as an obstacle to the transportation of people and goods within some of these countries, and it has an effect on the provision of basic services. All in all, one sees in many cases not a very pretty picture being painted as a result of the laying and indiscriminate use of landmines in conflicts that have long been resolved—and, of course, they have wreaked havoc on very innocent populations in postwar periods.</para><para>I found it of interest to read a publication dated May 1997 called <inline font-style="italic">Living in a minefield—a report on the mine problem in Afghanistan</inline>, which was put out by—pardon my French—Medecins Sans Frontieres.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>BE4</name.id><name role="metadata">NEWMAN</name><name role="display">Senator Newman</name></talker><para>—Good; eight out of 10.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>7L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Hogg, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HOGG</name></talker><para>—It was quite good? I got an eight out of 10 for French there, and I thank the honourable senator for that mark. But that was not the point. The point was not to prove my French but to look at just a couple of excerpts from this publication. I believe that we really have no experience nor real understanding of the problems caused by landmines and, therefore, it becomes a bit of an academic exercise for us. But I find it interesting that outlined on page 12 of the publication are the problems caused by landmines. It states:</para></talk.start></continue><para>There are three common patterns of anti-personnel mine injury: one is amputation of the foot or leg from standing on the blast mine; the second is multiple fragment injuries from triggering a fragmentation mine where the legs are injured and often so too are the head, neck, chest and abdomen; and, three, hand, arm, face and eye injuries from handling a mine.</para><para>What we see are injuries that are not at all pretty, injuries that take a lot of treatment and injuries that, in many cases, absolutely ruin the dignity of the individual living in these communities. This brings with it problems in terms of treatment, problems in terms of rehabilitation and problems in terms of ongoing support. It places a strain on the economy, 
 on the family and on the community. Without being emotional about the issue, one sees landmines really as being a blight on our society and an issue being appropriately addressed by this legislation and measures that are being taken by the government through our expenditure going towards the elimination of mines in different parts of the world.</para><para>Part of the real problem in this is the finding of the mines; that costs time and money as well. Of course, in many instances, the minefields have not been marked and have not been mapped. So it is not simply a matter of once the war is over the nation returning to normalcy; what one finds is that there is still much work to be done in finding the mines, marking the areas, mapping them and then, of course, clearing the areas. This further disrupts the lives, the lifestyles and the chance of a livelihood of those people within those nations.</para><para>Part of the problem is educating the locals and making them aware of the problem. This in itself can have its own problems in that many of these people are unable to read or write and, therefore, are not necessarily able to understand signage. Even if signage is placed there, with many of these people being so poor, there is evidence that it is removed to assist them to make basic shelter and homes. As I have said, the Australian government is to spend $100 million by the year 2005, and this is very commendable.</para><para>As I realise this is non-controversial legislation, the last thing I will do is read from a World Vision document, which highlights the problem in Cambodia. I quote:</para><para>Between six and 10 million landmines that were laid in Cambodia during or after the 25-year war are yet to be removed. One of every 236 Cambodians has lost an arm or a leg to a mine.</para><para>I repeat: one in every 236 people. It is something of enormous proportions and it shows the lack of dignity that these people must experience in the injury being inflicted and in the harm that has been caused to them by the landmines that were placed in Cambodia over a long period of time.</para><para>We are a nation free from this. In this nation we do not have this problem, we do 
 not experience it and, therefore, probably do not understand the disaster it causes at the family and social levels within these communities. The article goes on:</para><para>Landmines are currently the single greatest causes of poverty in these districts—</para><para>this is in Cambodia—</para><para>not only because of the deaths and the injuries but also because of the large areas of precious farming land that cannot be used due to the mines that lie hidden there. Mines are preventing needy families and communities from re-establishing decent livelihoods and futures.</para><para>The fact remains that, whatever one's view of war might be, landmines should be banned. They should be kept out of the realms of war. We as a nation should seek to assist others in clearing lands that are peppered with these indiscriminate killers. The fundamental thing that we can achieve by helping these people out is to return to them the most precious commodity that we can give them, and that is their dignity as human beings—their dignity as persons. I commend the legislation and I hope it gets the speedy passage it deserves.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>1650</page.no><name role="metadata">Calvert, Sen Paul</name><name role="display">Senator CALVERT</name><name.id>5F4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On behalf of Senator Bourne, I seek leave to incorporate in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>  a speech on the <inline ref="r603">Anti-Personnel Mines Convention Bill 1998</inline> .</para></talk.start><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The speech read as follows</inline>—</para><para>The Anti Personnel Mines Convention Bill is one of the most important we have dealt with in this Senate.</para><para>The Democrats have a proud record in calling for a total ban on the use, production, transfer and stockpiling of landmines.

Two million more mines are laid every year.</para><para>Poor farming communities bear the greatest load from the deployment of landmines. The burden of injury and loss of income affects poorer women to the greatest extent.</para><para>The mindless carnage caused by landmines is an affront to the conscience of humankind. Growing public awareness of landmines and the devastation they cause are the best weapons against their continued use.</para><para>In recent years, landmines have attracted international coverage—they are now recognised as a global catastrophe. In 1994 the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution calling for the eventual elimination of landmines. This led to the Ottawa process and the Bill we have before us today.</para><para>This Bill is also important for a second reason. It sends a loud message about Australia's commitment to a total ban on landmines. For that, the Minister for Foreign Affairs should be congratulated. I know it cannot have been easy for the Minister to convince the rest of the Cabinet that this was the right thing to do, and it is very much to his credit that he was able to do so.</para><para>In ratifying the convention and introducing this legislation the Australian Government will encourage other governments in our region to take similar action.</para><para>The past 20 years have seen new types of warfare, often involving non-conventional combatants such as insurgents, partisans, terrorists and guerrillas. Regular armies fight against these groups and each other. All use landmines. Those mines will kill civilians. In far too many circumstances, mines are beyond military control. They have ongoing political, social and economic effects.</para><para>Those countries most affected by landmines tell the story—Afghanistan, Angola, Burma, Cambodia, Ethiopia, Iraq, Kenya, Pakistan, Rwanda, Somalia, Sudan, Vietnam and former Yugoslavia. The list goes on.</para><para>The effects are devastating and the practice is a blatant violation of international humanitarian law.</para><para>Anti-personnel mines are cheap and very easy to manufacture. According to the International Committee of the Red Cross, prices range from $3 to $15 per mine. They might be cheap, but the cost of dealing with their effects is appallingly expensive.</para><para>Hospital stays, physical and psychological rehabilitation services, are all expensive. Many of the most affected nations don't have the money or resources to provide these services. Artificial limbs are just too expensive for many. Children typically require 
 a new artificial limb every year. Then there are the costs of re-integrating victims into society, making them feel useful and able to feed their families.</para><para>De-mining is very expensive. Clearing mines, which in most cases must be done by hand, can cost as much as $1,000 per mine.</para><para>The Australian Defence Force has an excellent record in mine clearance and training. The Government recognised this with a pledge at the Ottawa signing to provide an extra $100 million to aid clearance work. We welcome this. However, we fear the money for mine clearance will be drawn from the aid budget rather than the defence budgets where it belongs.</para><para>The Democrats and the NGO community have always maintained that funds for mine clearance operations should come from the defence budget. The humanitarian aid budget is already dreadfully depleted.</para><para>We also believe the Minister could better use forums such as the ASEAN Regional Forum to achieve a total ban on anti-personnel mines in our own region, as recommended by the Treaties Committee in our landmine report.</para><para>The Minister should be actively encouraging our South-East Asian neighbours to sign the Ottawa convention. Australia has demonstrated leadership in this matter and we should not lose that momentum.</para><para>The Democrats are keen to know when and how Australia will destroy our own stockpile of these weapons.</para><para>We welcome the Minister's clarification of clause 7(iii), which we now understand will be applied in instances where an Australian Defence officer carries out one of the prohibited acts under clause 7(i) in the course of combined operations.</para><para>We are also pleased that Defence doctrinal and operational manuals will be amended to comply with the prohibitions contained in the Bill. We are sure these amendments will be made as soon as possible after this Bill becomes law.</para><para>In conclusion, I would like to say how pleased the Democrats are to see this Bill before the Senate. It is remarkable to think that we are moving towards an effective total ban on landmines.</para><para>Lastly, I would like to thank Sister Patricia Pak Poy, Australia's co-ordinator for the International Campaign to Ban Landmines, whose tireless campaigning and encyclopaedic knowledge on the subject of landmines have been absolutely central to Australia becoming a party to the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and their Destruction.

My first question in the Senate on the issue was about the Australian Defence Force use of mines and Australian compliance with the inhumane weapons convention back in February 1994. The part of the question to do with modification of weapons for use as booby traps wasn't answered at that time and the issue of grenades and other weapons being modified to work as defacto land mines is still a problem.</para><para>What was different then was the political climate on the issue. In June 1994, when I raised the landmines issue in the context of its effect on the world refugee problem it seemed to me I was very much on my own in this place. There was sympathy but no commitment to getting anything done about it.</para><para>Australia was being accused of providing Papua New Guinea with grenades which could be easily converted to mines for use in Bougainville—but the government continued to turn a blind eye.</para><para>Australia's role in this arms trade was a recurring theme of my speeches on the issue and several times I sought to draw the attention of the Senate to the hypocrisy and inconsistency of the Government over its failure to support a total ban campaign. They held to a position that mines were OK if they were mapped and if they went off by themselves or defused themselves after a certain time. I pointed out then that they couldn't be mapped if they were dropped from planes or fired from guns and didn't necessarily do what was expected of them anyway.</para><para>Then in 1995 there was the infamous Gareth Evens speech which I hope will continue to haunt him till his dying day in which he referred to my call for a total ban on landmines as "hopelessly utopian". He went on in that speech to use the chilling phrase "landmines perform a unique military function".</para><para>That is an expression that deserves to be rated alongside collateral damage and smart bombs!</para><para>Well Gareth, maybe now that you have time for reflection from your position in semi-retirement on the backbench, you'll realise that a utopian position 
 is not necessarily hopeless. If a few more people in high office were to take a utopian position we might actually get a few more achievements such as this Bill to ratify the Ottawa Treaty.</para><para>Over the years that I engaged in a war of attrition with then-Senator Evens, Senator Hill and others, the real battle to put an end to landmines was being fought by the non-government sector which was building up a world-wide constituency pressing governments to go further, to take on the total ban as an achievable aim.</para><para>In 1995 Australian Catholic Relief, Community Aid abroad, The Christian Centre for Social Action and many others affiliated with the Australian Council For Overseas Aid raised almost a quarter of a million signatures requesting the Government to push for a total ban on Landmines.</para><para>The turning point was the 1996 Ottawa Conference at which Australia pledged to work towards a having a ban treaty in place as soon as possible. It wasn't long before the Government were backtracking on that position, moving in to line behind the US which preferred the slower approach through the UN Conference on Disarmament. The CD approach was always going to be flawed as landmines got caught up in the complex trade-offs over nuclear weapons—and the commitment of the US was always in doubt anyway.</para><para>Fortunately the momentum for change was overwhelming. The groundswell of popular feeling could not be ignored. Disgust grew as people became aware of the indiscriminate nature of weapons which lay around for years, sometimes killing children, farmers, anyone in the wrong place at the wrong time. And the wrong place at the wrong time could be any place at any time—in fields, on paths, in forests.</para><para>Then gradually there was the realisation that—all the more horrible—that this killing of civilians was <inline font-weight="bold">not</inline>  always so indiscriminate. That sometimes it was the intentional outcome of the planting of mines. This was the case in many conflicts around the world.</para><para>This realisation, and the appearance of television coverage of the plight of victims, intensified the movement for a total, global, unconditional ban on landmines. It would never have come about if it hadn't been for the untiring efforts of people such as Sister Patricia Pak Poy and the International Campaign to Ban Landmines. I am please to see Sister Patricia was recognised for her efforts with an ANZAC peace prize earlier this year.</para><para>It is she and the others in the Non-Government sector who are to be thanked for making so much progress on an issue that seemed so intractable only a short while ago. 
</para><para>That brings us to the current situation—where what was once "hopelessly utopian" is now Government policy and soon will be Australian law.</para><para>The Bill to ratify The Convention On The Prohibition Of The Use, Stockpiling, Production, And Transfer Of Anti-Personnel Mines And Their Destruction is very welcome indeed.</para><para>While there have been some concerns raised about particular aspects of the Bill, particularly in respect of Section 7 (3), on the issue of Australian troops involved in operations with non-signatory states, I understand those concerns have been pretty much addressed in the Second Reading speech by the Minister. I certainly hope that loop-hole is well and truly closed.</para><para>The issue I wish to focus on is: Where to from here? What happens from now on in terms of action to get the mines out of the ground, to provide assistance to victims and to universalise the Treaty. It is important to know how all of this will be managed and monitored. In this regard I commend the current efforts in Ottawa to establish a Landmines Monitor, but we will also have to be vigilant in our monitoring of Australia's role.</para><para>The amount allocated by the Government for work on landmines—$100 million—is on the face of it a generous amount. But do we have guarantees that this is `new money'?  i.e. not coming out of existing aid budgets. Even with this allocation, there is room for Australia to make further allocations for clearance of mines from priority land, and for assistance to victims and survivors.</para><para>Universalisation</para><para>Ratification by Australia now puts us in a better position to seek to convince others in the region, and elsewhere (including the US), to come on board. Vietnam, Laos, Burma, Singapore and PNG are still not signatories. Neither are China, Korea, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Let's make this a high priority in our regional relations.</para><para>The focus needs to be on total ban. Let's not see our efforts fall back into reliance on the CD process. While the CD is obviously one forum, Government efforts here should not detract from the ban principle. We must continue efforts in UN forums especially the next Review of Protocol II in 2000-2001.</para><para>Mine Action</para><para>Key issues around mine action are the priorities—deciding where and how the remainder of the $100m gets spent.  The choices here need to be made in a strategic and transparent way, targeting getting the mines out of the ground, maximising local capacity in the countries affected and maximising Australian expertise in the area. In this context, countries in our region should receive priority attention. 
</para><para>Mine Action programs should develop local capacity in mines awareness, management and clearance—not rely on expensive expatriate expertise. In this regard we should capitalise on the potential for the ADF to play a positive role—as part of its training and awareness role—and its moral responsibility.</para><para>But there are other advantages to the Defence Forces in participation in de-mining and their efforts should be funded out of their budget, not from humanitarian/relief allocations whether on a cost recovery basis or any other.</para><para>The choice of where to de-mine should be based on proper data, and on practical and humanitarian principles which will maximise the capacity of local affected communities to return to productive and safe livelihoods.</para><para>Victim Assistance</para><para>Obviously there needs to be an ongoing commitment to assisting people who have been injured by mines. In an immediate sense, we need to continue with medical assistance etc. But also we need to focus on providing assistance to victims, and their families in developing safe and alternative livelihoods (where people can't farm their land because it is mined, or because they have lost limbs etc). Landmines are currently the single greatest cause of poverty in some parts of the world: not only because of the deaths and injuries, but also because large areas of precious farming land cannot be used due to the mines that lie hidden there.</para><para>It is most appropriate that this assistance be provided through the non-government sector as much as possible. It is the NGO's who have the experience on the ground and the confidence of local people and organisations and it is they who are best able to provide assistance.</para><para>Organisations such as Austcare, World Vision, Red Cross and others have well established programs which are deserving of greater government support.</para><para>Monitoring</para><para>We would not want to see the legislation as being the end of this process. Although it has been a good achievement, we should not let the feast of self-congratulation cloud the fact that what matters will be what Australia actually does to further the cause of the elimination of landmines. There are many aspects here: how Defence implements its side (including the destruction of the stockpile—and the importance of openness about progress towards destruction of the stockpile within 4 years), how DFAT approaches the task of universalising both the principle and the fact of the Treaty, how AusAID disburses funds (and against what criteria) and what other efforts the Government and civil society will need to make in scrutinising adherence in the manufacturing/transfers area. There is a role 
 for multipartisan scrutiny here—involving parliamentarians, bureaucrats and NGO's.</para><para>Research</para><para>There is also need for research and development of mine detection and clearance technology, but it needs to be stressed that this must not come from the aid budget or humanitarian funds.</para><para>Finally let us turn to the longer term priorities.</para><para>In July this year in Rome the international community created a statute for an International Criminal Court (ICC). The ICC will come into being once 60 States have ratified the treaty. Unfortunately anti-personnel landmines were not included in the list of prohibited weapons found in Article 8 dealing with war crimes. However there is an opportunity to amend the Statute pursuant to Article 121 and 123 in the future. If the use of landmines was deemed a war crime it would be an extremely powerful tool in the fight to stop these heinous weapons destroying more lives.</para><para>The first priority there is for Australia to ratify and then start the long term process of getting the use of landmines considered a war crime for which prosecution can be mounted in the International Court.</para><para>But maybe that is just me being `hopelessly utopian' again.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>1654</page.no><name role="metadata">West, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator WEST</name><name.id>1X4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to associate myself with the <inline ref="r603">Anti-Personnel Mines Convention Bill 1998</inline> . This is a very important issue to a lot of people, particularly those who live in developing countries or countries that have seen strife, unrest, fighting and war in the last few years. I think particularly of Cambodia. However, more recently we have had brought home to us the troubles experienced around Honduras and some other Latin American countries as a result of Hurricane Mitch—the worst hurricane ever—dislodging and moving a significant number of landmines to areas that had previously been clear.</para></talk.start><para>That is the thing about landmines: they are silent killers and silent maimers. Everyone in some of the rural villages and communities of developing countries—people on low incomes—needs to participate in the labouring work that has to be done in the fields. These instruments of war silently sit buried for any number of years—with some of the later devices and batteries that are operating in them, it could be a century—and, when least expected, they explode, usually maiming 
 rather than killing. This places a large burden on small rural villages because an active worker is removed from that community. If the victim happens to be a child, the effect would be to remove that child from whatever future he or she had. If the child was maimed, their only future would be to beg or be at home, dependent upon other members of the family and other members of the village. When the village is living not much above subsistence, these impacts are very great.</para><para>The impact of this was brought home to me when, on Anzac Day and the day after, I visited the French and Belgian battlefields of World War I. Tonnes and tonnes of unexploded ordnance are still being dug up 80-odd years after the cessation of those hostilities. When you think that, 80 years later, potentially lethal ordnance is still being found and dug up, you wonder how long it is going to take countries and the world at large to clear so many of the mined areas of Cambodia, Angola and parts of Latin America. The monumental size of that task really impacted upon me when I saw those battlefields of France. While they did not use landmines in those days that are as sophisticated as the ones that are used now, we certainly saw the impact and the devastation. We saw unexploded ordnance that had been dug up from the site of the memorial at Le Hamel. So it is a very important issue. The use these days of smaller and lighter weight components in the mines has made them even harder to detect and has made them more able, of course, to be moved around by floods.</para><para>I have a friend who is working in Cambodia for an offshoot of the World Council of Churches on community development work related to landmine victims. She has told me stories about travelling in the Cambodian countryside on roads and paths that have been cleared of mines. As Senator Hogg said, people do not read the signs, cannot read the signs or use the material on which the signs are displayed for other purposes. My friend said that she had seen families out ploughing fields that are marked with the signs that warn of landmines. She told me a story about one gentleman who had been partly maimed by a mine being helped by his child to plough a 
 field. The dangers for that family were very great but, obviously, the dangers of starvation, hunger or no income were also very great. So it very much affects those countries that are less fortunate than us.</para><para>I think it is appropriate that we pass this piece of legislation today, which is the day we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Human Rights. This legislation will help people who have been fighting to maintain their access to human rights. It is important that we pass this legislation so that we do not contribute to the proliferation or the continued use of landmines. This is one of the most important pieces of legislation to come before us. It deserves to be classed as non-contentious legislation and it deserves to get the support it is getting from everybody within the government and this parliament.</para><para>It is legislation that puts to rest the lie that all we ever do in this place is argue, fight and disagree. This is a classic example of a good piece of bipartisan legislation being passed, one which will benefit many people, I hope. It certainly signifies Australia's commitment to the rights of those people and to not having landmines in a position where they can callously maim, injure and wound people in the future.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>1655</page.no><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name><name.id>SF4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Earlier this year I was in Africa.

This bill will put in place the necessary domestic legislation for Australia's ratification of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Land Mines and on their Destruction, known as the Ottawa Convention.</para></talk.start><para>The Foreign Minister, Mr Downer, took particular pride in signing the Ottawa Convention on 3 December 1997, the day it was open for signature. I know that for a fact because I saw him very soon after he signed it when he visited Ottawa and then came on to New York to meet with Penny Wensley, the Australian Ambassador to the UN in New York.</para><para>I was equally pleased to deliver a statement on the floor of the General Assembly of the United Nations shortly thereafter. Just after Minister Downer signed the convention I was able to give a statement in which I outlined 
 Australia's commitment to a lasting, effective and comprehensive solution to the global landmines problem, including through enhanced international efforts in the fields of de-mining and victim assistance. I was able to highlight some of the things that have been said around the chamber here today about Australia's role in that, about some of the technology that has been developed in Australia for de-mining, about the role the armed forces and the Federal Police have played and also about the pride we have in what Australia has been able to achieve in de-mining. I also mentioned around the traps some of the partnerships that were going on between community organisations in supporting people adopting fields and de-mining them.</para><para>So we have a good record. We have a commitment. I also take great pride in having taught some students in prosthetics and orthotics who have contributed to some of the developments in the technology, simplifying the development of prostheses for people who have been affected by landmines. So across the board we have set an example in signing the convention. With this bill we are ahead of the pack compared with some countries. We have a record in contributing to de-mining through technology, through personnel and through assisting people who have been injured. We all have the right to be proud of that but we should never sit back and rest on our laurels. It ought to be noted that this bill has been passed with very strong support on all sides of the chamber. That is not always the case with bills. I have much pleasure in acknowledging that.

The bill seeks to overcome the problems created for the government by the decision of Justice Spender in the Federal Court in Foster v. Attorney-General on 12 October this year. In that decision, His Honour held that the process adopted by the government in purporting to allow portfolio ministers to authorise junior ministers and parliamentary secretaries to act on their behalf was unlawful. In essence, the Federal Court found that there were flaws in the delegation process. A further flaw in the process was that the authorisation was made directly by the portfolio minister and not through the Administrative Arrangements Order or by the cabinet or the Prime Minister.</para></talk.start><para>Justice Spender's decision has a potentially wide impact. It affects the validity of all government decisions made pursuant to authorisations which were made in accordance with the Prime Minister's code of conduct since April 1996 and it affects delegations and decisions made by either junior ministers or parliamentary secretaries on behalf of a portfolio minister by or under, for instance, the following areas: the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975 pertaining to foreign investments; some 21 acts pertaining to the Department of Health and Aged Care, including the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989; the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987 and 17 matters taken by Australia on behalf of foreign countries; and the Crimes Act 1914 and a whole range of matters pertaining to parole, early release and revocation of parole.</para><para>It is important to note that Justice Spender's decision affects only those decisions made under a provision that vests statutory responsibility in a specifically named minister. In other words, if a minister, the Treasurer or the A-G is mentioned specifically in legislation, then under the Prime Minister's code of ministerial conduct and delegations of April 1996, quite a range of decisions taken over the last 2½ years under the four acts that I 
 mentioned, in particular, are probably now unsustainable at law.</para><para>The problem identified in the Foster decision would have been avoided if the government had acted pursuant to section 19BA(1) of the act and sought to regularise the arrangements reached between the relevant portfolio ministers and their junior ministers and parliamentary secretaries through the issuing of amended admin arrangements. Basically, what we have here is the Prime Minister going outside the law and endorsing somewhat sloppy administrative arrangements for his government. As a consequence, in a critical case just a few weeks ago in the Federal Court of Australia, Justice Spender found that such delegations were ultra vires.</para><para>Since that date, the Attorney-General has had the job of cleaning up the Prime Minister's mess. He has acted, I must say, with appropriate alacrity. This legislation is a sign of that. It must be put on the record as well that the Commonwealth is appealing the decision, and I gather the appeal was heard last Thursday. This legislation is necessary and it is urgent. It is for that reason that the opposition is assisting in the passage of it.</para><para>The bill, however, does go further than is required. What we have here is a bill which is retrospective in nature. Retrospectivity is always a concern but more so in respect of oral delegations. This government allowed, under the Prime Minister's arrangements, for oral referral of responsibility from a minister to a parliamentary secretary or a junior minister. Oral delegations have a number of problems in terms of ministerial responsibility and in terms of people being able to access their rights against government. Oral delegations are enormously difficult to ensure auditing of and administrative review thereof. The government has removed the ability to make an oral authorisation in future, but this legislation seeks to authorise past oral authorisations. We have some concerns about that, and they were expressed in the House of Representatives by the shadow Attorney-General, Rob McClelland.</para><para>Our second concern is the ability of a minister to job share even where parliament has prescribed that a particular minister needs 
 to act. The A-G, for instance, has special skills and experience. We would not want him delegating some of his responsibilities to the primary industries minister, for instance.</para><para>In terms of our second concern, this bill goes much further than the previous custom and practice. What we are seeking to do by way of our amendment is to allow authorisation by a minister to a junior minister or a parliamentary secretary within a particular portfolio, but not jump over the portfolio fences and delegate outside one's portfolio responsibility. That should not be a concept which would appeal to the Senate, though I anticipate that the Democrats are still thinking seriously about whether to support such an amendment.</para><para>This legislation seeks to redress the administrative problems arising from Justice Spender's decision, but we should also keep in mind that the process we are going through here may very well be a futile one, because Justice Spender in his judgment questioned whether anything short of a formal Administrative Arrangements Order signed by the Attorney-General in this case would be valid. His analysis was based on the concept of the separation of powers, and it is worth putting on the public record the comments he made on this point. In his judgment, Justice Spender said that the intention of the relevant section of the Acts Interpretation Act was to:</para><para>. . . provide a mechanism by which illness or absence from Australia or leave or other emergency could be met so as to permit the continued orderly administration of the enactments of the Parliament of the Commonwealth.</para><para>So we say that it is appropriate for delegation to occur in that situation. Justice Spender went on to say:</para><para>Consistent with the notion of responsible government is the requirement that Ministers of State, appointed by the Governor-General, administer Departments of State, and the cases reflect a "<inline font-style="italic">longstanding practice</inline> " that the Prime Minister might appoint a Minister to act, for the time being, for or on behalf of another Minister.</para><para>Again, we are content to support legislation which will confirm, entrench or specifically authorise that acknowledged practice. Justice Spender then proceeded with his analysis of 
 the separation of powers under the Westminster system. He said:</para><para>There is much to be said . . . that it is for the Governor-General on advice to appoint officers to administer such departments of State as are established, and . . . it is not even for the Prime Minister to determine who should be appointed to administer such departments.</para><para>So he went specifically to a discussion on the separation of powers and the role of the Governor-General under our Westminster system. He indicated that, basically, the approach that we are taking here may ultimately be found to be ill founded. This bill may turn out to be futile because it may breach the separation of powers concept. In the meantime, it is appropriate that the government should proceed to try to clean up this particular problem, and this legislation does that to the extent that we, at this stage, are assured of the constitutional parameters within which we are working.</para><para>I indicate that the opposition have one amendment, and it is an amendment I flagged earlier. It basically will ensure that delegations would occur within a portfolio rather than stretching over portfolios, and we will move that at the appropriate time. I also repeat that this legislation is substantially supported by the opposition.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>1658</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="r632">Acts Interpretation Amendment Bill 1998</inline>  sets out amendments to the Acts Interpretation Act and deals with the implications, as Senator Bolkus has pointed out, of the recent Federal Court decision in Foster v. Attorney-General. The government says that this decision has serious consequences for government administration. The Australian Democrats agree with that and we are happy to discuss this important issue which we believe goes to the very heart of how government in Australia functions.</para></talk.start><para>The Foster case itself has been the vehicle for this change and, in particular, the decision of Justice Spender, as Senator Bolkus has pointed out, makes this debate now necessary. I would like to briefly discuss the details of the Foster case and then move to the contents of the bill. The United Kingdom have request 
 ed that Peter Foster be extradited on a number of fraud related charges. He was arrested last year in Australia and granted bail. He challenged the Attorney-General's decision unsuccessfully and, after a number of appearances in court, failed to attend a listed hearing on 1 December 1997. He was subsequently captured in February 1998 and brought before a magistrate to determine his eligibility for extradition. He was found to be eligible to be extradited on 4 March this year.</para><para>Foster challenged this decision in the Supreme Court of Queensland, which dismissed his application on 7 April 1998. He then made a number of submissions to the Minister for Justice and Customs seeking to avoid extradition. The minister for justice, Senator Amanda Vanstone, decided on 24 July 1998 that Foster should be extradited. Foster sought review of that decision in the Federal Court. On 12 October 1998, the Federal Court granted Foster's application on the basis that the minister for justice did not have the authority to make the decision on behalf of the Attorney-General. The Commonwealth appealed this decision to the full Federal Court on 15 October 1998, which was heard on 26 November, and the decision was reversed.</para><para>I received submissions from both Foster and his mother setting out a number of grounds addressing the merits of the case. There is no doubt that Foster is a colourful character and has undertaken activities which have attracted considerable media attention and other attention. I have accepted those submissions from the Fosters in good faith, and I have put their allegations to the Attorney-General.</para><para>This is an issue that goes to the merits of the case which has been the subject of comment by Justice Spender. The submission to the minister was described by Justice Spender as:</para><para>. . . a careful and fair summary of the submissions advanced on Mr Foster's behalf in relation to the nature of the offences, the likely penalty that might be imposed, submissions concerning the bona fides of the United Kingdom charge, delay in the prosecution of the United Kingdom charges, and the safety considerations advanced by Mr Foster.</para><para>Justice Spender found that:</para><para>. . . it was open to the decision maker to reach a different conclusion than that urged by Mr Foster as to the existence or extent of any threat to his safety on extradition. . . the claims and assertions by Mr Foster were investigated and, in the end, the Minister was not persuaded that any mandatory ground for denying surrender was made out, nor did any other discretionary factor so indicate.</para><para>This is a merits matter, and I am in no position in this instance to adjudicate the decision of the court, which is still the subject of an appeal. I have been assured of the bona fides of both the Commonwealth and the United Kingdom governments, and I accept that—although I would seek an assurance from the government that they do not have an agenda here, and suggest clear cases of procedural unfairness can have a political component which might in some circumstances warrant the scrutiny of the parliament.</para><para>Turning to the substance of this amending bill, the bill proposes amendments to the Acts Interpretation Act by inserting a new section 18C. This will provide for a portfolio minister to authorise a non-portfolio minister or a member of the Executive Council who is not a minister to act in the performance of statutory functions or the exercise of statutory powers. This bill makes amendments to section 19A so that all ministers within a portfolio can exercise the statutory powers of the portfolio minister. Amendments to section 19BA ensure the Governor-General may make orders under the section to meet the changes of an administration.</para><para>These amendments will also validate past authorisations to the extent that they may be invalid. The government, of course, has argued these amendments are urgently needed to overcome the implications of the Foster case. They say this decision would mean authorisations to another minister, to the so-called junior ministers and to parliamentary secretaries are invalid when that person was exercising statutory powers based on that authorisation. We believe that this is a serious matter, as the functioning of government depends on the designated decision maker having the power to exercise the functions available through statute, subordinate regulation rules and cabinet decisions.</para><para>From the Democrat perspective, the way the executive implements its own structures in order to exercise these powers is often shrouded in mystery. These are complex rules and practices about the appointment, powers and responsibilities of ministers and other members of the federal executive and the other office bearers. The Democrats are keen to see some formalisation of these processes under our general policy of accountability and transparency in appointment and decision making by governments. This is particularly important because the institutions in Australia, such as the cabinet, do not have any legal foundation.</para><para>However, there are some formalities. Central to this process are the administrative arrangement orders, the AAOs, made out by the Governor-General acting on advice. The AAOs set out the details of the department's and the minister's responsibility. It is under this scheme the Acts Interpretation Act enables the AAOs to take effect in conjunction with the existing statutory and other relevant rules assigned to particular ministers and departments, and the terminology in this debate is important.</para><para>Delegations are a complete transfer of the decision making power, whereas an authorisation is the decision making taking place on behalf of the decision maker. This debate is about authorisations—the exercise of a decision making power for, and on behalf of, the holder of the statutory power. We are concerned whether these amendments are necessary, and I am assured by the Attorney-General's office a resolution of this issue is essential for administrative certainty. However, I would note that this bill fixes up an erroneous interpretation of the Acts Interpretation Act and that the continued use of section 19 is possible because the Prime Minister might rely on the existing powers to deal with indisposed or unavailable colleagues and the re-making of AAOs.</para><para>We are also concerned that this bill goes beyond the issue in the Foster case. We are concerned that this bill sets out to retrospectively validate past decisions, which may effectively deny certain rights. I have raised this matter with the Attorney-General's office, 
 and I have been assured that civil liberties and other rights will not be denied by this particular amendment. The government says this amendment puts into effect existing practice. This matter was identified by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. In response to these concerns, the Attorney-General has said that these amendments would in no way prejudice practice that has in the past ensured due process. We are happy to accept this assurance from the Attorney-General, although we would seek a further assurance that where this retrospective amendment does affect due process the government will use their discretionary powers to remedy that or any injustice.</para><para>I am also aware that the debate in the House of Representatives focused on the place of oral authorisations—again, Senator Bolkus has referred to this. The government now has introduced its own amendment to make all these authorisations in writing. The Democrats support that amendment, recognising the difficulty and often the considerable expense faced by anyone challenging a decision to determine the decision maker and the decision making power. We are of the view that every authorisation and delegation should be in writing and easily identifiable to ensure open and accountable decision making in government.</para><para>The Acts Interpretation Act has been subject to review by the department and a discussion paper has been prepared. We welcome that review. The issue identified by the discussion paper for section 19 of the act is that what is printed in an act may not have the meaning that the text indicates. The problem then arises in identifying the decision maker and tracing the thread of power through the various orders. This is clearly not satisfactory.</para><para>The Democrats are also conscious of the changed administration under the previous government that created the mega departments and the new range of junior ministers and parliamentary secretaries. These structures have been inherited; they have been maintained. However, the Acts Interpretation Act was never designed to deal with this structure, and we are effectively imposing a new struc 
 ture on an old framework. The solution is to review the Acts Interpretation Act comprehensively to reflect these new structures. This is under way in part, and we would like to see this involve the parliament to make sure the important issues of transparency, accountability and responsibility are maintained. I am happy to discuss that further in a committee stage whenever that may be.</para><para>Basically the Democrats are very keen to see reform of the Acts Interpretation Act. We see an act that was made out in 1901, which has been amended to try to reflect modern times but still in many ways is holding onto the past. Government is very different now from what it was back in 1901. We have had a huge increase in the amount of legislation administrated by the executive, and we have had a huge increase in the size of the executive and we have a society that is no doubt becoming more and more complex.</para><para>The Democrats believe that the Acts Interpretation Act is essential as an interpretative document and a pivotal act in the devolution of powers. It is for this reason alone we need to make sure that the act reflects our needs now as well as into the future. We will be supporting this bill with an understanding that the Acts Interpretation Act is under review. We would expect to see the outcome of this review in legislation before the parliament and, in particular, the entire issue of the distributions of powers between the Executive Council and others. The Labor Party has flagged its support for this proposition, and I look forward to the government making the same commitment.</para><para>I want to make very clear why the Democrats will support the government's amendments and this bill. We accept the need to remedy the presently invalid authorisations from ministers to junior ministers, parliamentary secretaries and others. But we also see the need to make the Acts Interpretation Act reflect modern times. We are very pleased to see that this process of review is under way in the Commonwealth's review of the act. We support this review and the proposed rewrite.</para><para>I will say clearly that the need for change to include institutions such as the cabinet in 
 the formal legislative structures is something else that motivates our support for these changes. Another important reason for the rewrite of this legislation is to recognise the evolution of administrative law. The legislation of administrative law has been a great move forward in government accountability, transparency and efficiency. This has required decision makers to be accountable for their decisions and, in opening up the review of these decisions, the powers of decision makers are under scrutiny. From the Democrats' perspective, the powers to make decisions should be easily identified and their scope strictly within the powers that are given according to our laws. Further, for anyone challenging a decision, the scope of power should be an easily resolved issue and should not be a major legal challenge in itself.</para><para>Finally, we look forward to the review and the rewrite of the Acts Interpretation Act, and we expect to see that legislation before the parliament—hopefully soon.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>1661</page.no><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name><name.id>SF4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—People looking at this situation might well say, `Of course, this act should be passed. Isn't it nitpicking to say that the proper process wasn't gone through? The Attorney-General didn't have power to delegate to another minister. So what? Everybody knows what was intended, and everybody knows that the proper result has been obtained.'</para></talk.start><para>The judge in this matter, Mr Justice Spender of the Federal Court, saw that argument and answered it—and, I thought, answered it very effectively—when he said:</para><para>It might be thought nit-picking and offensive to the efficient and orderly arrangement of the business of the Attorney-General's Department that I have concluded that the Minister for Justice is not a person who satisfies the description in s 19 of the Acts Interpretation Act. However, the liberty of an Australian citizen and our international obligations in respect of extradition highlight the need for a punctilious compliance with the law in this area. Deane J noted in Re Bolton; Ex parte Beane . . .</para><para>"Any officer of the Commonwealth Executive who, without judicial warrant, purports to authorise or enforce the detention in custody of another person is acting lawfully only to the extent that his conduct is justified by clear statutory mandate. That being so, it is the plain duty of any such officer to satisfy himself that he is acting with the authority 
 of the law in any case where, in the name of the Commonwealth, he directs that a person be taken and held in custody."</para><para>It would be a terrible thing if we as legislators and the government of the Commonwealth became desensitised, that is, we thought that locking people up was not a terribly big issue. To take somebody from the community and to lock them up in a cell—which, judging from my visits there and from illustrations that are made of it, is certainly not comfortable or big—is a dreadful and fearful thing. We must never forget it is a dreadful thing to arrest somebody and to lock them up in gaol. It is easier to do that to someone who we think is guilty. If you look at the history of what is alleged against Peter Clarence Foster, you can see that people might well say that this person has been in gaol and, on the surface, has been associated with fraud and what-have-you and so it is really not as bad to lock him up as it would be to lock up someone who was innocent.</para><para>The law in this area and the whole concept of civil rights are tested by our ability to apply them to the unattractive people in the community—the people who have a criminal record; the people who are twisted in mind and body. It is very easy at times to provide civil rights and the rule of law to the attractive, but it is often times less so where the ugly of the community are concerned. I think it would be a bad mistake on our part to say, `Foster'—that is what we would call him; we would not give him his full title—`is guilty anyhow. Therefore, we won't give him the rule of law.' The judge was a bit overenthusiastic in nitpicking about whether the law should apply or not.</para><para>It would be a bad thing to do that, especially on the day when we are celebrating the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The issues of 50 years ago are still the same as the issues of today. Taking away a person's liberty or going into a person's house without a warrant is a fearful thing. It is a fearful thing, even with a warrant. It is a fearful thing to be put in gaol, if you are put in gaol according to process. </para><para>It is for that very reason that we need the process. If we are going to do these sorts of things as a community—that is, to take away a person's liberty or to invade his or her house—we should do it only within the strict conformity of the law. It would be wrong of us to think—not that we do think it, but if we were inclined to think it—that Mr Justice Spender was somehow being pernickety, that he was somehow being precious in these circumstances. He was doing what he should have done as a judge, that is, to protect the liberty of the individual.</para><para>It is proper for us as legislators to think of these things. Indeed, as legislators, we do things about civil liberties and what-have-you. Mr Acting Deputy President McKiernan, I think the committee you are chair of—the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee—has done great work in this area. It has given parliament a real part in the protection of liberties. It has had many a fine secretary. I see Mr Paul Griffiths here in this chamber, and it is very true that having him in the system will ensure that the sorts of things I am talking about are properly listened to. Senator Coonan, an eminent barrister from the Sydney bar, is here too. It is good to have her in the loop.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>BE4</name.id><name role="metadata">NEWMAN</name><name role="display">Senator Newman</name></talker><para>—Will a common senator do, too?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>SF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name></talker><para>—An eminent minister has gone beyond the legal toing and froing. But may I say the minister went to a great law school and was there with many other eminent people.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Returning to the issue, there is some very good thought going on about how we as a parliament can protect liberties. I refer to two people who have done a lot of work in respect of committees in this parliament. The first is Professor Janet Hiebert, who is a professor at the Queen's University in Canada. She has written several articles, but the one I particularly address my attention to is entitled `A hybrid approach to protect rights? An argument in favour of supplementing Canadian judicial review with Australia's model of parliamentary scrutiny'. This article shows that proper parliamentary scrutiny can 
 overcome problems that might arise in legislation.</para><para> The Scrutiny of Bills Committee, which I am honoured to be the chair of, has played its part in that scrutiny. Over the numerous parliaments since I have been here, ministers have cooperated very effectively with that committee in trying to get legislation free of any infringements on human rights. The legislation that does infringe human rights usually does so by accident. When you draft legislation, these things can creep in. I must confess that over the years the executive has usually been keen to see that the legislation does not breach human rights.</para><para> The other person I want to refer to is Frank Brennan, who is probably known to everyone listening to me speak now. He has written a book called <inline font-style="italic">Legislating Liberty: a Bill of Rights for Australia?</inline> that has recently been published by the University of Queensland Press. Again, he goes into this issue of how parliament can have its input into seeing that civil liberties are properly attended to through the legislature. He argues that the Bill of Rights is certainly not to be put aside, because it can be a very effective means of looking after the liberties of the citizen, but that parliament itself can and should do more. I think we as a parliament should take up the words of Janet Hiebert and Frank Brennan and take their issues forward.</para><para>I make the point that the judge on this occasion was fulfilling the grand traditions of the judiciary, that is, he was ensuring that a person—no matter what his background, no matter whether he was good, bad or ugly—was nevertheless given the full protection of the law and that, if his liberty was going to be taken away, then it had to be taken away according to due process and that due process is a very high test—and so it should be.</para><para>The next point is that the courts over the years have been protective of the freedom of Australians, as has parliament. We should not overlook that. But this is the occasion and the time for the parliament to look more and more at its part—it would have to be a bipartisan approach—in establishing that legislation in any event does not contain problems in so far as human rights go. This is a good occa 
 sion to raise these issues, today being the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</para><para> The work of both Janet Hiebert and Frank Brennan provides us as a parliament with a way of going forward to ensure that we do walk proud as citizens and that nobody is going to be able to interfere with us, as we do walk proud as citizens, unless the full operation of the law has been called into play. It does mean the full operation. We cannot cut the corners. Once we start cutting corners, then we get instances of injustice, which we want to avoid. I do not want to go through the number of people who have been wrongly convicted and wrongly treated over the years—that will keep going because to err is human. But I think we as an institution can do a lot to ensure that that does not happen as much as it otherwise would.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>1663</page.no><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator COONAN</name><name.id>2M6</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On behalf of Senator Margetts, I seek leave to incorporate her speech on the second reading of the <inline ref="r632">Acts Interpretation Amendment Bill 1998</inline> .</para></talk.start><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The speech read as follows</inline>—</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">1.	 General Themes</inline></para><para>The broad issues in this bill relate to achieving a balance between administrative ease or speed and proper oversight of executive decision making. Administrative law in general, is concerned to ensure that the existence of values of fairness, openness, honesty and efficiency in Commonwealth executive dealings with the general public.</para><para>Now—I would like to make clear that the Greens (WA) are supportive of the concept of administrative efficiency. Administrative efficiency is beneficial for members of the executive so that they can deal with their business in an optimal fashion without unwieldy red tape. Administrative efficiency is also beneficial for members of the public dealing with the executive. It is not in anyone's interests that government decision-making process should falter on what are no more than mere technicalities. Third parties dealing in good faith with the Commonwealth have a legitimate expectation that arrangements will not be frustrated by administrative oversights beyond their control. In addition, otherwise reasonable and lawful action taken against wrongdoers should not be defeated by technical objections. 
</para><para>However, administrative efficiency should in no way be confused with administrative ease and speed. The speediest methods of administration are not always the ones that produce the most desirable outcomes. The Greens are concerned that best practice administrative procedures and protocols are in place in our executive arm of government—so that the executive can do their job with certainty, transparency and effectiveness and that the public can go about their business with certainty without having their rights unnecessarily or harshly or unjustly impinged upon.</para><para>The <inline font-style="italic">Acts Interpretation Act 1901</inline>  is one of the central pieces of legislation in this kind of framework.<inline font-style="italic"></inline> In some instances the<inline font-style="italic"> Acts Interpretation Act 1901</inline>  will operate to confer legal responsibility for particular statutory provisions on persons other than those specifically named in the legislation. Consequently the Acts Interpretation Act in prescribed circumstances works to bring the legal position into line with changes agreed at the administrative and political level. As such, the Greens take very seriously the potentially immense implications of even small changes to this Act.</para><para>In effect, the Bill asks the Parliament whether (and to what degree) it is prepared to permit the Executive to exercise a wider discretion than is currently available when altering lines of administrative authority and responsibility delineated by legislation.</para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold" font-style="italic">Verbal Authorisations</inline></para><para>One provision in this amending Bill, which would have had immense implications, is the ability to verbally authorise another Minister. We are pleased to see that the Government has taken on board concerns raised regarding their proposal that a grant of authority may be oral in cases where authority is conferred on a Minister. Oral authorisations are obviously problematic for a number of reasons.</para><para>The ability to authorise without a written instrument decreases the transparency in administrative decision making—it makes it hard to engage in proper auditing of these decisions; it creates problems in the enforcement of individual rights—as anyone who is aggrieved by administrative actions would run into evidentiary difficulties, and this would make it more difficult to gain redress through administrative appeal. Oral authorisations could also increase the incidence of court and tribunal proceedings being commenced with the wrong respondent/decision-maker being nominated by the complainant.</para><para>The lack of publicity and the lack of a clear paper trail could result in not only in severe injustices for anyone seeking to review or challenge an administrative decision, but in bad practice in Government decision making. Best practice most consistent with the principles of administrative law would be 
 written authorisations for reasons of transparency and accountability. If oral authorisations are legitimate, there would a temptation to pursue this easier and less specific path—which would undercut best practice.</para><para>Not only that, but oral authorisations would potentially undermine parliamentary intention in specific pieces of legislation. But I will come back to this point later. For all these reasons—oral authorisations are a good example of where administrative ease or speed would not produce administrative efficiency—and may have produced very poor outcomes all round.</para><para>For all these reasons, I am glad that the Government has been persuaded by these arguments and has removed the ability to orally authorise.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">2.	 What the Bill Does</inline></para><para>This bill is ostensibly a clarification of when it is allowable for a Minister to authorise another Minister or a Parliamentary Secretary to exercise statutory powers on their behalf.</para><para>The Bill amends the <inline font-style="italic">Acts Interpretation Act 1901</inline>  in direct response to the decision of Justice Spender in <inline font-style="italic">Foster v Attorney-General</inline>  (1998) that has put a question mark over the breadth of s19 in the <inline font-style="italic">Acts Interpretation Act. </inline></para><para>Justice Spender's decision in the Foster case means that s19 is not sufficient legislative authority for a portfolio Minister to authorise a junior portfolio Minister to exercise statutory powers vested in the holder of a specific ministerial office (ie vested in the "Attorney General"). So in the Foster case, the Attorney General's authorisation of the Minister of Justice was held to be invalid. Consequently, a decision to issue a warrant purportedly made by the Minister for Justice, Senator Vanstone, under section 23 of the<inline font-style="italic"> Extradition Act 1988</inline>  was held to be invalid.</para><para>This decision, by implication, also means that a portfolio Minister cannot authorise non-portfolio Ministers or Parliamentary Secretaries when powers are vested in a specific Minister.</para><para>Essentially this Bill will do a number of things.</para><para>(a)	 It will retrospectively validate past authorisations that may have been made in reliance on section 19 to the extent that they may be invalid.</para><para>(b)	 It will provide for a Minister to authorise a non-portfolio Minister or Parliamentary Secretary to act on his or her behalf.</para><para>(c)	 And it will ensure that an order can be made by the Governor General under section 19 whenever there is any change to the administration of government business and validates past orders under s19BA to the extent that they may be invalid. 
</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">3.	 Concerns</inline></para><para>The Greens appreciate the concerns expressed by the Attorney General in relation to <inline font-style="italic">Foster</inline> . The decision does have potentially serious ramifications for the administrative process of the executive and the Greens will not be preventing this Bill from attempting to address these concerns. The Greens see the merits in remedying the defects of the past. However, we do have concerns that a whole raft delegations or authorisations were done in an informal or non-recorded manner. And we would not like to see our acceptance of past validations as condoning informal delegations/ authorisations in the future.</para><para>Of course the issue of retrospectivity is ever present when we are dealing with past delegations. The issue is of injustices in the past that may no longer afford a remedy to an individual. This is always a difficult issue to weigh up. But on balance, as I mentioned previously, I do appreciate the concerns of the Attorney General and the potential for immense difficulties if these past authorisations are not validated.</para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold" font-style="italic">Parliamentary Oversight</inline></para><para>Another concern the Greens have is with the removal of the variance between specific and non-specific references to Ministers. This Bill essentially operates to remove the distinction between more general terms like "the Minister" and highly specific terms like "the Attorney General".</para><para>The situation as it currently stands is that when a piece of legislation uses the term "the Minister" this refers to any Minister with responsibility for that portfolio.</para><para>However, when a piece of legislation uses the term "the Attorney General" or "the Minister for Finance" or "the Treasurer", this refers specifically to the person currently occupying that position. By naming a particular Minister, there is an assumption that it was Parliament's view that that Minister should be accountable for things done under the Act and should be required to personally perform the statutory functions that the law assigns to her or him.</para><para>The amendments in this Bill, by homogenising the distinction between these terms, threaten to usurp parliamentary intention when the legislation was written and agreed to. Although the Prime Minister's ministerial code of conduct prefers the generic term to avoid potential complications, the legislation handbook recognises that there are appropriate circumstances where parliament should legislate to name a specific minister because of the special skills needed in undertaking a particular duty or function.</para><para>Of course, the entire basis of administrative law is that everything requires a specific statutory mandate. Ministers (or anyone else in the executive arm 
 of Government) cannot go off on "a frolic of their own" without reference to a specific statutory authority. So when a piece of legislation says "Attorney General"—it is indicating that there are special skills needed in this area. This should not be overlooked too easily.</para><para>The Greens (WA) note that the Attorney General's department is currently undertaking a review of the <inline font-style="italic">Acts Interpretation Act 1901</inline> . We shall be watching these developments carefully to ensure a good balance is struck. We shall be watching that changes do not ask the Parliament too go too far in permitting the Executive to exercise a wider discretion than is currently available and when altering lines of administrative authority and responsibility delineated by legislation.</para><para>While supporting this Bill at Second Reading, the Greens (WA) will carefully consider the amendments in the Committee Stage of this Bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>1665</page.no><name role="metadata">Newman, Sen Jocelyn</name><name role="display">Senator NEWMAN</name><name.id>BE4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Family and Community Services; Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank senators for their contributions to this debate.

I find some of the criticism directed at Australia very difficult to accept, particularly when it comes from Australians attending overseas events often at public expense. Australia has an outstanding record on and commitment to human rights. As a nation, we take a very strong bipartisan approach to this important issue. Australia strives to be a decent and harmonious nation, with a society fundamentally based on fairness, on appreciation of racial and cultural diversity, on tolerance and on mutual respect. The government is committed to upholding these values.</para></talk.start><para>I find it interesting to note that, since 1945, 5½ million people have come to Australia as new settlers and have made it their home. Last year 100,000 people from 150 different nations settled in Australia. I believe we all should be proud of the fact that Australian society is made up of many different races, religions and beliefs and that this society is balanced, harmonious, rich, varied and united. Indigenous Australians are a vitally important part of this society, and those of us whose origins lie elsewhere recognise that they are 
 an important component and rightfully recognise them as the original inhabitants.</para><para>It also needs to be acknowledged that both this government and the previous Labor government have put enormous resources into addressing indigenous disadvantage. There is no question of that disadvantage. International critics and Australians who go overseas and criticise should consider these facts. There are 352,000 Australians who identify themselves as indigenous. Over the past 10 years, the Commonwealth government has provided $15.3 billion in indigenous specific funding. During the past decade about $3 billion has been provided for indigenous housing and infrastructure. Some $3½ billion has been spent on indigenous employment, education and training, a billion dollars has been spent on indigenous health, and $350 million has been provided for indigenous legal aid.</para><para>Over $210 million has been provided for native title and land claims. A $64 million package was provided to assist people removed from their families in response to the <inline font-style="italic">Bringing them home</inline> report. In addition, there has been state, territory and local government funding. There has been support and assistance from churches, religious orders, charitable institutions and foundations and individuals as well as indigenous organisations and individuals. The disadvantage that exists today is not through any lack of government and  other resources. The disadvantage exists because of poor outcomes. I think the previous Labor government failed not because of any lack of funding but because it lacked the will to insist on reasonable outcomes from that expenditure.</para><para>The Howard government has fought hard for decent outcomes and, as a result, we have been criticised. The ill-informed and politically motivated critics of Australia might like to consider this. Neither this government nor the previous one has had direct control over most of the indigenous programs designed to address disadvantage. As part of the process of indigenous self-management and under legislative requirements, the Australian government is the funding body but not the program manager. The critics need to understand that the Australian government will not 
 be held accountable for failures in program areas it has no control over. They should also be aware that the Howard government will not be deflected from aggressively pursuing improved outcomes for indigenous Australians. We will continue to pursue improved outcomes in health, housing, education and employment no matter what the ill-informed or politically motivated have to say.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Centrelink: Staff Surveillance</title><page.no>1667</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>1667</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator MARK BISHOP</name><name.id>2L6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is directed to Senator Newman, the Minister for Family and Community Services.

The young people of Australia are, after all, our most precious resource. The coalition government has shown a real commitment to addressing the question of illicit drug usage in this country. In the recent election campaign, the coalition committed a further $10 million for the National School Drug Education Strategy over the next four years, bringing the total expenditure in this area to $17.5 million. This school drug education component is part of the Prime Minister's national illicit drug strategy entitled Tough on Drugs. The total expenditure involved is some $290 million and it covers areas such as law enforcement, health and, importantly, education.</para></talk.start></continue><para>As the former minister for schools, I had the pleasure of being involved in setting up the National Advisory Committee on Drug Education chaired by Ms Karen Hart, President of the Australian Secondary Principals Association, and consisting of representatives appointed for their expertise from education authorities, health and law enforcement agencies, principals, teachers, parents and other community organisations.

I am pleased to advise the Senate that the National Advisory Committee on Drug Education has completed a draft strategy and that has been released for comment by my colleague Trish Worth, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs. It has been released for wide consultation, and submissions are invited. Those submissions will 
 close on 12 February next year. I urge everyone here to participate in that process.</para><para>The goal of the draft strategy is to achieve no illicit drugs in schools. This goal has been endorsed by all states and territories. The strategy aims for world's best practice and reflects the best possible advice from health, education and law enforcement experts in the field. The National School Drug Education Strategy is about more than just teaching our young children to say no to drugs; it is about teaching young people to know and understand why saying no is much better and healthier for them than saying yes.</para><para>Key organisations and interested parties included in wide consultation have been the state and territory governments, the National Catholic Education Commission, the Australian Council of State School Organisations, the National Council of Independent Schools, the National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre, the Australian Parents Council and the Australian Federal Police. The government recognises that community support for schools is going to be vital to the success of this school drug strategy. The government is therefore inviting parents, teachers, key experts and community groups to submit suggestions and make contributions to the consultations on this draft strategy. As I say, submissions close on 12 February next year.

Can the minister confirm that the effect of the proposed health insurance rebate, which is not means tested and which will operate alongside the existing Medicare levy surcharge, will provide a double incentive for high income earners to take out insurance? They will gain a 30 per cent rebate and avoid the one per cent surcharge. Does this mean that a person on a high salary, such as a Prime Minister, of $205,000 per annum who is currently paying the one per cent surcharge would receive an effective subsidy of $2,950 per year for a $3,000 policy? Is it true that a family on $35,000 per year, which already receives $450 under the existing incentive scheme, would gain only an additional $90 per year on a policy worth $1,800?

Senator Evans is probably unaware of that. Many people are confused about this, and the Labor Party is obviously confused about it as well. Something that has never been acknowledged but that I think Senator Lees mentioned at one stage is that many people self-insure. If you go into the statistics on people admitted to private hospitals you will find that in many private hospitals, particularly maternity hospitals, people are uninsured but pay the Medicare levy and then pay out of their pocket on top of that.</para><para>The class struggle and class warfare have always been a chip on the shoulder of the Labor Party. It has always been there. All on the other side feel that they have been badly done by, somewhere or other, and that anybody who earns a few more bob than somebody else does should be cut down. They do not believe in creating wealth; they believe in cutting people down to the mean common denominator. Somehow or other they cannot get over this nonsense that you should not encourage people to earn a few bob, get off the taxpayer's back and take out private health insurance.</para><para>I am proud to say that nearly all my colleagues have private health insurance. They recognise that they are going to take the burden off the public hospitals, and so they either pay their own way, if they can afford to, or are insured so that they take the burden off the public system. That does not seem to get through. The Labor Party believes in a completely public system and that we should all be lowered to the lowest common denominator.</para><para>Another point that I would like to make to Senator Evans is that I heard Senator West this morning crying about the cost of the gap. Across the patients admitted to private hospitals, the average number of bills is 6.4 and the average gap is $106. Across all medical services in Australia, the gap is $14 for all Medicare services. In the private hospitals, the gap is $106. Obviously there are outlays. I know of a patient who had a $40,000 heart operation. The gap was $346. There will be outlays. There will always be people complaining about the gap. Everybody wants something for nothing; it is human nature to do so.</para><para>It is important that the legislation be passed, because it is equitable for every person in this country—for both the wealthy and the poor. It is equitable for the 700,000 people who are below an income of $20,000 who care to take out private health insurance.

The coalition has consistently sought to wind back the clock to the bad old days when women were denied access to child care, when 
 women did not have choices because they alone carried the burden of providing care for the children, the sick and the aged and when women struggled for equal pay and equal access to the work force.</para><para>Well, the coalition should be very proud of what it has done, very proud of its measure of success. The employment figures today paint a very grim picture for women. I repeat: the employment figures today paint a very grim picture for women. Let me just explain to you what they are—and I am sure that at least Senator Coonan and Senator Payne will be interested in what I have to say. Today we saw that the participation rate of women in the work force has declined to 53.8 per cent—twice the fall, as reported today, as having occurred in the male participation rate, thanks to the government and Senator Newman. Women are giving up in the work force, thanks to the government and Senator Newman. Women are also being hardest hit by the squeeze on jobs. Today's unemployment statistics have shown a rise in the unemployment rate for women that is more than double the increase in the unemployment rate for men—I repeat: more than double the increase in the unemployment rate for men. And that is on the back of pretty bad employment figures, anyway.</para><para>The bottom line is—and I think it was Senator Coonan who warned the coalition, and I agree with her—that there appears to be mounting evidence that the coalition government is losing ground with women voters. I think that is a statement of the absolute obvious, but she was absolutely correct. Make no mistake: this is quite a deliberate strategy. Make no mistake: John Howard's 1950s white picket fence agenda, supported by Senator Newman, is behind all this. And make no mistake: this is why in the last election far more women voted Labor than the coalition—four per cent, in fact.

That is a very important aspect that the opposition continues to ignore.</para><para>However, Madam Deputy President, in relation to the things that Senator Newman did refer to in her responses in question time today, I would like to address some of the issues in relation to Centrelink and the minister's portfolio. Do you know, since its establishment in just September of last year, Centrelink has made some extraordinary advances in service delivery to Australian consumers. It has improved access to government services by having brought together a huge range of service delivery functions from what were previously the departments of Social Security and Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs.</para><para>But those opposite do not want to know about any of those efficiencies, any of those more effective service delivery options. They do not want to know about the new approach to the delivery of government services—an approach that works from the customer's perspective. Centrelink has extended its previous roles beyond just the assessment of entitlements and distribution of payments to providing solutions for customers. It does this by providing a range of services, products, advice and payments on behalf of government departments.</para><para>What Centrelink currently does is bring together and deliver services on behalf of seven client departments, their services being delivered to customers in a manner targeted to simplify their interactions with government 
 organisations. But the opposition does not want to know anything about that. It does not want to see anything positive in those changes, and it does not want to see anything positive in improving services for the customers who access Centrelink.</para><para>Centrelink has, in the last 12 months, achieved an enormous success in becoming customer driven—and it has done it in practical ways. It has held value creation workshops where the staff listen to customers providing on the spot feedback. It has set up a popular 1800 customer feedback line. It has drawn up a customer charter and provided customer comment cards for customers to complete. It has been trialling what are referred to as `personalised service initiatives', which take the form of a `one main contact model' where the customers are able to deal with the same Centrelink customer service officer for all their business. That is what being customer driven is all about. It is a model that has been very favourably received by both customers and staff.</para><para>And Centrelink will build on the achievements of the past year to further improve its delivery of services. A new service delivery model has been developed that Centrelink describes as being based on `a life events approach'. When you talk about life events, what do you mean? They include things like looking for a job, needing help after someone in your family has died, and planning retirement. Under that new model, customers are not expected to walk in off the street and know the wide range of payments that are available; they are not expected to know what each single payment is called or how you specifically access it or fill in the appropriate form; whether you might be eligible or what queue you are supposed to be in. All of those things can be quite confronting, quite difficult for people who are accessing services for the first time.</para><para>All that those persons need to bring to the office is a knowledge of their own circumstances and a preparedness to tell the truth and give the details of those circumstances. What they receive then is a package of products and services that are tailored in response to that life event, whatever it may be, that 
 take into account their individual situation, their needs and their expectations. That is what responsive customer service delivery is all about.</para><para>In the new service delivery model, Centrelink will retain the `one main contact approach' so that the customer can represent themselves to Centrelink with whatever life event they are experiencing and have their own situation assessed. They can then continue to do business, if they choose to do so, with that same customer service officer over a period of time. What knowing a customer clearly does is cut out a lot of red tape. It cuts out, for example, the current proof of identity processes where, if you are not dealing with the same person, you do have to prove who you are on each occasion that you present to a different customer service officer in your Centrelink office. They do not have to repeat their story time and time again. That is a flexible customer-sensitive approach to service delivery. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>1682</page.no><name role="metadata">Crowley, Sen Rosemary</name><name role="display">Senator CROWLEY</name><name.id>ZF4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—One could say that the speech that Senator Payne has just given is the answer we should have heard from the minister before, and it certainly does go some way in defence of Centrelink. Centrelink's ambitions have just been very well described; Centrelink's performance is something else again.</para></talk.start><para>Some of us have had the opportunity, as part of a regional employment inquiry which I chaired, to visit and cover many, many places around Australia this year. Again and again, the complaint from the Job Network providers and from the people who were looking for jobs and assistance through the Job Network was that Centrelink was one of the major breakdowns and failings in that process. Centrelink, for something like eight weeks, failed to provide referrals to Job Network agencies. That is why so many unemployed people were disadvantaged, and why so many Job Network providers went to the wall.</para><para>So you might have listened to Senator Payne's excellent description of what Centrelink might be or might even strive to be, but it is not a description of what it is. 
 Certainly it is not. As for the suggestion that it has a new service delivery model that makes everything wonderful for the community out there, anyone who has ever rung a 1300 number trying to get information from the department will know that the time delays are very extensive.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5F4</name.id><name role="metadata">CALVERT</name><name role="display">Senator Calvert</name></talker><para>—Not all the time.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Crowley, Sen Rosemary</name><name role="display">Senator CROWLEY</name></talker><para>—No, not all the time, but one of the most recent calls I made involved a 20-minute wait. That is no service assistance to the community.</para></talk.start></continue><para>One of the things that really troubled me when listening to Senator Payne's answer on behalf of the minister was the use of the word `customer'. Most of us do not think of people as `customers' of government services. People who go to Centrelink or the department of social security or Medibank offices are not customers. They are citizens—they are people of this country. They are not there to buy a service; they are there to access what the public sector in this country provides for its citizens, for its people. I think the use of the word `customer' conveys a whole mentality that is characteristic of this government, and one of the reasons why so many women—another responsibility of Minister Newman—in the last election voted overwhelmingly to support Labor.</para><para>I find the mean spiritedness of Minister Newman interesting. On occasions she has told us of the pride that Mr Howard and the coalition government took in their success in 1996 to have so many women come into office. She has certainly not offered the same congratulations to the Labor Party, with so many women who have been successful in coming into the parliament this time around. I have actually congratulated Liberal women in the past on their successes. I would have thought it was befitting of the Minister for the Status of Women to also acknowledge the success of the Labor Party in getting so many excellent women, along with their male colleagues, into parliament this time around. Many of them, of course, are in safe Labor seats and they are here for the long haul—excellent.</para><para>Much of what Centrelink is proposing to do with the amalgamation of the service delivery 
 so as to make it customer friendly—building on what the Labor government had instituted and was in the process of implementing—had already started. It is not the policy or the intention that the opposition and I stand here to criticise today; it is about exactly what is happening. This process is fraught with difficulties and, like the Job Network, the minister fails to acknowledge that.</para><para>Senator Newman is saying, `If you want to know about Centrelink, I am the minister with portfolio responsibilities in the book, but don't ask me any questions. Centrelink stands by itself; you'll have to ask them direct.' Where does ministerial responsibility for the insufficiencies of this organisation stop? They stop with Minister Newman, who is actually stopping thousands of citizens getting easy and proper access. It stops with the 5,000 people who are going to lose their jobs from Centrelink over the next fews years, as people are going to be encouraged—the `customers'—to find out what their services are from a touch screen. I hope they have had lessons in how to use it. Thousands of people who would rather talk to somebody in the department or in Centrelink to assist will, I think, be disadvantaged.</para><para>Minister Newman, who has responsibility for Centrelink, is failing in her service to the citizens. She has failed to come before the parliament to answer questions that relate to the status of women. There are many things that the Howard government has sneered at that Labor introduced. They have decided to cut the funding, and lots of services for women are no longer in existence. The minister does not support the services to assist women that have continued. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>1683</page.no><name role="metadata">Lightfoot, Sen Phillip</name><name role="display">Senator LIGHTFOOT</name><name.id>WP6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I too rise to take part in the debate on the motion that the Senate take note of answers that were given with respect to Centrelink. Just a few moments ago, Senator Crowley disparagingly referred to the use of the word `customers'. I might just mention that, when we came into government, the people who attend these government offices were also referred to as customers.</para></talk.start><para>When we came into government, the Howard government was committed to bringing 
 under one roof all those areas that acted independently and were disparate of each other. They were the social security areas—pensions, unemployment, veterans and jobs. And, like everything where there is a radical change, there have been some teething problems. Those teething problems have largely been overcome.</para><para>The comprehensive area encompassed by Centrelink includes major regional centres in Western Australia—centres like Kalgoorlie, Geraldton, Carnarvon, Albany, Bunbury and Busselton. It was not practicable for the government to fund offices in separate parts of those particular towns. What the government did, I think, was commendable. This was an integral part of the plan, the mosaic, that the government put together shortly after it came into office. It must have been. It lowered the unemployment rate that had peaked during the horrid 13 years of Labor government from 11.2 per cent to the latest figures that I have seen of just over seven per cent. It lowered interest rates in the same areas with respect to that mosaic that I spoke about from over 20 per cent to ones that are now under six per cent. The ANZ survey of job vacancies—a respected survey; one used by most major and small businesses throughout Australia—indicates that expectations have risen, exports have increased and our system has survived the Asian devastation. Centrelink is an integral and important part of that system.</para><para>The Labor Party seems to have a bent that it cannot get away from. It wants to have Australians dependent on them. Centrelink takes away that dependency. This arrangement has increased the possibility and the practicability of assistance by providing a hub that encompasses a whole lot of offices. Centrelink has survived in most, if not all, of the major centres that I mentioned. With the retreat from the rural and coastal areas of Western Australia, all of those offices could not have survived. Some of those offices would have had to close if they had remained in the form they were in prior to the Howard government coming into office. They have been saved from closure.</para><para>There seems to be a growing thrust by the Labor Party to ensure that people of Australia 
 remain dependent on government largesse—the government handout; the government trough. Centrelink does not do that. Centrelink takes away that dependency and makes people more independent. It gives them more hope. It is highly successful. The 1800 number does work. The fact that you cannot get through at times is a manifestation of its success. It is so good, it is so busy, that that is a clear manifestation of its success.</para><para>It is about time the opposition gave some praise where it is due to this government. The success that it has had in weathering the Asian downturn is something that it deserves credit for. Centrelink is part of the mosaic, part of the major plan that has driven Australia forward, that has improved the areas which needed to be improved and that has taken people away from the dependency that the Labor Party desperately needs to maintain its support. Australia is far better off for it.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>1684</page.no><name role="metadata">Collins, Sen Jacinta</name><name role="display">Senator JACINTA COLLINS</name><name.id>GB6</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In taking note of Senator Newman's responses to several questions today I would like to go back to the question that I raised in relation to the Child Support Agency. Senator Newman should not be held trussed by Mr Truss as her junior minister and should deal with this issue. She did provide an answer yesterday but, as we have pointed out in question time today, the official answer coming through her junior minister, or through the senior levels of management in the department, are obviously out of kilter with the reality on the shop floor.</para></talk.start><para>Given all of the comments that government members are making about Centrelink, perhaps I should suggest also that the minister spend some time in a Centrelink office and actually experience how it is on the shop floor in those offices where, for instance, agencies have to close down for the day simply to catch up with business. I am somewhat amused by Senator Lightfoot's comment that the 1800 number is working because you cannot get through. That is absolutely astounding as a test of the success of service delivery. I wonder what the bases were of his development of logical reasoning.</para><para>But let me go back to the issue of the Child Support Agency. I would like to refer, so that 
 the minister is fully briefed on this matter, to a letter sent to the national program manager of the Child Support Agency from the CPSU in relation to the issue. The union still has had no response to a letter sent on 3 December on this very important issue. In trying to follow through for a response, they have been told that they will eventually get a response on Monday. That is simply not good enough, particularly given the fact that the minister through her junior minister is meant to be inquiring into the matter. The letter says:</para><para>The issue of CSA staff identification has been an ongoing one for the union and for the agency management. Concerns have repeatedly been expressed about the potential danger to staff if they are forced to reveal their full names and therefore in most cases give access to their residential address to clients. It is of great concern that with the introduction of the new CSA computer system staff's full names will be automatically printed on letters being sent out.</para><para>It is one thing for Senator Payne to be talking about wonderful efficiencies and performances and new models and theories, but again we have to get to the issue of how they are delivered in practice. If the minister spent a bit more time in Centrelink agencies she would see that it is pretty obvious that the differential between models and practice is vast. This is a case of another issue raised. The move to the computer system and automatic correspondence is obviously creating very severe security concerns for staff within the agency and they are not being addressed by senior management. The letter goes further:</para><para>I am aware of a staff petition from Box Hill staff signed by 61 staff imploring you to change your approach on this matter and of your response. Given recent events in the ATO, the union again requests that you urgently review your position on this matter. I will be contacting officers and indicating that we wish to discuss this vital issue and that we meet next week. The union will be examining issues such as employers' possible legal liability if changes are not made to the system, including duty of care issues as well as possible breaches of the Occupational Health and Safety Act.</para><para>Again, I highlight that this letter has not been responded to. The portfolio minister should now be paying some attention to this matter, 
 rather than referring it back to her junior minister.</para><para>Let me deal with some of the other comments made about Centrelink today. Senator Lightfoot's contribution I would characterise as denial and optimism. Denial of any of the problems in Centrelink is a bit like the government's denial of any of the problems in relation to CASA and the civil aviation tests, which have been overturned. It is a bit like the government's denial of any problems with the Job Network, which they should at least be aware by now is publicly seen as laughable. The same denial applies to the problems in Centrelink.</para><para>But then, the optimism was fairly extreme as well: `We have survived the Asian devastation.' Has Senator Lightfoot not seen today's unemployment figures? Does he not realise that the bump that we had last month is not characteristic of a trend but that we are back to eight per cent, that there has been a severe decline in full-time and part-time employment? <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>1685</page.no><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGAURAN</name><name.id>WH4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The performance we have seen today of taking note of answers is nothing more than a renewed attack on one of our ministers. Each day they seem to focus on one. The game is up. The tactics are obvious. I think you need a few fresh minds in your tactics committee. Yesterday we had Senator Kemp. That well and truly flopped over. The one that really flopped over, Senator Carr, was the attack you launched on Senator Macdonald. Today it is Senator Newman, so much so that Senator Mackay came in with a set piece. It wouldn't have mattered how Senator Newman answered the question or what the question was; Senator Mackay came in with a set piece talking about the performance of Senator Newman in relation to the status of women. I don't think Senator Newman even mentioned the status of women issue. She mentioned Centrelink. She mentioned child care. She did not even mention the extra arm of her portfolio in relation to women. Such was the set piece put down by Senator Mackay. It was a blind and unresearched attack.</para></talk.start><para>I would like to detail some of that research in regard to Senator Newman. She is the 
 Liberal Party's woman in cabinet. She is the most senior woman we have in government. It is not a token position. I remember only too well when we were in opposition, Senator Carr. How could we forget? We had 13 years in opposition. So there is not much you can tell us about opposition that we do not know. When we were in opposition, there was a certain female politician that was promoted by the Labor Party into cabinet. It was well recognised that that was a token promotion. In fact, a very disgruntled junior minister who thought they should get the position was reportedly going around saying that this promotion was made only because she had the right genes in the right state. Now work that one out!</para><para>Few on the frontbench have had to make tougher reforms than Senator Newman when she first took over her portfolio. We are now in our second term of government, and she has held that position in cabinet. Anyone—even you, Senator Carr—who knows politics knows that it is pretty hard to hold a position for two terms in cabinet. To her credit, this is her second term in cabinet. Few on the frontbench have had to make tougher decisions in their portfolios than Senator Newman has in hers. When we came into government, we had a deficit of $10 billion. We had to tackle that. Every portfolio had to deliver savings and cuts. One of the portfolios left with the legacy of disaster was the social welfare portfolio.</para><para>Senator Newman tackled her portfolio with sensitivity. She changed the whole philosophy of social welfare in regard to mutual obligation. That is something that Mr Latham would like you to look at: the question of mutual obligation. That is the great philosophy change in social welfare. There is no longer this handout mentality. Senator Newman's greatest achievement has been a saving of $1.4 billion a year in her portfolio—simply by bringing to hand the unchecked fraud that was going on by the previous government and the errors. An auditing process that went right through that portfolio at the time came up with a remarkable saving of $1.4 billion. That is the record of Senator Newman. That has sent a message right throughout society that 
 the days of rorts and the handout mentality of social welfare are gone.</para><para>Senator Crowley made some pretty glib remarks about the women supporting the Labor Party in the last election. That is the first time I have seen that statistic put on the table. I do not accept it at all. How could I when your primary vote was as low as it has ever been? You did not advance your vote at all. I am not going to accept that very glib remark by Senator Crowley. The great disappointment that Senator Crowley should have spoken about was the Labor Party's approach towards women in politics. They with great jubilation set down a quota system for I think 30 per cent of women to be in parliament by the year 2000. They are way behind in meeting that quota. In fact, they are not going to, particularly in New South Wales. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>1686</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Membership</title><page.no>1686</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>1686</page.no><name role="metadata">The DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name.id>10000</name.id><electorate>PO</electorate><party>N/A</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The President has received letters from party leaders nominating senators to be members of committees.</para></talk.start><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Heffernan</inline>)—by leave—agreed to:</para><para>That senators be discharged from and appointed to committees as follows:</para><para>Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee</para><para>Participating member: Senator Murphy.</para><para>Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit</para><para>Discharged: Senator Crowley</para><para>Appointed: Senator Faulkner.</para><para>Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters</para><para>Appointed: Senator Murray.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS</title><type>Personal Explanations</type><page.no>1686</page.no></debateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>1686</page.no><name role="metadata">Murphy, Sen Shayne</name><name role="display">Senator MURPHY</name><name.id>FX5</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I seek leave to make a personal explanation as I claim to have been misrepresented.</para></talk.start><para>Leave granted.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>FX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Murphy, Sen Shayne</name><name role="display">Senator MURPHY</name></talker><para>—Reported on ABC radio today were comments from Mr Paul

Bankers are required, in the case of the bank's customers, to conduct themselves in a particular way to ensure that the customers' interests are held uppermost. Mr Kemp's bank repossessed a number of cars. The particular cars in this case were Porsches. There were four of them. The cars in relation to which people defaulted on their loans and which the bank repossessed were supposed to be sold by the bank and, indeed, ultimately were.</para></talk.start></continue><para>But one in particular—again, this is part of my explanation in terms of questioning Mr Kemp's integrity—was a 1990 Porsche 944 S2 Cabriolet with which Mr Kemp was photographed in the <inline font-style="italic">Examiner</inline> in April 1992.

On 26 May 1978 the then Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Withers) informed the Senate that within six months of the tabling of a committee report, the responsible Minister would make a statement in the Parliament outlining the action the Government proposed to take in relation to the report. The period for responses was reduced from six months to three months in 1983 by the then incoming government. The then Leader of the Government in the Senate announced this change on 24 August 1983. The method of response continued to be by way of statement. Subsequently, on 16 October 1991 the former Government advised that responses to committee reports would be made by letter to a committee chairman, with the letter being tabled in the Senate at the earliest opportunity. The current Government in June 1996 affirmed its commitment to respond to relevant parliamentary committee reports within three months of their presentation.</para><para>The list does not usually include reports of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works or the following Senate Standing Committees: Appropriations and Staffing, Selection of Bills, Privileges, Procedure, Publications, Regulations and Ordinances and Scrutiny of Bills. However, such reports will be included if they require a response. Government responses to reports of the Public Works Committee are normally reflected in motions for the approval of works after the relevant report has been presented and considered. Responses to reports of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts are usually made in the form of Finance Minutes which are tabled by the committee. Where a response has been made by way of Finance Minute, the date of presentation has been appropriately annotated.</para><para></para><para>Legislation committees report on bills and on the provisions of bills.

We understand that there is a problem. We understand that the government wants flexibility, but we think the government goes too far and, in doing so, in some ways may give authority for ministers to in fact override laws passed by this parliament.</para><para>Our concern is that ministers should not be able to delegate or authorise outside of their portfolio areas. That should be a responsibility of the Prime Minister or cabinet. We think 
 that should be so for good policy and administrative reasons. There needs to be certainty. Individuals need to know who is taking decisions as to their existence, their businesses and so on. The current government proposal does not do that.</para><para>We are also concerned to keep in mind the words of His Honour when he tackled the case of Foster v. Attorney-General. In the judgment, as I cited earlier, Justice Spender made mention of the separation of powers under the Westminster system. Our amendment would offer protection against impingement on such separation of powers. I indicated before lunch that we would move this amendment. The Democrats indicated they would not support it. As a consequence, I will not be putting it to a vote.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>1699</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on the amendment moved by the opposition. As Senator Bolkus has indicated, the Democrats will not be supporting the amendment in its current form. Clause 18C makes provision for the Prime Minister or cabinet to authorise a non-portfolio minister or a member of the Executive Council who is not a minister to act for or on behalf of the portfolio holder. Although the Democrats have some reservations about the way this amendment operates in that it may not achieve its intended purpose, we are certainly quite glad that it is being proposed as a matter of discussion and debate.</para></talk.start><para>The Acts Interpretation Act was assented to on 12 July 1901 as the second act in the new Australian Federation. Since then, the sections covered by the government's bill have been amended a number of times to deal with changes in the way government operates. The idea supporting interpretation legislation has been a significant reduction in the amount of legislation because commonly used words and phrases can be relied upon. This was evident from a number of submissions to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs report entitled <inline font-style="italic">Clearer Commonwealth law</inline> in September 1993. That report recommended the Attorney-General's Department and the Office of 
 Parliamentary Counsel publicly review and rewrite the Acts Interpretation Act.</para><para>As I have set out before, the Democrats are keen to see this process advanced and encourage the government to rewrite this important act to reflect modern day times and needs and responsibilities. However, we also want to see that review and rewrite go further than just the interpretation measures. We want to see the Acts Interpretation Act deal with the institution of government and the way the executive organises itself and distributes the powers granted to government by our laws. We acknowledge the importance of the Acts Interpretation Act, and we want to ensure its continuing relevance and to promote legislative clarity so that those relying on legislation can know and understand what our parliament does and how laws are to take effect. More importantly, we want to make sure those challenging governments or who are subjected to the action of a government can ensure our laws are properly and appropriately administered.</para><para>The constitution makes provision for ministers and the federal Executive Council, but it does not distinguish between senior ministers, junior ministers and parliamentary secretaries. The Labor amendment, in many ways, is a welcome recognition of the central place of cabinet in the Australian government as well as these additional roles which reflect the changing way that government is administered. This recognition is now probably as important as ever before. This is because the changes to mega departments by the previous government, as I mentioned in my speech in the second reading debate, have been carried on by this government. It is also important to realise the increasing scope of government in Australia.</para><para>The constitution makes provision for only seven ministers. At the time the Acts Interpretation Act was assented there were 10 ministers. In 1998 there are some 30 ministers. Perhaps more interesting is the rise of parliamentary secretaries. They first appeared in the Lyons ministry in 1938, with parliamentary secretaries for defence and Treasury. Since then, they have existed in a number of government departments. In 1980 
 they became statutory office holders, and from 1990 they have become members of the Executive Council.</para><para>The Democrats are keen to see a reflection of these  changes in the Acts Interpretation Act. We welcome the Labor Party's recognition of these issues and their attempts to put them into effect. Unfortunately, we have some concerns about how these amendments have proposed to achieve their goal. We are of the view that they do not cover satisfactorily the complex issues. However, I understand we have a common interest in reviewing the Acts Interpretation Act to deal with this and related issues. I look forward to hearing the result of this reform process.</para><para>The Democrats will not be supporting the amendment in its present form with an understanding from the government that the Acts Interpretation Act is under review and that that review will be completed soon, we hope. We would expect to see the outcome of this review, as I stated in my speech in the second reading debate, in legislation before the parliament, addressing, in particular, the entire issue of the distribution of powers between the Executive Council and others. The Labor Party have flagged their support for this proposition, and I look forward to the government making the same commitment.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>1700</page.no><name role="metadata">Vanstone, Sen Amanda</name><name role="display">Senator VANSTONE</name><name.id>7E4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Justice and Customs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank Senator Stott Despoja for indicating the support of the Democrats for the <inline ref="r632">Acts Interpretation Amendment Bill 1998</inline> . I freely acknowledge that there are wider issues to be canvassed under the review, and I expect the Democrats and others will want to make submissions to that review of the Acts Interpretation Act, but their approach is a sensible approach to a potential problem we face. It has been well canvassed in the speeches in the second reading debate that a Federal Court judge has drawn an unexpected interpretation of the Acts Interpretation Act which has put a number of decisions at risk across a number of portfolios. That matter is under appeal, but the judgment has not yet been handed down. In the meantime, there is an absolute need to protect those decisions that have been made, obviously for the longer

I indicate on behalf of the Australian Labor Party, the opposition in the Senate, that we support Senator Lees's second reading amendment to the private health insurance bills. That amendment provides:</para></talk.start><para>"the Senate:</para><para>(a)	 notes the evidence provided to the Community Affairs Legislation Committee that the rebate scheme will not take the pressure off public hospitals and is an inefficient and inequitable use of public funds; and</para><para>(b)	 resolves that the bill not be read a second time; and</para><para>(c)	 calls on the Government to:</para><para>	 (i)	 introduce a means test to restrict eligibility for the rebate to hospital insurance for people on low incomes;</para><para>	 (ii)	 implement a review process to evaluate the rebate scheme against defined outcome measures;</para><para>	 (iii)	 require health insurance funds to achieve improved performance outcomes; and</para><para>	 (iv)	 address the key areas of need in the public health sector, including coordinated care for older Australians; waiting lists in public hospitals; public dental health services; rural health services; and the health care needs of indigenous Australians."</para><para>These measures highlight the concerns that have been expressed about the inadequacies of this bill. We think the amendment ought to be supported by the Senate. The problems with the proposed bills have been widely canvassed in the second reading debate. It is clear that this is bad public policy. It will not relieve the pressure on the public hospital system. Most of the funds will be directed to 
 those on high incomes who are already in private health insurance. A myth has been perpetrated by the government in this debate that somehow this measure is about assisting, via the rebate, low and middle income families who are battling to meet their insurance costs. The reality is that they will have a very small increase in the rebate that is available currently under the old scheme. Most of the money in this proposal goes to high income earners. Those earning over $70,000 a year are the ones that benefit most. The majority of the funds go to them.</para><para>We think that is inequitable. There are major problems in our public hospitals system and this sort of money would go a long way to addressing them. It would not only address those problems but mean that 100 per cent of the Australian population would have the benefit of those funds; that 100 per cent of the population could access good quality public hospital care, rather than just supporting the 30 per cent who are in private health insurance, as is proposed by the government.</para><para>It also does not solve the problems with the industry. The gap payments, the out-of-pocket expenses, are so high that a lot of people just cannot afford to use their insurance, even if they have it. That is a real problem in the industry. It is a problem that is not addressed in the bills. It means that this rebate will just get eaten up without solving the very real problems that exist in the health industry.</para><para>The other major problem it does not address is rising premiums. People in private health insurance know that their premiums have gone up 16 to 20 per cent in the last two years each year. That means that at this rate any benefit they get out of this measure proposed by the government would get eaten away in higher premiums within a couple of years. People will be no better off.</para><para>The measure is also highly inequitable, as I said. About $900 million of the additional $1.4 billion will go to families that already have insurance who are on high incomes. We are throwing money at the well-off in the community while denying funding for services, such as emergency dental care, for those who cannot afford to get treatment otherwise. It is just a wrong set of priorities 
 by the government. They are throwing money at a scheme with no real idea what it will do to the industry and with no real idea whether it will halt the slide. </para><para>The government claimed the last scheme would halt the slide in private health insurance participation, and it did not. They have no statistical or economic modelling to suggest that this will be any more successful, but they will have wasted $1.7 billion of taxpayers' money by throwing it at the problem, not knowing whether it is going to work or not. They got it wrong last time and I suspect they will get it wrong this time.</para><para>The proposed amendment by the Democrats seeks to ensure that the pressure on the public hospital system is relieved, that the Dental Health Scheme is reintroduced and that the health needs of indigenous Australians and those in rural areas are addressed. It would ensure that the rebate would be means tested to ensure that it is targeted at middle and low income earners, at the people who need the help to pay the premium, not at John Howard, who does not need the help.</para><para>John Howard and people like him will benefit most from this measure. We will basically pay their private health insurance as a result of this measure. That is not what the health needs of this country are. That is not the priority. John Howard and other ministers in this government do not need help to pay their premiums, but people do need to get access to public hospitals and they do need to get off waiting lists to have operations performed when they are in pain. There is a whole range of health needs that are a far more urgent priority for this parliament than subsidising wealthy people to have health insurance.</para><para>We are not opposing support for those who need it, but we are opposing providing support for those who do not. As I say, there are some very good things in the Democrats' second reading amendment. It provides a much better direction for public policy in this area and the opposition will be supporting it.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tambling</inline>) adjourned.</para><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tambling</inline>) proposed:</para><para>That the resumption of the debate be an order of the day for a later hour.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>1703</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator CHRIS EVANS</name><name.id>AX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—As the government has been pressuring us to bring on this debate for weeks and has been saying how important it was we get on with it, I think it is only reasonable that this chamber have an explanation as to why the government is not ready to proceed.

By all reports, he was disappointed that they failed to appreciate how much good he is doing to prevent the defence uses of nuclear weapons. Recent surveys highlight the very clear difference between public sentiment about nuclear weapons and the activities of governments all around the world, but particularly the nuclear weapons nations. We believe the Australian government is out of step with the community here. Despite the good intentions of the foreign minister, we do not believe that he is doing enough or that he is necessarily going far enough.</para><para>It was significant that the group who met with the foreign minister pointed out last 
 night on the radio the failings of the BJP government in India to focus on the nuclear detonations as a success of their office. This is significant, because we have been led to believe that there was great community support for those detonations and for the escalation of nuclear weaponry in India and in Pakistan. Clearly, the community does not necessarily share the same level of joy or have the same agenda as their government's.

I particularly drew his attention to the following comment on page 31 of the report to his government:</para></talk.start><para>If this technology—</para><para>which is being developed in Lucas Heights—</para><para>is classified as "associated technology", then any transfer to the US for further development will require an amendment to the existing Australia/US nuclear cooperation agreement, or a new agreement.</para><para>I asked whether that was so. I also asked whether, in order to accommodate this research into uranium enrichment, the government is moving to throw out, dismantle or change the nuclear cooperation agreement with the United States and, if so, why.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>1704</page.no><name role="metadata">Tambling, Sen Grant</name><name role="display">Senator TAMBLING</name><name.id>6E4</name.id><electorate>NT</electorate><party>CLP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I will address the specific issue put by Senator Brown but, before doing so, can I have the indulgence of the committee for a moment to comment on some related matters that he raised in the debate yesterday about mining at both Kakadu and Pine Creek. I advise Senator Brown that his concerns on both these matters have been passed on to the relevant minister. With regard to Kakadu, oral advice has been received from the Office of the Supervising Scientist that the recent weather conditions in the Northern Territory have not caused any environmental problems at Ranger.</para></talk.start><para>The senator would, of course, be familiar with the very satisfactory record of the Rang 
 er mine in that area over 18 years. I do not have particular information on the issue regarding Pine Creek. However, I assure the senator that it has been passed to a number of both Commonwealth and Northern Territory ministers for their early attention. As soon as I have any information on it, I will make it available to Senator Brown.</para><para>With regard to Silex and the laser issues, I am advised that the Silex project is a private sector project researching a possible method of enriching uranium for use in power reactors. This research is still at an early stage and it is not yet established that the Silex process will be effective in enriching uranium. The Silex company has a contract with the United States Enrichment Corporation for the commercial development of the process in the US if the research is successful.</para><para>It is too early to say whether the Silex process is of possible proliferation significance. However, security measures have been put in place to ensure that the technology is protected against unauthorised access. The Australian Safeguards and Non-proliferation Office is monitoring the process of the project to ensure that appropriate security is maintained.</para><para>Australian and US officials have been discussing a new agreement to ensure that if the technology is transferred to the US it will be used for exclusively peaceful purposes under international atomic energy safeguards. There is nothing inconsistent with Australia's non-proliferation commitments in undertaking this research. On the contrary, this enhances Australia's capacity to evaluate nuclear developments in other countries and to contribute to the development of effective non-proliferation controls. Examples are international safeguards and controls on the export of relevant technology. For these reasons, the research was authorised by the previous government.</para><para>The project does not represent any risk to the environment or public safety. It is extremely small scale. Silex is authorised to process no more than one kilogram of uranium. In practice, much less than this is being used in the process. Information on the project and safeguard arrangements applying 
 to it is given in the annual report of the Director of Safeguards, the head of ANSO.</para><para>I trust that that provides Senator Brown with information. I ask him to address any other questions that he may have specifically to this legislation, which we are keen to process in a reasonably ordered timetable today.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>1705</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I assure the parliamentary secretary that I will not take much longer.

Amendments Nos 5, 7 and 9 on sheet 1183 relate to prescribed procedures for public consultation. This is still an issue which has not been resolved. It is to give effect to the stated intent of the government following the committee hearing to have a transparent and consultative approach to the appointment of members of the advisory council and committees. By all means, leave the detail to be worked out in the regulations, about which there is still to be further consultation, but let us have this locked in at this stage rather than leave it to the goodwill of the government over the next few months.</para><para>Amendment No. 10 relates to public interest disclosures. It is essential that the council and committee structures work effectively. In going onto a council or committee, persons must be responsible to the people to whom they must provide advice (the CEO), to the people who appoint them (in this case the minister), to the rest of council, to the industry which relies on them and, most importantly, to the Australian community who rely on them to be their eyes and ears in the nuclear industry. From time to time—hopefully only rarely—it may be necessary for someone or 
 a number of people in one these councils to break ranks with the orthodoxy of their colleagues.</para><para>These committees, honourable senators will remember, are charged with monitoring radiation protection and nuclear safety. There is an obligation to err on the side of caution. We believe that it is necessary to make known concerns so people can make up their own minds and take appropriate action. If someone does have a concern and it is too urgent to wait for the annual or quarterly reports, what can they do? Clearly, they can raise it with the CEO, but more probably they have discussed it at council.</para><para>If the concern is genuine and is not shared by the majority or not shared by the CEO, it would be, we believe, in the public interest to disclose it, and this amendment will allow them to do so without fear of prosecution. This is particularly important for the community representatives on the council or committees because they represent a constituency of some kind as well as being council or committee members. The concern may be genuine. The issue has to be first discussed with the CEO and the person must believe the disclosure to be in the public interest. Then and only then can they publicly disclose any information about radiation protection and nuclear safety. If it were not for the culture of secrecy that surrounds and has surrounded this industry, this kind of specific amendment might not be necessary, but there still needs to be a way to move before the communities who have already been associated with industries, such as those associated with ANSTO, can gain that confidence.</para><para>Amendment No. 11 relates to public nomination and basically confirms in the bill a commitment given by the government to include in the regulations some process for public consultation before the minister chooses the representatives of the general public or of the community and environmental groups in the case of the committees. It takes that commitment one step further by requiring that the process include some form of nomination from the relevant community. In practice, this could be done by placing an ad in the papers or by contacting relevant local government 
 authorities. How it is done is still a matter for the regulations, but this amendment will ensure that the process of identifying community representatives includes an opportunity for the public to be involved in nominating suitable people. You would not think that would be too difficult.</para><para>Amendments Nos 14 and 18 relate to penalties and they highlight an inconsistency in the bill dealing with penalties. Section 40 deals with the power of the CEO to issue directions to a controlled person. There are two occasions on which this applies. The first occasion is where the person is not complying with the act or regulations. When someone is not complying with an act to protect the community from radiation, or when someone is in breach of a regulation about nuclear safety, you might assume that it is a pretty serious matter. Not so, if you go by the penalties of this bill. The second occasion is where the CEO believes a direction is necessary to protect the health and safety of people or to avoid damage to the environment.</para><para>The penalties come into play where the CEO's directions are not complied with. Let us consider the seriousness of that. The CEO believes there will be a harm to people if a direction is not carried out. If the person does not carry it out for whatever reason—it is too expensive, it is impractical, tomorrow is a holiday or whatever—what happens next? The penalty is 30 penalty units, which in today's money equates to $3,300. That is hardly a disincentive if the alternative is an expensive upgrade. So then what happens? Under this regime, nothing. There is a power for the CEO to undertake to do those things required if a controlled person will not, but imagine the complications that arise then, not the least being the arguments over cost and who will pay and the difficulty people will have getting information about this at the time.</para><para>When we consider that we have a situation where—and we will deal with this in more detail later—a person can be put into prison, according to the government, for two years if they get their warrant wrong, this is way out of proportion. This is an instance where, quite clearly, the community require and need the assurance that there will be some very firm 
 ability to make sure that those people under ARPANSA do feel the necessity to obey the legitimate instructions of the CEO—and this certainly is not good enough.</para><para>I do urge the support of the Senate for these amendments. If the government does not support these amendments, I urge the majority of the Senate to see the commonsense in them.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>1712</page.no><name role="metadata">Tambling, Sen Grant</name><name role="display">Senator TAMBLING</name><name.id>6E4</name.id><electorate>NT</electorate><party>CLP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Greens have proposed a number of amendments which are unnecessary because of amendments already agreed earlier in this debate.

 relation to part 7 of the bill, which deals with the powers of inspection; I mention it in relation to nuclear safety inspectors. This is where we have got way out of kilter with what we want the industry to do compared with the precautionary role we think we should be playing in relation to important nuclear health and safety issues. Part 7 of the bill deals with the powers of inspection—inspections crucial to the monitoring of any installation. Unless you can get in and have a look around, you cannot be sure that the information you are being given is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.</para></talk.start><para>But here, remember that we are hearing from the government and the opposition that it is all right if you hold back on the truth and do not allow the community to get it. Unless they can get in and have a look, basically clause 62 requires the inspector to have either the permission of the occupier of the premises or a warrant before going into a controlled facility. This is reasonable enough, I guess. One would expect that in the normal course of events a warrant would not be necessary but from time to time it might be.</para><para>Personally, there are other industries where inspectors, if you have a free and open case of health and safety, would not have to get permission or a warrant; that that would be part of their job. So I am not sure that it is reasonable—let us start off with that. I believe that perhaps there should be the powers of inspection and maybe there should be the powers of spot inspection. So we have already created a problem in relation to the powers of spot inspection.</para><para>There could be a part of an installation that an inspector wanted to get to or perhaps something in a facility—a computer simulation in a worst case scenario, for instance—which would require a warrant. There are procedures laid out by which an inspector gets such a warrant and they are, as you would expect, quite thorough. They require an inspector to provide information on oath that it is reasonably necessary to gain access to the premises to see whether the act is being complied with. Well, that is all well and good. </para><para>The problem arises when we come to clause 79, which sets out the penalty for making, in an application or a warrant, a statement known to be false or misleading in a material particular. Yes, it would be naughty for an inspector to spin a yarn or beef up a case for a warrant when there was only suspicion to go on, or exaggerate the credibility of a source or information to get access to check it out.</para><para>But are we talking about the kind of offence of an overzealous inspector that could or should lead to a two-year imprisonment, or the kind of offence that might be committed by an inspector who is willing to serve the community in the way the community would be expecting him to which has been brought about by a threat or concern? There are, at worst, offences which led to a bit of inconvenience for the operator of a controlled facility; at best, they could lead to the uncovering of otherwise hidden dangers. Either way, they should not incur a two-year gaol term. Compare the seriousness of this offence with the seriousness of the failure to apply with a safety direction, as I mentioned before, of the chief executive officer—a small fine for a person under the law who does something dangerous compared with the maximum of a two-year gaol term for someone who has an exaggerated concern for safety.</para><para>Where are we getting at and why is the Labor Party sitting there, allowing this to happen? The priorities are all wrong here. The more severe penalty should be for unsafe practices, for failing to put dangerous situations right—and not for the safety inspector. We are trying to have the regime administered by ARPANSA to be one that encourages a culture of safety in the nuclear industry. These penalties send the wrong message entirely and have had the effect of putting a muzzle on the inspectors before they even get started.</para><para>During the committee, one of the issues raised was: what kind of notice was given in relation to things like the regulations involved that are attached to this legislation? The answer was that there has been substantial consultation in relation to the industry. So, in effect, one of the major industries that we are 
 attempting to regulate in Australia—and that is ANSTO—has been in there, helping to draft the legislation and the regulations. Is it any surprise to anybody that they have written in to have greater penalties for inspectors than for themselves? Of course not.</para><para>It is time that the parliament of this place realised that that is not an acceptable practice to be taken by those groups, and we would never accept it under any other circumstances. We realise that, in the Australian situation, we have become, or allowed ourselves to become, dependent on ANSTO for advice on nuclear issues.</para><para>This is what we are trying to move away from—to have an independent body. I wonder, with the acting CEO of ARPANSA being in the chamber giving advice to the minister, how independent that has become. We have to start right, and we are not doing that with these kinds of proposals in the legislation.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>1713</page.no><name role="metadata">Tambling, Sen Grant</name><name role="display">Senator TAMBLING</name><name.id>6E4</name.id><electorate>NT</electorate><party>CLP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Greens propose to reduce the penalty for inspectors falsely applying for warrants.

They should not be worried about putting those reasonable concerns on a warrant in case they may have got something wrong or in case a rumour turns out to be incorrect. If I were on an aircraft, would I want somebody to be threatened with imprisonment for following a precautionary principle if a small light indicated that something was not working? Quite frankly, if I were in 
 that aircraft, I would want them to check out the light. Even if they, in every intellectual way, knew nothing was wrong, I would want them to check out the light, and that is what the community would want as well.</para></talk.start><para>Amendments not agreed to.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>1714</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—In the interests of time, I would like the strong support of those amendments to be registered from the Greens (WA).</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>1714</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I move Democrats amendments Nos 1 to 9:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	 Clause 20, page 12 (line 29), at the end of subclause (2), add "and on the basis of merit".</para><para>(2)	 Clause 20, page 13 (line 3), after "member", insert "except in accordance with a code of practice determined under section 28A and".</para><para>(3)	 Clause 20, page 13 (after line 9), at the end of the clause, add:</para><para>	 (7)	 In making appointments, the Minister must ensure that the balance of interests on the Council is such that no one interest may dominate the Council or derogate from its independence.</para><para>(4)	 Clause 23, page 14 (line 6), at the end of subclause (2), add "and on the basis of merit".</para><para>(5)	 Clause 23, page 14 (line 9), after "member", insert "except in accordance with a code of practice determined under section 28A and".</para><para>(6)	 Clause 23, page 14 (after line 15), at the end of the clause, add:</para><para>	 (7)	 In making appointments, the CEO must ensure that the balance of interests on the Committee is such that no one interest may dominate the Committee or derogate from its independence.</para><para>(7)	 Clause 26, page 15 (line 13), at the end of subclause (2), add "and on the basis of merit".</para><para>(8)	 Clause 26, page 15 (after line 20), after subclause (4), insert:</para><para>	 (4A)	 The CEO must not appoint a person as a member except in accordance with a code of practice determined under section 28A.</para><para>(8)	 Clause 26, page 15 (after line 24), at the end of the clause, add:</para><para>	 (7)	 In making appointments, the CEO must ensure that the balance of interests on the Committee is such that no one interest

Firstly, they provide that a member of the council or committees should not be appointed except in accordance with the code of practice under section 28A, which describes a very complex procedure. Secondly, the amendments require the minister or the CEO to ensure there is a balance of interests on the council and the committees, and that no single interest dominates these bodies. I understand that the Democrats are on a crusade to try to control government appointments from the Senate. The government will not be supporting the Democrats' proposal to establish this complex and unnecessary vetting system.</para><para>The government amendments moved earlier in this debate ensure there will be appropriate consultation before the appointment of any members to the council or committees.

We see it as still very much a part of our mandate, to use that oft bandied around word.

I hardly think that those principles are incredibly challenging for any government. We simply seek to enshrine not only in this legislation but in other legislation these very general and appropriate principles which we believe would be to the benefit of any organisation. If you have a system of appointment on principles of merit, independent scrutiny probity, and openness and transparency, those principles are to the benefit of any organisation.

Clause 31 empowers the Chief Executive Officer of ARPANSA to license a nuclear installation. In order for this to be anything like acceptable to the Greens, there need to be some changes. For indications of community concern about nuclear issues you only have to look at what has come up recently in the public eye and the level of concern that was unleashed by the video last week outlining the plans of a private company, Pangea, to turn Australia into the world's waste dump for high level nuclear waste.</para><para>I saw an article today in the <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline> newspaper regarding Hendy Cowan, the Deputy Premier of Western Australia, who did speak to representatives from Pangea. When I read his words very carefully I realised that they did not actually rule out Australia accepting nuclear waste from other countries' nuclear power stations or imply that he was against that. We are talking about enriched uranium or reactor cores. What he said was that it would be difficult for Australia to accept nuclear waste from countries to which we had not supplied uranium. When you translate that, it means that the Deputy Premier of Western Australia, a National Party Deputy Premier, has said that it would be reasonable—and I am paraphrasing here—for Australia to take nuclear waste from reactors from other countries so long as we have supplied the uranium. That leaves us pretty open. He is saying that if we have exported uranium we should be prepared to accept the nuclear waste.</para><para>So whilst we have had various statements from the federal minister saying what we will not do, when you scratch a little deeper about what has or hasn't been said at the state level, we are not looking at a fantasy scenario; we are hearing in the public arena the Deputy Premier of Western Australia say that nuclear waste would not be acceptable if we have not exported the uranium. How much uranium has Australia supplied over time? What does that potentially mean in terms of sheer volume of high level and medium level nuclear waste, including plutonium, enriched reactor cores and so on? What does that mean in terms of what could happen in the future?</para><para>The community wants some say in regard to scrutiny in the nuclear industry—for example, the existing research reactor at Lucas Heights. We have noticed that the minister never answered that question from Senator Brown about the new technology being researched there. Even in the context of this current bill, how can they have that confidence when we know there is that wave of secrecy over here? There was no advertising in relation to the Senate committee on this bill because it was a short committee. We were able to get a number of people to express concerns.</para><para>The amendments recognise that the community is interested—and has a legitimate interest—when any new installation is being considered. If you do not think the community of Australia is interested, just try any community in Australia and say: `By the way, you are going to make lots and lots of money out of being an international waste dump' and see what happens.</para><para>As the bill stands at the moment, the CEO of ARPANSA can licence a new nuclear installation with a minimum of fuss. This is clearly not sufficient. It is especially not sufficient when you consider that the definition of a nuclear installation includes a number of issues like nuclear reactors, nuclear filled storage facilities and nuclear filled fabrication plants.</para><para>We would like to see the strictest possible licensing and monitoring regime to make sure that it is as safe as it can possibly be. This amendment seeks to put commonsense pre 
 conditions into the legislation so that licensing is not seen as some sort of short circuit, a quick and dirty way of getting nuclear installations authorised. This amendment seeks to ensure that the stages have been gone through before the licensing process starts. It is carefully constructed so that it does not involve the CEO in policy matters about whether there should be this or that installation. It does not involve the CEO at all in any of the matters which should be the subject of public debate. It simply says that the CEO must not issue a licence unless the minister has set up such an inquiry and the need has been demonstrated.</para><para>At that stage, the normal environmental impact assessment process cuts in, and if there is not likely to be a significant adverse environmental impact then the CEO can proceed with the licence process. The effect of this will be to stop the issue of a licence unless the minister has set up an inquiry into the need for the installation. If there is a need, there is an environmental impact assessment, and it is unlikely to have adverse impact. Some of this includes matters which may well be the province of other legislation, especially the Environmental Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974. However, the need for the inquiry is new.</para><para>It should probably go into the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Bill 1998. In the absence of current legislation, the only way to ensure such an inquiry is done is to have it referred as a prerequisite to licensing in the ARPANSA bill. I urge the Senate to support these amendments. I indicate in advance that we will seek to divide on this issue, because quite frankly we do not know where the Senate stands on this issue, and it is important to put it on the record.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>1717</page.no><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name><name.id>656</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The opposition will support amendments Nos 12 and 13 moved by Senator Margetts. We have an amendment on the running sheet which substantially seeks to do the same thing—that is, to ensure that there is a process in this legislation whereby any  decision to construct a major nuclear installation would be the subject of a public inquiry or an independent inquiry.</para></talk.start><para>In our amendment we proposed that the Chief Executive Officer of ARPANSA would not be permitted to issue a licence pursuant to this section unless, firstly, the CEO had obtained from the minister a certificate in the minister's opinion having regard to the objects of the act that there was a need for the nuclear installation and, further, such certificate must not be issued unless there was either an independent inquiry or a public inquiry pursuant to section 11 of the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act. Senator Margetts has put forward a proposition which certainly has the same intended result but which is in a different form. Whilst there are some subtle differences between the two, the end result is the same as that which we have been seeking to achieve.</para><para>The need for this is self-evident. Anybody who understands what is happening within the nuclear industry in this country today recognises that the government has made a decision to build a new nuclear reactor at Lucas Heights to replace the current HIFAR reactor due to be decommissioned in about 2003. The government has made that decision without any proper consideration of the views of the scientific community, the medical community or the wider community, particularly the community of the surrounding areas of the Sutherland shire.</para><para>I appreciate that there is a major debate as to whether or not Australia needs another nuclear research reactor. The Labor Party has made it clear that that is a matter still to be properly resolved. There are arguments for and against the proposition. For instance, it is argued that we should have another reactor to replace HIFAR; that the best place and the cheapest place to put it is where the current reactor is; that it has a value with respect to the manufacture of medical radio isotopes; and that it is in Australia's national interest. That is a very brief potted summary of those who support the proposition.</para><para>There are some within ANSTO, I would suggest, who support the proposition simply because it means that ANSTO as an organisation will continue in perpetuity into the future. It guarantees they have another reactor to operate and, consequently, a large injection 
 well in excess of $400 million or $500 million of public funding over the next 40 years. The argument that we should have one because we already have one is one that some people support, notwithstanding what the merits of the case might be.</para><para>There are arguments from people within the local community who believe that, if we are going to have another nuclear reactor in this country, it should be located well away from any suburban residential area. The area around Lucas Heights is not the same as it was 40 years ago, when the establishment was built. It is no longer remote bushland some reasonable distance or long distance away from the city of Sydney. It is within about three to four kilometres of a thriving, growing part of the Sydney metropolitan region, with a population in excess of 150,000. If there was not a nuclear reactor at Lucas Heights today, no government in its right mind would contemplate putting one in that location. The fact that there is already one there is not of itself a reason why it is the best site for a reactor in the future.</para><para>I wanted to particularly address my remarks to the issue of why we need a public inquiry process. The 1993 Research Reactor Review, the McKinnon review, which I have referred to earlier in this debate, concluded that there were a range of issues that should be resolved before any positive decision for the new reactor was made. I quote from the conclusions of the report. It said:</para><para>If, at the end of a further period of about five years,</para><para>. a high level waste site has been firmly identified and work started on proving its suitability</para><para>. there is no evidence that spallation technology can economically offer as much as or more than a new reactor</para><para>. there has been no practical initiation of a cyclotron anywhere worldwide to produce technetium-99m</para><para>. there is good evidence of strong and diverse applications of neutron scattering capability in Australian science, including many young scientists, and a complex of industrial uses</para><para>. the national interest remains a high priority</para><para>it would be appropriate to make a positive decision on a new reactor. The most suitable site would need to be identified. 
</para><para>If any one of these onerous requirements is not met, either a negative decision, or a decision to delay further, would be indicated.</para><para>That was the report of the Research Reactor Review issued in August 1993. What that report said was that, if any of those very onerous conditions were not met within five years—it is appropriately just on five years since that report was handed down—a decision should not be made to build a new reactor or, at the very least, it should be delayed. But this government ignored the recommendations and conclusions of the McKinnon review. It made a decision to build a new reactor at Lucas Heights. In one of the most cynical political exercises I have ever witnessed, it announced that decision on the very day that it announced to the community of the Sutherland Shire and southern Sydney that it was not going to build the proposed airport at Holsworthy. It was a bit of good news, bad news. As I said, it was a highly cynical approach.</para><para>Efforts to obtain information from this government as to what alternative sites were being considered by the government have been refused on the grounds of cabinet confidentiality. There has been no proper assessment made, as Professor McKinnon called for in his report, about the value of alternative technologies such as spallation technology. There has certainly been no decision made about the suitability of any site to take high level waste.</para><para>The report recognises, despite what ANSTO might say and despite what the government might say, that there is high level waste stored at Lucas Heights. Recent proposals by the government to ship that waste overseas have come to nought because of decisions made in Dounreay in Scotland that they are not prepared to take that waste. So there is clearly a major gap to be filled in terms of what is ultimately going to be the approach adopted in dealing with the waste currently stored at Lucas Heights.</para><para>Frankly, the position we have is that this government has proceeded to make decisions contrary to the recommendations of that very thorough inquiry and has done it in a most cynical way with minimal consultation with 
 local government bodies in the area and the community generally. It is a major decision to build another nuclear reactor in this country. Whatever one's view—whether one supports it or does not—it is appropriate that it be subject to the most vigorous scrutiny, and not just by an environmental impact statement.</para><para>Frankly, most people have absolutely no faith in environmental impact statements anymore. We all know that about 99 per cent of proposals subject to an EIS eventually get approved. People have very little faith in the process that has been undertaken for the EIS to this point in time. It has been subject to very severe criticism by the Sutherland Shire Council and internationally recognised consultants they have engaged. It has been subject to severe criticism by Environment Australia itself.</para><para>For instance, there is no design for the new reactor even on the table at the present time. So one wonders how an EIS could be properly conducted. But, in any event, there still needs to be a proper public inquiry before any such decision is made. We believe that such a major issue involving the expenditure of $500 million or more which commits this nation and particularly that area to the existence of another reactor for the next 40 years, on top of the decommissioning of the existing reactors, is such a serious issue that it should be considered by a public inquiry.</para><para>These things do not come along every day of the week. That is what the provisions of the Environment Protection Act are specifically there for—that is, section 11 for the conduct of public inquiries. I am advised that there have only been some four inquiries conducted under that act since it was enacted. At least two of those related to most serious issues. The very first one was the Ranger inquiry conducted by Justice Fox, known as the Fox inquiry. The second one was the inquiry into sandmining on Fraser Island. Both of those are major issues of environmental significance, public health and safety significance and so on. We believe this is a similar case.</para><para>The issue has been raised as to the potential for major waste reprocessing facilities. We are 
 very disappointed with the attitude the government adopted in respect of an earlier amendment. We support very strongly the proposals contained in the Greens (WA) amendments. As I said, they reflect the intention of our amendment; that is, before any major nuclear installation, such as a new reactor at Lucas Heights or any others that may be contemplated—we hope they will not be—it should be subject to the most thorough scrutiny, including provisions for a public inquiry. We support the amendments.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>1720</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On behalf of the Democrats, I support the amendments moved by the Greens (WA).

The Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act still applies, and it can be expected that any substantial proposal would invoke the procedures under this act. Further, as was the case with the proposed replacement research reactor at Lucas Heights, substantial proposals for nuclear facilities will be assessed over a period of time in ways in which the government of the day considers appropriate. Second, it is clear that the real purpose of these amendments, and those proposed by the ALP, is to delay the replacement research reactor project.</para><para>Whilst I noted Senator Forshaw's comments—and I know his particular personal residential interest and genuine interest as a New South Wales senator—it is also important to note the comments of the then Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Gareth Evans, on 11 May 1998 when, in correspondence, he said, on the new reactor: </para><para>I am afraid that the realities of politics in an election year, and in particular our need to win Hughes, have led us to a position of opposing a new reactor at the Lucas Heights site—as difficult that may be to justify in objective safety-focused terms.</para><para>I also note the degree of cynicism in many of Senator Forshaw's comments. This project has been assessed exhaustively, including through the Australian Science and Technology Engineering Council inquiry in 1992, the McKinnon report into the need for a replacement reactor in 1993, the current environmental impact statement and the current Senate Economic References Committee inquiry. The government absolutely refuses to implement a further resource intensive, wasteful process, which is nothing more than an underhand attempt by opposition parties to further delay key government initiatives.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>1720</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I do not wish to delay this

How dare we point at India and Pakistan and say, `Your argument that you want to be considered part of the international community is irrelevant.'

I am just wondering whether it leaves the door open legally—not whether or not the government has a particular policy at this stage because, as Senator Margetts has stated, that can be changed pretty much at the whim of government.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>1723</page.no><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name><name.id>656</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I indicate on behalf of the opposition that we support Senator Stott Despoja's amendments.

I have some questions about them, as I have questions about the public health system, but I am not ideologically opposed to the dual system, provided it is fair and properly run. I am becoming less confident in the funds as a result of their inane campaign which was run recently. I am less confident in their capabilities. But, because it is usual to do so, I need to declare that I am a member of a health fund and have been for 40 years. I understand how people feel when they are struggling on a very insufficient income to try to keep up the payments—even then it was difficult.</para></talk.start><para>Let me come to the package of legislation itself. The rebate proposal does not go far enough to meet sound public policy requirements. There is no evidence by any modelling that has been presented to us that that proposed rebate will work and achieve the objectives of the government; in other words, there are no guarantees that it will work. There are no guarantees that premiums will not rise—in fact, we have heard that premiums will rise next year. There are no guarantees that the rebate will not get gobbled up in the payment of extra costs created by specialist doctors, operating on private patients in private or, indeed, in public hospitals.</para><para>There are no guarantees about anything, except that 70 per cent of the taxpayers of Australia will contribute to delivering an amount of $5.4 billion to assist the other 30 per cent of the population who are privately insured—though I suppose 100 per cent, if you like, will do that, rather than the 70 per cent. There are no guarantees that the 30 per cent rebate will result in the eradication of extra medical fees beyond the insured costs—those medical out-of-pocket expenses which are very much the concern of fund members.</para><para>Honourable senators will know from their own experience that the two major complaints of fund members are the ever increasing premiums and the extra charges in costs they are hit with once, after having been in hospital, they get home. Once they get home, in 
 come the bills, one after the other; it also might be that even three or four months later a bill comes in. Multiple medical fees not only are aggravating but also leave many patients with onerous bills.</para><para>This legislation does nothing to address this problem. Many of the elderly who are treated in private hospitals could be cared for in other more suitable settings, such as convalescence and rehabilitation services. The coordination of better health care services should be associated with a measure like the one that is before us today, the rebate. Then health insurance could be more user friendly, particularly for the elderly and chronically ill.</para><para>There are no guarantees that health funds will not continue to raise their premiums after the introduction of this package of legislation containing this rebate. This begs the question of whether the rebate is in the interests of the members or administration of the funds. The government has not been able to encourage health funds and doctors to strike effective arrangements to eliminate out-of-pocket fees and set premiums. There are some examples of where this has been achieved, and honourable senators during debate have been informed of those by various government senators—and I acknowledge that.</para><para>The government maintains that the rebate will help reduce public hospital waiting lists; yet there is no guarantee that this will occur. In fact, there is no guarantee that privately insured patients will not enter public hospitals; they have that right. And I guess that, if nothing is done about the gap, there will be more and more privately insured people—that is, members of health funds—going into public hospitals so as to avoid those out-of-pocket expenses. At the same time low income elderly people who cannot afford insurance are resigned to waiting on public hospital lists for treatment. The government should seriously consider instigating a special program to meet these needs.</para><para>Madam Acting Deputy President, I must say that I stand before you in a somewhat difficult situation. The speech I have given thus far was going to come to certain conclusions which perhaps do not reflect discussions that have taken place today. I point out again that 
 the government—and I have indicated this previously—should seriously consider instigating a special program to meet the needs of low income elderly people who cannot afford insurance, including their need to have quicker access to hospital and other health services. It is conceivable that such a program, conducted along with a rebate scheme, could reduce public hospital demand and better meet the needs of the elderly in particular.</para><para>The government should consider some way to ensure that health funds move towards the elimination of gaps. I will move an amendment, which is currently being drafted, to go some way towards that particular objective—and I apologise to honourable senators that that is not as yet ready to be distributed. It is a simple amendment that will give an incentive to health insurance funds to come to agreements with hospitals and doctors for that purpose.</para><para>There should be an attempt to address the burden of unknown medical fees, so the proposal I am going to present to the Senate will include the not known aspect. For many patients, procedures are performed on them not knowing what the gap is, not knowing that it will cost far more than what Medicare provides or what their health insurance funds provide.</para><para>I must say that we are extremely fortunate that Australia is blessed with a highly qualified and dedicated medical profession. I appreciate that private health care has developed under a fee-for-service system. I also appreciate the value of the doctor-patient relationship and its intimate role in quality health care. However, it is incumbent upon the medical profession to understand that the lack of attractiveness of health insurance also rests with some of their number charging unreasonable fees.</para><para>I understand that there are no easy answers to these problems. However, the solution proposed by the government in this legislation does not go far enough—it needs to go further. A 30 per cent rebate for the purchase of health insurance has merit if it is associated with other tangible measures which will alleviate the demand on public hospitals, do something practicable for the health of the 
 elderly and lead to the elimination of out-of-pocket expenses, out-of-pocket fees.</para><para>I have concerns that the elderly, particularly the chronically ill, need a better coordination of their services, and their complex needs must have greater attention from our general practitioners. I am particularly concerned that low income, uninsured elderly people have little choice but to wait on the public sector lists for urgent care. We need to do more to ensure access for them to services in both hospitals and convalescent home care.</para><para>I am particularly perturbed by the lack of progress on out-of-pocket expenses and believe a more concerted effort by government and the private health sector is needed. The rebate proposals need to be advanced only if real reforms on these other measures are actively progressed. I do hope that, during the course of this debate, there will be an indication by the government of precisely that. At this stage, I am prepared to support the bill into the committee stage.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>1728</page.no><name role="metadata">Tambling, Sen Grant</name><name role="display">Senator TAMBLING</name><name.id>6E4</name.id><electorate>NT</electorate><party>CLP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—At the outset, let me declare a personal interest of 37 years of holding private health insurance. At the same time, let me also reflect on the last 10 months. As many of my colleagues in this place will know, I had heart surgery in August and that required extensive financial support and obligation from many people, and I appreciate their assistance. There were eight specialists, two GPs, many pathologists, X-Rays, echocardiograms, angiograms, et cetera. But in financial terms, at the end of the day, my 10 months has cost $30,378. It is very important to note that the health insurance contribution to that was $21,284; Medicare, $7,135; and the gap, to which Senator Harradine has just referred, $1,959. In all, some 134 services were rendered to me in the course of this year, and it is very important to note that principal of $21,284 met by my private health insurers that otherwise would have been met by the public purse, and without the degree of choice that I did enjoy under the circumstances I had.</para></talk.start><para>The government is committed to maintaining a balance between public and private 
 sector health so that Australians have a choice when it comes to health care that is fair, affordable, customer-friendly and good value for money. The  Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 1998  and related bills allow for all members of private health funds to be eligible for a rebate of 30 per cent of the cost of their health insurance contributions. For example, a family with an annual health insurance contribution of $2,000 will be  entitled to a rebate of $600. This policy was taken to the recent election by the Howard government and roundly endorsed.</para><para>It is ironic that, after two decades of seeking to keep the bastards honest, the Australian Democrats are now seeking to prevent the government from honouring this commitment. They have lost their perspective of what honesty is all about and have become captives of political bastardry themselves. It is also ironic to see the Australian Labor Party carping on about gaps and billing for private health insurance, after spending 13 years doing nothing. Talk about political hypocrisy. The ALP have shown their hand as nothing but poker card players.</para><para>The Australian Private Hospital Association has said that without private hospitals the public system would have to treat an extra 1.8 million patients per year, perform twice as much surgery as now, provide 23,000 more beds and require $3.5 billion extra funding every year. If private health insurance participation declines further, the public system will have to provide more and more of the services and care that the private sector is providing. The ALP and the Democrats have conspired to wipe out that great Australian value of individual choice from the people they purport to represent.</para><para>The current trend shows that private health insurance will decline to around 20 per cent by the end of the current Australian health care agreement. This dreadful scenario would cost the government an additional $2.5 billion over the life of these agreements. Even more damaging to the bottom line is the fact that the base for the new agreements would be $5 billion more than the current agreements.</para><para>The alternative being offered by the coalition is to support choice, support quality care 
 and support private health care to continue the balanced health system that has served Australia so well. It is important that we note the issues that have been raised in this debate, particularly those that have been raised this evening by Senator Harradine. The government has undeniably done more to reduce the incidence of medical gap fees than any other government. I know that Minister Wooldridge is currently embarked on a major campaign with a number of issues to advance that important area.</para><para>Senator Crossin got it very wrong the other evening about the Northern Territory. She did not focus on the impact of this legislation on people who live in rural and remote parts of Australia. This is one of the most important tenets of this legislation. There is so much that needs to be offered for all of these people to get the balance right. People who come from rural and remote areas often need access to special services, not in their own area but in other areas. They need the reimbursement that private health insurance can offer to so many of them. And those people living in the bush are not rich.</para><para>The constitution of Australia prohibits any government's control of doctors' fees. However, through encouraging negotiation and partnerships between doctors and hospitals and health funds we have produced the first successes ever achieved in this area, for which Dr Wooldridge can take the credit. Legislation has been introduced to allow health funds, hospitals and doctors to negotiate over the entire medical fee, including any charges above the medical benefits schedule. The promotion of simplified billing has been a major lever in changing the culture of doctors, who are now recognising the importance of providing a better service to their patients. Labor did nothing during their 13 years to address the gaps. We certainly have, and some of the initiatives proposed by Senator Harradine tonight will go a long way in that regard.</para><para>I acknowledge that more needs to be done. We will continue to work hard to promote these issues, despite the moaning and the carping of those opposite. In summary, these bills provide for sensible incentives to com 
 plement recent and upcoming structural reform. The government's 30 per cent rebate makes sense economically, supports the choice that is one of the strengths of the great Australian health system and is expected by the Australian electorate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:25:00</time.stamp><page.no>1730</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I seek leave to make a brief statement on the interests of certain senators in relation to this legislation.</para></talk.start><para>Leave granted.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name></talker><para>—I thank the Senate.

In that answer he said:</para></talk.start></continue><para>I noticed on Monday an article written by Senator Cook, the opposition spokesman on trade, who argued that at the APEC meeting, APEC—and, indeed, the Australian government, in encouraging APEC—made a mistake by concentrating on economic issues and should have more narrowly focused the whole meeting on trade alone.</para><para>I did not say the words that the foreign minister has said I said, and I claim to be misrepresented by that statement and the conclusions Mr Downer then proceeded to draw from this false premise.</para><para>On Monday, 7 December the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> published an article by me on its opinion-editorial page headlined `Trade issues in hibernation'. The editors made it clear that I was the author and the shadow minister for trade. The relevant passages in the article state:</para><para>Inexplicably, just days before the KL summit the Prime Minister announced Australia was going to switch its approach from trade to economic issues. Why? Isn't trade a central economic issue? Or do we believe trade liberalisation is something to flirt with only in the economic good times?</para><para>This is peculiar thinking. Surely what we are on about is encouraging an economic renaissance in Asia. Opening markets and liberalising trade will help achieve that. 
</para><para>It is clear from these remarks that I was not arguing, as Mr Downer has said, that Australia should concentrate narrowly on trade issues to the exclusion of economic issues, but in fact by concentrating on trade issues the economic issues would be more readily resolved. It is facile and untrue to propose that the Labor Party has not even noticed the Asian economic crisis, when my trade remarks were clearly discussing how best to deal with it.</para><para>APEC is pre-eminently a trade forum with an agenda, a timetable, for trade equalisation. Therefore, it is remarkable indeed that these issues could have been shunted aside in the interests of discussion about economics and in some way to obviate the need to address the tough and complex trade issues. Mr Downer claims all this demonstrates a lack of intellectual rigour. It does but not on behalf of the Labor Party and me; it does on behalf of Mr Downer and the government.</para></speech></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1998</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>1732</page.no><id.no>r640</id.no><cognate><cognateinfo><title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>r639</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate><cognate><cognateinfo><title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT (PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE) BILL 1998</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>r638</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>In Committee</title><page.no>1732</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Consideration resumed.</para><para>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES AMENDMENT BILL 1998</para><para>The bill.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>1732</page.no><name role="metadata">Lees, Sen Meg</name><name role="display">Senator LEES</name><name.id>8U4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I move Democrat amendments Nos 1, 2 and 4:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	 Page 6 (after line 11), after clause 4-5, insert:</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">4-6 Income test, policies covering only one person</inline></para><para>	 (1)	 If the policy covers only one person, the income test is satisfied in respect of the financial year in question if the sum of the taxable incomes of all of the persons whose incomes are required by subsection (2) to be taken into account is less than

By means testing this in this way would mean that roughly half of this extraordinary amount of money, about $1½ billion a year on average, would be able to be directed into the public system. At least if we could not make the government put it into the public system, we would actually make a reasonable saving so that hopefully, when it came to budget time, their consciences would dictate that that money be directed into things such as the dental health program, rural health and public hospital waiting lists.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>1734</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to make a contribution at the beginning of the committee stage of this debate about the way the committee stage is to be handled.

It is not as if Senator Herron has an awful lot of work to do. It is not as if he has got an enormous ministerial load. This is the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs who has not had responsibility for the issue of stolen children, who has not had responsibility for the native title debate, who now does not have responsibility for the issue of reconciliation, because that is now, as a result of the new ministerial arrangements, in the hands of Mr Ruddock, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. This is the minister who cannot come in at the committee stage of this debate and deal with this issue on which he has been the spokesperson in this chamber.</para><para>Regardless of any other commitments that he might have, the truth of the matter is that this is a very important piece of legislation, the responsibility of the minister representing the Minister for Health and Aged Care, and Senator Herron does not have the capacity to 
 deal with the detail of this legislation or the focus that is required of a minister during a committee stage debate. And, as far as the opposition is concerned, it is absolutely unacceptable, for a committee stage debate on legislation that the government believes is as important as this, that the minister representing the minister for health in this chamber cannot front up to the Senate and handle the committee stage debate on behalf of the government.</para><para>That says it all. It is not just that he cannot handle himself during question time on the range of issues on which he has had questions asked of him not only by opposition senators but also by minor party senators and Senator Harradine, it is not just that he cannot go the hard yards in question time, but that, here in this important and crucial committee stage debate, Senator Herron is missing in action. The point I want to make is that that is not good enough. We have had Senator Herron plead for the representational responsibilities that were previously handled by Senator Newman, whose approach always on these issues was to say, `I don't know anything about it. I will just refer it to the minister in the other chamber.' Senator Herron's approach is to say the first thing that comes into his head, and it is normally nonsense. It is normally incoherent psychobabble.</para><para>I think it is important that the record shows that in this committee stage debate, which the government claims is of such significance on such an important issue, the minister representing the minister for health cannot front up after lecturing senators, the parliament and the people of Australia day in and day out during the parliamentary sittings since the election. He cannot be bothered or is not interested enough to come in and handle this committee stage debate in the parliament.</para><para>Senator Tambling, as the parliamentary secretary, is doing this job and, obviously, he is struggling with the detail. I do not expect Senator Tambling to have the same level of familiarity with this particular issue. No reasonable person would expect Senator Tambling to be able to take over this responsibility in the chamber at short notice and handle the debate when, of course, you have 
 got the minister representing the minister for health squibbing it.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>—Senator, please do not reflect upon ministers.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name></talker><para>—I think we have had enough of lectures from Senator Herron, the sort of flaky performances that we have seen from him in question time today and over the last few weeks.

The attitude of the opposition is that if  Senator Herron wants to get up day in and day out and lecture us on how important this bill is—and there is no doubt he has done that in the past—he really should be here to handle it. I am pleased Senator Faulkner put it in such a way as not to reflect on Senator Tambling. What is Senator Tambling's position? He is a parliamentary secretary, who does not get 1c more for all the work he does, and he does a lot of work. He gets one medium-level adviser and one receptionist and, if he is lucky, he might get a DLO.</para></talk.start><para>Meanwhile, we have another minister working in his second job as Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, getting $50,000, about seven staff and about 100,000 platitudes and cliches a year, yet he is not here to handle this bill—the only bill that he will probably have of any complexity or of any importance between now and when he gets appointed High Commissioner to London or to wherever he is heading off.</para><para>This is starting to become a bit of a pattern. I do not mind the fact that parliamentary secretaries are used as workhorses. But, really, they are not the front-line troops; they are the reserves, they fill in the gaps, and you should not expect them to take on the responsibility of shepherding through very complex 
 legislation, given the poor resource base and the lack of remuneration. What parliamentary secretaries are getting is all responsibility and nothing else.</para><para>It is true that some people may see the taking of a parliamentary secretaryship as a way up the greasy pole—that is, you do your apprenticeship as a parliamentary secretary and you might eventually be promoted into the role of minister and eventually to cabinet. I think that is true to a point. I am not going to point to anyone that disproves it because there are always hurtful examples on any side of the chamber at any particular point in time.</para><para>When it comes to crucial legislation—and I suppose the coalition would put this as one of its four or five centrepiece pieces of legislation in its three-year term; no doubt the GST would be their key one, but I would have thought this one would be in the top five of the remaining ones—we do not have Senator Herron here today. Why don't we? He may have a genuine excuse for not being here today, but, if he did not, I suspect he still would not be allocated the handling of these bills. You have got a minister who the Prime Minister picked, frankly, because he was a friend and he liked the look of him. That is basically why he was made a minister, the same as Mrs Moylan was in Western Australia.

 here to put it through. It is no reflection on Senator Tambling. In fact, I think he will do a much better job of handling this.

However, the initial comments were with regard to the first amendment. The critical issue that the senator is raising in these amendments is that the government's private health insurance rebate should be means tested. I have no doubt that this rebate is the most equitable way to encourage people who can afford to take out private health insurance and to reward those who already have it. I completely reject the proposal by the Democrats that the rebate should be means tested. The government will not be 
 doing any deals to compromise the integrity of this policy.</para></talk.start><para>Australia's private health insurance system complements our universal health care system and funds around 80 per cent of all private hospital care. It is entirely reasonable for those people who choose to fund part of their own private care to get back part of the funding from the public system they would otherwise draw on. The rebate is in essence a tax concession designed to reflect the extra cost burden borne by people across all income levels for private health insurance which is not carried by others who rely solely on the public system.</para><para>The government decided not to means test the rebate for several reasons. Firstly, the universal nature of the rebate reflects the universal nature of Medicare. Every taxpayer pays the Medicare levy whether or not the taxpayer uses it. It is only fair that every taxpayer who chooses to pay extra for private health insurance is entitled to the rebate.</para><para>Secondly, means testing the rebate would have an adverse impact on increasing private health insurance membership—the government's main objective in offering the rebate. The largest falls in health insurance participation rates have been in the middle to high income bracket and these people are generally lower risk members who are essential to balancing the cost of sicker members and helping control the escalating costs of premiums. The limited success of the current Private Health Insurance Incentives Scheme illustrates the likely effect means testing would have on the success of the 30 per cent rebate.</para><para>Thirdly, the universality of the rebate recognises that, for some people, private health insurance is the only way they can be assured of a reasonable level of choice. For example, in rural communities, although publicly funded services are available, private health insurance provides a wider range of health care choices, especially if their condition requires transfer to a metropolitan facility. I certainly referred to that when I talked about my own personal health experience this year. I am not trying to transpose myself as someone special. I appreciate that there are 
 many other people in lower income levels than me who would similarly draw on that area.</para><para>The government supports people's right to choose between Medicare and private health care services. It is essential that people making the choice to choose private health care are treated equally, just as Medicare users are.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>1737</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is a good opportunity with the parliamentary secretary referring to his own experience earlier this year—and I say thank goodness he is looking so healthy—to ask if he can tell us, in regard to the $30,000 or so expenditure that was required for that heart operation procedure, what the cost would have been in the public health system. If I remember correctly, the parliamentary secretary Senator Tambling said in his case some $21,000 was covered by insurance, $7,000 or so was covered by Medicare and the rest was out of pocket. That gives a very clear measure of the costs of this procedure with private insurance available. I would like to know what would have been the cost had the same procedure been undertaken in the public health arena and whether it would have been as readily and quickly available?</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>1737</page.no><name role="metadata">Tambling, Sen Grant</name><name role="display">Senator TAMBLING</name><name.id>6E4</name.id><electorate>NT</electorate><party>CLP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I can only reflect on my personal experience in this area. As I said, that $21,000 that was contributed by my personal health insurance certainly reflected the extra costs of a number of specialists. It was largely the component of the health provisions at the private hospital of my choice and included all of the special facilities that were made available, such as intensive care and specialist treatment.</para></talk.start><para>If I had not elected to have that surgery in Sydney, then I would have had to have been evacuated from the Northern Territory to Adelaide into the system where the cost would then have been borne by taxpayers. I assume it would have been at a similar cost factoring, but it certainly would have cost substantially more because of the extra requirements that would have had to have been imposed on the government for that provision, particularly with regard to the transport costs. 
 Again, I would not have had the choice of specialists—some eight of them—who were required to administer to me. I would have had no choice in that regard. I would have naturally been a public patient in Adelaide.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>1738</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This is a very important point. If I can remove it from the personal arena, I would like to get from the government what the actual costs would have been both for the medical procedures involved—all of them—and separately for the transport because that is another matter. When it comes to people who do not have the income level that we senators have, such things as availability of air transport become much more problematic. Access to the diagnostic services of specialists themselves also becomes much more problematic.</para></talk.start><para> There is great concern in the community that, if you join an insurance scheme, the price of the procedure goes up. At all levels there is a premium that is taken by the private system which makes it much less attractive for people to take out insurance. That is one of the major factors why we are seeing the tumbling participation rate in private health insurance.</para><para> What I would like the government to do—if you cannot do it now, I would like an assurance that the work can be done on this—is to give a cost comparison for a very expensive medical procedure (one that has been very successful, very important and, I daresay, lifesaving) as against what it would have cost in the public health system. It is important that we get a measure on these things so that we see the premium, the mark-up, that occurs once you move across into the private system.</para><para>If the government has figures to show what the premium is for the delivery of a private health service—we are talking about legislation which is going to put billions of dollars over the years into supporting that health service and therefore that premium—I think the public needs to know the facts of the matter. Here is a very good example that, due to the grace of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Aged Care, we have before the committee. It will serve the purpose of this exercise—seeing what the difference is between the costs in the public 
 arena and the costs once you take out insurance and move into the private health arena.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>1738</page.no><name role="metadata">Tambling, Sen Grant</name><name role="display">Senator TAMBLING</name><name.id>6E4</name.id><electorate>NT</electorate><party>CLP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The important issue to be addressed here is the particular matter in the legislation before us, and I would draw all senators' attention back to that.

A very significant part of your health care cost was borne by the public sector. That needs to be clearly put on the table.</para></talk.start><para> I rise to ask not about your health but about this matter in general. As a doctor myself, I have long since learnt that you never ask or never talk about other people's health in the public arena. If you wish to talk about your own, that is fine. I do not know what operation you had—and I do not want to know—or what procedures you had. I would like to talk about this in the general.</para><para>In the course of my second reading contribution, I said that I would like to know what is the state of play of casemix. Is the department still working in the area of casemix? Can the department say what happened to casemix, if you are not continuing with it? It was understood that an effort was being made to try to put a cost on a surgical procedure or a procedure, and therefore you would be able to say that this cost should be more or less the same in the public or the private sector.</para><para>It is curious to me that any surgical procedure, any operation—according to much of the evidence of people who have to pay the gap—costs more in the private sector when the private sector does not have anything like 
 the add-on costs that the public sector has. If there were to be a case for a more costly procedure, it ought to be in the public sector where our large public hospitals carry the burden—happily—of educating our doctors, educating our nurses, educating our pathologists and educating all sorts of health professionals. Very often they carry the burden of providing ancillary costs such as pathology in times past and morgues—whatever else was necessary for an adequate and thorough delivery of comprehensive health care.</para><para>What people were trying to do in casemix, as I understand it, was to factor out those extra costs from the cost of the procedure so that we could have a more accurate understanding of the comparison between procedures in one sector and another. I ask the parliamentary secretary for an answer on what is the state of play of that kind of study.

It just further adds to our argument that we should not be dealing with this partially blindfolded, which is what the government wants.</para></talk.start><para>I return to some comments Senator Tambling made about how we have to have this because we have to acknowledge that all Australians, if they are earning, pay taxes and Medicare. I want to pick up on the point that Senator Crowley just made. A lot of the costs were covered by Medicare. A lot of the costs that someone who goes into the private 
 system has are covered by Medicare. People need Medicare to go to their GPs. They tap into the public system when they get a prescription or have radiology or pathology tests. The issue is that you do not get  anything back at the moment for the bed. That is the way in which I believe, if we want to support private hospitals—and we certainly should be—we can support them. It would cost a fraction of this measure.</para><para>If the right checks and balances are put in place, we might tackle some of the other difficulties we have in the private sector. At the moment, there are no cost controls there. This is the battle the Labor Party fought when it brought in the contracting system, which fell into a hole because doctors said, `How dare you interfere with the doctor-patient relationship.' They wanted to charge what they liked. We had no right to know what they were charging.</para><para>I stress here and acknowledge that we are only talking about a minority of doctors. But the problem for the pensioners is knowing which doctor will come out of the hat and how much they are eventually going to end up with. Certainly speaking for doctors in my home state, I congratulate particularly those working at places such as Ashford in the private system, who seem to be able to manage with the Medicare rebate and the schedule fee. People do not get gap payments with them. However, you only have to go through our mail and the calls we get to know that, unfortunately, there are a lot of different doctors out there. I had better not mention particular specialties here tonight.</para><para>It is highly relevant to this bill that we have no cost controls on the private system. This money could simply be going to further feed those doctors who want to charge more. They know now that their patients are getting money back for their private health insurance. So I argue that some of the constraints that may have been there may be lifted. Again, it is a minority of doctors, but they give the private system an incredibly bad name. They are ones that the private hospitals do not have any control over. The funds also do not have any control over them.</para><para>I understand what Senator Harradine is trying to do. However, this is where the second part of his amendments fall down. If we are going tonight to put in restrictions on gaps and make the funds pay them, all the doctors will do for some of them is charge the absolute earth. I imagine that it will drive premiums up—I will ask these questions later—between seven and 10 per cent to be able to guarantee that there are no gaps. Tonight we are giving a 30 per cent rebate. We will see these funds increase their charges by eight or so per cent next year. Add on 10 per cent for the gaps. Where are we then? We are almost back to square one, and we could put $1.5 billion into the public system.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>1740</page.no><name role="metadata">Crowley, Sen Rosemary</name><name role="display">Senator CROWLEY</name><name.id>ZF4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank Senator Lees for her comments, which I think make my case very nicely.

 more regularly than they are in the public system. One example is caesarean delivery. Women who go into the public system have a quite small chance of having a caesarean compared with women who end up in a private hospital. Rather than there being any overservicing in the private system, there may be underservicing in the public system. So, whichever is true, we need some answers. I put on notice this question for the minister: what have you done to actually look at the level of servicing in the private system?

As we know, one of the reasons that there is considerable strain on our public hospital system is that so many private patients are having their procedures done as private patients in a public hospital. Indeed, very often it is as a public patient in a public hospital.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>AX5</name.id><name role="metadata">EVANS</name><name role="display">Senator Chris Evans</name></talker><para>—As is their right.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Crowley, Sen Rosemary</name><name role="display">Senator CROWLEY</name></talker><para>—Indeed.

They will be subsidising his taxation by about $800 a year because he will be paying less tax because he is in private health insurance. He will be $800 better off and we will be contributing $800 for a rebate for Senator Tambling's health insurance, or something of that order, because we will be paying 30 per cent off his private health insurance. For someone who is on a salary of $80,000 per year, I think that is a national disgrace.</para></talk.start><para>I do not think people earning $20,000 or $30,000 a year ought to have to subsidise 
 Senator Tambling's private health insurance. He talks about choice and I agree with him that he has the choice to take it out but we have the choice not to pay for it for him. That is what this debate is about. It is about who pays for Senator Tambling's health insurance and who pays for John Howard's health insurance. I am happy for them to have health insurance but they should pay for it themselves. The taxpayers of Australia should not pay for their health insurance. They have the means and the wherewithal to make that decision and pay for it themselves.</para><para>The bill tonight says, `All of you out there in Australia who pay taxes, whether you are on $18,000, $25,000, $30,0000 or $40,000 a year, have kids and are struggling, your taxes will go into a pool so $1.5 billion can be paid to prop up the private health insurance of people who choose to take it out.' We are not talking about the money going in to prop up the private health insurance of the battlers; $900 million of this goes to people earning over $70,000 a year. The vast bulk of it goes to the top end of town. It goes to the Senator Tamblings and John Howards of Australia. This is a disgrace. The government will learn to regret this decision because it is inequitable. It is unfair.</para><para>Every time someone on a waiting list at a public hospital rings you up and says, `I can't get into hospital—why?' tell them it is because the money is paying Senator Tambling's private health insurance instead. That is why. That $1 billion plus that could end waiting lists in this country and that could mean that nobody waits in pain to go into hospital for an operation could be used so they would not have to wait, so they would get their operation in the public hospital and they would not be in pain. It could be used so pensioners who cannot eat because their teeth are broken could get their teeth fixed. But no, what are we saying tonight? We are saying the priority of the parliament of this country in health care is to subsidise Senator Tambling's and Mr Howard's private health insurance so they can pay less for their private health insurance. That is what this is about. It is a priority.</para><para>Whether we choose to spend $1.5 billion on this or on something else is the conscious choice of this parliament. We decide tonight whether this is a good use of $1.5 billion. I say it is not a good use and, when the 70 per cent of Australians who are not in private health insurance understand what this means—understand what it means for public health, understand what it means for waiting lists, understand what it means for nurses' wages, understand what it means for services in public hospitals—they will turn on this government.</para><para>Also, the 30 per cent who pay will begin to realise. The government has been very clever at trying to convince the 30 per cent who are in private health insurance that this is all about them, but they have to understand that for the vast majority of them this is a very marginal increase. The current scheme provides them with up to $450. Most of them will get, at best, around $600 to $700 out of this. It is a marginal increase. This money is going to the top end of town. That is what this is about. The government says we have to get the young rich people back into the scheme. That may be right, but do we have to pay to get them back in?</para><para>On John Howard's salary of $200,000 a year, he gets a tax discount of $2,000 because he does not pay the one per cent surcharge. So he pays $2,000 less tax than he otherwise would and we are also going to throw in $700 to $800 worth of rebate. So we are going to pay $2,800 to $2,900 of public subsidy so John Howard can take out $3,000 worth of health insurance. We are going to pay 95 per cent of John Howard's and Senator Tambling's health insurance. Why? Can't they afford it? I reckon they can afford it. We would be better off spending the money on helping the pensioners waiting to get their hips replaced so they can have an operation in a public hospital. I think that is a much better use of the money.</para><para>If the government want to defend this move, they have to say to Australians why this is a better use of Australian taxpayers' money than what the opposition is proposing. You cannot argue the case. This is not the best use of the money. This is an election 
 bribe that the government put up at the last election. It sounded like smart politics—I think it will turn out to be sour politics—but it is very bad economics. They did not get one public health economist to come and defend the scheme. They have not found one bit of methodology or calculation to support it. It is an absolute rort. It should not happen. It is a complete waste of taxpayers' money. I am extremely disappointed that we did not knock it off at the second reading stage, but I hope the Senate will reconsider. This is a gross misuse of taxpayers' money and it should not go ahead.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>1743</page.no><name role="metadata">Tambling, Sen Grant</name><name role="display">Senator TAMBLING</name><name.id>6E4</name.id><electorate>NT</electorate><party>CLP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I do not know whether Senator Evans has any children, but it was his side that, with both hands, grabbed the child-care payments that were made to every millionaire and every other family in Australia.

As for your previous comments, private hospitals are not about to close down. I suggest you go and check the Stock Exchange. You will find that private hospitals are making record profits. If you do consult with those who advise on how to invest money, that is one of the top investments in this country at the moment. Indeed, shares have had a steady increase over about the last five years. Looking at new beds, in my home state in particular a new private hospital attached to Flinders is about to open. Looking at the number of new private hospitals established over the last 18 months, I think we have a surplus of something like 17 new private facilities, both bed day facilities and hospitals. We are far from the end of the private hospital system.</para></talk.start><para>Again I would just make the point: this is not the way to support them anyway. If we do want to acknowledge that people pay Medicare and wish to use a private hospital, there is a bed-day subsidy which is putting health money into health; it is not putting health money into an insurance product.</para><para>Drawing our attention back to the amendment—as you keep wanting of us so that we will not ask too many more embarrassing questions—the amendment actually says that, while we do not want a bar of the measures you are putting before us tonight connected with the rebate, at least we should be quarantining the rebate to those Australians on low and middle incomes so that high income earners do not get something that they do not need.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>1744</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator CHRIS EVANS</name><name.id>AX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I just indicate that the opposition will not be supporting these amendments.

Also, it would look at the ability of this measure to hold down the costs of private health insurance over the two years and to do something about the number of people in private insurance. In other words, we are looking basically at what the government is claiming will happen.

The government has not made out a case for subsidising ancillary cover. As we know, 60 per cent of ancillary cover is in dental care. I have made the point in debates previously on this issue that the government's priority in this area is ironic. We are going to fund up to $200 million worth of ancillary care, which largely consists of dental care, for those in society who can afford it, while we as a community cannot afford emergency dental treatment for pensioners and others on low incomes because we have seen fit to abolish the Commonwealth dental scheme and remove the $100 million that was provided for that purpose.</para></talk.start><para>So we have a very stark contrast. We can find $200 million to subsidise dental care for people of all income levels with ancillary cover, but we cannot find $100 million to provide emergency dental care for those people who sometimes cannot even eat because their teeth are in such bad condition but they cannot get care. It is an important representation of the government's priorities in this bill. It is an important representation of the choices confronting the Senate. I do not want to labour the point, but I do not think the government has made a case at all for us underwriting the provision of ancillary care.</para><para>Clearly, the government's major argument in all of this—however unconvincing—is that it will take the pressure off the public hospitals. This would do nothing to take the pressure off the public hospitals. These services are not generally provided in public hospitals. In terms of priorities for the use of money, the opposition cannot see any need to support the government's position. We therefore support the Democrat amendment.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>1747</page.no><name role="metadata">Lees, Sen Meg</name><name role="display">Senator LEES</name><name.id>8U4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to make a few comments. The government's argument in committee on this was that ancillary services are very important. We have no problem with that whatsoever; they are very important. They are sometimes a part of a hospital procedure but, as Senator 
 Evans has already said, the majority of them are dental and a lot of them are optical.</para></talk.start><para>I have great difficulty with this when there has not been a drop-off in ancillary services. The pattern of private health insurance from 1995 shows that the number of people with hospital insurance dropped from 6.3 million to 5.7 million, but ancillary services remained stable. Roughly six million Australians are covered for those. As Senator Evans has pointed out, I have great difficulty subsidising mostly high income families and individuals, and remember there are already support mechanisms with the old system for those on low to middle incomes.</para><para>If this bill is passed tonight, what will really happen is this: of the $290 million that will go into subsidising ancillary services, a good $200 million will probably be spent on those on middle to high incomes, when we cannot find the money for dental treatment for those who are on waiting lists. They were once on waiting lists in the Commonwealth public dental scheme, but that has now been handed back to the states. In some states, such as Tasmania, that scheme is almost inoperable; that is true also for many rural areas across the country. In New South Wales, waiting lists for the public dental scheme are around three years and anyone could imagine what it would be like for someone to have to wait three years to have basic fillings attended to. In many instances, it is a case of having to extract their teeth by the time they reach the front of the queue.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>1747</page.no><name role="metadata">Tambling, Sen Grant</name><name role="display">Senator TAMBLING</name><name.id>6E4</name.id><electorate>NT</electorate><party>CLP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The critics of the rebate are arguing that the rebate should not apply to ancillary cover. To claim that only wealthy people use ancillary services is nonsense. Ancillary products cover such things as dental, optical, physiotherapy, chiropractic, osteopathy, podiatry, emergency ambulance transport, speech therapy, hearing aids and non-PSB pharmaceutical prescriptions. These services are used by all Australians, not just the wealthy. Indeed, 76 per cent of all people with health insurance have both hospital and ancillary cover, which shows that Australians across all income levels value 
 ancillary cover. It is not just the high-flying football players. It covers all people, especially those who are terminally ill with cancer, children with disability illnesses, the aged and the infirm, paraplegics and quadriplegics.</para></talk.start><para>The majority of ancillary services are not covered by Medicare. Excluding ancillary services from the rebate would deny many less wealthy Australians access to these essential services. These are the very services that can prevent people from needing to go into hospital for acute care. For example, being able to access podiatry services can prevent a person with diabetes from being admitted to a hospital for a limb amputation.

 rebate from 1 January 1999. It provides for access reductions of private health insurance premiums—namely, 30 per cent received by either of three areas: a reduction of private health insurance premiums, a tax rebate or a cash rebate from a government office, presumably the Medicare office. That is precisely what it is in the legislation at the moment.</para><para>The rebate could be used to put pressure on funds in negotiation with the medical profession to offer no gap or known gap policies to health fund members. National Mutual already offers such policies to its members in South Australia and in Victoria, and some 30 to 40 per cent of insured South Australian residents have such policies. Under simplified billing arrangements, there are now over 25 simplified billing agents across the country, and many of these also offer known or no gap arrangements for privately insured patients using both public and private hospitals.</para><para>These policies require negotiation between funds, hospitals and procedural specialists. Now over 5.7 per cent of all claims are going through simplified billing agencies. National Mutual has processed over 200,000 claims on its own. This amendment attempts to build on this achievement, and that is exactly what this incentive scheme should be doing. I have argued all along that the 30 per cent rebate should deal with the gaps issue. This has been a critical question in my mind in coming to the conclusion that I have come to within the last few hours: that is, to support this measure.</para><para>There were other factors which influenced my considerations thereon, but the issue of the gap is one which we have to deal with sooner or later, and the sooner the better. What these amendments do is deal with funds that do not offer these options to their members. These funds would no longer be permitted to offer the 30 per cent rebate as a premium reduction. In other words, any fund that does not offer to its members a no gap or known gap policy would not be able to offer the 30 per cent rebate as a premium reduction.</para><para>Therefore, the members could only access the rebate as a tax or cash rebate. Many who would be aware of this would move to other 
 funds that did meet the target and therefore could offer the 30 per cent premium reduction. The government cannot provide the committee with modelling to see how this would finally pan out, but anybody with any commonsense would realise that, in a competitive field such as private health insurance, the funds that could offer the no gap or known gap policies and therefore the 30 per cent rebate as a premium reduction would be at a considerable advantage in the marketplace as against those funds which would be unable to do that.</para><para>Those funds which would not offer that sort of policy would not be able to advertise or offer a cheaper premium based on the 30 per cent reduction in premium costs. Of course, the membership would be attracted to those that could. Clearly, it would provide an incentive to insurance companies to enter into agreements with private hospitals and with doctors, particularly specialists, so that they could offer the no gap or known gap policies. This is an advantage which should be considered by the committee as a step in the right direction to try to grapple with this vexed question of the gap.</para><para>I remind the committee that the thing that concerns members most is the cost of premiums, but this question of the gap is a matter that comes forward time and time again. People are complaining to us as members of parliament about it. You hear around the place in general conversation, `Yes, I had to go to the hospital. I was on top cover and thought I would be covered and now I'm receiving bill after bill after bill,' and those bills represent the amounts which were not picked up by Medicare or the fund and the person has to pay up out of their own pocket.</para><para>This is an attempt to overcome that situation. I appreciate that the funds would need a little time to ensure that this is worked out and to undertake the necessary negotiations with the private hospitals and with the medical profession. If the medical profession does not accept and cooperate and if they then do not themselves bring down their fees, then they are likely to face a real problem. If they do not do that, the whole private health system will be under so much pressure that it 
 is likely to collapse. I therefore submit these amendments to the committee in the hope that, though they are not the optimum, they are at least achievable with goodwill on all sides.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>8U4</name.id><name role="metadata">LEES</name><name role="display">Senator Lees</name></talker><para>—That's what's needed.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>6H4</name.id><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name></talker><para>—Yes, I agree, Senator Lees. I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the work you have done in the committee work and other areas. But at least these amendments are trying to address the problem.

At least we won't have to send the bills to the patients. The health funds will have to pick up the tab.'</para></talk.start></continue><para>Those that do that I think would be seen as traitors to the private health system by their colleagues. There will be, I believe, a considerable incentive on the part of funds to ensure that costs are kept down, because if they are not then the members have to pay increased premiums. If the members have to pay increased premiums, that is the primary concern of members. That will lead to the destruction of the private health insurance funds and, ultimately, to the private system itself. Those doctors surely would be regarded as traitors to that particular cause.</para><para>I submit this as workable and also constitutional. There are other ways to try to pull the doctors, the medical profession, into line. That has been tried in a number of fields.

</para><para>I think virtually every health insurance company already fulfils this, and I would like to ask the parliamentary secretary if that is not indeed true.</para><para>My preferred option would have been that the 30 per cent rebate could only be available on policies where there was going to be no gap—in other words, if we could really have driven down the cost of those policies that really did offer everything. Looking at my home state, I congratulate the largest fund there. It has managed to do that, and a lot of people are now using that option. But my worry is that, given that in each state, except one state, there is a dominant insurer, the no-gap policy could indeed end up costing $6,000 and the premiums for ordinary existing policies for everyday hospital cover, which the minister has the final say in, would manage to stay down because the gaps will still be there.

The government supports Senator Harradine's important amendment, as it goes a long way to supporting initiatives the government is already pursuing to address the issues of the gap. In fact, the Howard government has done more to reduce the incidence of the medical gap fees than the previous government. In the last 18 months we have seen major successes which would have been unimaginable only three years ago. HIC statistics show that an increasing number of in-hospital medical claims are being processed through agreements with health funds and through simpli 
 fied billing agents, many of which have eliminated gaps or shown known out-of-pockets.</para></talk.start><para>I draw attention to this whole issue of the success that we have had in Victoria and South Australia with a number of admissions to hospitals with a no-gaps basis rising exponentially. We have a real prospect of making major changes nationally within the next 18 months.

He, of course, has referred to the areas where we will be providing money for computer software development, which is one of the limiting factors, to changing the reinsurance pool to provide greater incentives for funds to offer no-gap products. Within the last week, Dr Wooldridge has brought Medibank Private to his office and instructed work in this area as a matter of urgency.</para><para>You will recall that the  Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1998  has just passed through the House of Representatives, and it has a number of measures to help costs, such as attempting to create a wholesale market in private health insurance and removing incentives for in-hospital treatment when a procedure could be done in rooms or as day surgery. Certainly much more needs to be done. Senator Harradine's amendment will help immeasurably in this regard, and we acknowledge its important contribution to this part of the legislation.</para><para>Senator Lees asked about the issue of existing policies. I am informed that current covers are only in the area that relates to hospital costs and cover such issues as accommodation, whereas the extension of what is now envisaged in Senator Harradine's amendment picks up new and innovative products that will be available and will move into the wider areas of medical assessment and medical need.

What we are doing here is providing a $1.7 billion blank cheque and saying, `In addition to that, we might have this small amendment moved, and carried by the government, that would provide some signal that there would be some serious attempt to deal with the problem of the gap.'</para><para>I agree with Senator Harradine that the gap is one of the major issues. I think all minor party and Labor senators have stressed that this does nothing for that major issue, that we are throwing good money after bad without any of the reciprocal obligation that the government demands of social security recipients or unemployed persons in this country. In return for $300 a week of pension, all sorts of reciprocal and mutual obligations are demanded. But in return for $1.7 billion we demand nothing. We say, `Take the money 
 and we will have a look at some of the other problems down the track.'</para><para>Quite frankly, if Dr Wooldridge was in business, he would go broke very quickly. You never give them the money before you get the service. You certainly do not give them the money before you get some sort of sign of their commitment to provide some service in return. What we have done is provided an underwriting of 30 per cent of whatever the private health insurance funds choose to charge over the next however many years. They can increase premiums, knowing that we will always pay 30 per cent of the bill. I think that is an outrage in terms of public policy. While this amendment has some worthy objectives, it takes us no real way towards meeting our obligation to deal with the real problems or ensuring that we get a proper response from the health insurance industry.</para><para>Senator Harradine referred to the problem of modelling and costing that we found with the government's proposals, and I think he indicated that he had similar difficulties in costing this proposal. I think it is important that he or the parliamentary secretary provide some explanation, because the evidence given to the Senate committee of inquiry into this matter indicated that the cost of providing gap insurance would actually increase premiums by some 7½ per cent. I am not sure what the government and Senator Harradine are saying about this measure but, on the evidence of the private hospital industry, gap insurance would increase the total cost of premiums by 7½ per cent. Is that right? Is that the estimate of the cost of this measure—an increase in premiums of 7½ per cent? Is that the government's estimate as well?</para><para>And, will we be subsidising 30 per cent of that increase in cost? Is there any limit on the charges that can be applied to gap insurance? Surely it is going to be quite an expensive product, by anybody's reckoning. I would be interested to know what sort of restrictions or flexibility apply in that regard. Will any measures be taken to cap the cost of gap fees? I understood that Mr Chalmers of the private industry stated in his evidence at the committee hearing that there are no mechanisms by 
 which gaps can be quantified or capped. It is unclear to me how this measure is to work, how it is to be funded, or what the government estimates the cost of the measure to be. Obviously, some answers to those questions would assist the committee greatly.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>1753</page.no><name role="metadata">Tambling, Sen Grant</name><name role="display">Senator TAMBLING</name><name.id>6E4</name.id><electorate>NT</electorate><party>CLP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—There are several issues that arise.

The Government believes that the amendment you have circulated would substantially address this problem and, accordingly, will support it. I note that the amendment would have the effect of setting a target of all private health insurance products having no gaps or known gaps by 1 July 2000. Funds that did not meet the target would not be permitted to offer the 30 per cent rebate as a premium reduction after that date.

These include:</para><para>.	 providing money for computer software development which is one of the limiting factors;</para><para>.	 changing the reinsurance pool to provide greater incentives for funds to offer no gap products; and</para><para>.	 asking Medibank Private to work on this area, as a matter of urgency.</para><para>We also discussed the provision of measures to alleviate the health problems of the aged and chronically ill.

This would be a very substantial change in our health care system and the Government is prepared to trial 
 it seriously. It is dependent on being able to cash-out hospital costs for a given group of people or a defined geographic area. The Government would also be willing to cash-out Medicare or pharmaceutical costs. I can confirm that in the next Budget, the Government will provide funds in the order of $25 million to run additional coordinated care trials in capital cities and selected regional centres to address the health care needs of older people who are chronically ill or disadvantaged.</para><para>The Government would, of course, appreciate your support in securing passage of the legislation in its amended form.</para><para>Yours sincerely</para><para>John Howard</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>6H4</name.id><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name></talker><para>—Senator Evans raised questions about possible increases in premiums that the covering of the gap would entail.

We are in the situation here of not knowing and that means, to some degree, flying by the seat of our pants.</para></talk.start><para>It is a very important matter, because the alternative that the opposition and the Greens have been putting quite strongly is that it would be better for the $1.7 billion to be going into the public health system. This would have a very clear impact for the good on the medical health services delivery to the Australian populace as a whole.</para><para>The problem with Senator Harradine's amendment is that while it appears on the face of it that there may be some beneficial effect in increasing the participation in health insurance, beyond that we have nothing to go by. We are being asked to give up the alternative of a much improved public health system—if the money went in that direction—in the hope that there will be some degree of improvement in participation rates in private health insurance.</para><para>We have already heard Senator Harradine say that it would be traitorous for doctors to increase fees on the back of this measure. But there is nothing in this amendment or in the legislation to stop that happening. Doctors—and I am one of them—are human beings and past practice has shown that some of them at least will move to take monetary advantage from a system that allows them to do so. The only way we can stop that is by regulating. I would be much happier as a member of the medical profession if that were an outcome that we were entertaining here tonight. But we are not. Therefore, what the argument for this measure comes down to is that it sounds like a good idea.</para><para>One thing I would like to know, which might help the committee in deciding whether this idea is going to be effectual, is what the

I will return to it in a minute. There is no implementation for 18 months, so this is not a measure that will have any immediate impact. It suffers from a lack of review and defined objectives.

I was not asking him what the costs of the measure are in terms of the package of the government's legislation; I was asking him what the costs will be of the amendment from Senator Harradine that has been agreed to by the government. Senator Lees asked the very question that Senator Harradine seeks to answer by this measure tonight. Mr Chalmers, from the Private Hospitals Association, provided the answer. This is not one of those witnesses who so upset Senator Knowles; this was Mr Chalmers from the Private Hospitals Association. When asked by Senator Lees about gap payments, he said at page 42 of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>:</para><para>Senator, while my colleague is thinking about that, we have just done some quick `back of the notepad' calculations at the table. To answer the question of what would be the premium effect of covering existing medical gaps, that would require a premium increase in the order of 7.5 per cent. However, that would not necessarily ensure that the gap problem would be eliminated because there is 
 no mechanism by which gaps can be quantified or capped.</para><para>So Mr Chalmers from the Private Hospitals Association seemed to be indicating that the idea was a nonsense and that it was not feasible.</para><para>The parliamentary secretary may or may not agree with that. Given that he is voting for the amendment and co-sponsoring it, I assume he does not accept that view. But does he accept, and has the government done the calculations on, the cost to premiums of the gap insurance? Do you agree with the private hospitals' estimate that it will cost a 7.5 per cent increase in premiums? Senator Harradine has now put this letter into the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>. I appreciate his doing that. I was not sure how I would come by it. I wanted to be a bit careful.

However, I do take seriously the questions that he has raised. One of the very important issues that must be addressed when we are dealing with private health insurance is the retention rate within the funds themselves. For many years now, the fall-off in membership has been one of the 
 most serious factors influencing the continuation of premiums and, in fact, rising premiums for members who stay within the funds.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Brown referred to the South Australian experience. I know that National Mutual in South Australia has acknowledged that, in the changes to the system this year, the retention of membership has been one of the key goals. It is a very major economic factor in keeping the premiums either stable or as tightly measured as possible.</para><para>Senator Harradine's amendments now reinforce that opportunity for the funds to have innovative, new and special products that will not only appeal to retaining membership but also, hopefully, to expanding it and encouraging people in different areas. It will certainly be very focused in that area. The costs will have to be measured by the funds. Naturally, there will be normal economic adjustments based on their membership and participation, which are so vitally important. I believe that this amendment will go a long way to stabilising that area.</para><para>Senator Evans referred to the letter from the Prime Minister to Senator Harradine of today's date which acknowledges and puts on the record a number of the government's very important initiatives, not only those that Dr Wooldridge has been keenly pursuing now for some time in a number of particular areas and which I mentioned earlier in the debate this evening. The fact that Dr Wooldridge has been working for some time now in the area of gaps naturally meant that he, Senator Harradine and the Prime Minister were able to reach some very important agreements on this whole matter of the objectives that have surfaced in Senator Harradine's amendments.</para><para>Senator Evans refers to the other parts of the letter in which the Prime Minister acknowledges, very properly, to Senator Harradine that there are a number of other ongoing government programs to which he has alluded previously, particularly at the recent ACOSS Congress. Certainly, I am aware of the directives and the determination of both the Prime Minister and Dr Wooldridge in changing the areas of quality health care and how that is to be achieved, 
 particularly measuring outcomes in a number of ways. The Prime Minister has quite rightly set out that there will be initiatives in the context of the International Year of Older Persons and has named a number of specific projects that the government was in the course of developing and has put on the record.</para><para>With regard to the area that Senator Evans mentioned, the coordinated care trials, I am pleased to note that the Prime Minister has confirmed a particular amount—and it may even be larger when the budget comes around—for these important projects. The coordinated care trials will have tremendous advantage not only for aged and elderly people but also for people in regional centres throughout Australia. I can speak from personal experience, as there are currently two such coordinated care trials operating in the Northern Territory, specifically in Aboriginal communities. They will have a major impact in delivering important health care outcomes.</para><para>I for one would certainly acknowledge that it is important that coordinated care trials should be expanded and built up to address the area of care for people in regional centres. If they are as successful as those that are operating in the Territory and elsewhere in Australia, I am sure that the advantage to people—particularly older people—who are chronically ill or disadvantaged will have a major impact.</para><para>I am sure that Senator Harradine welcomed the letter.

It sounds a bit like a product for sticking windows together, doesn't it? Once there is that extra incentive, what does it mean for states if they have very few choices already in health insurance packages or products? Does the parliamentary secretary have any specific figures on the coverage of health insurance and the numbers of health insurance products that are available in each state?

I want to take us back to one of the clauses in the amendments that Senator Harradine has moved. The proposed clause states:</para></talk.start><para>The Minister must not approve an application by a *health fund for the financial year beginning on 1 July 2000 or a later financial year unless the 
 health fund provides its members with the choice of one or more of the following types of policies:</para><para>(a)	 a *no gap policy;</para><para>(b)	 a *known gap policy.</para><para>In effect, that looks like a sanction that is to be applied against the health funds—that is, unless they provided this choice, there would be some sanction. The letter that Senator Harradine received today from the Prime Minister, which has been incorporated, states:</para><para>I note that the amendment would have the effect of setting a target of all private health insurance products having no gaps or known gaps by 1 July 2000. Funds that did not meet the target would not be permitted to offer the 30 per cent rebate as a premium reduction after that date. All fund contributors would, of course, retain access to a taxation or direct cash rebate.</para><para>It seems to be a slightly different understanding of the sanction. So I would like some clarification as to whether the sanction is to be applied against the health funds if they do not provide this choice or, as it appears in the Prime Minister's letter, whether the only sanction is that they would not be able to offer that particular rebate as a premium reduction, that people would still be able to get the taxation or direct cash rebate.</para><para>Is the sanction on the fund really only restricting them in terms of one of the three options of paying the rebate to people but not restricting them from continuing not to offer the policies that you are suggesting are vital? I just want to get it clear what Senator Harradine thinks the amendment does.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>1759</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—That is precisely what the amendment does. That is a penalty. Is that not a sufficient penalty? You could then have a number of funds offering the no gap or known gap policies having their premiums presented to potential fund members at a particular rate; others would not. Those that did not so offer could not provide on any of their tables a cut rate from their premium.</para></talk.start><para>In the marketplace—if you are talking about the marketplace—it is an enormous advantage and an enormous incentive for funds to make sure that they offer this particular product, and it is what I propose in this amendment. To do otherwise would be to penalise the 
 fund members for the failure of the fund to do what it ought to be doing. It would be unfair to penalise the fund members by taking away their 30 per cent reduction provided either by cash or through the taxation system. When advertising, the funds that were not participating and were not offering these particular policies would be at a great disadvantage because, in particular tables by comparison with the other funds, their premiums would have to be advertised 30 per cent above the others.</para><para>I come back to a point that you made. You are concerned about the failure of this to cap the fees that are charged by specialists. I think it will have the effect of capping them because there will be a lot of pressure on the funds to come to arrangements with public hospitals, particularly with medical specialists. But, let me make it clear to the committee, as most members of the committee must know, that it is, unfortunately, unconstitutional for the parliament to cap the fees of medical specialists. Senator Brown said we ought to be regulating them. Quite frankly, I tell you right here and now that I would be the first one doing that. But we cannot. I have been through it the last few weeks and you cannot do it. The states do have the powers to fix fees, but we do not. I know it is not perfect, but at least it is an advance. I am putting it to the committee and am hoping that it will be carried.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>1759</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We ought to have the states come together with the Commonwealth for that purpose. We do it on so many other things, so I cannot see why we cannot do it when coming to an arrangement on capping medical fees. That seems to me to be an extremely good goal.</para></talk.start><para>I want to raise two things. What improvement has there been in the participation rate in South Australia, which has this system that is being advocated or promoted in this amendment, vis-a-vis the other states? Margaret in my office tells me that, in 1997, hospital cover in South Australia—this is an average sort of scheme—had gone to 267 per cent of 1989 levels compared with 220 per cent for the country as a whole. In other 
 words, premiums have gone up faster in South Australia than they have in the rest of the country. Is this related to the fact that South Australia had this rapid change across to a known gap option? I do not know, but that is the sort of thing this committee should know.</para><para>It is a pity that we do not have time here to look at the ramifications of this amendment. I suggest, Senator Harradine, that it would have been a more assured outcome for you had the analysis and scrutiny that should have taken place on this amendment been made before we had the vote on it. As it is, nothing is going to change.</para><para>The other point evident here is: sure, as Senator Harradine says, some funds will be able to say, `Look, our premiums are 30 per cent lower.' But what is to stop the other funds from saying, `Look, our premiums are higher, but you're going to get a cheque in the mail or a tax deduction as a result of this new scheme coming in, and overall our premiums will be lower.' If the only thing to come out of this is to be an advertising advantage that will induce people into the funds, all of us in this committee know that a good advertising person will be able to put the argument in the other direction if fund participants themselves are to be able to get the benefit of the rebate—even if the fund cannot give it in reduction of cost of premiums.</para><para>I think we will not see much good result at all come out of this amendment. But we will see a heck of a lot of money go from the government coffers, into the rebate incentive, into the private system. As a committee, we are left with no figures, no modelling, no argument essentially, other than this being a good advertising way of increasing membership. I just do not think that is good enough, particularly considering the amount of money that is involved.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>1760</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator CHRIS EVANS</name><name.id>AX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I agree with Senator Brown, but his arguments against Senator Harradine's amendment hold true of the whole bill. While I think it is a good argument, as I say, the government has not provided any modelling for any of this, so I do not think it takes us 
 much further. Yes, we have another amendment that is uncosted, unmodelled, with no real idea of impact—but then the whole bill is like that. So I have given up on that argument. That has had no weight and no success in moving the Senate more generally.</para></talk.start><para>I do not want to spend too much time on this because, quite frankly, I think it is a very modest minor amendment that does not go to the heart of this bill nor to the heart of the problems of private health insurance. I think the sort of thing that Senator Harradine talked about in terms of sanction is more of a minor inconvenience to the funds. Nevertheless, that is not really essential debate on the bill. I do not think we ought to delay the committee stage too long on that issue. I think there are much bigger issues in terms of the bill.</para><para>I think it is unfortunate that we have not got any costings out of the parliamentary secretary in relation to this measure, nor in relation to the undertakings given to Senator Harradine. They obviously add to the total cost of this package; they add to the money that the government is throwing at getting this package through the parliament—and I think it is not unreasonable for us to expect to have that properly costed and be put before the parliament. But that is obviously not going to happen.</para><para>Again, I do not want to labour the point, but it is more money thrown at the problem in order to get the bill passed, because that is the political imperative. There is no health imperative, there is no economic imperative. It is just, `Throw money at the problem, get it fixed, get it passed; if we need to give $25 million for coordinated care, we'll throw that in as well; when you've got $1.5 billion, what's another $25 million? It's all big numbers and it's all got out of control, and there's no basis for any of it, there's no modelling for any of it—so, what the heck, what's a bit more? But the failure of the government to provide any costing on that I think is a sad reflection.</para><para>I just want to make this clear: the Labor Party is most concerned about gaps. They are a major issue. They need to be treated seriously. They need to be treated more seriously than was possible, it seems, in a couple of 
 hours of discussions this afternoon in order to get a compromise to get the bill passed. What we proposed—and what the Democrats and the Greens proposed—was a proper look at these issues; that we would not pass this bill until we dealt with the gaps issue, until we dealt with the premium rises issue and had a coordinated thorough look at how to get good health policy. What we have instead is a slipshod bill that is throwing money at the problem, throwing money at people who do not need support, and denying that health support to people who do need it.</para><para>As I say, I do not want to labour this issue any longer. I do not disagree with the objectives; I think they are worthy. It is a major issue that needs to be tackled. I do not think this amendment goes anywhere near far enough in dealing with that. But that is not to say that it is not worth supporting, in the sense that it is at least giving some recognition to the problem and some recognition to the fact that we need to do much more about gaps and premiums. But, as I say, we will not solve those problems tonight because there is no serious attempt to deal with those problems in this bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>1761</page.no><name role="metadata">Tambling, Sen Grant</name><name role="display">Senator TAMBLING</name><name.id>6E4</name.id><electorate>NT</electorate><party>CLP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Senator Brown raised the issue of the statistics based on South Australia.

If the competitive market is used as the model for the way this particular measure will work, you have to keep in mind that a competitive model works on full information. So I guess that people actually would have to go off and find out the information from the various health funds.</para></talk.start><para>But also with the ability to quickly transfer, I believe—and, okay, these are my personal feelings—that people generally stick with a fund, unless they make a major decision to change. If I am not mistaken, that usually happens because there are substantial penalties with what you can claim and what you cannot claim. I do not know that you can transfer those over from one fund to another, but for many kinds of health care you have to wait a certain number of years.</para><para>The private health insurance market operates in such a way that people will not transfer from one fund to the other, like in superannuation, because they are concerned about losing benefits they have to wait several years to obtain. The reality is that this market does not operate in the way a lot of other markets operate—not even in the way superannuation funds operate—and we have to keep those issues in mind when we think about incentives we are offering to create a market situation or to keep people in a market. It might have an impact on attracting new people to the market, but this has been unproven in all the statistics we have been asked to believe. In reality, it will not necessarily operate as a real market incentive for those existing clients of health insurance, because you are unable to easily move from one fund to the other without losing some of the benefits you have to wait for.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>1761</page.no><name role="metadata">West, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator WEST</name><name.id>1X4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am looking at the Prime Minister's letter and the third paragraph states:</para></talk.start><para>I can also confirm that the Government will promote the facilitating measures concerning out of

The best option was that this whole matter should have been investigated before the election, and the results of those investi 
 gations ought to have been before the Australian people when they voted at the election. After all, the Prime Minister did say that he got a mandate from the election. I know there are figures to show that that is wrong.</para><para>The second best option was for us to ensure that, seeing the vote of the people is so important to the Prime Minister, the Senate which was voted in at the election is in place when this matter is determined. That of course will happen on 1 July next year. That is why it is very important that we follow through the logic of the Prime Minister himself to make sure that the vote in the Senate reflects the vote of the people when they went to the election. That will not be possible until 1 July.</para><para>I would have thought that the Democrats, who are not here at the moment, would have welcomed this provision because they will clearly have the balance of power.

They could ensure that by making sure the Senate holds over the vote on this important package until 1 July next year. That is impeccable logic.

To accept the logic of Senator Brown, firstly, that we need to suspend standing orders and, secondly, that we need to suspend the vote on this historic package of bills till 1 July would mean that you really could not seek to put anything through the parliament, except for old legislation, until 1 July after any election, which I think is a ludicrous proposition. If you apply the logic of Senator Brown, you would really have to wait for a further three years until the next set of senators came up for election. The Senate was designed by our founding fathers.

The reality is that there is a different mandate in the Senate from that in the House of Representatives. It is quite ludicrous to say that you cannot pass any legislation through the Senate until the new senators come in. We have already shown here today and in this session—and I take this opportunity to thank honourable senators for their hard work during this short session—that a lot of constructive work can be done.

Let us be frank. As far as we are concerned, we have already agreed to a timetable for a Senate inquiry into the GST and related legislation. That timetable, if I recall correctly, will see the legislation available for debate in the Senate some time after 19 April 1999.</para></talk.start><para>The opposition is not about delaying debate on the government's GST proposals; we are and always have been about a very serious level of parliamentary and public scrutiny of these particular proposals. We have also been very serious about providing an appropriate forum to allow the public, particularly those who are going to be affected so adversely by the goods and services tax, to have their say before the committees of this Senate.</para><para>The other point that needs to be made in relation to the progress of the inquiry is that any Senate inquiry like this, in large measure, depends on some level of willingness on the part of the government to cooperate in providing the committee with adequate information. I think it is very disappointing to have seen this government's rejection of my proposed return to order for the modelling studies and the assumptions and other documentation on which the GST proposals are based. I think that was a very ominous signal to Senator Cook and his colleagues on the select com 
 mittee and those who are serving on the references committees inquiring into these particular proposals.</para><para>As for the opposition's attitude, we remained, of course, resolutely opposed to a goods and services tax. It is, as we have said consistently, an extraordinarily unfair burden on those Australians who can least afford it. Let me turn to the other element of Senator Brown's motion, which goes to the composition of the Senate after July 1999. It does change. In one sense, it will be a very significant change because no longer will we have the government accepting the vote of Senator Colston, which they have consistently done since the last election.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>4J4</name.id><name role="metadata">SCHACHT</name><name role="display">Senator Schacht</name></talker><para>—A sleazy, corrupt deal!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name></talker><para>—Of course it was, Senator Schacht.

It is not just one party that will have the balance of power in this chamber.</para><para>But one thing this chamber will do is make sure that this legislation is given good and proper scrutiny. Compare that with the farce of the last three days in the House of Representatives; compare that to the guillotining through of 16 complex bills—the centrepiece of the government's strategy, they say, for the next three years—belted through with only the most cursory debate, consideration and scrutiny. I have never been a Senate chauvinist, but I think in any democracy we should 
 have had a slightly longer consideration than that which occurred in that farce over in the House of Representatives.</para><para>But you will never get a pure Senate in terms of mandate or anything else. In 1993, we had senators elected—one lot supporting the GST, another lot opposing it—who said that they would not block an incoming government. That was the strategy that people went to the election with. In 1996, we had the Labor Party saying they would not introduce a GST; we had a Liberal Party saying they would not support a GST. Several people sitting opposite went out and campaigned on the `never, ever' pledge of their leader, Mr John Howard, saying they would never have a GST.</para><para>So there is no such thing as a pure Senate. You only have a mandate in this place if you have 39 votes. That is the only definition that you can have in the end. I do not think Senator Brown's motion would ever be acceptable to me, simply because of the history of this place. You deal with the numbers in existence.</para><para>Those opposite did not particularly like Senator Faulkner's comments, but the fact is that since August 1996, and especially in the last four weeks, this Senate voting process has been totally perverted, because one person elected as a Labor senator six years ago on the full resources, the platform and the pledge of loyalty to the Labor Party has left. Those on the other side say, `Do not criticise him. You are being a bit harsh before Christmas. You are just poor losers. You should just roll over and forget it.' But when the boot goes on other foot and someone from the Liberal Party deserts, see if they take that same avuncular attitude. See if they say, `That is all right. Senator Heffernan has decided to leave the Liberal Party. Good old Bill. See you later, Bill. We don't mind. You are still going to be invited to the Christmas party, even though you are a traitor. Don't worry about it.' That is the Liberal attitude.</para><para>The Liberal Party has always treated deserters kindly. Look at Francis and Jennings in Victoria who got expelled. Have a look at the current South Australian Liberal Party. Have a look at anyone who has deserted the conser 
 vative cause. They get the same degree of contempt that we would offer to anyone who leaves the Labor Party.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Senator Ferris interjecting</inline>—</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>UI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator ROBERT RAY</name></talker><para>—Senator Ferris interjects, given the mess that she has got the South Australian branch of the Liberal Party in.

This is the most comprehensive reform of taxation in the history of the Federation.</para><para>This is <inline font-style="italic">A New Tax System</inline>  for a new century. Today's legislation sweeps away an outdated, inefficient, tax system that does not serve the needs of the modern nation. The New Tax System re-writes Commonwealth-State financial relations. The New Tax System will lighten the burden of income tax for families and average wage earners.</para><para>At the last election the Government put this plan to the people. And the people of Australia endorsed it.</para><para>The Government asked for a mandate. And the people of Australia gave it.</para><para>This is a plan not for a new tax, but for a new tax system. It encapsulates those changes necessary to make our great country more productive and more competitive. It will help our exporters, deliver more jobs and increase standards of living.</para><para>The bills being introduced today are the first part of a package. The Government proposes to enact 
 the whole package by the end of this financial year to meet the timetable outlined to the Australian people at the last election. When the package is enacted, Australia will have a new tax system from 1 July 2000.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">A Modern, Broad Based, Low Rate, Goods and Services Tax</inline></para><para>The bills before the House will enact a broad based goods and services tax that will be levied at 10 per cent and will start in July 2000.</para><para>The GST will apply to most goods and services consumed in Australia.</para><para>When a business purchases goods and services it will be entitled to full input tax credits. This means that the tax burden on business inputs will be significantly reduced.</para><para>With the introduction of the GST, the wholesale sales tax is to be abolished.</para><para>In consultation with the States, the following nine types of taxes are also to be progressively abolished:</para><para>.	 financial institutions duty;</para><para>.	 debits tax;</para><para>.	 stamp duty on marketable securities;</para><para>.	 conveyancing duties on business property;</para><para>.	 stamp duties on credit arrangements, instalment purchase arrangements and rental hiring agreements;</para><para>.	 stamp duties on leases;</para><para>.	 stamp duties on mortgages, bonds, debentures and other loan securities;</para><para>.	 stamp duties on cheques, bills of exchange and promissory notes; and</para><para>.	 `bed taxes'.</para><para>The abolition of the wholesale sales tax and other taxes is vital to reduce the cost of doing business. At the moment over half the money raised from the WST comes from taxing goods purchased by business. It imposes a hidden tax on exports and import competing industries.</para><para>The introduction of the GST will change this. As businesses are entitled to full input tax credits the hidden burden will be removed. In fact business costs will fall by more than $10 billion as a result of the GST and abolition of current inefficient and unfair taxes.</para><para>The GST will also lead to a $4.5 billion fall in the cost of exporting. Lifting this burden will increase the competitiveness of Australia's export industries.</para><para>The bill provides for some activities to be GST-free which<inline font-weight="bold"></inline> include:</para><para>.	 exports of goods and services;</para><para>.	 international air and sea travel, and domestic air travel, purchased overseas by non residents; 
</para><para>.	 taxes and charges at all levels of government (including local government rates and water and sewerage rates and charges).</para><para>The price of GST-free services will fall because tax will be removed from the purchases of those supplying them.</para><para>The GST will be broadly based, providing simplicity for business and consumers.</para><para>Madam President, the Government has not neglected important community services.</para><para>In its tax plan, the Government proposed that virtually all health, education and childcare services; charitable activities and religious services would be GST-free.</para><para>On 27 October a Tax Consultative Committee was established and charged with the task of making recommendations on the appropriate scope of four key GST-free areas—health, education, religious services and the non-commercial activities of charities—and, transitional arrangements for motor vehicles.</para><para>The Committee received over 300 submissions from interested parties and made recommendations to the Government based on these submissions and its own expertise.</para><para>We consider the recommendations provide sensible boundary lines which are clear and based on sound policy principles.</para><para>The recommendations extend the GST free areas further than those proposed in the Government's tax policy.</para><para>They recommend GST-free treatment for a wide range of medical and allied health services.</para><para>They provide for comprehensive GST-free treatment for residential and community care for the aged and the disabled, provided the care is at a sufficiently high standard.</para><para>They provide for GST-free treatment for a wide range of aids and appliances specifically designed for people with illness or disabilities.</para><para>They provide for GST-free treatment for all secondary and tertiary courses, including vocational courses, provided students are eligible for income support.</para><para>And they provide for generous rules for charities.</para><para>Accordingly, the Government has no difficulty in accepting the vast majority of the recommendations. In some areas the Government has gone further, with more generous treatment of religious services and professional education.</para><para>The bottom line is that the Committee tried to promote clarity and simplicity and in doing this has recommended good policy which we will adopt.</para><para>We will apply international best practice to the treatment of financial services, which means that 
 banks pay tax on their purchases, but home mortgage payments and the supply of most financial services is not taxed.</para><para>No GST will be charged on residential rent and rents will be input taxed only. Houses will only be taxed when first built and sold.</para><para>A First Home Owners' Scheme will be introduced to offset the net impact of the GST on the price of new homes and entitling those eligible to a lump sum payment of $7,000 from 1 July 2000.</para><para>The Government has at every turn considered the impact on business.</para><para>Very small businesses with a turnover less than $50,000 per year and non-profit organisations with a turnover of less than $100,000 a year will not have to register (but may choose to do so).</para><para>A special Small Business Consultative Committee will be involved in consultations to ensure that financial incentives, worth up to $500 million, for small and medium businesses and other bodies registered for GST will be delivered in the most effective way.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Gains for rural and regional Australia</inline></para><para>The reform package also acknowledges the high cost of transport particularly for rural and regional Australia. A new diesel fuel credit scheme will effectively reduce diesel excise for all off-road (including marine) users from around 37 cents per litre to zero, and for larger transport users (including rail) from around 37 cents per litre to 18 cents per litre.</para><para>This is on top of savings of 7 cents per litre for business users of petrol and diesel through their access to a refund of the GST paid on fuel.</para><para>Alternative fuels will remain excise free on the introduction of the GST.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Transformation of Commonwealth-State financial relations</inline></para><para>From 1 July 2000, the Commonwealth will provide States with a secure and growing source of revenue by giving them the revenue from the GST, conditional on the States abolishing inefficient taxes (such as the Financial Institutions Duty, the debits tax and various stamp and conveyancing duties), and not re-introducing them. Financial Assistance Grants will be abolished.</para><para>The States will be required to take responsibility for the payments of general purpose assistance to local government currently made by the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth will make the payment of GST revenue conditional on the States making these payments in accordance with existing conditions. This will ensure that local government is not worse off in that respect.</para><para>In fact, overall, local government will gain from the removal and reduction of Commonwealth and State 
 taxes that currently increase their running costs. Local governments will also benefit from rates and water and sewerage charges being GST-free.</para><para>The Special Premiers' Conference on 13 November this year reached an historic agreement on the principles that will transform Commonwealth-State financial relations as promised in the Government's tax plan. The Commonwealth, and all State and Territory governments, agree that the current financial relationship between levels of government must be reformed to facilitate a stronger and more productive federal system for the new century.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Locking in the GST rate</inline></para><para>Part of the Commonwealth-State agreement is a process to lock in the rate of the GST. Any request for a change to the GST rate would need to be made to the Commonwealth unanimously by all State Governments: it would need to be endorsed by the Commonwealth Government of the day; and relevant legislation would need to be passed by both Houses of Federal Parliament.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Price oversight</inline></para><para>The community has a right to expect that reduced business costs are passed on to consumers in the transition to the new tax system.</para><para>We will amend the Trade Practices Act, to give the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission special transitional powers to monitor prices for 12 months before GST starts, and 2 years thereafter. There will be penalties of up to $10 million per offence.</para><para>The Commonwealth will consult with the States and Territories, to ensure these measures apply across the economy. The amending legislation for this measure is expected to be introduced next week.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Transitional Arrangements</inline></para><para>Madam President, the abolition of Wholesale Sales Tax, and the introduction of GST, could result in difficulties for business if appropriate transitional rules are not put in place.</para><para>Without such rules, there might be double taxation, or large falls in the value of stock held for resale. Consumers and businesses may delay purchases to take advantage of price falls when the higher Wholesale Sales Tax rates cease to apply. Business may delay high value purchases, to obtain input tax credits.</para><para>Without special measures the benefits of tax reform would be delayed. The Government has designed transitional arrangements to ensure that this kind of disruption does not occur so that the benefits of tax reform can flow immediately to businesses and the wider community.</para><para>When the GST commences, businesses holding stock for sale on which sales tax has been paid will 
 be able to claim the sales tax against their GST. This will ensure that GST does not apply to stock that has already paid WST.</para><para>The Government recognises that large price changes can disrupt markets. Accordingly the 32 per cent luxury WST rate will be phased down to reduce market disruption. Except for furs and jewellery, goods currently taxed at 32 per cent will be subject to the standard 22 per cent rate from the date the GST is passed by the Parliament. That is, goods such as cameras, televisions, video recorders and watches would all become cheaper, prior to the introduction of the GST.</para><para>Madam President, the introduction of the GST could result in major disruption to the motor vehicle market if businesses were able to claim input tax credits straight away. The Government will reduce the incentive to delay vehicle purchases until after GST starts by denying input tax credits for purchases made in the first year of GST, and by reducing the input tax credit by 50 per cent in the second year.</para><para>Importantly, this measure does not apply to organisations, such as schools and farmers, that can buy cars and 4WDs WST free. They will get a full input tax credit for motor vehicle purchases from day one of the GST.</para><para>Of course, consumers will get the benefit of substantially lower car prices as soon as the GST comes into effect.</para><para>Goods and services sold or performed after 1 July 2000 will be subject to GST.</para><para>Where a contract has been entered into before today goods and services sold or performed pursuant to it will not be subject to GST even if sale or performance is to be on or after 1 July 2000.</para><para>However, if such a contract has provision for a review then GST applies after the first opportunity for review arises. Otherwise GST will apply to the sale or performance under the pre-existing contract only on or after 1 July 2005.</para><para>GST will apply to goods and services supplied to consumers after 1 July 2000 under any contract entered into from today.</para><para>If a construction contract spans the start date of 1 July 2000, the part completed before that date, will not have GST applied to it.</para><para>Many businesses will need to consider the GST-implications of contracts that they enter into after today. The Government recognises legitimate concerns that businesses will need some time to consider the precise impact on their operations. Businesses that enter into contracts with other businesses (which will be entitled to input tax credits) for the supply of goods and services, will provide those goods and services GST-free until the first opportunity for review, provided the contract 
 is made before the date the GST legislation gets the Royal Assent.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Personal tax cuts and increased family assistance</inline></para><para>From the outset, one of the Government's guiding principles for tax reform was that there must be no increase in the overall tax burden. We will do better than that. The tax reforms will actually reduce the overall tax burden on Australians by $4 billion.</para><para>The tax cuts will more than compensate taxpayers for the introduction of the GST, and will also make it possible for ordinary Australians to save and invest.</para><para>The Personal Income Tax Bill gives effect to the cuts in rates of income tax and provides extra assistance to families by increasing the Family Tax Assistance tax-free thresholds.</para><para>The tax-free threshold increases to $6,000 and the lowest tax rate decreases from 20 per cent to 17 per cent. This helps all taxpayers but is of relatively greater benefit to low income earners.</para><para>Under the old system, incomes between $20,700 and $50,000 are subject to rates of 34 per cent and 43 per cent. The new system applies one lower rate of 30 per cent on all income between $20,000 and $50,000. This will mean that around 81 per cent of taxpayers will have a top tax rate of 30 per cent or less compared to 30 per cent of taxpayers at the moment.</para><para>Low and middle income taxpayers, in particular, will keep more of their wages. This incentive encourages Australians to seek promotion, extra training, and overtime. More effort will now mean more reward for individuals as well as a more productive Australian economy.</para><para>The top rate remains unchanged at 47 per cent for those with annual incomes of more than $75,000.</para><para>The $75,000 threshold will be equal to around 1.7 times average earnings. This will ensure that average earners do not drift into paying the top marginal tax rate, which would otherwise have occurred early in the next century.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Increased fairness</inline></para><para>Madam President, some high earners are avoiding obligations and taking advantage of Government assistance given to low income earners, by converting income into fringe benefits. This way they get their monetary income down to qualify for income support even though their actual remuneration (including benefits) is much higher.</para><para>From the 1999-2000 income year, group certificates will show the full value of fringe benefits received, when the taxable value exceeds $1,000. These benefits will be taken into account when liability for surcharges and eligibility for assistance is being determined.  
</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Conclusion</inline></para><para>Madam President, the Government has received strong endorsement for its management of the Australian economy. We are committed to pushing ahead with economic reforms to build on our achievements and to continue to strengthen the economy so that we can continue to withstand external crises like those affecting our region and other areas of the globe at present.</para><para>Madam President, this package of legislation represents a fundamental economic reform. The need for tax reform has been recognised by governments of both persuasions over the last 30 years. But this is the Government that has acted on it. This is the Government that intends to fix the problem and reform the system notwithstanding opportunistic opposition contrary to the best interests of the nation. These reforms relieve the tax burden for business and exporters, allow scope for substantial personal income tax cuts, and will contribute to a more stable and prosperous Australian economy.</para><para>These are the reforms which will strengthen our economy, our prospects, our living standards, our financial arrangements and secure better opportunities for the future through <inline font-style="italic">A New Tax System</inline> .</para><para>Full details of the measures in the bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum circulated to honourable senators.</para><para>I commend the bill to the Senate.</para><para>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX IMPOSITION—EXCISE) BILL 1998</para><para>This bill is part of the package of 7 bills that ends the wholesale sales tax and introduces the Goods and Services Tax.</para><para>The A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax Imposition—Excise) Bill is one of the 3 Imposition bills in the package which will have the effect of imposing GST on importations and supplies that are liable to GST.

Rates can be 0, 12, 22, 32, 37, 41 or 45 per cent.</para><para>The wholesales sales tax needs to be abolished because it has no logic or design.</para><para>It was introduced in the 1930s and was appropriate for a 1930s economy. But the economy has changed.</para><para>Multiple rates were introduced in 1940 as a war-time measure to encourage resources to flow to "essential" war-related activities.</para><para>Goods were classed according to the standards of the time.</para><para>Radios, watches, and tape recorders which are currently taxed at the `luxury' 32 per cent rate were perceived as war-time luxuries.</para><para>Ad hoc changes to classifications, by both the Parliament and the Courts have resulted in anomalies. And as the economy increasingly becomes a service based economy our indirect tax system applies to a narrowing base, with even higher rates needed to preserve revenue.</para><para>This penalises our manufacturers and exporters. We have a tax chasing an economy long gone:- an absurd system which has no place in a modern economy entering the 21st Century.</para><para>This is the tax the Labor Party is pledged to preserve.</para><para>Goods production now represents less than a quarter of the economy.</para><para>The economy has transformed. The sales tax system has not. Neither has Labor.</para><para>The contribution to tax revenue from income taxation and indirect taxation has changed significantly over time.</para><para>This change has been particularly marked over the last 20 years since the deregulation of many sectors of the Australian economy.</para><para>Over the 1980s, indirect taxation (comprising principally excise and sales taxes on goods) represented 7.2 per cent of GDP compared to 5.8 per cent of GDP over the 1990s.</para><para>In comparison, direct taxation (individuals and companies) increased from 16.4 per cent of GDP to 17.2 per cent of GDP.</para><para>Over the same period, the composition of revenue to the Commonwealth budget has also changed, with the share of indirect tax falling from 27 per cent to 24 per cent, whilst the share of income tax has increased from 63 per cent to 70 per cent.</para><para>There are two approaches to addressing this automatic and continuing shift in the tax mix.</para><para>The Government's approach is to replace the complexity and unfairness of the WST with a simpler and fairer broad based, low rate, indirect 
 tax which will ensure a secure and stable revenue base to fund government services.</para><para>The alternative approach would be to maintain an outdated and unfair system which cannot provide the revenue required to sustain the level of government services Australians demand and deserve.</para><para>In 1993, the Labor Government told the Australian people before the election that they could have tax cuts without reform of the indirect tax system.</para><para>After it was re-elected it took away the tax cuts and increased WST rates across the board, without any compensation whatsoever.</para><para>This bill will abolish the wholesale sales tax. It will put to an end and finally bury that sorry episode.</para><para>Madam President, this bill provides an opportunity to sweep away the outmoded, outdated complex 1930s style wholesale sales tax.</para><para>Those senators who oppose tax reform and support the Wholesale Sales Tax will vote against this bill. They will vote for the indirect tax system of the 1930s. But they will also be voting against a secure indirect tax base growing in proportion to the economy, securing growth revenue for essential State services and removing the extraordinary high tax burden which will otherwise be imposed on average earners.</para><para>Full details of the measures in the bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum circulated to honourable senators.</para><para>I commend the bill to the Senate.</para><para>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (PERSONAL INCOME TAX CUTS) BILL 1998</para><para>Madam President, after winning the 1996 election, the Government inherited a $10.3 billion deficit which has now been turned into a surplus. This sound fiscal management has provided the ability for all Australians to share the benefits from sound economic policy through $13 billion of income tax cuts delivered by the Government's new tax system.</para><para>The tax cuts will more than compensate taxpayers for the introduction of the GST, and will also make it possible for ordinary Australians to save and invest.</para><para>They will also deliver substantial income tax savings to families and average earners.</para><para>Full details of the measures in the bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum circulated to honourable senators.</para><para>I commend the bill to the Senate.</para><para></para><para>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (COMPENSATION MEASURES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT) BILL 1998</para><para>This bill gives effect to a number of important measures which are part of the Government's new tax system.</para><para>First, extra assistance will be provided to families in recognition of the additional costs in bringing up children and the sacrifices that families make.</para><para>The tax-free thresholds of the Family Tax Initiative introduced by this Government in 1997 are to be doubled. This increase will benefit eligible families with dependent children by at least $140 a year per child with extra benefits of at least $350 a year flowing to eligible single income families with one child or more under the age of 5.</para><para>In addition, the family allowance income test will be eased by increasing the level of income that a family can earn before maximum rate payments are effected. The income test free area will be increased to $28,200.</para><para>When the income test free area is exceeded, the new taper which applies to reduce a family's rate of payment will be 30 cents in the dollar, a significant decrease on the current taper rate of 50 cents in the dollar.</para><para>The changes to the family income test, combined with the personal income tax cuts, will increase greatly the rewards for low-to-middle income working families from working harder. It also ensures families are substantially better off when moving to full-time employment.</para><para>Secondly, this bill provides for the maximum rate of all income support payments provided to social security and veterans' pensioners, other social security recipients and students in receipt of income support to be increased by 4 per cent on 1 July 2000.</para><para>The 4 per cent increase will raise the level of these payments by significantly more than the expected impact of tax reform on prices, as measured by the CPI. The increase incorporates a component that represents an advance on future CPI increases that result from the impact of tax reform on the CPI. That is, this arrangement is considerably more beneficial to income support recipients because indexed payments are being provided `up-front' rather than later, as occurs under current indexation arrangements.</para><para>The overall effect is that not only are indexation increases being provided up-front, but income support payments will be 1.5 per cent higher than they would have, had normal indexation arrangements applied.</para><para>In addition, Madam President, the income and assets test free areas that apply to social security, 
 veterans' and student income support payments will be increased by 2.5 per cent.</para><para>The income test for pensions will also be eased by reducing the current 50 per cent taper rate to 40 per cent. This measure will enable pensioners to keep an extra 10 cents of pension for every dollar of income they receive over the income free area. It will be of particular benefit to age and service pensioners and to self funded retirees with modest incomes who will, as a result, be eligible for part rate pension and associated benefits.</para><para>Madam President, this bill is an important plank in the new tax system. Taken together with the other elements of the new tax system, it ensures that all Australians share in the benefits of tax reform.</para><para>Full details of the measures in the bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum circulated to honourable senators.</para><para>I commend the bill to the Senate.</para><para>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (BONUSES FOR OLDER AUSTRALIANS) BILL 1998</para><para>This bill recognises the special circumstances of older Australians with savings and investments, including those who receive income from superannuation pensions and annuities.</para><para>In addition to other measures associated with the new tax system, such as the income tax cuts, increases in income support payments, refundable imputation credits and increased tax rebates, this bill provides further compensation to help maintain the value of the savings and retirement income of senior Australians.</para><para>The bill will assist both age pensioners and self funded retirees. Australian residents aged 60 years or more with income from a range of savings and investments, and with incomes of up to $30,000 a year will be able to receive a savings bonus of up to $1,000. If they are of age pension age, or above, and do not receive any income support payments, a bonus of up to $3,000 may be payable.</para><para>These amounts will be tax-free and will not be counted as income for the purposes of the social security or veterans' income tests.</para><para>In claiming their bonus, senior Australians will have the security of dealing with agencies they already interact with in relation to tax or income support payments, and will have the usual rights of review and appeal.</para><para>The measures in this bill, particularly when combined with the other measures associated with the new tax system that I mentioned earlier, gives effect to the Government's clear commitment to reforming the tax system in a manner which is fair and generous to senior Australians. 
</para><para>Full details of the measures in the bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum circulated to honourable senators.</para><para>I commend the bill to the Senate.</para><para>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (INCOME TAX LAWS AMENDMENT) BILL 1998</para><para>This bill will amend the income tax law so that the aged pensions bonus payments will be exempt from income tax, and will not be taken into account in calculating their net exempt income for the purposes of determining deductibility of tax losses of earlier income years.</para><para>This will ensure that persons entitled to receive the bonus payments will receive the full benefit of those payments.</para><para>This bill also amends the Income Tax Regulations to provide further assistance to senior Australians by increasing the maximum pensioner tax rebate and the tax rebate for low income aged persons. These rebates will be increased by $250 (for single people) and $175 (for each of a couple) per year. These increases will come into effect from 1 July 2000. The higher rebates will ensure an extra 70,000 pensioners and self-funded retirees are not required to pay tax and will provide an extra tax cut to 330,000 senior Australians.</para><para>The last income tax measure associated with this bill removes the savings tax offset.</para><para>Under the new tax system this rebate will no longer be necessary as elements of the package—including the increase in the personal income tax threshold, significantly reduced marginal rates and refundable imputation credits—will have a major impact on incentives for Australians to work and save. Taxpayers will still be able to claim the offset in their income tax returns for the 1998-99 income year.</para><para>Full details of the measures in the bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum circulated to honourable senators.</para><para>I commend the bill to the Senate.</para><para>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (AGED CARE COMPENSATION MEASURES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT) BILL 1998</para><para>This bill reflects the Government's commitment to ensure that older Australians will benefit from a better and fairer taxation and income support system. It demonstrates that the needs of older Australians remain a priority for this Government.</para><para>The Government announced, as part of the taxation reforms, a 4 per cent increase to the full age 
 pension. Increased rates of assistance will be provided to ensure that recipients receive a real (after CPI) increase in their pensions of 1.5 per cent, thereby enabling them to receive a fair share of the benefits of the new tax system.</para><para>The Government is committed to quarantining this increase from the formula used to calculate residential aged care fees. This bill amends the Aged Care Act 1997 to implement these commitments.</para><para>Currently, the basic fee is 85c in the dollar of the maximum single rate age pension. While the pension is being increased by 4 per cent as a compensation measure, the basic fee will not rise. Effectively, the fee becomes 85c in each 104c of pension. Accordingly, the proportion of the pension represented by the fee falls from 85 per cent to 81.5 per cent. Thus, setting the proportion of pension payable in residential care fees at 81.5 per cent ensures that the full 4 per cent increase to pensioners is passed on.</para><para>It also removes the possibility that residential care providers could seek to gain a windfall by charging care recipients extra in fees. Providers will be limited by legislation to only charging 81.5 per cent or face the possibility of sanctions being imposed if they exceed this amount.</para><para>This bill also ensures that non-pensioners are protected from increases in residential aged care fees as a result of the pension increase. Currently non-pensioner fees rise in line with indexation to pensions. This bill breaks this nexus with pension indexation ensuring that the 4 per cent increase in pension does not cause the non-pensioner fee to rise.</para><para>Lastly, this bill ensures that war widows and widowers will continue to pay the same in income tested fees as other care recipients with the same total incomes. This amendment is necessary to maintain parity in fees as a result of changes to the pension withdrawal rate under the taxation compensation package for older Australians.</para><para>Not only does this bill guarantee that no older Australian will be worse off, it ensures that pensioners will be considerably better off as a result of the taxation reforms. The pension increase will see single aged pensioners receiving an <inline font-weight="bold">extra</inline>  $15.50 per fortnight and pensioner couples an <inline font-weight="bold">extra</inline>  $25.50 per fortnight—which is a large increase in income for older Australians. This increase lifts the full pension rate above the minimum level of 25 per cent of male average weekly earnings that is <inline font-weight="bold">already</inline>  guaranteed in legislation by the Government.</para><para>This bill demonstrates that the needs and aspirations of older Australians continue to be of primary importance to the Government. Older Australians will continue to benefit from access to quality residential care based on need.

The election result was one that I am sure many opposite did not expect. In fact, they were very confident that they would get the opposite result. They did not and they now consign themselves to three more years of hard labour.</para><para>I do want to pay tribute to my colleagues, particularly those in the Liberal and National parties—Senator Boswell in particular for his sterling leadership of the junior coalition partner. He was there shoulder to shoulder when he was needed. He did understand the real benefits for rural Australia in a number of the policies that we took into the last election and he was prepared to see it through. So I think he deserves a particular commendation.</para><para>I would also like to pay tribute to the work of Senator Hill, as the Leader of the Government in the Senate, and to you, Madam President, for the way you have conducted yourself under very difficult circumstances on many occasions from the likes of me and others. You have always managed to control proceedings in a manner that has ensured that people at the end of the day respect the chair and all that ought to be respected in this chamber.</para><para>I would also like to pay particular tribute to the work of the whip and the whip's clerk, Senator Calvert and Claire Dace, who is taking leave of absence—this is well earned and I hope that we will be seeing her back here in the not too distant future. I also pay 
 tribute to Senator Coonan for her rapid ascension to a position of high eminence and her great enthusiasm and enjoyment for the role. We have certainly appreciated the work that she has carried out on our behalf.</para><para>I also pay tribute to the tremendous work of the Senate PLO, Gail Bansemer, and her assistant, Jacquie. They go beyond the call of duty, but nonetheless they are always there when needed. I would also like to thank the officials and the clerks, John Vander Wyk in particular, all Senate staff, the attendants, security, transport, Hansard and Library officers—all of whom ensure the smooth running of the Senate.</para><para>I simply conclude by hoping that the Christmas season will enable all of us to have a well-earned rest, to reflect on what might have been and what is ahead of us in the year to come. I trust that those on the other side of the chamber will come back to this Senate chamber refreshed, aware of the errors of their ways and prepared to be constructive and embrace sensible government policy. If that is the case, then we will not be having any more late night sittings. We will simply be able to get on with delivering more good government for Australia. Merry Christmas to all.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Valedictory</title><page.no>1780</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>23:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>1780</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—There have been some notable events during 1998 including the Constitutional Convention. Also I suppose, if you like, the double dissolution brinkmanship of the coalition government on Wik, on Telstra, on unfair dismissals and on the public service bills. We had a phoney election campaign around those sorts of issues for a long period of time. We then had the real election campaign for the election on 3 October.</para></talk.start><para>In a debate like this, the magnificent performance of Kim Beazley as Leader of the Labor Party ought to be recorded. It was the most successful performance ever by a first-term opposition in the history of Australian politics. I know that all my colleagues in the Labor Senate team, all our caucus members and also all the rank and file members of the 
 Labor Party are very proud of the way our leader performed during that election campaign. We are also very grateful for the leadership that he has demonstrated since our election defeat in 1996.</para><para>Can I also thank, as is traditional in speeches of this nature, those who support the work of parliamentarians and senators in particular. I thank the Clerks, Harry Evans and Anne Lynch, who as we know work most diligently and have done so for the last year. I particularly want to single out Rosemary Laing and her assistant, Kathleen Griffiths, because they have a particular role and responsibility with non-government senators. We do appreciate what they have done.</para><para> We also appreciate a range of other Senate officers: the Black Rod and his staff, the Department of the Senate, all the office services, the Senate committees, the information services, the research section. We should record that Shiva Sabihi of the electronic publishing unit was awarded the Department of the Senate's meritorious service medallion and certificate for exceptional and outstanding performance in her work on the Senate Internet site. The Parliamentary Education Office was a joint national winner in the secondary school category of the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline>'s Awards for Excellence in Educational Publishing, presented by the Australian Publishers Association, for the education resource kit entitled <inline font-style="italic">Your Future—Your Say: the Constitution in your life</inline>.</para><para> This year we have also seen a couple of long-serving and valuable members of staff move out of the department: Gordon Kimber, I recall, went to the ANU and Martin Blyth-Marshall from records management left after more than 20 years of service. We need to acknowledge that, very sadly, Greg Kelly of the human resource management section passed away in August after a 10-week battle with cancer. I also acknowledge the Table Office, the Senate PLO and her assistant, the attendants and those involved in the security of this place. Phil Botha, a security attendant, also passed away on 20 July this year. Our sympathy and condolences go to both Phil and Greg's families again.</para><para> The Senate committees have worked diligently over the last year, as we have come to expect. I have most contact with the finance and public administration committee. I suppose I can be—at least in part—blamed for them sitting so late at night during estimates hearings and the like. We appreciate in all the committees the committee staff who chase answers to questions on notice, while as everyone knows the government sits on these answers for months on end.</para><para> We ought to recognise again that Stewart Rendell, the estimates officer for the Economics Committee, won a gold medal in hammer throwing at the Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur. I think his throw was 74.88 metres. That was a fantastic thing for Stewart—and for all of us. It is worth remembering that Stewart is supported by the Department of the Senate as a participant in the Olympic Job Opportunity Program. This means that Stewart, like other elite athletes participating in this program, can fit in his work hours around his demanding training and competition schedules. I do  not think we really understand how he manages to do all that, but we know he does. We know we subject him to hours of estimates hearings and the like, but he has really delivered for Australia at KL. We all appreciate it.</para><para> To you, Madam President, and your staff and to Madam Deputy President and her staff, we appreciate and acknowledge the efforts that have been put in. We also thank the Library, Hansard, the Procedure Office, the Commonwealth drivers and many others around this building whom I do not have time to acknowledge by name. But I want to say on behalf of the opposition that we sincerely appreciate the support that we receive from them throughout the year. We would like to take the opportunity that this debate provides us in thanking them for that assistance and support.</para><para> Turning to the opposition in the Senate, let me thank my colleagues for their tremendous dedication, commitment and support over the past 12 months. I want to thank the opposition whips—Senator Evans prior to the election and Senator O'Brien since the election—for their great dedication and efforts. They 
 have been very ably assisted by Senator Denman, by Senator Conroy prior to the election and by Senator Quirke since the election. One of the real indications of their success is the fact that it is very rare for the Labor Party to have to come in and say, `We have fouled up a division; we have to do something about it.' We appreciate all that they do.</para><para>I thank the Manager of Opposition Business, Senator Carr, for his great support and assistance over the year. I acknowledge the government office holders. The opposition whip's clerk, Ruth Webber, left in Christmas last year and Rachel Nilon took over. We welcome Lara Giddings to one of the most difficult jobs in this building. We appreciate all that Lara has done since she picked up the cudgels on our behalf. We also appreciate her predecessors, who worked so ably in the same job. We acknowledge the government whip's clerk, Claire Dace, the staff of Senator Calvert and the government whips.</para><para>The opposition has two new senators this year, Senator Hutchins from New South Wales and Senator Crossin, both of whom have already made a very important contribution to our Labor Senate team. We should acknowledge that they have replaced two senators, Senator Bob Collins and Senator Belinda Neal, whom, of course, we miss.</para><para>The Senate opposition team had a number of staff who left after the election. They include Jill Hardy and Mark Hough, who worked for Senator Schacht; Jo Scard, who worked for Senator Cook; and Toni Moreton and Anne Holmes, who worked for Senator Neal. We miss them and wish them well in the future. I particularly acknowledge my deputy, Peter Cook, for his advice, support and assistance over the past 12 months. We wish that all have a well deserved holiday and hope that everyone comes back renewed for more vigorous warfare in the year ahead.</para><para>I do not think those senators and staff who are involved in the GST inquiry will get much of a break. But to everyone who has assisted to us over the past 12 months, let me say on behalf of the opposition that we sincerely appreciate it. We wish everyone a happy Christmas and best wishes for the New Year.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Valedictory</title><page.no>1782</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>23:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>1782</page.no><name role="metadata">Boswell, Sen Ronald</name><name role="display">Senator BOSWELL</name><name.id>YE4</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is time to wish everyone a happy Christmas. Unfortunately, the contribution of a couple of senators has poured a bit of cold water on what should be a fairly happy occasion tonight as we depart for our various homes. I think I will do my best to ignore that contribution in the spirit of Christmas and say thank you to the many people who serve this parliament: Kate, the person who looks after us at meal times; the attendants; the car drivers; Hansard; and all the staff. My personal thanks go to my own staff, including Joanne and Pru and all the people who work in my office.</para></talk.start><para>It has been a particularly hard year for the National Party. We started in the Constitutional Convention in February and went through a very hard native title debate, which was particularly pertinent to our constituents. The latest findings by a judge in Western Australia have put up for grabs all the hard work we have gone through here. I do not know where we will go from there. We will have to readdress that in the future.</para><para>I thank Senator Hill and Senator Alston. We have tried to work together in the best interests of our constituents. We have our differences from time to time, but we always honour the coalition. One of the hardest times I had here was in the Telstra debate, where the opposition guys gave us plenty. Senator Schacht said that we were getting led down the garden track. But there is $670 million now locked into legislation in Telstra.

I would like to thank my deputy whip Helen Coonan and Bill O'Chee, who is the National Party whip, for the wonderful cooperation that they have given me. Of course, the reason that I stand tonight is to pay particular thanks to Claire Dace, who is going overseas for 12 months next year and abandoning her office and leaving me on my own. But I am pleased to say that I have managed to poach Suzanne 
 Ferguson from Bill O'Chee's office, and I am sure that she will fill Claire's shoes very aptly.</para><para>I also thank my colleagues from Tasmania, Kerry O'Brien and Kay Denman, for their cooperation.

I wish to say a few words before concluding, particularly to the people in the Joint House Department, many of whom work in the basement of the building. We tend to focus on ourselves, the chamber and those who are most closely associated with what we are doing, but I think from time to time we should all remember that there are a large number of people in the rest of the building without whom the whole of the parliament, and the building itself, would not function. Many in the Joint House Department, in the Library, in Hansard and in the Parliamentary Information Systems Office are absolutely vital to the running of the Senate, and of the whole

It will be a bit of an anticlimax after all of the comments that have been made, and the best wishes for the Christmas and New Year period, but I do feel a necessity to put on the record my comments in relation to volunteer organisations. </para></talk.start><para>As you would be well aware, Madam President, volunteer organisations are the backbone of the Australian community, particularly in rural and regional Australia. They represent the best qualities of Australian culture—that is, self-sacrifice, mateship, support and reliability.</para><para>The Australasian Assembly of Volunteer Fire Brigade Associations is one of those organisations. As a peak body, it represents a combined membership of around 330,000 volunteer firefighters, through 12 volunteer fire brigade associations represented from both Australia and New Zealand. These volunteers place their personal safety at risk every time they volunteer their services. They are not paid for the risk, or for their time and effort. In the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> on 4 December 1998, the New South Wales rural fire service Commissioner Philip Koperberg said:</para><para>If the state had to pay for its 77,000 firefighters across 2,400 brigades, it would cost $1.5 billion instead of the current $70 million budget. With 74,000 in Victoria, 17,000 in South Australia, 5,000 in Tasmania and thousands more in Western Australia, the Northern Territory and Queensland, the national costs would be astronomical.</para><para>The Leader of the Opposition has proposed that a monument be built to honour these volunteers and the valuable service that they have provided to Australia. This proposition has been fully supported by the Prime Minister. These volunteers, though thoroughly deserving and long overdue for it, have never asked for any form of recognition. They would rather have an adequate level of funding so as to be able to protect their safety than a stone monolith on a hill somewhere. I would hope that our government is supportive enough to provide both.</para><para>The Australasian Assembly of Volunteer Fire Brigade Associations is attempting to access funding from the federal government so that it can attend important standards safety committees for its members. The assembly acts as a representative body at national level on issues that affect these volunteer fire brigades. It participates through representations to the Australasian Fire Authorities Council and federal government standards committees on safety equipment.</para><para>Currently, the assembly is represented on six federal standards committees that deal directly with firefighting safety equipment. It is required to attend committees on helmets for firefighters; occupational protective helmets, which include the new bush firefighters helmets; protective clothing; clothing for protection against thermal hazards; clothing for protection against hazardous substances and breathing apparatus for firefighters. Some recent practical examples of the effectiveness of the work of the Assembly of Volunteer Fire Brigade Associations show the valuable role that it plays.</para><para>A recent issue that has arisen is which type of material a helmet chinstrap is manufactured from. Manufacturers indicate that it is cheaper and more comfortable to make elasticised chinstraps but, from experience, the volunteer firefighters can show that, under severe heat in fires, an elasticised chinstrap will melt. The practical result of this is that a firefighter could have it burnt into their throat.</para><para>Recently Standards Australia drew up a new standard for identification of LPG powered vehicles. Several of the state associations asked the assembly to represent them collectively so there would be a uniform approach to the standard across Australia. This achieved an outcome where the markings are more visible so those emergency service workers can recognise a vehicle with LPG on board. This achievement has gone into a draft standard that is out for public comment at the moment. This change has a potential to avoid death and injury at both accident and fire scenes through confusion over unrecognisable markings.</para><para>The assembly has recently held discussions with the Federal Office of Road Safety. Volunteer associations of South Australia and Victoria brought to its attention that it takes a significantly longer time to extricate people from heavy transport accidents than other accidents. Due to this longer time taken, the patient outcome has been very poor. The assembly has suggested safety changes which include changes to limit injuries when vehicles roll over in accidents.</para><para>More and more volunteer fire brigades are being utilised to carry out roadside accident 
 rescue. As a result of the approach by the assembly, the Federal Office of Road Safety will now keep separate data on heavy vehicle accidents. This data will support an application for a design ruling from the Federal Office of Road Safety to have mandatory rollover protection for heavy transport vehicles. It could take up to five hours for a brigade to cut a driver out of a heavy haulage vehicle. If this could be shortened, in many instances lives would be saved.</para><para>These examples highlight just a few of the valuable contributions that this organisation has achieved so far. With government funding and adequate support, firefighters will be able to contribute their knowledge and practical experience and in this way save the lives of their colleagues. The assembly raises its own income solely from affiliation fees of $500 per association per year, which is not enough for it to adequately do its job. It can effectively run its organisation with affiliation fees but cannot meet the additional expenses associated with its representation on various standards committees. When approaching governments about funding for these projects, it is inevitably faced with politicians passing the buck. It is continuously told that bushfires are a state government responsibility. No-one wants to take responsibility for this matter and just provide the money.</para><para>The standards committees that it is represented on meet several times per year in different capital cities. Currently the assembly has only barely enough funds to pay travel costs in order to attend some meetings. It cannot attend all meetings, and its representatives must meet their own accommodation expenses. This organisation plays a most valuable role in providing information that directly affects the lives of volunteer bush firefighters. The safety equipment that is designed from these standards will help protect lives in the future, and it is essential that those people who use that equipment are represented in determining the standards.</para><para>This association is asking for a small amount of $15,000 per annum in order to effectively represent volunteer firefighters on these committees. It is about time that the federal government took responsibility for this 
 matter and provided the assembly with these funds. The ability of firefighters to contribute to the development of standards that will protect them and the onerous tasks that they carry out would be a much more effective monument to their significant contribution to the Australian community than some concrete monolith.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Transport Infrastructure: Private Investment</title><page.no>1786</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>23:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>1786</page.no><name role="metadata">Tierney, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator TIERNEY</name><name.id>O15</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise tonight to outline to the Senate the many advantages of private investment in Australia's transport infrastructure. We hear over and over again about the congestion in our cities. Of course, in such a large country, businesses right across the country face the problem of the tyranny of distance and have faced for many decades an inadequate road and general transport system. There is a great need to improve Australia's transport infrastructure.</para></talk.start><para>When I was in the United States 20 years ago, I came across a man who berated me for the very poor state of Australia's roads. He had travelled around the United States on their magnificent expressway system. When he went round Australia in the early 1970s, he just could not believe the state of our roads. But, with a country the size of the United States and with a tax base one-twentieth or five per cent of that of the United States, obviously we have a great deal of difficulty keeping our infrastructure system up to scratch. What has made it particularly difficult is we have insisted for so many years that this sort of infrastructure be totally government funded, that it all be funded out of the public purse. We have to ask ourselves very seriously whether this approach has delivered us the best possible outcomes.</para><para>Increasingly, the private sector is getting involved in this sort of investment. So a major policy decision that faces us in this parliament—and, indeed, in all the state parliaments—is: what is the appropriate mix of government, private and combination of government and private in the development of Australia's infrastructure?</para><para>Unlike the previous ALP government, which scrapped the essential black spots program, this coalition government is committed to maintaining and improving Australia's transport infrastructure. The key question to ask is: is it really—as the Labor Party and many of the public say—best way to go through public investment only?</para><para>About 40 years ago a private American company put forward a proposal to build the Sydney to Newcastle freeway; it proposed to build it at no public expense. The only condition that company put on the proposal was a toll which would be on the freeway for 20 years, and then the company would hand it back to the government. The then Cahill Labor government refused on ideological grounds to allow this proposal to go ahead. It then took governments over 30 years to complete that project.</para><para>One of the advantages of private money is that the money is up front straightaway, and the project gets built at a very fast rate. Private developers have to do this to get a proper return on their investment. We were deprived for many years of proper roads between Sydney and Newcastle. Fortunately, after 35 years that situation has been corrected. It needs correcting in many other areas of Australia, and that is why we need to embrace more enthusiastically private money in public infrastructure.</para><para>It is starting to become more common, as a number of the projects around Sydney show. The building of the M2 motorway in northern Sydney is an example. The current eastern distributor is another example. A matter that was raised this week in this parliament, in terms of Sydney's transport, was the western orbital road which would complete the link road around Sydney; and decisions have to be made on that as to what is the most appropriate mix of public and private investment.</para><para>There are several reasons why private investment is becoming more common. There are ownership conflicts between government as the owner and government as the regulator. It reduces government deficits and it improves international competitiveness. Also, people are starting to question why the government 
 should own assets such as power stations, telecommunications facilities and transport infrastructure. By putting a lot of government resources into these things that are often much better run by the private sector, we tie up valuable and scarce capital and, therefore, deprive other sectors that are very much within the purview of government from the benefits of that money. So moving towards a system where we have more private investment in public infrastructure frees up more money for the health system, for the education system and for the welfare system.</para><para>One of the best examples and state-of-the-art practices in terms of the way in which this private infrastructure money is working for Sydney at the moment relates to the eastern distributor. This is the main route that will occur in the next few years between Sydney and the airport. It will alleviate major traffic problems and the very worst bottleneck in Sydney, which is at Taylor Square. It will be a very important conduit during the 2000 Olympic Games. There is an expected opening two-way traffic of 80,000 vehicles per day. But here is the big bonus: the company that is building it and the financiers have, under the contract, agreed to transfer this eastern distributor back to the government for nothing after a period of 48 years. So, despite making no outlays at all for this project, the government will own the road.</para><para>Allowing private sector investment in these types of projects also transfers inherent risks, such as project cost overruns, to the private sector, saving the government money. Macquarie Bank has outlined the benefits from private sector participation in the eastern distributor as follows: the liberation of public funds for social infrastructure; the private sector being better equipped to deliver and manage economic infrastructure; the $600 million freed up to be used for other social infrastructure projects, such as hospitals and schools; and the fact that the road will be handed back to the government free of charge at the end of the concession period.</para><para>Private sector investment also helps get infrastructure projects under way that much more quickly. The eastern distributor that is now being built is well ahead of schedule. 
 Macquarie Bank has argued that, without private investment in the eastern distributor, it would not have been completed prior to the commencement of the Olympic Games. This scenario would have been an absolute disaster for Australia's hosting of the games and would have led to the sort of traffic complaints that we saw in Atlanta.</para><para>So why don't we see even more private investment and less public? The reality is that, out there, the public is not sure of the benefits of private investment over public. Popular criticism is that it is `selling off the family jewels', that it will result in a loss of service and lower safety standards and a loss of job security. However, in reality, there are many more advantages than disadvantages. It can deliver to the community infrastructure way ahead of the time that it would have come into being with public funding. The projects are completed more efficiently on time and on budget and on a more economically viable basis.</para><para>The advantages of private investment in public infrastructure far outweigh the disadvantages. The challenge before us in this parliament and certainly in the private sector is to work very hard to sell that message to the public.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><adjournment><adjournmentinfo><time.stamp>23:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>1787</page.no></adjournmentinfo><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senate adjourned at 11.44 p.m. until 12.30 p.m. on Monday, 15 February 1999</inline></para></adjournment><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>1787</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tabling</title><page.no>1787</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The Special Minister of State (Senator Ellison) tabled the following government documents:</para><para>Anti-Dumping Authority Act—Anti-Dumping Authority—Report for 1997-98 (Final report).</para><para>Australian Political Exchange Council—Report for 1997-98.</para><para>Australian Science, Technology and Engineering Council Repeal Act—Australian Science, Technology and Engineering Council—Report for the period 1 July 1997 to 18 December 1998 (Final report).</para><para>Australian Securities Commission Act—Companies Auditors and Liquidators Disciplinary Board—Report for 1997-98.</para><para>Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act—Reports for 1997-98—

factors that contribute to the differences in labour market performance across the States and Territories. For example, the States and Territories generally rely on different industries for economic and employment growth. As such, any changes in policy or economic conditions which affect sectors in a non-uniform manner can be expected to have different impacts on employment. Similarly, characteristics such as population size and growth, natural attributes and climatic conditions also contribute to the differences in employment growth.</para><para>The reduction in the number of unfair dismissal applications indicates that progress has been made under the current legislation in discouraging inappropriate applications. This in itself would not be expected to create additional jobs in the small business sector. The Government considers that further change is required to recognise the particular circumstances of small businesses as well as to provide greater certainty for employers about the length of an employee's employment before that person can initiate an unfair dismissal application (no change is proposed in respect of unlawful dismissal applications). It is necessary to provide security for employers that they will not be subject to inappropriate applications. This is provided for in the Workplace Relations Amendment (Unfair Dismissals) Bill 1998, presently before the Parliament.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Youth Wage Rate</title><page.no>1790</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 14)</subtitle><id.no>14</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>1790</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator Murray</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, upon notice, on 10 November 1998:</para></talk.start><para>How many workers are there on youth rates: (a) by industry; (b) by State and Territory; and (c) by each of the 6 industrial relations systems operative in Australia.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>1790</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator Alston</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><para>There is no source of data that can provide all of this information.
