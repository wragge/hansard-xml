In the context of this second reading debate I think it is a worthwhile venture to examine Telstra the organisation. It is currently a majority publicly owned corporation that has a life and a culture all of its own. As telecommunications become more profitable, successive governments have relied on dividends returned to the public purse to fund social imperatives—that is, until now.</para></talk.start><para>Let us introduce a human factor. Telstra workers have borne the brunt of deregulation and competition, and any innovations in efficiencies that have arisen out of that are a credit to them. Then came privatisation. Suddenly the goals that were being pursued—with considerable pain and 25,000 job losses, I might add—and these achievements were no longer in the public good. Any detail surrounding Telstra's restructuring had to be painfully extracted through their estimates process. I am sure many will recall the names Project Strawman and Project Mercury which were internal plans by Telstra to deconstruct Telstra research laboratories in the first instance and sack over 20,000 workers in the second.</para><para>After all the restructuring, all the tension, the reduced investment in R&amp;D, the job losses, the beneficiaries of Telstra's large dividend will be not the Australian public but private shareholders. Out of the hands of many into the hands of a few. The efforts of everyone who has put their time in with Telstra over the years, or Telecom as it was formerly known, are now focused on cold, harsh and dry economic returns. The focus of 
 a privatised Telstra is on how to extract maximum profit for minimum service. Evidence of this comes in the form of complaints about billing and service having risen by almost 40 per cent.</para><para>If a customer focus is his weakness, chief executive Frank Blount's strength is to deconstruct a telecommunications company. He brought with him the corporate trends from the late 1980s and has spiced up his life by reincarnating them in Australia. I can picture the four-step plan now. First, sop up all the company loyalty built over many years and refocus it towards a lean, mean corporate machine, ready to compete in the new paradigm of telecommunications. There is some merit in that strategy, although exporting the goodwill of all those Telstra workers leaves a lot to be desired in management practice. Then came the change of government and privatisation raised the stakes.</para><para>The second step was this: keep the smile on your face while your workers get sacked, your R&amp;D funding is plundered, your export opportunities are squandered and critical regional projects are dumped. The main game here is the bottom line: tidy up the books. The third step in the plan was to brief the minister, give the doormat the lines and promise to say lots of nice things about him, put him in front of a camera or a Senate estimates committee or his party room, wind him up and let him go.</para><para>The fourth step was to deliver massive salary increases to himself and all his senior management mates, sit back and contemplate retirement. There's another job well done, Mr Blount. You have done over another telecommunications company and made lots of shareholders rich. Won't that look good on your CV? Never mind that Australia's telecommunications infrastructure is left as a shadow of its former self. It is not your responsibility any longer.</para><para>You may think that I am being unduly harsh on just one participant in this strategy of privatisation, but consider this: corporate trends do not just happen. They do not just miraculously occur overnight. People manage these agendas, they create strategies to forward them and they give them a life of their 
 own. Privatisation of telecommunications carriers around the world is part of that global trend and it is the government that has the responsibility of realising the social and economic value of keeping a carrier in public hands.</para><para>This government have failed in their responsibility. It is not surprising that they have, given the leadership void. It is not surprising that the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts (Senator Alston) does not have the capacity to see that Australia is uniquely placed to  show the rest of the world what can be gained from harnessing telecommunications for the betterment of all, be they city dwellers or those in rural communities.</para><para>I now turn to an issue that I think is one of great importance and looks at more the cutting edge of telecommunications and future communication services—that being the Internet. I believe that privatisation of Telstra will result in increased prices for access to the Internet. We know already that Telstra have a propensity to discriminate against those in rural and regional areas for access. Only 13 per cent of adults living in non-metropolitan areas use the Internet. That is half of city net users. Looking at it another way, about 2½ million Internet users live in metropolitan areas, while only 516,000 live in rural, regional or remote areas.</para><para>The reason for the slow Internet take-up by rural people is due to a combination of overpricing and inadequate services. There have been a number of reports that the high level of rural interest in the Internet is being hampered by the high cost of access. Telstra's own product, Big Pond, charges remote users $7 per hour plus local call access compared with their city rate, which is between 80c and $1.50. I think Ross Wheeler, manager of Albury Local Internet, summed up the situation best when he told a newspaper that his business survives on antipathy and antagonism towards Telstra.</para><para>A closer look at Telstra's retail Internet product, Big Pond Business, shows how blatantly they discriminate against rural and regional users. Telstra uses an arbitrary 85-kilometre radius around regional centres to 
 impose a higher charge which they call their rural charge. Regional users themselves have a much larger rate to pay just because they live in the regions. Telstra have been unable to demonstrate the technical need for such higher charging. It has been imposed without any justification, other than an expectation that the market will pay.</para><para>This structural and economic disadvantage has fuelled genuine concerns by rural constituents about the impact of a privatised Telstra. For instance, the National Farmers Federation has established a company called Farmwide to provide online facilities to 1,000 farm families. This project was funded through the rural telecommunications infrastructure fund and does have some merit. The project itself has legitimate aims, but why didn't Telstra conduct it straight up? The project did not have to come through the regional bribe drawn out through the last one-third privatisation of Telstra. And that is exactly what the RTIF was: it was a $250 million bribe constructed for the sole purpose of securing votes in this place to allow the passage of the one-third sale of Telstra bill.</para><para>Now we are seeing exactly the same tactics being played out, only the government has put $400 million on the table. This shameful bribe is no better than the emotional plea for the $1 billion for the Natural Heritage Trust leading up to the sale of one-third of Telstra, only this time the government is playing on the needs of rural and regional Australia. This is not even a buy for young people and those who care about the environment. It is a buy on the needs of those who are suffering an inadequate service. It is quite interesting to hear John Howard's latest line, `Well, if we don't sell all of Telstra, these people will not get an improved service.'</para><para>Let us have a look at the other ways in which these projects could be funded. There is no reason at all that a Telstra in public hands cannot design and manage these projects themselves. That is the value and the beauty of having a corporation such as Telstra in public hands, so they can do exactly these types of projects. But the most telling indictment of Telstra comes from their experience with the ACCC.</para><para>Even before this bill came before the Senate, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission was forced to intervene because of alleged anticompetitive conduct in breach of the Trade Practices Act. The issue related to the transfer of data over Internet bandwidth. Telstra have proven once and for all that they are prepared to use the courts to protect their profitability against government regulation. This, more than anything else, shows us why there is folly in the government's plan to reregulate and force Telstra to adhere to a greater level of service for rural and regional customers, or even those in metropolitan Australia. This corporation has shown like every other private corporation around the world that they will use every legal mechanism at their disposal to fight regulations that constrict their ability to make a profit.</para><para>At the height of this stand-off between Telstra and the ACCC, Telstra's chief executive warned the government that regulatory changes could endanger plans to privatise Telstra. In other words, he is saying, `Look, Mr Howard, if you want to make so many millions of dollars out of Telstra, you had better not regulate us too harshly.' The blackmail goes both ways. Frank Blount said:</para><para>If we have so many conditions tied around this company . . . if it goes too far I think the Government has to decide `can this really be sold?' [and] if they go too far over the line with conditions wanted around the country, [Telstra] will not be able to be floated.</para><para>In other words, Telstra is saying, `Do not put restrictions on us that will hamper our profit, because we will take you on or put under threat your plans to privatise.'</para><para>Telstra is saying that they are not prepared within their own corporate plan to focus on those in need. And what was Frank Blount's response to all of this? He said that Telstra needed to focus on `delivery of increased shareholder value'. Comments like that should send shivers up the spines of all those sitting opposite, because that is what we are dealing with here. We are dealing with a company that, by its nature as a privatised entity, will not have any choice under Corporations Law but to focus on the interests of their shareholder. That is the nature of beast. When you 
 are living in or existing within that environment, then quite fairly Telstra will have no choice but to conduct themselves in this way.</para><para>The greatest weakness of the minister in this portfolio has been his inability to escape the grip of those within the telecommunications industry sector and the minister's adeptness at constructing political arguments to justify the government's acquiescence to the will of the corporate powers within telecommunications has become his trademark. It would be disappointing if this skill were to be interpreted as having a broad understanding of his portfolio.</para><para>Minister Alston is incapable of lateral thinking, of stepping outside the corporate agendas which surround his government, and hence the social and economic benefits of exploiting the enabling capability of telecommunications infrastructure has been completely ignored. If there is a vision behind the minister's policy considerations, it will be a shallow reflection of the plans articulated in many a timber-lined boardroom.</para><para>When exploring the enabling capacity of telecommunications, one cannot help but turn to Australia's unique character and inherent strengths. Australians have shown a willingness to adopt new technologies—in fact, we are running second in take-up rates of new technologies such as mobile phones and personal computers. There are still some structural inequities with respect to accessing new technologies, including the fact that the less you earn the less likely you are to have access.</para><para>With enhanced services, whole communities have the opportunity to improve their knowledge and understanding of the information revolution. Apart from positively confronting the insecurities that accompany such rapid technological changes, this will empower communities and will give them a voice. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>5449</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is such a pity that there were only three members of the government in the chamber to listen to Senator Lundy's talk, which comprehensively covered the field of argument as to why Telstra should remain in public hands and not be sold across into 
 private hands where the power over its future will remain with the Stock Exchange.</para></talk.start><para>Essentially this debate comes down to the disempowerment of the people with regard to telecommunications in the future: it will have been taken out of the hands of their elected representatives and put into the hands of the Stock Exchange. As Senator Lundy pointed out so eloquently, the primary duty becomes one of servicing not the telephone system but the profit line. There will be an obligation to try to increase profitability on behalf of the shareholders, even where it will patently mean a loss for the people who are being serviced by the corporation.</para><para>One of the sad things about the way in which this matter is being handled in this place is the fact that, while the Senate is here debating this issue at the demand of the government, Senator Colston and Senator Harradine, who three times gagged debate last night in the Senate, the so-called deal for the bush which the government has struck in its pre-election panic negotiations with the National Party has not been revealed to the Senate. In fact, this morning, somebody in the coffee shop told me that it would be revealed on this morning's <inline font-style="italic">John Laws</inline> program—and I do not mention that so that ABC viewers can switch across; I recommend that they do not, that they stay right where they are—but whether or not that is the case what sort of democratic process is it that Senator Harradine, the self-proclaimed father of the Senate, is engaged in?

But, Mr Acting Deputy President, Senator Harradine has become a person who spends maximal time negotiating behind closed doors with the government. People can work that one out for themselves, whatever ruling is made on my description of him. The reality is that, having sold out the indigenous people of this country with whom he danced only a month or so ago, he is now selling out rural and regional Australia, not least Tasmania. But I will come back to that in a little while.</para></talk.start></continue><para>When we look at the process that Senator Harradine and Senator Colston are engaged in here with the government, over the next couple of days we will be seeing a forced debate to get through a bill which the government does not intend to enact in the life of this parliament—in fact, it made a commitment not to. It is a forced debate to get through legislation which the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) promised the nation would not be brought before this parliament at all.</para><para>To do that, the government and the Independent senators have had to kick out of the way a long list of other legislation which the nation requires. This legislation will now not get through this parliament before the government takes the nation to an untimely and unnecessary election nearly a year before it has to happen. If ever there was an argument for fixed date elections, this current politicking by the government highlights it.</para><para>There is the Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Amendment Bill which will not get through the parliament. There are two 
 bills on radiation protection and nuclear safety in Australia, which one would have thought are of great interest to the people in Sydney's southern suburbs, but they will now not get through the Senate because of this turn of events. There is a bill for Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service reform brought by Senator Newman which will now sit on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline> and disappear.</para><para>There is the ANL sale bill brought by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Hill), which likewise has been kicked aside because of the government's political interest in debating this bill which it has declared will not be enacted. There is an aged care amendment bill, which aged people in this country have a right to expect will be debated in their interest, but it will now not be because the aged are being knocked aside due to this government's political considerations.</para><para>There is a national transmission network bill. That comes the closest to the matter in hand, but that too has been kicked aside, as has the Adelaide Airport Curfew Bill 1998 and a bill to do with superannuation called the  Workplace Relations Amendment (Superannuation) Bill 1997 . All those and many other important matters have been knocked aside by the way in which this legislation was steamrolled into the agenda last night by the government, Senator Harradine and Senator Colston.</para><para>When it comes to the impending sale of Telstra, I can do little better than reiterate Senator Margetts's contribution last night where she spoke about the `economic disbenefits' of this move. She said:</para><para>It is important to note that the Office of Asset Sales refused to divulge—</para><para>to the relevant Senate committee—</para><para>crucial figures used in their calculations of the economic benefits—</para><para>of the sale of Telstra. She continued:</para><para>In particular, it was pointed out in the minority report—</para><para>to which Senator Margetts contributed—</para><para>that the estimated future dividend flows were not disclosed, on the basis that it would not be in the financial interests of the Commonwealth. 
</para><para>That is, on the basis of cheating by keeping information from the people. Senator Margetts then said:</para><para>Obviously, the concepts of transparency, accountability and systematic analysis—</para><para>so crucial to Senator Harradine in the past—</para><para>were not considered important by the government in this case, despite all the filibustering about the Charter of Budget Honesty.</para><para>She went on to say:</para><para>At the end of the day, there is no way to definitely determine whether the sale of Telstra will produce net economic benefits.</para><para>The government's economic arithmetic bandied about in the press, however, has been strongly disputed. The first error in the government's projections is the calculation in interest savings on government loans. These estimations have been severely questioned. The government calculation of $4 billion worth of savings on interest repayment is more accurately estimated at $2.5 billion per annum. If you stack this interest saving against the ongoing losses, the hope of net economic benefits is nothing to be enthusiastic about.</para><para>Senator Margetts continued:</para><para>The sale of Telstra will, in fact, generate losses . . . first, public sector savings produced by profits of over $1 billion per annum, either paid into the Commonwealth or used as retained earnings by Telstra to finance investments . . . </para><para>That is the current situation. She then said:</para><para>Secondly, the loss of franking credits: the government does not claim franking credits but private shareholders, however, are sure to claim those credits.</para><para>Professor Quiggin estimates that this will be a cost to revenue of $600 million, rising to $1.8 billion within three years, if Telstra's profits continue to grow at their current rate. Professor Quiggin has estimated that by 2007 Australia would have sustained a loss of $9 billion and beyond that time the loss will increase. For the glory of contributing to the sweet surplus—</para><para>that is a much touted government surplus—</para><para>Australia will lose a revenue stream that could contribute to any number of socially desirable outcomes in the future.</para><para>Consequently, the Greens (WA) are of the belief that the government should heed the warnings that the sale of Telstra is likely to produce a net loss at the current valuation of $40 billion that has been tossed around.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">CAMPBELL</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Campbell</name></talker><para>—Ha!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>QD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name></talker><para>—The Manager of Government Business laughs at that, Mr Acting Deputy President, but you have to remember that this is a once-off sale of an enormous public asset in circumstances which do not warrant it. If in 10 years from now this government were to be in power in foreseeably much worse economic circumstances than those which currently prevail, what would it do; what would it sell then? Maybe it would look around for someone to buy Parliament House, as is the case in the Northern Territory with even that being privatised. Senator Margetts then told of the response from the government—that is, the minister—to the challenge of Professor Quiggin's figures, and she said:</para></talk.start></continue><para>The very warm response that I received from the minister was that, `The last thing I would do is treat Professor Quiggin as any sort of sensible economic analyst on this issue.' The good minister finished his answer with the exceptionally uncompelling evidence that retaining Telstra in public ownership `is simply quite contrary to economic orthodoxy around the world'.</para><para>It is economic orthodoxy, economic rationalism, which Senator Margetts has fought ever since entering this place, and sometimes on her own—witness the debate on the World Trade Organisation where the legislation went through under the last Labor government, supported by the opposition parties. It is that economic rationalism which is leading to the rapid widening of the gap between rich and poor, both within this country and between this country and other countries. That is, in itself, a recipe for future social disruption.</para><para>Besides the obvious loss in terms of social equity when a very important part of public infrastructure, like Telstra, is sold on the Stock Exchange, we have the then ongoing difficulty, which Senator Lundy pointed to this morning, of the disempowerment of the regional people of Australia. If the regions are having difficulties with getting a fair go now—and we heard Senator Lundy's reference to the appalling discrepancy between rates paid in Albury and those paid in the big cities—how much worse will it be after Telstra has been put into private hands, where the most compelling argument for the future 
 will be about what good it will do to the profit lines.</para><para>Senator Lundy outlined the philosophy, as it stands, of the chief executive of Telstra. That let loose will mean that, as we go down the line, the whole aim will be to make Telstra more lean, which means getting rid of more jobs, and more mean, which means the taking of money from the hands of consumers to be put into the hands of Telstra shareholders.</para><para>When it comes to the issue of jobs, one has to ask the absent Senator Harradine—I wish he were here; he has brought this debate on—what happened to your promise of gaining great benefits for Tasmania with the first one-third sale of Telstra?

They know that the people do not believe them when they say that it is going to be good for them. They know that the people are right about that. They are trying to shove this through here in unforecast sitting hours, following a triple gag last night in the Senate, so that that they can get it over and done with and sneak home hoping that nobody has noticed. The appalling thing, as I said earlier today, is that the real information about the government's so-called deal is being announced somewhere else, but not in this place where the debate should be taking place on behalf of the people of this great country of ours.</para><para>I was talking about the Tasmanian situation. We had much fanfare with the first one-third sale of Telstra about the benefits—benefits by way of jobs and benefits for the environment—that Senator Harradine was going to bring to Tasmania through the extra $100 million. Where is the accounting for that? Where is the presentation of the Tasmanian package so that it can be analysed and put to the test? Once again, the Tasmanian people have been set up and cheated by a pronounced package that has not brought home the goods. As far as people like Senator Harradine and Senator Calvert are concerned, as I said earlier, the promise of 170 jobs has led to the loss of 130 jobs.</para><para>When it comes to the environment, which Senator Harradine was going to look after through the part sale of Telstra, we currently have in Tasmania environmental indices across the board going from bad to worse. In our forest industry there has been a massive contribution to global warming because of Forestry Tasmania's continued burning of rainforests and tall eucalypt forests as they clear-fell in order to put in monocultures of plantations, and an ongoing shedding of jobs. Another 300 jobs are going west at Amcor, for example, as it closes its pulp facility. That is because the Labor and Liberal parties in Tasmania failed to put conditions on handing across the forests through the resource security legislation at state level in 1991 and on the regional forest agreement between John Howard, the Prime Minister, and the Premier of Tasmania last year.</para><para>Whether you look at jobs or the environment—it goes way beyond forestry, of course—Tasmania is being made the fall guy for the role that Senator Harradine takes in national politics. He has not just sold out the indigenous people of this country. Through this legislation, he is not just selling out regional and rural Australia. On the evidence we have available, he has sold out his home state of Tasmania so that the power he wields in here could effectively get the government what it wants.</para><para>Senator Harradine may feel that he has had some breakthroughs and wins, but when you stand back and look at them it is a rather pathetic self-deception. He has done nothing more than become part of a government apparatus. He was elected to be an independent voice for Tasmania, but he has simply become a rubber stamp for the Howard government and the Liberal-National Party coalition. There has been a breach of promise through the sale of the first one-third of Telstra. We have nothing much more than a slush fund coming out of that as far as the environment is concerned. In the minute or so remaining to me, I want to refer to that.</para><para>In this parliament in the last two weeks, after serial questioning, I have unearthed the fact that $12 million of the money earmarked for the environment through the first one-third 
 sale of Telstra, for catchment management of the Murray-Darling Basin and for environmental repairs, has been put into repair of the Hume Dam—capital works. You could argue that that is as environmentally important as upgrading the Hume Highway. It is a massive breach of promise by the Howard government. It is cheating on the people in the Murray-Darling Basin, it is cheating on environmentalists around this country and it is cheating on those people who thought the promise of the sale of the first one-third of Telstra would be kept. When the government comes up with another deal now and says, `Trust us second time around; we cheated you the first time but the second time around surely you will trust us to the ballot box,' how could anybody in the bush accept its word? I would not encourage anybody in the country to do that.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>5454</page.no><name role="metadata">Gibbs, Sen Brenda</name><name role="display">Senator GIBBS</name><name.id>6L6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—John Howard's ideologically driven obsession with selling Telstra does not just threaten a long history of service and access for all Australians, it also heralds more job losses. Telstra is too important to be subjected to the whims of such ideology. The government believes that Telstra is first and foremost a business. It is much more than that: it is a key part of our national infrastructure and the major provider of telecommunications services in a country which, for reasons of its size, demographics and future industry development needs, relies on these services as a lifeline.</para></talk.start><para>I just do not buy the government's claims that selling off Telstra turns ordinary mums and dads into shareholders. The truth of the matter is that we are all shareholders in Telstra. We already own it and we all share in the benefits of it. It is vital that Telstra not be sold off so that we can all continue to share in the benefits. The question I want to ask the government is this: how will the sale of the remaining two-thirds of Telstra benefit people in the bush? How will those who do not have shares in Telstra benefit?</para><para>It has become increasingly clear that the government's obligations to broader Australia have suffered as a result of this obsession with privatisation and the bottom line. This 
 growing lack of regard for members of our society has already been made blindingly obvious by the behaviour of the banks, which are continuing to close branches across Australia at an alarming rate, even though they have been making record profits. It is Australians living in rural and remote areas who are most directly affected. And it is not just the actual employees of the bank, Telstra office or Medicare office who are affected; it is also their families and the businesses that rely upon their custom which are affected. All of us pay one way or another. The indirect effects can be felt across the country as unemployment continues to rise in regional areas and small businesses close.</para><para>This was brought home to me quite recently when the Commonwealth Bank decided to close its branch in Aminya Street, Mansfield, a suburb in Brisbane which has a large number of elderly residents. In fact, over 30 per cent of the residents are aged over 60. Other businesses in the shopping strip relied on the bank's customers for patronage. This included a family business snack bar, which is now on the verge of closing, a Cut Price Deli and a hairdresser. There is an industrial zone close by and the workers there used the bank and the other ancillary businesses nearby. The decision to close this branch has had serious implications for these businesses and for local residents.</para><para>This may seem like a small example, but we are talking about real people here. The loss of the bank will be catastrophic in that community. Customers picketed outside the main Brisbane city branch in Queen Street one day a week for several weeks in an attempt to force the bank to change its mind, but they did not succeed. The backlash from members of these communities which are so adversely affected has been savage in some cases, but unfortunately banks are not really accountable to their customers for service obligations, only to their shareholders. Is this what we want to happen to Telstra? I fear that we will see people also protesting the loss of services by Telstra and protesting job losses—but to no avail should Telstra become fully privatised.  </para><para>It is just this lack of concern for providing a basic customer service that will be the undoing of small businesses and regional economies throughout Queensland. The introduction of the customer service guarantee scheme to compensate customers where service standards are not met has failed to ensure even the maintenance of existing service levels. People are, and should rightly be, concerned about the future implications of a fully privatised Telstra. It is not enough to say that Telstra will continue to meet basic obligations. We know that service standards have slipped as a result of staffing cuts. It is not good enough to say that facilities and rates of service will be maintained. We also need to be able to give assurances that facilities available to city based people will be available to people living in regional and rural areas.</para><para>The customer service guarantee under the existing legislation is not working. The Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman has pointed out that the majority of complainants contacting the TIO office are not aware of the existence of the customer service guarantee, let alone the specific performance standards set out in that guarantee. The ombudsman's office has been critical of service providers, who he states have been slow to meet their obligations to advise their customers of its existence and of their rights, even though that is one of their obligations. I fail to be convinced that proposed amendments to the act to include large fines for those service providers who do not meet the customer service guarantee will be effective. Out in rural and regional Australia, in many cases it will be cheaper to pay daily credits than to provide the service in a timely manner. How effective really will these fines be in the long term when they clash with the market values of profit maximisation? In reality, it will be impossible for any government to force a privately owned Telstra to meet service obligations, especially in rural and remote areas.</para><para>The information age is well and truly upon us. In the future, those with access to information which is provided via a telecommunications system will be the fortunate ones. 
 Those who are information poor and lack quality, affordable access to the services upon which our society increasingly depends will become more and more marginalised.</para><para>Australia is a country increasingly divided on so many fronts. The privatisation of Telstra will create two classes of citizens, and those people in the bush will disproportionately feel its effects. People in the bush are already doing it tough. When decent, hardworking Australians deserted the coalition in droves in Queensland recently, that should have been enough to tell you that they are hurting. Election results in Queensland show that it is the coalition which suffered damaging swings against it. The coalition was not listening to what people in the bush need, and they still are not. Has John Howard learnt nothing from this debacle, other than the fact that he should put One Nation last in his own seat of Bennelong?</para><para>This is a case of too little, too late. Maybe he should have listened more attentively to the Leader of the National Party in the Senate. The privatisation of Telstra is a key issue upon which the Labor Party and the coalition stand divided. I am proud of that fact. It ranks right up there with the GST. I have faith in our fellow Australians and I do not think they are going to be taken in by the glib promises of the coalition that they will be better off.</para><para>The full privatisation of Telstra will disproportionately affect the elderly, people with disabilities and the uneducated—those who are least able to stand up for their rights or to seek redress where their rights have been breached. Telstra's employment levels have declined by about one-third over the last four to five years. This has occurred at the same time that Telstra's before tax profits rose by 26.4 per cent, revenue increased by 13.1 per cent, profit per employee rose 42.2 per cent and labor costs for the period rose 3.7 per cent. Job security and quality of service have suffered as a direct result. And what about foreign ownership? Under John Howard's privatised Telstra, foreign owners will be able to control 35 per cent of the privatised company.</para><para>I do not really believe the government's rhetoric that ordinary mums and dads in 
 Australia who own a few shares in Telstra will have any real influence on, or be able to exercise any real control over, Telstra. In addition, if Australia becomes a signatory to the MAI, then current limits on foreign ownership of Telstra may well become illegal. Australia is a small economy. Our geographical size and uneven population distribution make service provision a challenge in some cases. The universal standard obligation exists to ensure that where there are shortfalls in revenue over expenses in rural areas, these will be subsidised by a contribution from carriers to a central pool of funds used to reimburse Telstra, which is the nominated carrier.</para><para>The government has not guaranteed an extension to the services offered to rural and regional Australians under the USO. All that has been written into the plan is that a standard telephone service must be accessible in rural and remote areas. There is no guarantee that, as new services come on line, regional, rural and remote subscribers will have access to them. The USO is central to the provision of telecommunications services across the nation on an affordable basis, and universal access to affordable, quality telecommunications services is essential to be able to participate in our society and economy.</para><para>As a senator whose constituency includes rural communities, I am very concerned about the disproportionately negative impact that further privatisation will have on people in the bush. This, coupled with the fact that global and national economic reform measures have already disproportionately affected people in the bush, will not be addressed by selling off the major telecommunications carrier in this country. The long-term impact of the privatisation of Telstra must be considered in this context.</para><para>I have already alluded to the decline in services and business infrastructure in the bush. This trend is very worrying, but there is some hope that telecommunications services can fill the breach in areas like finance, health, education, trade and commerce. However, for regional Australians to be able to take advantage of this potential, they must have access to the most up-to-date technology 
 and services which are delivered in a timely manner. A nationwide poll conducted by Rural Press and published in <inline font-style="italic">The Land</inline> newspaper shows that country people do not believe Mr Howard's rhetoric that they will not be disadvantaged by the sell-off.</para><para>Of those people who were surveyed, 49 per cent said that they expected services to be worse under a fully privatised Telstra. Sixty-three per cent of people linked their concern about the sale of Telstra with their overall concern about the continuing deterioration of services in the bush. Even the National Farmers Federation does not support it. In a poll released in the Western Australian Farmers Federation, less than one in 10 farmers support the full privatisation of Telstra.</para><para>I do not see how the government can guarantee under a privatised Telstra continuing access to timely service and maintenance, a reasonable price for services, equitable common charging regimes, the provision of untimed local calls throughout the network, access to new technology or access to the Internet and data capable connections in the long term. These guarantees cannot be met under a privatised Telstra, which is already struggling to operate as a commercial telecommunications service and under the expectation that it will provide public services at a common cost schedule.</para><para>Government claims that the vast bulk of the proceeds of the sale of Telstra will be used to retire existing public debt thereby reducing the Commonwealth's public debt interest liability must be measured against the future loss of earnings arising out of the sale of Telstra. This is a false economy. The opportunity costs of selling off Telstra will be enormous; the benefits will be short term indeed. Given that Telstra's dividends have grown at an average of 15.6 per cent per year, if they were to continue to grow at that rate, the value of the dividends will become greater than the interest saved on public debt by 2002-03.</para><para>On this basis, the government cannot justify selling Telstra for either extra spending or tax cuts on an ongoing basis. At best, one-off commitments can be made, but these will have disappeared by the year 2002-03. This 
 is, of course, assuming that Telstra's dividends do not increase in value and that they maintain the average growth rate of 15.6 per cent, which based upon past trends seems very reasonable, if not a little modest.</para><para>How can we even think of selling off Telstra when the benefits of doing so will run out by 2002-03? This is unbelievably short-sighted and clearly not in the long-term interests of Australians. Any short-term gains will be at the expense of jobs and employment conditions. The industry development capacity of Telstra will contribute to our telecommunications and electronics industry and to the provision of services to regional Australians.</para><para>The Telstra bill inquiry evidence clearly showed that there is a lot of support out there for the retention of parliamentary scrutiny of Telstra and the ministerial power to direct Telstra in the national interest. The choice is quite clear: we can have a world-class telecommunications industry in terms of technology, pricing, quality of service and the capacity to sustain support for national competitive advantage across a wide range of industry sectors, as the government has said, or we can have a privatised Telstra which makes some people rich at the expense of most Australians.</para><para>The lack of revenue going into government coffers after the year 2003 does beg some interesting questions, doesn't it? No clear longer-term economic benefits arising out of the proposed sale of Telstra have been established, nor can the interests of competitors or consumers be adequately safeguarded.</para><para>Telstra is just too important a part of our national infrastructure to be sold off. If Telstra is fully privatised, I know that it will rank as one of the worst excesses of economic vandalism perpetrated upon the Australian people. In years to come, its sale will be related by economists as one of the reasons why Australia's people and her economy failed to reach their full potential. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>5457</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In this debate, I am proceeding on the basis that Senator Harradine has agreed to sell Telstra. Therefore, we must move on, 
 accept the numbers and see what we can do to improve matters. But before I do that, I want to comment on the economics of it all. First, I want to comment on the sale price. Eight months after floating, Telstra shares are now valued at $6 a share, which is $11 billion more than the government sold them for. At the time of the sale, numbers of commentators, including James Capel, the stockbrokers, told the government that they were selling Telstra too cheaply. The Australian Democrats persistently told the government that they were selling Telstra too cheaply. I recall Senator Alston and the entire government frontbench mocking the Democrats for doing so. The consequence is that the government has let Australia lose billions of dollars that it could have received. So the first thing to do is to question its judgment and ability on the matter of sale price.</para></talk.start><para>The second area I want to cover is this astonishing belief in privatisation. It has variously been described as economic devastation, economic rape and an economically illiterate and incoherent policy. Professor John Quiggin, the Senior Research Fellow in economics at James Cook University in Townsville, in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> on Thursday, 2 July 1998, had this to say:</para><para>The case for privatisation rests on the claim that private owners could achieve efficiency improvements not feasible under public ownership.</para><para>. . .              . . .             . . .</para><para>By focusing on the dividends from public enterprises, and ignoring their retained earnings, they make it appear that the interest savings arising when privatisation proceeds are used to repay debt are more than the income forgone by the public.</para><para>In fact, the reverse is almost invariably the case, partly because the rate of return demanded by private holders of equity is considerably higher than the government bond rate. The illusory fiscal benefits of privatisation have led governments to offer over-generous terms to buyers, particularly when they are upper-income "mums and dads". The total loss to taxpayers from privatisations so far amounts to billions of dollars.</para><para>. . .              . . .             . . .</para><para>Most economists, including those in State and Federal finance departments, have now recognised the idea of a pot of gold from privatisation as a fallacy.  
</para><para>The work we have done on the sale of Telstra indicates that the total loss to the community from the sale of Telstra, the direct loss, will be $6.5 billion by the year 2006. Frankly, that is appallingly bad economics.</para><para>The net economic benefit is, therefore, a result of what I would refer to as flat earth accounting. It is that automatic acceptance of an economic dogma which is outdated and which has been proven persistently to be wrong. It is the Australian Democrats who have persistently and consistently told Australian governments both past and present and the people of Australia that fact. This sale of Telstra will not deliver net economic benefit to Australia. I will be moving an amendment to the motion for the second reading in the following terms:</para><para>At the end of the motion, add:</para><para>	 "but the Senate:</para><para>	 (a)	 notes that the following information, requested of the Office of Asset Sales and IT Outsourcing at the hearing of the Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee on 4 June 1998, has not been provided:</para><para>		 (i)	 a comprehensive balance sheet, or assessment of net present worth, which compares the net Commonwealth financial position, under the two scenarios of selling Telstra and not selling Telstra, including all relevant financial flows, such as, but not necessarily limited to:</para><para>			 (A)	 the value of Telstra dividends to government foregone;</para><para>			 (B)	 the value of retained earnings by Telstra;</para><para>			 (C)	 reduced government debt interest payments;</para><para>			 (D)	 the costs of the sale of Telstra, such as stockbroker and agents fees, and the costs of government administration of the sale;</para><para>			 (E)	 the effect of increased taxation foregone, due to the passing of franking credits from government to private ownership;</para><para>		 (ii)	 separate analyses for the sale of the first third of Telstra and the sale of the remaining two thirds of Telstra; and</para><para>	 (b)	 resolves that the information identified in paragraph (a) be laid on the table by no later than immediately after Questions

Please provide separate analyses along the above lines for the sale of the first one-third of Telstra and the proposed sale of the remaining two-thirds of Telstra.</para><para>Mr Acting Deputy President, it will not have passed your attention that that was on 4 June. We are now at 10 July and, surprise, surprise, the government has not yet provided those figures. If it did provide those figures, if it did provide the truth to the Australian public, it would show that this sale of Telstra, on straight accounting, economic and cash flow terms, will deliver a net economic loss to Australia. And that has been the persistent and consistent message of the Australian Democrats, which was mocked by the flat earth economists and the ideologues within the media and on the government benches.</para><para>However, I believe we are going to lose that debate, so we should attend to what we can do to make Telstra a far better company, at least for Australians as a whole. The consideration of the future of Telstra, Australia's largest corporation, does allow us an excellent opportunity to instigate cutting edge measures for corporate governance. These remarks are particularly directed to the Labor Party, because I believe the Labor Party should support these measures which would improve the governance of this company. It is our company until they sell it; ours on behalf of the Australian people. As representatives of the Australian people, we still 
 have the option to deal with a company which is owned by all Australians, not just the richest 10 per cent and the fat commission-taking people who enjoy this process so much.</para><para>The Australian Democrats have a strong commitment to democratic principles, openness and accountability and believe that Australian company law continues to need reform to ensure Australian corporations conform to these standards. Our greatest concern is with companies that have the greatest impact on our society—public companies. The fundamental issue is that, while public companies are privately administered, they are publicly owned and should therefore be fully accountable to the public or at least to their individual shareholders, who are large sections of the public. The way in which this accountability is advanced and enforced is the responsibility of every democratic government. We think changes are necessary because corporations in the modern world have enormous power over our communities, the environment in which we live, the society in which we live and the fabric of our relationships.</para><para>If you do not attend to how these corporations operate you will find that they will do us less good than they otherwise might. If you attend solely to economics it is a bit like making sure somebody is clean and fed but is not nurtured appropriately. The Australian Democrats feel that, in the interests of the public as a whole, matters of accountability and honesty in corporate governance need to come before economics. Economics on its own will damage society unless it is moderated by the principles of justice and democracy.</para><para>A comprehensive legislative structure to ensure transparency and accountability in the activities of company management is vital. Shareholders, on whose behalf the directors and senior management are working, must be able to monitor the full extent of the decisions taken by company management and directors and have the opportunity to ensure they comply with best commercial practice as prescribed by the law. I am speaking this way because I accept that, if Senator Harradine has 
 determined to sell Telstra, we must attend to the company.</para><para>The peculiar thing about modern companies is that it is often the shareholder who is left behind in matters of power and matters of decision making. Companies worldwide have been taken over by two classes of people. One is the managerial class, the members of which are very often far from entrepreneurial. Most managers in major companies have never had to earn a dollar on their own account: they have always sat on the back of somebody else's money, somebody else's structure, somebody else's company and they are not at all entrepreneurial. They preserve in a guild-like fashion the benefits and the attributes that go with being part of an elite and a class. Unlike nearly every single member of the cabinet, I would remind the Senate I am one of the few people in parliament who have operated at both an international and a local level at the highest level of business and at the lowest level of business, owning and managing my own businesses. I know of what I speak.</para><para>Similarly, the directors' class can sometimes be categorised in the same manner. There is a particular person who will find himself—and sometimes herself—repeated on countless companies because of the way the club operates. Directors recommend their succeeding directors and it becomes a kind of mates' class. They, too, operate in a system of power and control which can be to the detriment of shareholders en masse. The average shareholder, in fact, is very little more than simply a paper holder in a company and is as far removed from capitalism as it is really possible to be.</para><para>We think there are important elements which have to be attended to in terms of the modern relationship between governments and parliaments representing the people and the powerful interests controlling our economies and affecting our societies and communities. Those interests have to be attended to in terms of much greater democratisation, much greater responsiveness to the community as a whole and much greater concern with public interest. Of course, whilst I am illustrating some of the weaknesses of the system as it is, 
 we must recognise that there are many very good pioneers in companies—pioneering managers, pioneering directors and pioneering entrepreneurs—who operate their companies, their corporations and their enterprises in the public interest and who, in fact, advance the cause of good corporate governance, good corporate management and good relations with the societies out of which they make their profits, their sales and their wealth. Those sorts of people are to be congratulated and encouraged.</para><para>The Australian Democrats have led the way on corporate law reform. When Labor and the coalition sought to make no changes to the Company Law Review Bill by signing off a majority report on that basis, the Australian Democrats issued a comprehensive minority report calling for numerous improvements. Our report forced changes to be considered.</para><para>When the bill was passed in June 1998, it included the following changes, all prompted by the Australian Democrats' report: companies must now disclose the remuneration of directors and top managers; `whistleblowing' directors can call meetings of members; overseas disclosures must also be made available in Australia; the rights of shareholders to appoint directors are safeguarded; listed companies must give 28 days notice of a meeting of members; performance in relation to environmental legislation must be reported; safeguards against fraudulent lodgment of documents which must be put with the ASIC; proxies can now be sent by fax and the chair must declare all proxies; and directors must declare that financial statements accord with the law.</para><para>We are pleased to see these advances to corporate law but there is more to be done. I have gratefully accepted the offer from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator Ian Campbell) to have the following referred to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities: compulsory disclosure to shareholders of their privileges and rights; establishment of corporate governance boards to ensure responsible company governance; the introduction of preferential voting for directors; the establishment of an internal audit committee; and a requirement 
 that companies make disclosures in relation to proceedings against them in relation to the Corporations Law and the Trade Practices Act.</para><para>Now, with the consideration of the future of Telstra, there is the opportunity to introduce reforms to what is at present our own Australian company, the one that belongs to all Australian people, whom we are here to represent. We want to ensure that Australia's No. 1 company adopts best practice in its corporate structures and processes.</para><para>I will be proposing amendments in two areas. The first is the area of corporate governance. Perhaps the most important issue affecting accountability in corporate management is the structure applied by law to corporate governance. This issue embodies the basic conflict that advocating greater accountability raises: whether the shareholders' interests and the public interest are better served by a model that promotes minimum accountability, maximum freedom and lowest cost or by an alternative model which includes maximum accountability, ensuring less opportunity for fraud and mismanagement and greater adherence to best commercial and community practice.</para><para>As fundamental principles, the Australian Democrats always favour greater accountability, greater openness, greater transparency, better representation and more democracy. The existing corporate governance structure gives very wide-ranging operational management duties to the main board of directors. They have powers to determine their own remuneration and to appoint and remunerate company auditors, who are supposed to see that they are being honest. They can nominate themselves for re-election, they can initiate changes in the constitution and they can control the conduct of shareholder meetings and voting procedures.</para><para>These powers alone create situations where major conflicts of interest, corruption and mismanagement can arise and go unchecked, as the very individuals who may be affected by these things are the ones who are responsible for their management and elimination. Fortunately, it is seldom that corruption and mismanagement does reach that level. Never 
 theless, it has been a danger and it remains a danger.</para><para>Clearly, this issue goes to the heart of managerial accountability to shareholders and the public interest. At worst, directors and the managerial elite can evade their full responsibilities to the public interest and to all shareholders. These issues are at the heart of managerial and board accountability.</para><para>As a means of improving this situation, the Australian Democrats propose that companies be required to separate the normal business and internal management functions of the board from the governance functions of ensuring openness and accountability. A new governing board, elected directly by shareholders, not shareholding, should exercise these governance functions. The main directors would continue to be elected by shareholding, representing, of course, where the financial weight lies. They would exercise normal main board functions of business and management.</para><para>This would have the additional benefits of simplifying and reducing the role, responsibilities and workload of the principal board directors and at the same time increasing their credibility by removing the powers that permit the appearance or reality of a conflict of interest. As a result, directors should be able to make better business management decisions, so improving the company's financial situation and its credibility.</para><para>Ultimately, this is about re-establishing the balance of company governance in favour of shareholders rather than management. Why do I stress that with regard to Telstra? Because at the moment it is this parliament which ensures, as far as it can, given the attitude to government, that Telstra delivers appropriate services to the Australian community. Once it is in private hands, by all means the community service obligations and other regulations may contribute to better management by Telstra but, ultimately, the real power will reside in the board and the management. We have to make sure that those people are as representative and thoughtful about accountability and community needs as possible. One way to do that is to make sure that their 
 constitution is appropriately structured. Currently, their constitution is not.</para><para>The second area is the democratisation of voting. There is currently a great disparity between the principles of corporate democracy and the rules set out in the Corporations Law governing the internal operations of companies. For example, the existing method of electing company directors on a limited re-election basis allows dominance by control groups and inhibits the likelihood of support being expressed for particular directors. It does not enable minority interests to be heard through more accessible internal procedures, and it forces minority interests to rely on expensive and time consuming formal procedures like the legal system and the ASIC.</para><para>To increase the democratisation of company management and operations, the Australian Democrats advocate applying a system of preferential or cumulative voting to the election of directors of listed companies, requiring all directors to be elected annually with each share obtaining as many votes as there are vacancies. The number of directors to be elected would be determined according to the company's constitution. One of the requirements of good company law is that there should be a scheme setting out the steps company management must follow to achieve not only best commercial practice but also best community practice. The scheme should be paired with a comprehensive mechanism to enable shareholders and outsiders to monitor what management is actually doing and, where necessary, require that it comply with the law.</para><para>Serious deficiencies exist in the current Corporations Law, even as it has been recently amended and improved, which contribute to the disparity between the rules governing the internal operations of companies and the principles of corporate democracy. The existing method of electing company directors on a limited re-election basis is one such deficiency, allowing dominance by control groups and reducing the possibility of support being expressed for particular directors. This is an aspect of all corporate structures which is to be regretted. It does not enable minority interests to be heard through more accessible 
 internal procedures and it forces shareholders to rely on expensive and time consuming procedures. That should not be the case for the over two million shareholders of Telstra.</para><para>A better alternative would be to adapt the system of preferential or cumulative voting for the election of directors of listed companies. This system would require all directors to be elected annually, with each share obtaining as many votes as there are vacancies. It is a system well understood by Australians and would improve corporate governance. The number of directors to be elected would be determined according to the company's constitution, and the law would need to specify that each shareholder is free to distribute their allotment of votes as they see fit to those nominated as directors. This proposal would improve the democratisation of the relationship between Telstra company directors and shareholders. If we are going to lose Telstra, let us at least structure it in the best fashion. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline><inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>5462</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen George</name><name role="display">Senator GEORGE CAMPBELL</name><name.id>NB5</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Telstra for decades has played an integral role in the development of this—</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>C16</name.id><name role="metadata">HEFFERNAN</name><name role="display">Senator Heffernan</name></talker><para>—Don't read your speech, George.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>NB5</name.id><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen George</name><name role="display">Senator GEORGE CAMPBELL</name></talker><para>—Who's reading it? <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline>  I will commence again. Telstra has played an integral role in the development of this nation, not only by bridging the vast distances between population centres in Australia but also by developing an Australian industry that offers world leading technology in communications. The full privatisation of Telstra will mark a momentous degradation of the Australian communications industry and an upheaval of the sorts of communications services that Australians are entitled to expect. The central issue on any further sale of Telstra will be the effects on rural and regional Australia, not only directly through service provision or further job cuts but also in the way that telecommunications will be provided to regional Australia in the future.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The further sale of Telstra has become a central political issue. Regional communications has increasingly become the focus of 
 communications policy. The current conflict within the coalition demonstrates that the Telstra privatisation debate and the growing signs of a political rural revolt have significantly raised the temperature of the regional communications debate but so far it has generated more heat than light.</para><para>The argument has followed the well-worn track of public ownership versus private, tinkering with the universal service obligation and increasing subsidies to Telstra to do what it has never done well—that is, to provide compatible rural services. However, this debate will not be resolved until we address the central issue of regional telecommunications. Before building on structures of the past, which have already been demonstrated to be inadequate in meeting the communications needs of rural and regional Australia, we should be seeking to develop an approach that is compatible with the communications systems of the future.</para><para>As a publicly owned company, Telstra has a responsibility to the Australian people as a whole. Previously, this responsibility was fulfilled in a number of ways, including a clear obligation and commitment to provide telephone services to all Australians, not only profitable services. Telstra also has a commitment to Australian jobs in direct employment and indirectly through its support and development of secondary industries in Australia. We now have a thriving electronics industry that provides the equipment necessary to run the Telstra network. Efficient telecommunications in all its facets was an integral component of business opportunities and business costs, with increasing reliance on electronic commerce in Australia and throughout the world.</para><para>Telstra, as one of the world's largest telecommunication companies, spends a significant amount of money in the course of its operations and development of its business each year. According to its industry development plan:</para><para>Telstra plans to spend up to $4.4 billion on capital expenditures and investments in the 1998 financial year.</para><para>Traditionally, Telstra has had a significant policy of purchasing locally in order to 
 support Australian industry. This policy has had a particular focus on small and medium sized businesses that supply Telstra from the electronics industry amongst others.</para><para>For the last 15 years, Australia has developed a significant electronics industry, the bulk of which has come through supplying to Telstra. Its export contribution to the Australian economy has been lifted from $50 million a year to $1 billion per year, although it has to be said that we are still suffering a growing deficit in this area of trade of in the region of 10 to one. This industry has grown solidly through Telstra and its commitment to supporting Australian industry.</para><para>In Telstra's latest industry development plan, however, only a few months after its part privatisation, the tidings are no longer as supportive for the Australian electronics industry. According to its plan:</para><para>Differences between global best practice and Australian conditions will not be sustainable. Local industry must meet the same best practice objectives of its offshore competitors.</para><para>As a privatised company, Telstra will now place the interests of its shareholders first. The overwhelming factor that will drive Telstra will be profit. The previous success of secondary industries in Australia that have been built with Telstra's support will end. There will be sacrifice for off the shelf solutions which will see our telecommunications industry settle for outdated technology instead of being at its leading edge.</para><para>Telstra will now be shopping in the global supermarket for the best bargains it can find when it purchases its equipment. In light of the Asian crisis, with depreciating currencies all around us and numerous countries desperate to earn export dollars, it is easy to see that, through no fault of their own, many Australian companies will be outpriced unfairly by overseas competition. Telstra points to this in its development plan, when it states:</para><para>Typically, Telstra's direct spend with Australian SME's has been around 30% of its total spend. This strong support for SME's who offer commercially attractive products and services will continue, but Telstra believes that most of the future opportunities for Australian industry will be in niche 
 market products and services for the regional and world market.</para><para>The importance of Telstra to Australian industry is not only represented in its direct economic contribution but also in the essential service that it provides. The success of future Australian industrial development, particularly in rural Australia, depends on the communications service that Telstra will provide.</para><para>For regional Australia to successfully compete in business, it is vital that it has the same services as the metropolitan areas in terms of Internet, fax, mobile phone and digital communications. Without regional equality of these services, industry and business in rural Australia will not survive. A privatised Telstra will be focused on the more profitable metropolitan centres and these services will be reluctantly provided to regional Australia, if at all. Perhaps now is the time to rethink our communications model—particularly as it relates to regional and rural Australia—to reassess its adequacy in meeting the communications requirements of regional and rural communities into the future.</para><para>The information age is forcing all of us to rethink our assumptions about our society and how it functions. Perhaps this is the opportunity to develop and adopt new and radical solutions for our communications network of the future. Privatisation is not the answer.</para><para>Since its part privatisation, Telstra has cut its employment significantly. It announced in September 1996 that it intended to reduce its employee numbers by 22,000 in the 1998-99 financial year. It has already cut more than 17,000 jobs, according to the union that represents Telstra workers. The greatest effect of these job cuts has been felt in rural Australia, firstly, as a loss of desperately needed income to those towns and, secondly, as a severe reduction of service by Telstra in rural areas. The government of Western Australia, in the recent Senate inquiry into the full privatisation of Telstra, submitted that:</para><para>It is expected that full privatisation would have some impact on the number of Telstra staff located in non-metropolitan areas. Telstra has already withdrawn many staff previously located outside the major cities, however, it has not yet put in place adequate arrangements for sending staff to 
 country areas when needed as evidenced by the slow response to some telephone system outages.</para><para>The slow response in service to rural areas has meant that there are often delays of several weeks both in new connections and to restore faults.</para><para>In its current position, Telstra is clearly holding a monopoly stranglehold over the provision of Australian telecommunications services. In this position, it can easily exploit consumers, particularly if it is privately controlled. The government insists that Telstra will be forced to maintain its service levels through the customer service guarantee and the universal service obligation. The explanatory memorandum circulated by the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts, Senator Alston, contends that:</para><para>The public interest in telecommunications is protected through the comprehensive community and regulatory safeguards set out in the <inline font-style="italic">Telecommunications Act 1997</inline> , the <inline font-style="italic">Telstra Corporation Act 1991</inline>  and . . . the <inline font-style="italic">Trade Practices Act 1974</inline> .</para><para>This government contends that there is sufficient regulation already to monitor Telstra and that any further regulation will interfere with the rights of other shareholders in Telstra. The Communications Expert Group, in their submission to the recent Senate committee inquiry, disagree with the confidence of the minister and point out that:</para><para>The customer service guarantee is not effective and is currently not being implemented. There are either deficiencies in the promulgation or enforcement of the customer service guarantee.</para><para>The Communications Expert Group also highlighted the reality of government's ability to control Telstra as a huge private monopoly. They said:</para><para>A major concern is the access that a privatised Telstra will have to legal resources, compared to the legal resources made available to government departments and smaller carriers. The access to legal resources makes the imposition of $10 million fines of doubtful value, as it makes commercial sense to mount a $1 million legal defence which will tie up a department's legal, financial and manpower resources to defeat the charge.</para><para>It makes simple economic sense to retain a monopoly in government hands. A private monopoly is clearly able to exploit consumers 
 without the public benefit that government ownership provides.</para><para>As a profit driven private monopoly, Telstra will be like any other private company. It will comply with government regulation only when it is forced to comply. Under full privatisation, the government will be waging a never-ending war in the courts if it hopes to enforce Telstra's universal service obligations.</para><para>Perhaps the opportunity now prevails to resolve this not by privatisation but by a radical restructure of our telecommunications giant in such a fashion that would ensure it is more responsive and in tune to the community it seeks to serve. For example, in the US, telecommunications companies specialising in rural communications are increasingly common and are growing at a startling rate, with some achieving up to 30 per cent of market share. In Canada, for example, New Brunswick Telecom has been instrumental in providing job opportunities and investment in a rural province.</para><para>What matters most in rural Australia is access to world-class outcomes, not only 64-kilobit per second links but also customer service, networked applications, tailored regional pricing packages, technology optimised for regional geography and corporate focus on their needs. The central objective for regional telecommunications must be nothing less than the achievement of parity between regional Australia and the south-east corner of Australia. A radical new approach to the provision of world-class telecommunications to the bush could be the cornerstone for the revitalisation of regional and rural communities.</para><para>Even now the government has no understanding of the real issue. The problem is structural and requires a structural solution. Without a structural solution, the options offered by the coalition, such as capital grants schemes or extending the USO, will have a marginal impact at best. The problems with regional telecommunications have been apparent for years—chronic underinvestment and the obsolescence of equipment, the lack of regionalised marketing strategies to drive consumer demand and the physical and 
 psychological distance between regional communities and industry decision makers.</para><para>Regional communications are very different from metropolitan communications. Demand characteristics, demographics, optimal technology choices, network geography and levels of competition are all different in regional Australia. The imposition of legacy solutions on these markets cannot deliver the world-class competitiveness that regional businesses and homes desperately need. The solution to the communications service that is provided to regional Australia lies in investment. There has to be a separate approach taken to metropolitan and rural telecommunications within a comprehensive telecommunications framework as defined by government through public debate, not developed haphazardly by the privatised carriers around their boardrooms without being subjected to public scrutiny or forced to show commitment.</para><para>The coalition government does not have a comprehensive telecommunications policy at all. Its approach is one of haphazardly placing bandaids on gaping wounds and making policy on the run. This is again clearly demonstrated by the hastily cobbled together political fix with the Nationals to secure their support for the Telstra sell-off. The tragedy is, however, that if we can believe what is being reported, the  so-called fix will not address the communications problems in the bush, nor will it save the National's political hide.</para><para>Rural and regional Australians are relying ever increasingly on telecommunications services for every part of their personal and business use. Without this service at an equal level and cost it will be isolated. It requires these services before it can be interlinked with metropolitan Australian industry. If it does not have this opportunity it will never be linked to the industrial heartland of Australia that is currently centred on major metropolitan cities.</para><para>We have already witnessed the results of the sale of one-third of Telstra by this government. Amongst other problems, the quality and level of service provided by Telstra, particularly in rural areas, has dropped significantly. The proceeds of that sale have been squandered in the already well-documented Natural Heritage Trust fiasco. That has been 
 the largest pork-barrelling exercise that this country has ever seen. In short, the one-third sale of Telstra can only be described as a national disgrace.</para><para>The Australian public are entitled to demand more from their government than short-sighted policies and fire sales. If the recent election result in Queensland contains a message for governments it is clearly that Australians are sick and tired of economic rationalism and its effect on communities. There is no valid reason whatsoever, economic or social, to privatise Telstra any further, just as there was no social or economic reason to privatise any part of it in the first place.</para><para>What we need is a serious and comprehensive policy approach on the communications and information industries as a whole. We need to ensure that regional and rural Australia has access to these services on at least an equal basis. The Australian Labor Party has a clear policy on communications that will ensure that rural and regional Australia is not left behind.</para><para>We will not be about making decisions on telecommunications in this country, which in many respects will determine the capacity of us as a nation to compete in the global marketplace on an equal footing, based on the political quick fixes that are needed to stitch up a coalition that is in disunity, disharmony and disgrace. We have a telecommunications policy being driven in this country by the desire of a Prime Minister to get a political fix to be able to go to an election within the next four or five weeks with a policy stitched up with the numbers in this Senate to privatise what can be the cornerstone of our competitiveness into the future.</para><para>This has nothing to do with any economic rational decision. This has nothing to do with any social commitment to people in the bush. This has nothing to do with bringing rural and regional Australia into the industrial network of this nation. This has everything to do with trying to secure the seats of two or three people on the other side. The strange thing about it is that it will backfire. The one good thing for those of us on this side of the chamber is that when we come back after the 
 next election a lot of your faces will not be there to look at. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>5466</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="r482">Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 1998</inline>  is the legislation that John Howard said we would not see in this parliament, that would not be considered.

Don't be under any illusions—the full privatisation of Telstra is as good as done. The National Party does not have the bottle or the guts to stand up for their constituency. They are going to roll over and let the Liberal Party walk all over them. They are going to vote for the full privatisation of Telstra.</para></talk.start></continue><para>There is no-one in the National Party contingent in this chamber who has the courage and intestinal fortitude to stand up to the Liberal Party and Mr Howard. They want to; they would like to be able to. They would like to be able to shake off this aura of weakness that surrounds them, but they will not do it. Sure, Mr Katter, Mrs Kelly and perhaps a few other Nationals might in the House of Representatives, but that will be purely symbolic—the deed is done. It matters in the Senate and they will not stand up. The deal is done with Senator Harradine and Senator Colston. With Senator Colston it was through the buying of this tainted vote to ensure he got the deputy presidency of the Senate. And Senator Harradine, the great democrat—the man who said he would never vote for a gag motion—voted for three in succession last night. A slimy deal has been done in relation to this particular matter.</para><para>I am absolutely confident and quite certain that the Telstra privatisation bill will go through. I said it last night and I say it again: it will go through with the Labor Party fighting it every inch of the way. Not only will we fight it in the parliament, but also we will fight it in the election. We will make it a centrepiece of what Labor stands for.</para><para>We will not back down and we will make absolutely clear to the Australian people that the only way this bill will not be proclaimed is for a Labor government to be elected. We will ensure that every single person in Australia, particularly those who live outside the major capital cities, understands that commitment from Labor. It will become absolutely 
 clear that the only way that the privatisation of Telstra can be stopped is, of course, to vote Labor.</para><para>There is no urgency about this matter. Last night Senator Harradine would not let one Labor member of the Senate actually put a case to argue against the urgency of this bill. They could not put the obvious case that there is no urgency with this bill, because even the government is not planning to proclaim the legislation until after the election.</para><para>What they are worried about is the numbers in the Senate after the election. They know the National Party will be wiped out. They are fearful that the government will be wiped out and that they will be replaced with One Nation senators who apparently are opposed to the privatisation of Telstra.</para><para>What a sell-out from the government, Senator Colston and Senator Harradine! We want to know what the details of the deal that has been done are. We really do want Senator Harradine for once to come into this chamber, own up and say what has gone on behind closed doors with the government. Forget about his dealings behind closed doors on the native title bill; that has occurred. Tell us the truth for once about Telstra. Own up to what you have done behind closed doors and the deal with Mr Howard. But, rest assured, Labor will never sell out. We will fight it right through and I am confident in the election we will win.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>5470</page.no><name role="metadata">West, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator WEST</name><name.id>1X4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I start by quoting the opening lines I made in a speech on 18 October 1996 when the first tranche of the sale of Telstra was being debated. At that time I said:</para></talk.start><para>Today we have heard from government senators their usual diatribe about why they should be able to sell a third of Telstra.</para><para>There is a big difference between this debate and that debate, because this time we are not hearing from government senators as to why the remainder should be sold off. We are certainly not hearing from National Party senators as to why it should be sold off.</para><para>But it is interesting, because we have certainly seen what they have had to say in the media in recent weeks about it and some 
 of their lower house colleagues have a lot to say about it even today. What happened? What bought them off? Why isn't the government here contributing to this debate? Let me tell you, the people of Australia want to know the reasons.</para><para>I have a very large quantity of press clippings here that I have accumulated in very recent times from the rural areas of western and northern New South Wales, west of the Great Dividing Range. They are absolutely horrified at the sale of Telstra. They do not approve of the sale of Telstra. If the National Party were reflecting to the coalition forces what people out there were saying, they would be in here speaking very volubly in opposition to the continued sale of the remainder of Telstra.</para><para>Telstra should not have been sold in the first place. Why sell an asset that brings in over $1 billion worth of revenue in dividends—revenue that is spent for the good of this country, for schools, for hospitals and for infrastructure? But this government wants to sell the farm. As a letter to the editor in a local paper said, once you sell the farm you are gone. You can only sell the farm once. You cannot sell Telstra two or three times.</para><para>What replaces that $1 billion worth of dividends that Telstra has been paying the government and the people of Australia? What happens to the resources and the services that those dividends actually purchase and provide for the people of this country? They will have to find an alternative source. I guess we can all hang onto our hip pockets because it will have to come from there.</para><para>Infrastructure does not need to be built and maintained once; it needs continual refurbishment and upgrading. It seems that this government has forgotten that. They are talking about the infrastructure services that they will build with the money from the sale but, once that infrastructure has been built, it will require additional funding to keep the infrastructure current and technologically advanced in areas where we do not have the population and the businesses to ensure that revenue is coming in.</para><para>I am sure that Telstra, or the communications companies, will do exactly what the 
 banks have done to us in rural areas where there is not very much service demand, where there is lots of land between individual people or individual services. What will happen? We will be neglected. It will get to be a two-tier service. In the cities, where there is lots of turnover, lots of revenue generated, it will be kept at the absolute peak of performance. But they forget about those of us who live west of the great sandstone curtain. That is what happens: they forget about those who live west of the great sandstone curtain.</para><para>It is important to remember, when this government talks about a community service obligation or a universal service obligation, that it will apply to Telstra. But they are only talking in terms of a phone service; they are only talking in terms of the handset and the copper wires that are strung around. They are not talking about alternative technology that is being developed or other technology that Telstra and other telecommunications companies are into providing.</para><para>That is something that people in rural areas need to be very conscious of. I think it is something that coalition senators opposite, and particularly National Party senators, need to remember: their universal service obligation is not for the whole raft of Telstra services and telecommunications that they think it is, or for what might happen in the future regarding telecommunications advances that are made. And services and communications advances are being made at a very rapid rate and are improving markedly.</para><para>If we do not have access, and if there is no universal service obligation applying, those of us in the bush will have to pay for it, and we will have to pay more because, as there is no USO, it will not get any cross-subsidy. If there is some subsidy from the government, pray, may I ask, where will that money come from? They will not have the dividend stream that they have had with Telstra.</para><para>I cannot imagine that a fully privatised Telstra will be any different from any other large business in this country. They will be able to get up to all sorts of dodges. They will want to minimise their tax, and they especially will want to reduce the dividends they are paying. Up to 35 per cent of Telstra 
 can be sold to foreign ownership; 35 per cent of the dividend could be going overseas and not staying in this country. That is another thing that is of grave concern to people. We know that the government is putting a five per cent ceiling on the number of shares that people from overseas can purchase, but it will only require seven large organisations to take up five per cent each to basically control Telstra.</para><para>How the devil can the thousands of mums and dads in this country, to whom we are told these shares will be sold, have a shareholders' vote to control the directors? Of course, it will be stacked by the seven from overseas with the 35 per cent. Can you imagine, if a million mums and dads have shares, how many of them will turn up for shareholders' meetings? What venue in this country will you be able to use to hold these people if they all turn up?</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>CX5</name.id><name role="metadata">MACDONALD</name><name role="display">Senator Sandy Macdonald</name></talker><para>—The same ones that they use for Qantas and BHP.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>1X4</name.id><name role="metadata">West, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator WEST</name></talker><para>—As you have just said, the same ones.

What control and what access will they have regarding future directions? They will have none, because they will have no power. They will get their small dividends each year.</para></talk.start></continue><para>But when it comes to this country's future directions, when it comes to the important decisions being made, the mums and dads, the battlers that Mr Howard talks about, will have no power in the boardrooms. Can you imagine someone with 200 shares getting a seat on the board of Telstra in competition with somebody from overseas owning five per cent or one of the major institutional investors in this country? There only needs to be a couple of the major institutional investors ganging together, and what they want they will get. That is the danger and the problem with this legislation. </para><para>People need to be reminded that we will be allowing 35 per cent of our telecommunications system, our major one—basically it is a monopoly—as a company to be owned by overseas people, overseas companies. It may be that it is to be owned by as few as seven entities, because five per cent is the maximum percentage of shares they can have.

Let us go back to about the year 1995 and look at a number of those electorates: in Gwydir, there was a cross-subsidy of $13.54 million; in Parkes, there was a cross-subsidy of $15.21 million; in Calare, $3.29 million; in New England, $4.24 million; and in Riverina, $4.06 million. This will be a universal service obligation only when they have to get the money, and it will be for their phone line only, nothing else.

If that were happening in New South Wales, I suspect that ICAC would be taking a very close look at some of them—and I mean that very seriously. I think it ill-behoves people to make some of these promises and to say that they have been given 
 guarantees, with nobody else knowing about them. I suspect that, if this were happening in New South Wales, ICAC would be extremely interested.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I have mentioned foreign ownership. As I say, it will take telecommunications out of the hands of the people in the bush, the mums and dads and put it into the hands of those who have larger shareholdings. I do not know why this government has this hang-up that private is more efficient than public. A lot of research is being done on that, and it is not being borne out, but this government does not tend to want to agree with that or even listen to it.</para><para>We have also seen in recent times—unless, of course, this got changed too in the last 24 hours—a cut in access to the remote access channel called Reach. This access channel enables television stations to feed their signal down the line to city areas. This will result in less coverage of local events that have national and international significance. This will mean less coverage of those local events on the national media. It will further remove from people in the bush, and remove from city people, knowledge of what is going on out there. It is very, very concerning that this has already started to happen. We know the service to country areas has deteriorated in the last two years. That has been admitted here by the minister, and he says that he will up the fines. But I think on occasions it would be cheaper to pay the fines than actually provide the service.</para><para>I would draw the Senate's attention to a street survey undertaken in Parkes. The town of Parkes is not a rabid Labor town; it is a country town. Of seven people surveyed, four were totally opposed to the sale of Telstra, two said yes and one did not care. Those sorts of snapshots of what the feeling of the community is are vitally important.</para><para>There are headlines like `The bush will not cop the sale of Telstra', that `Telstra guarantees are being sought'. These guarantees were being sought by National Party candidates. There is `Questions on the Telstra sale'. There are editorial headlines like `Telstra float not as good as it appears'. That was in the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Advertiser</inline> in Wagga—and that is not some 
 socialist rag, let me tell you, it is a conservative newspaper, but it obviously taps into the feelings and thoughts of its community. The <inline font-style="italic">Daily Liberal</inline> in Dubbo—well named—`The Telstra carrot a real danger'. These are the sorts of headlines that all the regional and rural New South Wales newspapers in particular are full of. I think it is important that people recognise this situation: people in the bush are very scared and very concerned that they are going to lose out in this situation.</para><para>I wait with interest to see some of these plans that they have unveiled today—the old pork barrel gets greased up—and I wonder if it is going to be like the telecommunications infrastructure package that was announced last time. I wait for people to remember that it was a per capita funding worked out on the percentage of each state's population living outside non-capital areas. It took no cognisance of the size of the state. And guess which state got the most money? Guess whose votes changed in here and enabled the legislation to pass? Guess which states got the most money?</para><para>In New South Wales, the per capita funding was $15.99. In Victoria, it was $22.21 a head. In Queensland, it was $29.70 a head. In South Australia, it was $67.60; they did quite well. I do not have the Western Australian figures with me. But it is quite obvious that, when the Tasmanians were getting $208.41 per head, the Tasmanian people were doing far better in a much smaller size state than those of us who came from the larger states and the more populous states. It was not a fair distribution of this allocation of money, and I wonder what has happened this time. What has the government got up to this time with its smoke and mirrors to make it appear that this is a wonderful salvation and a wonderful solution for everybody? We have the situation, of course, where the second two-thirds of Telstra was not going to be sold, was it? We now have another promise that has been broken.</para><para>Today, we have an outline of a whole lot of promises that the government have made that they are going to deliver on Telstra. Why would we believe that when they have core and non-core promises—they have broken any 
 number of promises—and now they have come out with a whole stack of further promises that are pork barrel type promises? They are the ones that go up in a whiff of smoke and all you get is a very aromatic bacon smell as it burns. That is all that people are going to get. People need to realise that this organisation should remain within the ownership of the people who already own it—the 18 million Australians who already own two-thirds of Telstra. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline><inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>5474</page.no><name role="metadata">Lees, Sen Meg</name><name role="display">Senator LEES</name><name.id>8U4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="r482">Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 1998</inline>  is about broken promises and about compounding the errors, failures and misrepresentations of the first one-third of Telstra sale and multiplying them threefold by selling the rest. The sale of the remaining two-thirds of Telstra is poor policy. It will enrich the most wealthy 10 per cent of our community while impoverishing the rest. It will exacerbate the service failures in telecommunications by creating an effective private sector monopoly when the current regulatory system is clearly not succeeding in delivering better consumer outcomes. And it will create a huge accountability problem by setting free Australia's largest company—a company twice the size of BHP or the National Australia Bank—whose profitability will depend entirely on its ability to lobby government and resist and restrict the rigours of regulation. On every front, the sale of the rest of Telstra will be a disaster.</para></talk.start><para>I cannot believe that a government that prides itself on fiscal rectitude and sound budgeting could present the Telstra sale bill before this parliament and argue that it is good policy. In the heavy and entirely misleading selling of the privatisation of Telstra by a string of ministers, we have been told that the sale will leave Australia debt free in a few years. Yes, if you sell off two-thirds of Australia's biggest company and raise $40 billion, you can retire a lot of debt, but that is not the full picture.</para><para>The real question is this: is the amount of debt being retired greater than the value of the company being sold? In Telstra's case, the answer is very clearly no. The value of debt 
 is reflected in the budget by interest. The value of the company is reflected in Telstra's profit stream. No matter which way you want to measure it, within a few years at the very outside the interest savings will be less than the lost profit stream. That means that the budget will be left worse off, not better off, by the sale of the rest of Telstra.</para><para>Telstra's profitability is expected to grow sharply in the coming years with profits rising to about 10 per cent a year. This is because its revenues keep rising on the back of its dominant market position. Its multibillion dollar capital spending program is being wound back and its deep and savage retrenchments have reduced costs. A wide range of analysts, including Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, Merrill Lynch, Macquarie Equities and CS First Boston, are all predicting double digit growth for Telstra.</para><para>Investment analyst Ord Minnett, for example, is forecasting Telstra's profits will rise from $2.6 billion last year to $3.6 billion by the year 2000. Two-thirds of that is $2.4 billion and that would flow to the government as dividends or as capital gains in terms of retained earnings—but obviously not if Telstra is sold. If Telstra is sold, then this $2.4 billion is lost to government. In the year 2000, at least it will be offset by a $2.4 billion interest saving, but as Telstra's profitability continues to rise the budget black hole continues to grow and grow substantially.</para><para>In evidence presented to the Senate inquiry on this bill, economics professor John Quiggin forecast that, assuming modest growth, the budget black hole will rise to $3.3 billion by 2007. I might add that, in assessing the impact of Telstra's sale on public finances, it is essential to look at the reported profit and not just the dividend. This follows the asset pricing theories of Nobel Prize winning economists Miller and Mogdiliani and is cited by various analysts as the most appropriate way of determining the value of an asset.</para><para>But the situation is likely to be even worse than that. As Professor Quiggin correctly points out, the privatisation of Telstra also has income tax implications. Privatised companies are generally able to manipulate dividend 
 payouts to deliver dividends which are fully franked, that is, dividends on which the shareholders need pay no more income tax. At present, whilst Telstra pays company tax, its franking credits are not paid out because the government owns the shares. Telstra this year will generate about $500 million in unrefundable franking credits, rising to about $1.2 billion within a decade. Adding the cost of franking tax credits to dividends and retained profits results in a loss to the budget bottom line of $500 million in the year 2000, rising to $4 billion a year by 2006.</para><para>These are incredibly big figures. If Peter Costello or John Fahey were facing a budget blow-out in the social security area of up to $4 billion a year within a decade, they would be screaming from the rooftops and we would have all sorts of allegations about black holes and intergenerational equity, and they would be moving to cut entitlements willy-nilly. They have already shown that they are happy to slash and burn in this area. Despite the great yawning hole that Telstra will leave in our public finances, this government continues to promote the sale as somehow financially prudent. It is not. Selling Telstra will mean that, in less than a decade, we will need to cut services across the board by $4 billion just to balance the books. Each year after that, the gap will get worse. What sort of a legacy is that to leave to future generations?</para><para>That is just the loss on the remaining two-thirds. If we include the fire sale price at which the first third of Telstra was sold, the loss blows out to cost the government over $1.2 billion in the year 2000, rising to over $6.5 billion by 2006. The Democrats view the price at which the first third of Telstra was sold last year as positively scandalous. Unfortunately, the scandal of it has not set in the public mind yet. People out there do not realise just how much this government ripped off the 90 per cent of Australians who could not afford to take part in the sale.</para><para>Let me go through the arguments again. The government set a share price of around $3.35 a share. Within a day of listing, that rose to over $4, delivering a paper profit to shareholders of $2.6 billion, at public expense. Within a month, the publicly funded 
 windfall gain was up to $5 billion. Eight months later, it now stands at over $11 billion and is still rising. Let us make this very clear: this government sold the first third of Telstra for $11 billion less than it was worth, effectively transferring $11 billion of windfall gains from the public ownership by 100 per cent of Australians to the private ownership by 10 per cent of Australians. And they dared call that a successful float.</para><para>Let us look at who profited. Within two months of the float, in a massively publicised $7 billion speculative orgy, over a third of Telstra's shares changed hands. Of the 20 largest shareholders lucky enough to be allocated shares, only one did not take the money and run. One of the biggest winners was the largest foreign investor, the Bank of Ireland, which for its one-month investment in Australia made a profit of over $28 million. In fact, most of the foreign investors sold within the first few months, with windfall capital gains of almost $1 billion, again at public expense. If the government had got the pricing of Telstra right, there should not have been such outrageous windfall gains. Months before the float, stockbrokers were valuing Telstra at between $3.70 and $4 a share. So why did the government set a share price that undervalued the float by $3 billion?</para><para>I believe that a massive undervaluation will happen again with the sale of the rest of Telstra. Even with the Commonwealth Bank, when 49 per cent of the company had already been floated, the government still got the final price wrong by about $2.8 billion. I have absolutely no confidence that if this sale bill is approved—and it looks like it will be—the next government, whether it be coalition or Labor, will sell Telstra at a price that is fair to the 90 per cent of us who do not own shares in it. I have complete confidence that they will again deliver a huge, publicly subsidised windfall gains to their friends in the finance sector, to the banks, to the foreign investors and to those who can afford to buy in.</para><para>The failure to deliver a genuine improvement in public sector finances by selling one third of Telstra is just one of the many pre-election promises that this government has 
 failed to keep on the Telstra sale. Remember the customer service guarantee? It was supposed to guarantee that service levels would be enhanced on what they were under Labor. Well, on every indicator, they have gotten worse. According to the Australian Communications Authority, the percentage of new rural services provided by the agreed date has fallen from 82 per cent in 1996 to just 64 per cent in March this year. The number of faults in rural areas cleared within a day has fallen from 74 per cent to 59 per cent. No wonder the bush is screaming about the prospect of more of Telstra being sold off. The reason for this decline in service is not hard to find. It is there in the 3,000 Telstra jobs lost from rural areas last year. That includes 248 staff in Tasmania and 517 in Queensland. Even the government's minimal promises last time to Senators Harradine and Colston about keeping jobs in Tassie and rural Queensland were not kept.</para><para>Then there was the promise to spend the money on the environment. The Natural Heritage Trust Fund, as we all know, was set up, and Senator Harradine got it topped up by $100 million. But then the bulk of its funding was allocated to the primary industries portfolio. The few increases in environment spending within the fund have been offset by reductions in environment programs within the Department of the Environment proper, where the funding has fallen by $70 million a year, or 30 per cent, since this government took office.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>YW4</name.id><name role="metadata">MACDONALD</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Macdonald</name></talker><para>—That is quite untrue, and you know it.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>8U4</name.id><name role="metadata">Lees, Sen Meg</name><name role="display">Senator LEES</name></talker><para>—It is $70 million a year less, Senator, since you took office. So many holes have developed in the NHT bucket that much very valuable funding has gone to projects previously funded by states, local governments, individuals and other organisations.</para></talk.start></continue><para>This bill shows a breathless contempt indeed for parliament, and also for the constitutional separation of powers doctrine, by leaving the decision of whether this bill becomes law in the hands of the executive rather than the  parliament. This is because the proclamation of whether this bill becomes 
 law is left up to the incoming government. The constitution of Australia is quite clear about who makes the laws, and it is not the cabinet. Section 51 says that the parliament shall have the power to make laws, but this bill gives cabinet—or, more correctly, Executive Council—the power to make laws, and that is not appropriate. If the government wants this bill passed before the election and actionable only if its mandate is proven, then it should recognise that its mandate can be tested only by the parliament, and that parliament consists of two houses: the House of Representatives and the Senate.</para><para>Finally, I wish to move to my second reading amendment. We are discussing this bill in a vacuum—blindfolded—because we do not yet have the report from the Australian Communications Authority on how the universal service obligations can be improved. That report is due on 15 August. It is premature to discuss this bill before that date and before we know what legal changes will be needed to deliver service obligations to the public on things like digital services. Let us remember that the government's customer service guarantee has failed to deliver better services under the partly privatised Telstra. Surely this government would want to ensure that they get the regulatory system right this time before they proceed to sell off the rest. My amendment seeks to defer consideration of the bill until after that report is received, and I would hope that any senators genuinely interested in improving Telstra services would want this information before they consider the sale bill any further.</para><para>In conclusion, let me state that the government has not a shred of credibility in insisting that this bill be passed now. Every precondition that the government—or, indeed, Independent senators—set on the first float has been breached. The float was a failure in every sense: in terms of public finance, in terms of customer service and in terms of improving competition. The Telstra one-third sale was a monumental mistake and a monumental public policy failure that enriched a few at the expense of the many. This Senate would be compounding folly and failure threefold if it agreed to the sale of the rest of 
 Telstra, and it would be flying in the face of the 62 per cent of Australians who, according to the recent Morgan poll, are stridently opposed to the sale of Telstra. Those National Party senators, who all seem to be missing at the moment—and, indeed, all senators in this place—should take careful note of the overwhelming and growing public opposition to this sale.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Patterson)</name></talker><para>—Senator Lees, you have foreshadowed that amendment, haven't you?</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>8U4</name.id><name role="metadata">LEES</name><name role="display">Senator Lees</name></talker><para>—Yes.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>5477</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise in this debate to oppose the <inline ref="r482">Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 1998</inline>  and to support the second reading amendment to be moved on behalf of the opposition that further consideration of this bill be postponed and be an order of the day for the first day of sittings in 1999.</para></talk.start><para>One would understand members of the public being bemused by the fact that we are debating a bill which this government has promised will not be put into effect until after the next election.

Firstly, it could have waited until the next sittings, which are due to commence on 10 August, but probably, more appropriately, it could have waited until it actually had the mandate of the Australian people, which I do not believe it will get.

The Senate is being asked to consider legislation which is not urgent and which the government says it will not proclaim, if the bill is passed, until after the next election—which would see no possibility of this legislation being passed. The government is doing it with a number of senators who would not be returned at the next election were those poll outcomes to be reflected. That is a matter which will concern the Australian people, given that, on this issue, we do not have the detail as to exactly what the government is proposing to do with the proceeds of the sale.</para></talk.start></continue><para>We have heard in the past that this measure is to pay off government debt. There have been all sorts of claims made about the position that this government faced when it came into office. Let us contrast that position with the position that the Labor government faced when it came into office in 1983. There have been all sorts of claims about so-called budget black holes. In 1983 the Hawke government was elected. In the budget preceding the election, the then Treasurer had indicated that a proposed deficit for the 1983 budget—this is the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), who was then Treasurer—would be in the vicinity of $6 billion. During the campaign, it became known that it was going to 
 blow out to at least $8 billion. What did we find out after the election? We now know that there was not a truthful position presented to the Australian people by the then Prime Minister, Mr Fraser, and his Treasurer, Mr Howard.</para><para>After Saturday, 5 March, the new Labor government found out that the projected budget deficit for the next year would be in the vicinity of $9.6 billion. This is 1983 dollars. What does that translate to? In today's dollar terms, something in excess of a budget black hole—Mr Howard's budget black hole—of $22 billion. The position that John Howard and Malcolm Fraser, former Prime Minister, left the country in in 1983 was far worse than the position that allegedly applied to the Liberal government when it came to office in 1996.</para><para>We are considering this bill in the context that we really do not know the detail of the government's proposal as to what they will do with proceeds of sale if this bill is passed into law, given assent and acted upon. We really do not know. All that we can do is say, `How can we judge the statements of this government and its actions?' How can we transform the promises that this government makes into actions it might take, if it is in the extremely fortunate position of securing government after the next election. The polls at the moment are saying that that is an extremely unlikely eventuality.</para><para>We are going to have to rely upon the statements of the Prime Minister. This is the Prime Minister, let me remind you, who, as Treasurer, was responsible for one of the greatest turnarounds in public policy that ever occurred. This is the Prime Minister who, according to newspapers of the day, in 1977, after the budget, described the position of the government as `lies, lies, lies'. What had occurred is this. Tax cuts were promised. People were actually told that they could ring up a certain number and be told what they would get out of those tax cuts. What happened after the election? The next budget took those tax cuts away. So not only do you have to look at the detail of the package, not only do you have to have the opportunity to examine the package in detail and understand 
 exactly what it means, but also you have to be able to accept that this government will act on those promises and not act in the way that it has.</para><para>One has only to look at the situation that we now face—the proposal that this government will pursue the introduction of a goods and services tax. That is a tax which the current Prime Minister said would never, ever be introduced. This Prime Minister has said that it was a dead issue and would never, ever be revisited. It is now obviously going to be a key plank in this government's re-election strategy. That is the form of this government in terms of its credibility on promises that it makes. This is a situation which we will carry into the next election. This is the contrast that we will present to the Australian people in relation to this government's promises and its actions. And there are many, many, other issues.</para><para>We are starting to see bits and pieces of the detail of the proposed package trickle out.

Let us wait and see what the detail is. Let us see exactly what comes out of it for rural and regional Australia. There is a lot of scepticism out there. This 
 government will not get away with a glib announcement that some magnificent thing is going to change. People will want to see the detail. They are going to think very carefully about promises that this government makes. They will analyse those commitments in the light of broken commitments that this government has made—whether you go back to the 1977 actions of the current Prime Minister, which were described on the front page of the <inline font-style="italic">Illawarra Mercury</inline> as `lies, lies, lies' or whether you go to the budget black hole in 1983 where the Hawke Labor government was left with an over $22 billion black hole in today's dollar terms or whether you go to the Prime Minister's commitment that there would never, ever be a GST and that he would not be pursuing it. You can see the contrast on that. The Australian public will look very carefully at this announcement. Certainly the bush will. We have seen the passing of the National Party and Liberal Party vote in some areas to One Nation. That is a reflection of people's lack of confidence in the Liberal Party and the National Party—the coalition. It is about their desire to replace that group with another group of people.</para><para>Some of the Liberal Party vote has clearly come to Labor. We expect that there will be a very significant movement to Labor at the next election, particularly in my state of Tasmania. If you look at the most recent polling there, the Liberal Party polling is showing up at about 28 or 29 per cent. That may well be an overstatement of the vote, but I can assure you that in terms of the privatisation issue, the community has overwhelmingly rejected the proposal to privatise any part of the Hydro-Electric Corporation—the Hydro—in Tasmania, if you can believe the myriad opinion polls on the issue. Yet the Liberal government in Tasmania is continuing to pursue that option, irrespective of obvious opposition in the community. At the same time, there is obvious opposition to the privatising of Telstra. But what is this Liberal-National Party coalition doing? They are pursuing it with a bill which they are seeking to pass prior to gaining a mandate from the people on the issue. The reason that they are pursuing it is that they know after the next election they will not have a mandate for 
 it; they will not have the numbers in this place.</para><para>Senator Lee suggested that the Labor Party would act on this bill if it were elected in the next election.

I think that the carrots and promises of the government should be examined before we again jump in to sell our most important business. My colleague Senator Lees dealt this morning with the flawed economic arguments for selling such a profitable public asset as Telstra and the hash the government made of the float; the value of the Telstra 
 shares is, I understand, around $10 billion higher than when they were sold.</para></talk.start><para>What I want to address today is the extraordinary sweetener that was used by the government to sell one-third of Telstra. Of course, I am referring to the Natural Heritage Trust Fund. This was the sell: the environment would be the winner and unprecedented amounts would be spent on repair, restoration and protection. My colleague Senator Lees rightly called the offer blackmail. She quoted a senior government adviser, who said in <inline font-style="italic">Scitech</inline> magazine:</para><para>We are appalled at the lies and the deception involved in this issue. It is an exercise based on just one thing—finding a way to sell off Telstra. The linkage to the environment is just a sop, designed to cloud the Telstra sale issue and to try to blackmail other parties and the general community into accepting it.</para><para>Anyone who looks at the figures can quickly see that the Natural Heritage Trust is a blatant and cynical political fraud. There is simply no way the interest from the $1 billion supposedly to be diverted from the Telstra sale could possibly pay to rectify the enormous environment problems confronting Australia.</para><para>And those who closely follow political debate in Australia will soon see the chasm between the proposed Telstra funding and the government's own admissions about the extent of these problems. Several senior ministers including Senator Hill have publicly declared that these problems are already costing us a minimum of $1.5 billion a year and are rapidly getting worse.</para><para>Leaving aside, just for a moment, all the short termism associated with the use of the revenue for a five-year program—after which, who knows what will happen to the environment?—we discovered that large amounts of this $1.25 billion have already replaced core environment funding. The minister said over and over again, `This is additional funding.' In the very first sentence of the glossy package which invites community groups to make application for funds, it says:</para><para>The Commonwealth will invest an additional $1.25 billion from the Natural Heritage Trust over five years.</para><para>It could not be plainer. Again, my colleague Senator Lees warned that the Natural Heritage Trust Fund would be a perfect vehicle for cost shifting. She pointed out the problems with 
 unclear definitions and objectives. She moved amendments designed to eliminate cost shifting by the states, but of course these were not taken up.</para><para>The Labor Party tried to make a big deal out of the discovery that 80 per cent of NHT money had gone to coalition electorates—and, indeed, it has. We would have liked to have seen much more interest in repairing and protecting natural environments in urban areas, but by and large community groups in the city have not been so financially affected by the degradation of the environment as have farmers and they have not come forward in such large numbers as landcare groups and the like. So, whilst that is an issue, I do not think it is anything compared with the shonky deal that the government has done in siphoning off funds to projects outside the environment; projects which should be funded by other means and by other governments.</para><para>It is very difficult to get figures from the states and local government to determine the level of cost shifting, but there were some spectacular examples in the last round of grants which showed that Natural Heritage Trust funding is now paying for the most basic state and local government works. I will go through some examples: an irrigation drainage system for northern Victoria costing more than $1 million, with no matching dollars from the state government; management strategies for flood prone urban areas; levee banks for Cobram; the Myrtleford breakaway program to stop the Ovens River breaking into Happy Valley Creek; the Leadbeater possum recovery plan, $86,000 to save possums when the state government's approval of logging programs presents the greatest threat to those possums; a flood plain strategy for Myrtleford; and the Nyah Nyah West sewerage system. Also, just the other day Senator Parer admitted that $12 million of Natural Heritage Trust Fund money would be used to repair the Hume Dam.</para><para>I am not saying that these are not worthwhile projects—I am prepared to accept that many of them are—but I think we need to ask whether the money should come from the Natural Heritage Trust Fund. We have to remember that that was promised for the 
 environment. We need to ask whether these projects should have been funded out of public infrastructure moneys. The point I want to make is that millions of dollars have gone from the Natural Heritage Trust Fund, often without any matching dollars from the states, on work which should have been funded in any case.</para><para>Most of the projects that I mentioned earlier are in Victoria, and Senators will be aware that the Victorian state government is running a huge surplus. Why should the Commonwealth help Mr Kennett make a hero of himself amongst the business world with his obscene surplus? In case Senator Hill had not noticed, the Victorian government continues to slice away at environment spending in Victoria to the point where there is almost no-one left in the Department of Natural Resources and Energy. I must say that it is just as well that we have a reasonably good landcare network in that state, because they are essentially the only ones left to do anything about fixing up the thousands of hectares in Victoria which have been destroyed by inappropriate farming practices.</para><para>Millions of dollars have gone into work on private land. Again, I would not argue that none of this will have good environmental outcomes—I am sure it will—but you do have to wonder about a waste water reuse system for the Bright golf course. You have to ask yourself about the program for perennial pastures, the reclamation of eroding sand dunes for the purposes of cropping in the Mallee, the purchase of pneumatic pruning gear for the Dundas Tablelands and farm drainage at the Wandella catchment. I know that farmers are having a very hard time, but Natural Heritage Trust money was promised for the environment. I repeat the minister's words: `Australia's largest ever environmental rescue effort'. That was his claim.</para><para>Leaving aside the questions of cost shifting or whether the money is actually being spent on projects which will have worthwhile, long-term benefits to the environment, I think we need to examine whether the money is additional because that was the key for the government's selling to Senator Harradine, Senator Colston, a lot of people in the conser 
 vation movement and a lot of people out there in the bush the sale of one-third of our most important public asset.</para><para>My office asked the Parliamentary Library to take a look at Commonwealth spending on the environment. I will start with 1995-96, Labor's last year of office. The Commonwealth budget for the environment—and this is the budget spending on environment strategies, the EPA, the Australian Heritage Commission, the Australian Nature Conservation Agency and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority—was $212 million. In 1996-97, the coalition's first year of government, the core spending dropped to $174 million and then that was topped up with $20 million from the Natural Heritage Trust Fund, making a total of $194 million. So that was a drop in overall funding of $18 million and a drop in core funding of $38 million.</para><para>In the next year, Natural Heritage Trust funding stepped up to $96 million and core funding dropped back to $160 million. That was a $14 million slice off the previous year. This financial year, 1998-99, the core funding has dropped a further $18 million. So back in 1995-96, the spending was $212 million and this year it is just $143 million. Core spending, in other words, has come down nearly $70 million since the coalition came to government, and that is a drop of about one-third.</para><para>The spending on the environment is not additional; it has been used to plug the hole created by cuts to existing spending. The question has to be asked: what happens at the end of 2001 when the money runs out? I simply do not know and I do not get any answers from the government to that question either. There is not much left of the family silver to sell and I do not see this government being prepared to raise taxes for what will be an ongoing and an increasingly serious need to address environment problems and to protect what we have left in this country.</para><para>The figures that I quoted are preliminary because, as I said, it is quite a difficult job to find out where the money went and where it came from. These figures were prepared by the Parliamentary Library and I seek leave to table that advice.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>EU4</name.id><name role="metadata">O'CHEE</name><name role="display">Senator O'Chee</name></talker><para>—We will not oppose the tabling of those figures, but I do note that the person who prepared the figures admits that they are simplistic.</para></talk.start><para>Leave granted.</para></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>1M6</name.id><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name></talker><para>—I raise all of this because I want to point out to honourable senators that this government cannot be trusted to deliver on its promises. Whatever it says about spending on telephone services to the bush should be treated with the utmost caution. In fact, I suggest that it should not be believed.</para></talk.start></continue><para>It is very interesting to hear the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) saying that part of the money from the sale of the rest of Telstra would be used to provide Australians with a package of socially desirable gifts which we will all feel good about. But the question I ask is: how do we know that this is not just another tall tale and that the package will simply fill a hole left by underspending in schools, hospitals, employment programs and the like? Whatever this package is, I think we can be sure it will be dressed up in all the tinsel in the world and sound like a great deal. Or will it? I think Australians are smart enough to know a core promise when they see one. If the Prime Minister is saying his bundle of goodies is a core promise to do some good out there—additional spending on who knows what at this stage—then I think they will be smart enough to see through the baubles.</para><para>I was interested to hear the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Fischer, last night talk about giving all Australians local telephone calls at the rates that we are accustomed to in the city. `Everyone will have local call rates,' he said. I would expect this to be small comfort to many people in isolated areas. The number of people who do not have local call rates is quite small and that is because their nearest neighbours are some distance away. These people will still need to call outside their immediate area and to regional centres and to cities much more than those people who live in large built-up areas.</para><para>Nevertheless, giving these people local call rates is something the Democrats have been advocating for years. In fact, we have argued 
 that there is absolutely no reason anymore why people in rural and isolated areas should have to pay long distance charges at all. It is completely unfair. We get cheap calls in the city, but they are subsidised by the bush. Here is yet another great by-product of competition. The cost goes down where the market is strongest. Advances in technology are reducing the cost of telecommunications to the city, particularly to businesses, but again people in the country will miss out.</para><para>It costs Telstra no more to place a call from Mildura to Melbourne than from North Melbourne to South Melbourne. Distance is no longer a factor in cost. Gone are the days when we had telephone exchanges, which were mostly staffed by women who pushed plugs into holes. Technology has made distance completely irrelevant to the equation. The Democrats have been pointing this out for a long time—ever since I have been in the Senate, at least.</para><para>So this offer is no big deal. People in the bush should not be swept away by the prospect of having dual analog and digital services either. We know that the coalition was complicit in getting rid of analog by the year 2000. Senator Macdonald earlier this morning shouted across the chamber, `Labor did that,' as if he had nothing to do it with. I want to point out today that the government has had lots of opportunities to reverse that decision. We have put up amendments time and time again, but the government prefers to sit back and blame Labor for this mistake and votes each of them down.</para><para>Mr Fischer could use the revenue from the sale of Telstra to compensate Optus for reversing this decision of Labor which it supported to the hilt at the time, but we know that the Howard government will not do that. Whatever the bait is that comes with the sale of the rest of Telstra, I think we should be wary—Senator Harradine should be very wary. The government has not demonstrated that anyone in Australia will be better off. It is bad policy and Australians should not be hoodwinked by the promise of baubles and beads. Remember the Natural Heritage Trust. Remember the core promises. Remember that 
 this government does not care to be a provider of public services.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>5484</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise, as a Labor senator, to oppose the legislation that the Senate is considering, known as the Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill, and effectively the sell off by the Australian government of the remaining two-thirds of Telstra.

I draw the attention of those people to the fact that the sell off of Telstra is a very important debate. I also draw the attention of those listening to this broadcast to the fact that it is an example of the contempt that members of the so-called coalition—the National Party and the Liberal Party—have to the sell off of Telstra, despite the vigorous grandstanding we have seen from a number of them over the last week in particular. They have suddenly discovered that it is an issue. They are making a very small contribution to this debate. In fact, there are only two government members in the chamber today.

If the bill is passed by the parliament and the Senate and proclaimed after the election, if the Liberal and National parties win that election, the government will lose the capacity to give direction to Telstra. There will be a significant restriction on our capacity as an Australian nation to exercise any significant degree of influence in the vital strategic direction of a national economy—namely, the telecommunications sector—and our ability to ensure that that strategic sector includes all of Australia, not just the major urban centres.</para><para>Other speakers in this debate have outlined the importance of Telstra to the nation's economy. A great deal has been made about the effect of the sale of Telstra on the budget bottom line. In my view, it has not been a very accurate assessment of the issues and its implications. The basic argument runs something like this: there will be a benefit to the budget position of the Commonwealth government regarding debt and the bottom line of the budget. Financial commentators are saying that the Commonwealth government might make a further $40 billion on the sale. That in turn will enable it to make a public debt saving, reducing government debt, at a current cost of that debt to the Common 
 wealth of about six per cent. That is a figure of about $2.4 billion per annum.</para><para>This should also be judged against a background of Commonwealth government debt being at a reasonable level. One of the furphies in this debate is that Australian government debt levels are nowhere near unsustainable levels, unlike some other states in Australia—South Australia, Victoria and Tasmania. The simplest and totally incorrect assessment is that there is a $2.4 billion saving to the budget. That is obviously wrong because, whilst we will have a saving to the budget, at the same time we lose the dividend, or income stream, from the profits of our current two-thirds ownership of Telstra. In 1997-98, that was $1.2 billion.</para><para>So we are not dealing with a static gain of $1.2 billion to the budget. We have to factor in the increasing dividend stream of Telstra over the next few years. If we look at the past increase in dividends from Telstra, we find there has been a steady increase in the dividend—that is, the money paid to the budget from Telstra profits—at the rate of 15 per cent per year. At some point in the future, there will be what is called a crossover, a point when the budget bottom line gets worse because of the loss of an increasing dividend. That will be greater than the gain from the public debt that is reduced as a result of a two-thirds sale of Telstra.</para><para>This issue, unfortunately, has not been publicly reported widely or even debated in any significant way. I argue that it is reasonable to expect that Telstra's dividends will continue to increase at the rate that has occurred since corporatisation. In fact, independent analysts are predicting a more rapid increase in profit for Telstra, but let's be conservative and use that figure of 15 per cent that I referred to earlier. The crossover point when the government, that is, the people of Australia, begin to lose money from the revenue to budget—and it is not some far distant point—will occur in the year 2002 or 2003.</para><para>We are looking at a point in time four or five years into the future from now when, as a result of the remaining two-thirds sale of Telstra, the Commonwealth government 
 becomes a net loser. Sure, the people who have the money to buy shares in Telstra may make a net gain, depending on the purchase price and the sale price, but the Commonwealth government becomes a net loser in four or five years' time.</para><para>When one-third of Telstra was sold enthusiastic privatisers argued—and they continue to argue this on the basis of selling the remaining two-thirds—that it would inject a new private sector approach into Telstra and make it more profitable. It will inject a new element of rigour. Shareholders demand a better return, so it should improve profits and return on investment.</para><para>I have never believed that to be true, but if it is, the crossover point—in other words, the increased profitability that should be flowing back to the public purse because of the increase in profit that should come back to the Commonwealth government—is reached at an even earlier period, that is, in three or four years' time. Even if we assume a more modest 10 per cent improvement in profit, that makes a difference to the crossover point. It moves it out to the year 2004 or 2005, that is, six or seven years from now when the Commonwealth would start making a loss.</para><para>I would also point out—and I have not gone into this in any detail—that I have not included the loss to government revenue of franking credits on private share ownership. Because, as the shares are sold to the private sector, there is a further loss to government revenue as a consequence of the issues relating to franking credits. It is estimated that will be a further loss to government revenue of $400 million to $500 million a year.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Senator Cooney interjecting</inline>—</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name></talker><para>—Four to five hundred million dollars a year, Senator Cooney. You can paint a range of different scenarios and different assumptions all based on independent market analysis of the likely profits, and you still get a loss to the bottom line of the budget inside 10 years. In other words, on conservative projections, the Commonwealth will have lost money in 10 years.</para></talk.start></continue><para>If this government's intention is to build into long-term expenditure greater expenditure 
 based on the sale of Telstra and/or tax cuts on the basis of an assumption that there is an improved bottom line to the budget, it will not be there in four, five, six or 10 years' time. What do you do after that period of time if you have no other assets to sell? You either have to cut your expenditure or increase your tax or sell some other form of asset. I suspect that the only one remaining will be Australia Post.</para><para>I referred earlier to the ending of the government's ability to direct Telstra and that is obviously inevitable once it passes into private hands. This ability to direct Telstra has been vitally important towards ensuring a relatively equitable distribution of technology throughout all of Australia. This is a very important issue for rural and regional Australia.</para><para>There are rapid developments in technology. If you are a private shareholder, you will rightly demand the highest return on your investment and you will demand that the investment is made where you will get that highest return from. That will be from the major urban centres. It is probably going to be great for everyone who lives in Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane or Adelaide. But, if you do not live in those major urban centres, the demands of the private shareholders will be, `Don't invest in those areas outside the core, the major urban areas. Don't invest, because it is too costly. We don't get a decent return.'</para><para>Inevitably, the core—the major urban centres—will do much better than the non-core or rural and regional areas of Australia in the next five, 10 or 15 years as Telstra invests in new technology. Those same private shareholders will rightly demand the highest possible return. That is not going to come from rural and regional Australia where the cost structures relating to the installation of new technology are much higher.</para><para>People in rural and regional Australia, including my home state of Tasmania, understand the implications of this sale of the remaining two-thirds Telstra. There is certainly a growing centralisation of service and movement of jobs to the core, or major urban 
 centres, and a retreat from the non-core centres.</para><para>I do not like the terms `core' and `non-core'. That was the glib phrase used by the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, when he said he was going to implement certain promises and break others, that is, core promises and non-core promises. Of course, we all remember his commitment that he would not be privatising the rest of Telstra before the next election. Yet here we are today considering legislation to sell off two-thirds of Telstra. Another broken promise from Mr Howard.</para><para>We should remind the Senate of the never, ever promise—never, ever a GST and, of course, a further assurance that it will never, ever go up. That is the record of this Prime Minister on Telstra and other related important issues.</para><para>We have seen attempts made over the last week by National Party senators. There have been public demands all of a sudden from Senator O'Chee, who is in the chamber, Senator McGauran, Senator Sandy Macdonald, Senator Boswell, who is the leader of the National Party without portfolio in the Senate, and Senator Brownhill—although I do not think I have seen too much from him. We have had doorstops over the last week from senators sounding stern warnings to the Liberal Party that they are not going to cop the sale of Telstra unless rural and regional Australia is looked after.</para><para>Of course, they are attempting to justify their position. The National Party has rolled over on this yet again. The doormat of the coalition has been trodden on yet again. The National Party has precious little influence in this government. They have been engaged in a form of grandstanding to justify at least partially their position to their rural and regional constituents.</para><para>I think it was rather aptly described as `noise and static' from the National Party. They are not my words; that is the description by the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, of the National Party senators—`noise and static at doorstops as they walked in and out of the Senate'. Unfortunately, in this debate `noise and static' is a fairly apt description. That is about the level of technology we are going to 
 have in rural and regional Australia—noise and static over the next 10 to 20 years.</para><para>In conclusion, I do want to make some comments about my colleague Senator Harradine from Tasmania. I will pay him at least a partial compliment. I do know him as a fairly competent negotiator in the trade union context. He was always able to drive what I considered to be a fairly hard bargain. But I, as a Tasmanian colleague of Senator Harradine, have to say to him—I do not know whether he is listening to this debate in his room—that we do not know yet the details of the deal that we can only assume he has done with the government to sell the remaining two-thirds of Telstra. On the last occasion, when one-third of Telstra was privatised, it did not stop job losses in Tasmania, it did not guarantee the fundamental upgrading of technology in our telecommunications system that is needed—and not just needed in the next year or two.</para><para>You can buy a little bit of time. This government has done the same thing to the National Party. You can buy a little bit of time with $100 million. It sounds like a lot of money, but, when you think about the tens of billions of dollars that are necessary for telecommunications investment, it is not a lot of money in that context. You can buy a little bit of time—a year here, a year there—and that is really all Senator Harradine is doing: buying a little bit of time for Tasmania. I certainly know that, from a regional perspective, from a Tasmanian perspective, in 10 or 20 years—and unfortunately not many politicians do look that far ahead—we will look at Tasmania and other rural and regional areas in this country, we will look back on this point in time on this sale of the remaining two-thirds of Telstra, and I am sure that the relative economic and financial position relating to the telecommunications industry will have gone backwards. Tasmania will have gone backwards.</para><para>It is no good just looking at the next six months, the next year or the next two years. We have to look at and make a judgment about where rural and regional Australia will be over the next decade or two. The reality will be that the core areas, the major urban 
 centres, may do well out of the privatisation of Telstra, but the non-core areas—like Tasmania, which Senator Harradine says he represents—will have gone backwards.</para><para>Senator Harradine should remember this: it really is down to his vote. That is the reality. If he is going to vote for this government package in the next day or two he should know full well that, as a direct result, he is going to deliver to Tasmania—and to other areas of rural and regional Australia—a relative movement backwards in our financial, economic and employment circumstances for the next 10 to 20 years. I certainly hope that he thinks long and hard about that if he has, in fact, done a deal—as we believe he has—with this government in order to privatise the remaining two-thirds of Telstra.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>5487</page.no><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name><name.id>SF4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I refer to the second reading speech on the <inline ref="r482">Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 1998</inline> . As you know, Mr Acting Deputy President Hogg, the second reading speech is the speech made by the minister when the legislation is brought into the chamber. It is a speech that puts the case for the government and explains what the government is on about. It is an interesting second reading speech by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman). In the last paragraph of the first page, it says:</para></talk.start><para>We delivered on that promise—</para><para>that is, the promise to float a third of Telstra—</para><para>resulting in an outstandingly successful public share offer that has been universally applauded in the community, and which was overwhelmingly supported by the ordinary investors—the mums and dads of Australia.</para><para>It then goes on to say that about 500,000 people invested in it. It is hardly fair to say that, because a large number of people bought shares, this was universally applauded by the community and the mums and dads of Australia who gathered parts of the shareholdings of this company. I want to concentrate on the next paragraph of the second reading speech, which begins on page 2, which says:</para><para>We are again delivering on our promises. We promised that there would be no further sell-down of the Commonwealth interest without the Govern 
 ment first getting a mandate from the people at a Federal Election.</para><para>It goes on:</para><para>Here is the proof of our words. We have faith in the good judgement of the Australian people. We are spelling out the legislative basis on which a further sale will take place so they can make fully-informed choices at the polls. This Bill clearly provides that, when enacted, the act can only be proclaimed to come into effect on a date after the next Federal Election.</para><para>There are two uses of the words `a'—a very short word, but in this context a very significant word. `A' is the shortest word in the English language. The government is saying that they will not sell the rest of Telstra until after a federal election, not necessarily the next federal election.</para><para>Following on from that is this: if this bill is passed and becomes an act, before coming into operation it must be proclaimed at some time in the future. It can be proclaimed next year, the year after, five years from now or 10 years from now. What that means is this: suppose the people of Australia say, `Well, look we don't want the sale of Telstra; we're going to vote a Labor government in'—and a very wise choice that would be, I think you would have to agree, Mr Acting Deputy President—`and we will give that Labor government a majority in the House of Representatives,' which means it then becomes the government, `but, in keeping with what has now become the usual situation in the Senate, we will not give it the majority in the Senate.' That means that, although a Labor government has been voted in, it cannot undo this legislation. That legislation remains there to be proclaimed when the next conservative government comes in, which might be 10 years from now.</para><para>Mr Acting Deputy President, what is fair about that? This bill has been put forward on the basis that people will have a chance at the next election to say whether or not they want it. But the reality is that it will remain there unproclaimed until the next conservative government comes to office. If at the next election people want to reject this bill but at the same time also want to put a different arrangement of party strengths in the Senate from the arrangement in force in the House of 
 Representatives, they can do nothing about it. Wouldn't it be better and fairer for people to be able to vote on this at the next election and then see what happens in the next parliament, rather than committing to a future parliament the difficulty of having to undo the legislation if it wants to carry out a mandate the people may have given it not to go on with this legislation?</para><para>Mr Acting Deputy President, why has the government brought this bill forward now? Why doesn't it promise in the second reading speech that, if defeated in the House of Representatives at the next election, it will agree to undo this legislation? Why doesn't the government do that, instead of saying in the second reading speech:</para><para>We promised that there would be no further sell-down of the Commonwealth interest without the Government first getting a mandate from the people at a Federal Election.</para><para>I repeat: a federal election—not at the next federal election, but at `a federal election'. So I think there is much to be worried about in the attitude taken by the government in this matter.</para><para>I want to comment a little on this: it has been said that the Labor government sold the Commonwealth Bank and the airline—and that is true. It has been said also, `Well, that's the same as this government selling Telstra.' But there is a big difference between selling an airline and a bank and selling Telstra. That point is brought out well in section 69 of the constitution, which states:</para><para>On a date or dates to be proclaimed by the Governor-General after the establishment of the Commonwealth the following departments of the public service in each State shall become transferred to the Commonwealth:-</para><para>Posts, telegraphs, and telephones:</para><para>Naval and military defence:</para><para>Lighthouses, lightships, beacons, and buoys:</para><para>Quarantine.</para><para>Our constitution specifies those four categories of matters as having been assigned to the Commonwealth. Looking at them, they are all matters essential to the good running of the community.</para><para>Going from the bottom up, we have quarantine. Of course quarantine is something that 
 should not be privatised. Quarantine guards what comes into the country, making sure that our health and safety are preserved and making sure that our country's stock and plants are not adversely affected. That sort of public service needs to be carried out by the Commonwealth. Lighthouses, lightships, beacons and buoys: again, a concept of a public nature. Naval and military defences: would we privatise naval or military defences? Of course we would not.</para><para>Then the first on this list—going upwards of course, but saying them last: posts, telegraphs and telephones. The founding fathers chose to put posts, telegraphs and telephones—that is, the subject matter being dealt with by the Telstra act—together with naval and military defence; lighthouse, lightships, beacons and buoys; and quarantine. Along with customs and excise, which are dealt with in a different part of the constitution, those were very early matters that were taken up by the founding fathers.</para><para>When the Australia bill, the forerunner to the constitution, was discussed in Sydney on 6 April 1891, which was a very long time ago, clause 10, right at the start, read as follows:</para><para>The control of the following departments of the public service shall be at once assigned to and assumed and taken over by the executive government of the commonwealth, and the commonwealth shall assume the obligations of all or any state or states with respect to such matters, that is to say—</para><para>Customs and excise,</para><para>Posts and telegraphs,</para><para>Military and naval defence,</para><para>Ocean beacons and buoys, and ocean lighthouses and lightships,</para><para>Quarantine.</para><para>The great figure at that meeting was Sir Samuel Griffith, a great Queenslander, as you would know—a person who took on board the fact that posts and telegraphs, the forerunner of the powers that Telstra carries, should be given over to the Commonwealth and looked after by them. Apparently, that great tradition from that great Queenslander is to be ignored, thrown aside, and Telstra is to be privatised.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>N26</name.id><name role="metadata">ABETZ</name><name role="display">Senator Abetz</name></talker><para>—Samuel Griffith preached nothing about privatisation and you know it!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>SF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name></talker><para>—Senator Abetz says that Sir Samuel Griffith said nothing about privatisation.

Senator Abetz is absolutely correct, it bears out the point that Sir Samuel Griffith said nothing about privatisation.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The preamble to this bill is going to be a nightmare for a court which may have to look at it to interpret certain sections of the act. The preamble says, among other things:</para><para>The high-growth and fast-moving telecommunications sector requires competing carriers to have:</para><para>(a) full commercial flexibility, subject to necessary regulatory safeguards . . . </para><para>How is a judge going to interpret that? What does it mean for a body to have `full commercial flexibility' and at the same time be `subject to necessary regulatory safeguards'? And the regulatory safeguards are going to be enormous. Can I just demonstrate: the Telecommunications Act 1997 was made necessary by the one-third privatisation of Telstra. This one-third privatisation required a lot more legislation than before. The legislation that attended to Telstra before that was the Telecommunications Act 1991—a much smaller volume than the Telecommunications Act 1997. The privatisation of Telstra will require a lot more legislation to make it work than would be the situation were it to be kept in public hands. I do not mind that, given my background, but it is going to be a very fertile field for lawyers. People are going to have to interpret, as I say, what is meant by:</para><para>. . . full commercial flexibility, subject to necessary regulatory safeguards.</para><para>The next point in the preamble says:</para><para>(b) an ongoing ability to raise the capital needed to meet changing commercial and customer requirements . . . </para><para>What does that mean?

But given the fact, as illustrated by the Patrick company, for example, that you can strip assets, what is to stop a service provider from arranging its affairs, and arranging the companies through which it is going to deliver its services, in such a way that it can fail to carry out the obligations provided by the act and not have the money to pay any fine that is imposed? The second reading speech said:</para><para>What we—</para><para>that is, the government—</para><para>are saying is that the business of government is not to be in business. The business of government is to set the framework within which business operates.</para><para>It continues:</para><para>Whatever the rhetoric at the time, the incorporation of what is now Telstra under Corporations Law was an explicit recognition that Telstra was and is first and foremost a business. 
</para><para>At that part of the second reading speech the government says, `This is just a business we are dealing with.' Then, when we go to a later part of the speech, we see that it is not simply a business; it is very much a strategic part of Australia's business future. It says:</para><para>Telstra has a vital continuing strategic role in the national economy.</para><para>On pages 4 and 5 of the speech it is just a business; on page 14 it becomes a body that has a vital continuing strategic role in the national economy, and one that must remain in Australian hands and be controlled by Australians. The government has to make up its mind: is it just a business, or is it the strategic body described later in the speech? The government just has not got this matter thought out, and it is a bad time to be passing legislation such as this.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>5490</page.no><name role="metadata">Murphy, Sen Shayne</name><name role="display">Senator MURPHY</name><name.id>FX5</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I have to say that this debate on the <inline ref="r482">Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 1998</inline>  is as much about honesty and integrity as it is about the full sale of Telstra.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>GX5</name.id><name role="metadata">TROETH</name><name role="display">Senator Troeth</name></talker><para>—Sit down.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>FX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Murphy, Sen Shayne</name><name role="display">Senator MURPHY</name></talker><para>—The senator opposite who interjects says, `Sit down.'

He said:</para><para>I am determined that the commitments we made to the Australian people before 2 March are honoured. I do not think any of us can greet with any equanimity the steady decline in respect for our political and parliamentary institutions which has occurred over the past few years.</para><para>He went on:</para><para>One of the reasons why the respect for our institutions has declined is the way in which promises are too freely made and even more freely repudiated after governments are elected to power.</para><para>He went on further and said this:</para><para>And, even more important than other benchmarks against which you are entitled to judge us, in three years time you will be entitled to judge us accord 
 ing to the benchmark of whether or not we have honoured commitments made to the people and to the Australian nation before 2 March.</para><para>What were those commitments? In respect of the further or full privatisation of Telstra, they were very clearly that it would not occur. You can find any number of references to support that. I suppose one of the very good ones is the following, especially as it is in response to a question from a backbencher. This is the Prime Minister, in response to Mr Andren, on 9 December 1996. The Prime Minister was asked:</para><para>Can the Prime Minister clarify the government's position in relation to any further sell-off of Telstra, especially in light of the fact that the people of Australia voted at the last election on the understanding that only part of Telstra would be sold if the coalition formed government?</para><para>The Prime Minister replied:</para><para>There has been no change to that policy. There will be no change to that policy. No attempt will be made by us in the currency of this parliament to sell anything more of Telstra. If there were in the future—and this is repeating exactly what I said in the past—to be any desire on our part to sell another tranche then we would seek a specific mandate from the Australian people. Nothing could be more transparent, nothing could be more consistent and nothing could be more honest.</para><para>I guess a lot of people in this place would have to be thinking to themselves, `Well, what did the Prime Minister really mean?' The Prime Minister was not the only one to make those sorts of commitments. The Leader of the Government in this place, Senator Hill, said on 9 December 1996:</para><para>The government has said it will not be attempting to privatise more than one-third of Telstra. That was the policy we took to the last election. It is clear and unambiguous. It remains the case and has just been repeated clearly and unambiguously by the Prime Minister. So, yes, Senator, I can tell you that is the case.</para><para>What was the case he was confirming? He was asked by Senator Faulkner:</para><para>Can you guarantee, here and now, that the coalition government will not attempt to privatise more than one-third of Telstra?</para><para>As I said, Senator Hill answered:</para><para>I can tell you that is the case.</para><para>If Senator Hill makes a contribution to this debate, which he probably won't, I hope he 
 can actually clarify what he meant at that time. I go to the Minister for Finance and Administration, Mr Fahey, in response to a question from his own backbench, from a member of this coalition government. He was asked a question in relation to any further sale of Telstra, and he said this:</para><para>. . . but I can assure all members of the House that the government will consult the Australian people before it considers any further selldown of Telstra.</para><para>Those are pretty clear, pretty unambiguous and honest commitments at the time.

He went on further to say:</para><para>. . . our position is crystal clear. I am telling you the truth now—</para><para>The truth!</para><para>I was telling the truth then. Our policy is that we will sell one-third and no more, unless the matter is put before the public at election.</para><para>What has happened to the truth? What has happened to honesty? What has happened to integrity?</para><para>That is something I know is very near and dear to the heart of one senator who is not in the chamber at the moment: Senator Harradine. I know he has been praised as a man of honesty and integrity and I guess, on the face of it, I would have to accept that. But I want to go to some words that he said on the full sale of Telstra. I hope, Senator Harradine, you listen to these words because 
 the question will come to you, and you will have to address yourself to the Australian public on a commitment that you made. Senator Harradine, on 9 December 1996, said in relation to the first one-third sale:</para><para>The simple position is that the government in fact did take the issue to the electorate. The electorate made its decision to support the government. I do not know how many would have voted on the basis of a sale of a third of Telstra for the redemption of debt and for the establishment of a natural heritage trust. But, nevertheless, there was a mandate. My view about mandates of popularly elected governments is that the Senate should not simply be obstructionist about them.</para><para>He said further:</para><para>. . . but the Senate should apply certain principles which if those principles and values conflict with the government's legislation in the discharge of its mandate then those principles should prevail. On this particular matter I would have voted very strenuously against the total sale of Telstra.</para><para>I note that in another debate, with regard to the Wik legislation, Senator Harradine had a lot to say about double dissolutions. Back in December 1996 he said:</para><para>One had to make a judgment as to what the government would have done had we blocked the third sale of Telstra. My judgment was that the government would have used it as a double dissolution trigger.</para><para>Very interesting.</para><para>And if that occurred, if they pulled that trigger, then in the current climate you would have a total sale of Telstra. The only other way that the government can get through a total sale of Telstra during this Senate is to gain the numbers in the Senate.</para><para>I ask Senator Harradine: has he given the government the numbers? If he has not, why are we debating this piece of legislation? He went on to say:</para><para>As I read the numbers they are not there for the total sale of Telstra. I would certainly vote against a total sale of Telstra.</para><para>This was in December 1996, and I hope Senator Harradine remembers the statement that he made to the public of Australia at that time. With regard to this proposal for the total sale of Telstra, another interesting aspect of this goes to the question of foreign ownership. Senator Alston said in May 1996:</para><para>The usual furphy about foreign ownership has been put to rest. There will be an absolute limit of less 
 than 12 per cent of the company in foreign hands . . . </para><para>I don't know. I think about 19 per cent of the one-third is in foreign hands already, so goodness knows what would happen if we got a full sale.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>UI4</name.id><name role="metadata">RAY</name><name role="display">Senator Robert Ray</name></talker><para>—There would be a lot more if Parer had not got so many.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>FX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Murphy, Sen Shayne</name><name role="display">Senator MURPHY</name></talker><para>—That is true, Senator Ray.

Let me say this to you, Senator Abetz: it has been a long way short of marvellous; in fact it has been a total flop. In fact it has probably been a disaster, and Senator Harradine knows that, because I know Senator Harradine has been harrying Senator Alston to try to get some things done. I want to have a look at what was promised and quote some words that Senator Alston said about Tasmania. He said:</para></talk.start></continue><para>There is a world of difference between Tasmania and Victoria or New South Wales, where you are close to capital cities which have world-class telecommunications facilities, where there are enormous incentives by virtue of population size for the carriers to keep on providing world best services. Those states and their citizens are immeasurably better off than those in a place like Tasmania where you are lucky to even be able to make a phone call if you live in some parts of the west coast; even if you are in the capital city of that state you are very much a second-class telecommunications citizen.</para><para>That was December 1996. What has changed since then? Let me tell you: not much at all. For $58 million—it was actually supposed to give us something additional—we got zip. We got nothing more than what Telstra had planned all the time. I think that for once in 
 his life Brian Harradine had the pea and thimble trick pulled completely over him.</para><para>Senator Sherry was saying that Brian Harradine has been a good negotiator in respect of the trade union movement. He probably has been; in fact, I would have to agree with that comment. Indeed, I would say that he has used that to some degree to benefit himself, because the only thing that was delivered out of the one-third privatisation sale for Telstra was a promotion for Brian Harradine. It has not been forthcoming in terms of benefits to the state.</para><para>If we look at what has happened with employment, we were supposed to get more employment in Tasmania. In terms of promised upgrades, some have been brought forward but no additional money has been spent. We have had a bit of a bring forward in the provision of some services, but what has happened with a whole host of other services? We do not even have a business sales office in Tasmania any more. If you are in small business in Tasmania and you want to talk to Telstra about services, you have to ring Melbourne. Likewise, the general commercial consumer sales centre that currently employs around 120 people in Hobart is going to be transferred to Melbourne. The network and design construction unit is going to be sold. It employs eight people who are supposed to be paid for out of the Harradine money. What is the term of their contract? Six months. So what is the long-term benefit for Tasmania in that? Of course we will lose the 50 jobs, in effect, when it is sold because a mainland contract firm will win that business and it will be serviced from the mainland.</para><para>The administrative work that was based in Tasmania for Telstra has gone. It has been transferred to Waverley, Melbourne. As I said, commercial sales have gone to Footscray. We got $58 million, but we paid for everything to be transferred to Melbourne.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>N26</name.id><name role="metadata">ABETZ</name><name role="display">Senator Abetz</name></talker><para>—You are wrong.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>FX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Murphy, Sen Shayne</name><name role="display">Senator MURPHY</name></talker><para>—That is what we have done with the money, Senator Abetz, and you ought to do something about it as part of the government.

John Howard said that there would be no move to fully privatise Telstra in the first term of his government. In introducing this bill, he has broken his word, and he has dishonoured himself yet again. It is not possible to debate this legislation without considering the processes by which the government, and others conspiring with them, forced this upon the Senate—several of whom, I might add, could not have legally driven home last night.</para></talk.start><para>Last night, the government gagged all the procedural motions moved in association with this bill. It is true that the Labor Party often moved procedural motions when in government, but we always allowed them to be debated. In 13 years of government, Labor never moved the gag concurrently with the procedural motion. Contrast this with the current government—a government that does not even have the courage to allow its procedural motions to be debated. The opposition would have appreciated the opportunity to have made some comments on the appropriate 
 way in which to manage the legislative agenda in the Senate. Our comments would not have reflected the hypocritical rantings that the current government made when it was in opposition. We would not have argued, as Senator Hill did on countless occasions, that corralling debate was always intrinsically wrong. We would have examined Senator Dr Herron's extensive comments from the opposition benches on the health effects of late sittings. He always prefaced those remarks by saying that he was speaking as a doctor, not as a politician. But last night, as on other occasions, he just sat mute—other than uttering last night the most disgraceful comment I have ever heard in this Senate and we will never forget that that comment was made across the chamber.</para><para>We also would have brought Senator Ian Campbell to account for his previous comments when in opposition about the effect of late night sittings on the staff of this building. But, of course, we were never given the opportunity. At least we got one first last night. We saw Senator Harradine voting for the gag. In fact, we got the trifecta. He voted for the gag three times. One senator, representing 30,000 voters, was effectively able to gag 28 senators representing four million voters so that we could have no say at all.</para><para>Finally, we had an `Independent' from Queensland voting to make us all sit long hours in the full knowledge that he was to return home this morning for what I am led to believe are legitimate reasons.

I do feel sympathy for those coalition senators who are rostered on to ingratiate and cajole Senator Colston. It must be the lowest imaginable job there is in politics. But what I find passing strange is that Senator Colston's recent submission to the magistrates court asserted that he could not concentrate for more than 10 minutes at a time in instructing his defence counsel. Yet he seems to have no problem trading in Telstra shares following his previous enthusiastic support for the government's privatisation. For years, Senator Colston issued press releases and attended rallies defending the public ownership of Telstra. It took a mere $16,000 a year and a job conferring some degree of formal honour and prestige for the convictions of a lifetime to be abandoned. </para></talk.start></continue><para>The government will exploit Senator Colston's defection while tacitly acknowledging his murky past by refusing, belatedly, to accept his vote because of the political embarrassment it would bring it. If this legislation passes, senators who listen carefully might hear a noise from Queensland. It will be Senator Colston's father turning in his grave knowing that his son has stabbed the Labor Party in the back, a Labor Party that his father loved. Like father, like son? Never! Having previously voted to privatise one-third of Telstra, one would have thought Senator Colston would leave well enough alone. But no. In spite of his claimed mental enfeeblement, we find that he has become, as I said earlier, an active share trader in Telstra shares.</para><para>We know that Malcolm Arthur Colston and Dawn Patricia Colston sold one parcel of Telstra shares on 23 December 1997. Another parcel, also held in their joint names, was sold by the Janfern nominee company on 19 December 1997. Yet another parcel, held by the Janfern superannuation fund account and registered in both their names, was sold on 23 December 1997. Yet another parcel, in the sole name of Dr Malcolm Arthur Colston, was also sold on 23 December 1997. At present, Mrs Dawn Colston holds 2,000 shares and one son holds 600 Telstra shares. The profit from the sale of these Telstra shares is, of course, far in excess of the additional $16,000 that attaches to the salary of the Deputy President of the Senate.</para><para>Before anyone accuses me of the politics of envy, let me make one thing perfectly clear: there is absolutely nothing about Senator Colston that I envy. Of course, we know that Senator Colston is not the only individual to acquire Telstra shares. The opposition has now learnt that a spouse of a senior coalition frontbencher managed to purchase 10,000 shares through an investment company in which she has a controlling interest. These were purchased at the time of the float in two separate parcels. In addition, this spouse purchased two parcels personally. Guess when these were disposed of and came off the register? It was on 6 July 1998, the very day the opposition raised questions about the 
 purchase of Telstra shares by ministers and their families.</para><para>The Senate has already heard of the existence and extraordinary share acquisitions of the Minister for Resources and Energy, Senator Parer. We know that Investment Management Pty Ltd, a holding company for the Warwick Parer family trust and a company in which Senator Parer held eight of the nine shares, acquired a parcel of 2,600 Telstra shares on 25 November 1997. This was despite a prohibition on ministers and their staff acquiring shares within 90 days of the Telstra float. This ban, provided in writing to all ministers last August, extends to trusts, nominees and other proxy style arrangements.</para><para>But Senator Parer, running true to form, decided that the ban did not apply to him. What was he thinking when, as he now claims, he brought this issue to the attention of his staff at a meeting and then put it to his staff in writing? How ironic it is that, at the very time Senator Parer was warning his staff off acquiring Telstra shares, he and his wife acquired one parcel through IMPL of 2,600 units; one parcel in the name of Kathleen Parer of 2,200 units; one parcel in Gashbah Pty Ltd of 3,000 units; a parcel in Spanlex Pty Ltd via the Rutherglen superannuation trust of 5,000 units; and one parcel in the name of the Warwick Parer family trust No. 2 account of 2,200 units. That is right: 15,000 shares to the minister and his spouse were tied up in this purchase either through controlling companies or from being bought individually.</para><para>That, of course, does not include the rest of the shares held by the rest of his immediate family either directly in their own names or through an investment vehicle called White Rhinos Pty Ltd, which is a new holding company for the Warwick Parer family trust. These arrangements now account for 8,900 units of Telstra shares and represent at least 18 different parcels of shares at the time of the float.</para><para>We now know that, at the same time Senator Parer was helping himself to a large parcel of shares in defiance of the Prime Minister's directive, Mr Bob Baudino, his media adviser, was also investing in Telstra. Bob Baudino 
 acquired 1,600 units on the day of the float. Two days later, these shares were transferred to the joint names of him and his wife, Olive, at their home address in a Brisbane suburb. Yet Mr Baudino now expects us to believe that he was unaware that these shares were purchased on behalf of him and his wife. No explanation, of course, was given as to why the spouse got an additional parcel of 5,200 shares. They probably did not know about it at all.</para><para>Mr Baudino tells us that he instructed his broker not to purchase Telstra shares. He must have been surprised when he received in the mail at his home address the issuer sponsored statement advising him of his Telstra shareholding. He would have been stunned and outraged when in early April he received again at home a statement advising him of his Telstra dividend. What did Mr Baudino think when he received these statements? We will not know until Mr Whitrow's report is complete and Senator Parer explains to this chamber how these extraordinary events occurred.</para><para>The contemptuous disregard of the Prime Minister's directive did not end with Mr Baudino. We now know that Mr Geoff Cousins, a consultant to the Prime Minister, also purchased Telstra shares. He sold his two parcels on 30 December 1997. The explanation from the Prime Minister's office is that Mr Cousins did not advise on telecommunications matters, had no access to price sensitive information and was only a part-time consultant anyway. However, like the <inline font-style="italic">Guide on the key elements of ministerial responsibility</inline>, it now appears that the Prime Minister's Telstra directive is headed for the scrap heap. The directive was categorical. It instructed ministers to inform all their staff not to purchase Telstra shares within 90 days. If you happened to be a part-time consultant earning $44,000 for one day's work a week, you were not suddenly exempted from it. But especially for ministers with an ongoing involvement with Telstra—the Treasurer, the Minister for Finance and Administration, the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts and the Prime Minister—there was  a  total  prohibition,  not  just  a  90-day 
 one. Nevertheless, they managed to buy these shares.</para><para>We also know that Mr Howard's senior economic adviser holds Telstra shares, bought before he took the job—we have always said that—but there are clear guidelines in the handbook and in the employment handbook about how owning shares can involve a conflict of interest. Has he ever had anything to do with this particular piece of legislation or cabinet decisions that derive from it? However, this government will not answer that fundamental question. It will just go up to the gallery, put the line out and then disappear without proper questioning. What we need to do in these matters and what our job is in opposition—in spite of what those opposite might say—is to take the Prime Minister's standards as he says them and see if they are properly applied. And let me say, the search will go on; there are many more staffers whose records in terms of Telstra purchases are yet to be revealed.</para><para>The final point I want to make here today, and returning to the point made earlier, is this legislation can pass only with the coalition voting for it—and thereby breaking the Prime Minister's word—with Senator Harradine voting for it—and basically breaching undertakings he has made in the past—and with Senator Colston's corrupted vote in this chamber. But there is one other group that really has a lot to answer for in this regard. I will give the Liberal Party this: they have some brownie points for consistency. They have considered the issue; they have evaluated it; they will take their electoral risks and they will make their decision. I accept that. But what we have seen from the National Party has been nothing short of pathetic.</para><para>We have seen the big statements in the papers by Senator Boswell and Senator Sandy Macdonald that they do not really believe that Telstra should be privatised. We did not take any notice of that. We knew they would roll over. We knew they would sell out the bush. We knew they would not have the intestinal fortitude to stand up to the Prime Minister. We knew they would get rolled right out. The National Party of Australia today is full of intellectual dwarfs. It is nothing like the 
 National Party of 25 or 30 years ago when the Jack McEwens, the Doug Anthonys, the Ian Sinclairs and the Nixons—hard men but effective men in politics, men of intellect, men of gravitas—ruled in the National Party. What have they been replaced with? Absolute flim-flam; they have been replaced by people who will not stand up for their own constituency.</para><para>That is why, when you look at the results in the Queensland state election, you will find some booths where they got 85 per cent of the vote historically but they are down to 30 per cent of the vote. The National Party just do not know which way to jump. They suffer from all forms of conflict of disloyalty on these sorts of issues. Do they represent their bush interests or should they continue their subservience to their coalition masters who just tell them what to do?</para><para>Nothing could have been clearer in this regard than the recent fracas over preferences. You have the Queensland state branch of the Nationals in which their most prominent federal member, Senator Ron Boswell, advocates taking the fight to One Nation on their ground and taking them on. What does he get from the rear echelon, the David Russells of this world? He gets, `We'll continue to send preferences to One Nation. By the way, let's get rid of our policy on guns. Let's get rid of our competition policy. Let's dump all those things off the sled so One Nation can feed on them and maybe, just maybe, our miserable hide can be saved.' It does not work like that. Basically, David Russell and the Queensland National Party are saying, `Senator Boswell, you're an irrelevancy. You don't matter. You can't have a say in policy formulation, strategy, tactics or any other matter. You are not going, in fact, to influence the policies of the National Party in Queensland.'</para><para>The National Party elsewhere in Australia continues to decline in a much weakened state. Take my own state of Victoria, where they hold two lower house seats: one with a crippled ex-minister who has been absolutely marginalised and the other in the north of the state whose member has never been heard of in his life and never will be—maybe his two-day trip to the US for a prayer breakfast is the 
 best he will ever do in terms of publicity. So they are basically finished there.</para><para>What the bush was relying on was the New South Wales National Party—traditionally the strongest, traditionally the most decent—to put their hands up and defend their constituents' interests: missing in action—all of them, not to be sighted, gave in to the Liberal Party, gave in to the Prime Minister and sold out their own constituents. Basically, this legislation is the longest suicide note in Australian political history and it is from the National Party of Australia. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>5499</page.no><name role="metadata">Crossin, Sen Trish</name><name role="display">Senator CROSSIN</name><name.id>7Y6</name.id><electorate>NT</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—A debate about the future of Telstra must encompass and give serious consideration to the needs of people in regional and remote Australia. Let me start by saying that I have heard last night and today the words `regional', `rural' and `bush' roll off the tongues of many senators here. Let us pause for a moment and really think about that. Let us think about outstations that are four hours drive from Gupuwiyak at the top of the Australian north coast. Let us think about people who live at Mutujullu or along the Borroloola Highway. If we really think about them for a moment, we might really get a sense of not just remote and bush people in this country but people who actually live in isolation.</para></talk.start><para>I am aware of the numerous articles on, and coverage of, this issue over the last week. It is important that, in standing here and representing Territorians, I ensure their concerns are known and that the impact of this bill is fully understood and appreciated. In the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> on Monday, 6 July, Wendy Craik, the Executive Director of the National Farmers Federation, was quoted as saying:</para><para>The ownership of Telstra is not the issue. . . Rather, it is the price and quality of telecommunications services for the bush that are the key issues.</para><para>Her reference to the price and quality of services to the bush is important but I believe ownership, contrary to her view, is just as crucial because, when you are talking about isolated and remote communities in the Northern Territory, the two are linked.</para><para>The needs of the bush and regional Australia cannot be ignored or disadvantaged com 
 pared with urban areas. The National Party have known this and they should be concerned. They know that the bush will suffer if Telstra is fully privatised. The latest edition of the Telstra journal, <inline font-style="italic">Our Future</inline>, has a three-page spread titled `Unique People, Unique Challenges'. This article says:</para><para>Meeting the needs of customers in the main cities is one thing. Providing customer service over Australia's vast distances and diverse landscape—from snowfields to the outback—has presented Telstra with challenges that few telecommunications companies face.</para><para>These challenges are indeed unique; they are challenges for the people working in rural and remote areas, usually in the most difficult and extreme conditions. The same article goes on to describe the work of one Telstra employee at Tennant Creek. That person is responsible for 13 technicians and line staff and an area of 500 kilometres—and let us just try to picture that again when we are talking about regional and rural places—ranging from Tennant Creek to Alice Springs. These people are called upon to change DRSC batteries at places such as Epenarra, which is 350 kilometres south-east of Tennant Creek, or to work on data services, television and radio transmitters, optical fibre jointing and underground PABX systems.</para><para>Telstra plays a crucial role in providing a quality and reliable service to the bush in the Northern Territory, especially to pastoral properties, schools, health clinics in remote communities and Aboriginal homelands. Under a fully privatised Telstra, the best guarantee that this government can give to rural and especially remote communities through the universal service obligations is that they will receive a standard telephone service. This standard telephone service is not going to deliver a broadband and on-line service to regional communities, and there is no guarantee that their services would keep up with the latest developments in telecommunications. That is, I might add, if you do have a standard on-line telephone service, and I will get to that in a moment. People in the Northern Territory understand and comprehend that if the service they obtain does not permit them to use the sorts of on-line services that people can use in the metropolitan 
 area, then they are competitively at a massive disadvantage.</para><para>Unlike the subjects of privatisation in the past, Telstra operates as a monopoly with extensive community service obligations. Telstra is the communications network for the nation. It is an essential service and a virtual public monopoly. Telstra is currently required to provide subsidised telephone connections to the bush, which would otherwise cost upwards of $10,000. For most customers, the standard new residential telephone connection fee is about $200, but in many parts of regional and rural Australia, the real cost of providing that service can be hundreds even thousands of dollars more.</para><para>Under the current system of cross-subsidies, customers pay the same amount regardless of the real cost, and that means that all Australians have equal access to telephone services. Under the cross-subsidy arrangements that operate at the moment, loss making infrastructure in rural and regional Australia is supported by profits made in other parts of Telstra. That means that in the Northern Territory the cross-subsidy can be over $1,000 a line and, in the remote parts, the cross-subsidy can be as high as $4,000 to $6,000.</para><para>At the Alice Springs show last weekend, I met a person employed by Telstra to install public payphones in remote Aborignal communities. There are many communities waiting for this commodity because very few families in these areas can afford to maintain a line into their homes. These payphones are installed at a cost of nearly $100,000 each, and the money on the installations is never really recovered. This is due to faults, vandalism and problems with general maintenance.</para><para>Once Telstra is sold, it will be gone for good. It will be impossible to get it back. It will also be impossible for any government to force a privately owned Telstra to meet these needs—to meet the needs by putting payphones into the remote communities I was talking about, to meet its current service obligations, particularly in rural and regional Australia. A privately owned Telstra's first responsibility will be to maximise profits to its shareholders. It will be under intense pressure from shareholders to shed its non- 
profitable operations, and those services in the bush are untimed local calls, directory assistance and general services to remote areas. They will all be obvious targets.</para><para>Let us have a look at the real issues for rural and regional Australia, particularly in the Northern Territory. Besides the cost of service and maintenance, there is also the standards of service, including the response times for installation and maintenance. The <inline font-style="italic">Telecommunications Performance Monitoring Bulletin: Issue 4—March 1998 Quarter</inline>, released by the Australian Communications Authority, shows that the national performance figures for faults cleared within rural areas—calculated within two full working days after being notified of a fault—declined by three percentage points to 81 per cent during the March quarter. For the urban areas in the Northern Territory, there was a decrease from 54 per cent for the December quarter to 45 per cent for the March quarter. Rural fault restoration in the Northern Territory improved though from 61 per cent to 68 per cent, because these figures included the unusually intense wet season that we had this year and the massive effort by Telstra to respond to the damage caused through floods in many parts of the Northern Territory, particularly in Katherine and the Daly River region.</para><para>That is something in this debate that people have forgotten about—the intense flooding that we have been subjected to this year in Katherine and the Daly River region and the intense electrical storms that we get during the period of November to April right across the Top End that in one fell swoop have the capacity to wipe out your telephone or electrical systems. In fact we are warned many times that, when there is such an intense storm happening and hovering overhead, we should get off the telephone.</para><para>Telstra addressed the situation in Katherine this year by mobilising aircraft and additional resources. Telstra made a number of arrangements to assist the people in Katherine during this flood period. The mobile net circuits were expanded to cater for the influx of volunteers and workers. Special billing extensions were provided as well as advice and consideration for people in the flood affected areas on a 
 case by case basis for both mobile and fixed phone users.</para><para>There was a temporary Telstra shop set up at the Telstra depot in Katherine, and the Telstra equipment was there for the use of removing and burying rubbish. So it is appropriate that the community service obligation that Telstra displayed during these times is recognised, but the impact on the Territory to date with the partial sale of Telstra has been detrimental.</para><para>In the Territory, staff numbers have been slashed with no regard for customer demand, the seasonal factors I talked about such as the wet season or the population growth. Many Telstra operations have been stripped out of the Territory and relocated in southern capitals. Decision making has been taken out of the hands of local management. Permanent full-time jobs are increasingly being converted to part-time and casual positions up there. Workers are being made redundant and are leaving the Territory with their families. This is having an enormous impact on our regional economies.</para><para>Since the partial privatisation of Telstra, the triple 0 emergency service has gone. I am personally aware, through my involvement in the Women's Advisory Council, of the enormous difficulty this has created. If I have a need for an emergency service and I live in a place such as Anula, which is a suburb of Darwin, and I dial triple 0, I get an operator in Adelaide. The time it takes for me to actually tell the person in Adelaide where exactly Anula is in a Darwin suburb is wasting precious seconds that could well be put towards saving a life.</para><para>Previously, this service was operated out of a telephone exchange at Casuarina, only some half a kilometre from the suburb of Anula, which I have mentioned. We do not now have local people taking our triple 0 calls, people who understand where these places are. Therefore, we do not have the quick turnaround time that is needed.</para><para>The cable assigning has gone from the Territory. Fault management has gone. The mobile phone centre has shut down. SOLAS, which is the Safety of Life at Sea, maritime safety centre has also shut down. The fault 
 reporting function and the assigning of installation and maintenance are under threat and are likely to survive only another year. The training of staff has all but stopped, causing erosion of the skills base. I gave an example before of how someone working out of Tennant Creek not only needs to know one area of the communications industry but needs to be multiskilled.</para><para>The Territory is rapidly becoming Telstra's poor relation, and nothing in this discussion about the full privatisation has convinced me that things will improve. The full privatisation of Telstra would see an escalation of the rationalisation process. The new owners of Telstra, non-Australian conglomerates, would demand ever increasing profits, which would result in the user pays principle becoming the norm. Such an outcome would be catastrophic for remote areas of the Territory, areas where telecommunications services are a matter of life and death and where most disadvantaged people are to be found.</para><para>The Howard government's blithe assurances that the bush would be looked after are predicated on a short-term solution—that is, its rural infrastructure fund. Once that fund is exhausted, we can look forward to some taxpayer funded solution which would demand increased contributions from those who can least afford it, rural and remote subscribers—in Territory terms, that means everyone.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Women and the telephone in Australia: a study prepared for Telecom Australia</inline> in 1989, provides an interesting insight into the views of Australian women, particularly those women in country and rural areas. The conclusion of this survey states:</para><para>Evidence from the Australian survey, hence, opens up an arena of `private sphere' social organisation and activity that has, politically, been overlooked. The nature of this activity has altered importantly in the past two to three decades. Historically, women's telephone communication has moved a long way from its major instrumental uses of 40-50 years ago to its present concentration on protracted intrinsic calling.</para><para>Both country men and women in Australia have benefited from the conquest of distance and the part played by telecommunications technology in bringing people closer and closer. Again, the survey states:</para><para>Data retrieved indicated the enormous importance of the telephone to country women. "The telephone is top priority", said one woman from a . . . rural centre, "We'd be absolutely lost without it". Many farmers' wives were alone during the day, and "would be very vulnerable to dangers without the telephone". Much ordering was done by phone, the phone was vital for keeping in touch with family and, for rural women, "the phone is a substitute for contact face-to-face".</para><para>That is another important aspect of the Territory that has been left unsaid here. There are very few extended families living in any of the parts of the Territory, particularly in the remote areas, or even in Alice Springs and Darwin. For us, the telephone is a vital link, almost weekly, to our families in the rest of this country.</para><para>Some 66 per cent of the total remote area population comprises Aboriginal people. While an increasing number of communities and some outstations now have good telephone connections, there are still significant gaps and problems across the country. The lack of a telephone in many Northern Territory outstations, the want of adequate public phones, the vandalism and inoperation of many public phone boxes and the restricted access to the council and community phones in some centres and communities leave a large number of Aboriginal women among Australia's telephone poor.</para><para>In the full privatisation of Telstra, there will be winners and losers. Who are these people? Who fits into each of these categories? The winners are the merchant bankers, the stockbrokers, the financial institutions and the Telstra executive and board members. The financial industry loves privatisations because there is plenty of money to be made. The merchant bankers and stockbrokers who worked on the sale of the first one-third of Telstra made over $200 million in management and coordination fees. But that was only part of their earnings.</para><para>After the float, stockbrokers made further huge commissions. As people bought and sold Telstra instalments receipts, brokers did particularly well because most of the shares traded have been in small quantities, which attract high commission rates. Although Telstra now has 1.6 million shareholders, the 
 top 20 investors already own 40 per cent of the shares that have been issued, and these investors are big financial institutions such as banks and insurance funds.</para><para>The biggest single shareholder is Westpac Corporation, which owns 8.4 per cent of the partly paid shares issued last November. This pattern of ownership is similar to that in most privatised companies. Small shareholders are gradually squeezed out by the big players in the market. Members of the Telstra board also did nicely out of last year's one-third float. While most shareholders, ordinary Australians, received between 600 and 2,000 shares, the 11 member board received a total of 804,114 shares between them. That represents a profit of over $1 million to these Telstra insiders.</para><para>But let us look at the losers—the small low spend customers. In a big telecommunications company such a Telstra, the top 20 per cent of customers provide 80 per cent of the profits. Privatisation increases the company's focus on those customers. Residential companies are already getting the rough end of the telecommunications deal when it comes to service quality. For instance, last year barely half of the metropolitan residential customers had faults fixed within 24 hours. The rate for business was 80 per cent.</para><para>I have spoken at length about the effect of this bill on regional and rural Australia. Expert reports have shown that Telstra already underspends in the bush. Naturally a privatised company will want to concentrate even more on the profitable areas such as the cities along the eastern seaboard. But how will the government ensure that there is investment in regional areas once its influence over Telstra is gone? Full privatisation means that the government loses the power to direct Telstra to act in the public interest. The present government is trying to reassure country residents by putting part of the Telstra sale money into a special rural infrastructure fund, but where will the money come from in the future once this Telstra piggy bank is empty?</para><para>Another loser in this scheme is the employees of Telstra. Telstra's commercial and consumer business unit, which looks after small business and residential customers, has 
 shed 10,000 staff over the last two years as part of the privatisation process, and nearly 20,000 jobs have gone since 1996. While some of those employees have been transferred to other companies, the great majority have simply lost their jobs. These huge job losses affect everyone. In the Northern Territory work is scarce, and this inevitably leads to less money being put into the Territory economy.</para><para>The sale of Telstra affects everyone. While it might add to the government's budget surplus, in the long run privatisation will leave the Australian community poorer. Although many Australians bought Telstra shares, these shareholders are still only a small minority of the whole community. Before any of Telstra was sold, all of Australia's 18 million people had `shares' in the company. Every year  Telstra paid a dividend to the Australian government and that money could and should be spent on hospitals, schools and the environment. If Telstra is sold off, that money will all go into the pockets of private investors. A lot of it will not be re-invested or spent in Australia or in the Northern Territory, because it will go overseas to foreign shareholders. The biggest loser in all of this debate is the Australian community now and in the future.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>5503</page.no><name role="metadata">Hogg, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HOGG</name><name.id>7L6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise in this debate today because the government have once again broken another promise.

What they are doing, in my view, is very contemptuous of the electorate at the very best. What is at issue in this bill is a fundamental principle of the right of people to be able to communicate, because it is of such great importance.</para></talk.start><para>With the technological advances that are being made today, one sees that the services need to be delivered in the rural and regional areas in particular. If one were to look at the recent report by the Australian Communications Authority, one would see that there are 
 headlines floating around such as `Telstra lets the bush down'. There was a whole spate of those around the time that the March quarter report for 1998 was released. It showed that Telstra, after one-third privatisation, has let the bush down.</para><para>Fundamental under the one-third privatisation was the fact that there was a guarantee to the bush that there could be a ministerial power to direct Telstra in the national interest to save those areas. Under total privatisation, as my colleague Senator Crossin has just said, there is no such guarantee whatsoever. In other words, the safety net which was of great importance to the people in rural and regional areas is being removed. This measure will see those people living with the scepticism of the coalition forces that they showed and enunciated quite clearly at the most recent state election in Queensland, and I will come to that.</para><para>We also see an attempt by the National Party to try to win back some of the massive vote that they lost in Queensland by stitching up a deal which, on the surface, they will say protects the interests of rural and regional Queensland, but all it does is provide a short-term bandaid approach to the issue—it gives people in the country no long-term confidence. Why should the people in the country be concerned? If one looks at appendix 8 of the report <inline font-style="italic">Telstra: to sell or not to sell?</inline>, one will see the effect of cross-subsidisation on rural and regional areas in Australia.</para><para>The last figures that we have been able to get were those for 1994-95 based on a federal electorate basis. At that time a total of $225.965 million was used to cross-subsidise services to rural and regional Australia. In my state of Queensland, some $50.974 million or 22.55 per cent of the total cross-subsidisation occurred. It is in large states, such as Queensland, that we see a great need for subsidisation. The interests of the major telecommunications operators in the longer term, and particularly a privatised Telstra, will be to their shareholders.</para><para>No matter what undertakings are given here now, those undertakings will in due course mean nought if the shareholders erupt in major disbelief that the company is not 
 delivering them a profit. They will pressure Telstra or other telecom operators to somehow weasel out of their community service obligations. In the longer term, the ultimate effect will be on the service that can be delivered to rural and regional areas.</para><para>If one looks at some of the seats in Queensland, one can understand why the National Party in Queensland have been so interested in the 13 June election in Queensland and its result. Let us look at the cross-subsidisation figures that I have for 1994-95. Out of the $50 million for Queensland, $4.1 million went to Capricornia, $2.76 million went to the federal seat of Dawson and $10.7 million—nearly $11 million—went to the seat of Kennedy. No wonder Mr Katter was upset! Nearly $5 million went to Leichhardt and $16.485 million went to the seat of Maranoa—the so-called heartland of the National Party in Queensland. The fact is that, after the 13 June election, the Liberal Party in Queensland was reduced to less than a cricket team—nine seats—and the National Party was decimated and reduced to 23 seats, whilst One Nation has proven to be the big winner.</para><para>One can understand why there is a great deal of concern in the National Party, even though it is too little too late. They have deserted the country, deserted the rural and regional people, over a long period of time. In that state election the people of Queensland reacted. They will not be fooled in any way by the attempted pork-barrelling that we are now seeing under this privatisation deal which will come about with the further two-thirds sale of Telstra.</para><para>If you look at the effect on the National Party you will start to understand why we are seeing what we are seeing in this chamber today: this bill that seeks to take the two-thirds privatisation and the pork-barrelling that goes with it. Just look at the safe seat of Barambah in Queensland, which in 1995 had a first preference vote for the National Party of 67.21 per cent. The best they could get on the last occasion was 30.96 per cent. Let us look, booth by booth, at some of their so-called safe polling booths—my colleague Senator Ray mentioned this before. You can see how their vote has been decimated and 
 you can see why we have got this grubby deal on now. In Gomerri, for example, the National Party vote in 1995 was 76.18. It has gone down to 34.81—a massive cut. Who was the major winner? One Nation. The Tablelands seat of Barambah was 91.46 per cent but has gone down to 29.33. Tansey has gone from 90.06 down to 36.62. Wondai has gone from 66.38 down to 27.48. The vote has been decimated, so their style is to try to redress the situation, but it is too little too late.</para><para>Look at the seat of Crows Nest, which has always been a very safe seat for the National Party in Queensland. In the Esk booth, for example, the vote went from 65.1 down to 29.28. In Highfields, it went from 67.77 down to 44.77. In Oakey, a regional centre in Queensland, it went from 71.83 down to 35.24. These are the sorts of results that are peppered throughout the electorates of Queensland. This is the sort of result that they did not want, but this is the sort of result that they got because of their neglect of Queensland as a state government. They are doing much the same here. Having seen the result, they are now trying to redress it, but it is too little too late.</para><para>If the litany of problems for the National Party in Queensland was further elucidated, one would see that there have been massive swings because people do not believe in them. It is as simple as that—people do not believe what the National Party are telling them about the further two-thirds privatisation of Telstra. They have major problems indeed. If one looks briefly at the <inline font-style="italic">Courier-Mail</inline> of 7 July, this is clearly spelt out. The Queensland Farmers Federation President, Lex Buchanan is quoted as warning the Prime Minister, John Howard of the perils of ignoring bush fears over the sale of Telstra. Mr Buchanan said that the full sale of Telstra policy was a recipe for handing votes to One Nation at the election.</para><para>That is Mr Buchanan's opinion. I do not know the gentleman personally, but obviously it is a warning that the National Party have not taken. They obviously have not gone through the results booth by booth and seen the decimation. If they think that they can, in effect, buy back people's votes, they have got 
 something else coming to them—there is no doubt about that.</para><para>On the same day an article appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> by Paul Pickering. I think his article is very relevant to the debate that we are having today on the privatisation of Telstra. His article is about the One Nation Party and its leader. He said:</para><para>Surely it did not need Pauline Hanson to remind National Party backbenchers that it is the state that has provided and maintained infrastructure in the bush. They simply needed to look to their own past to understand that the only way to guarantee a continuing cross-subsidy for rural telephone services is through public ownership.</para><para>They should heed those words very loudly and very clearly because the path they are heading down today is not only disaster for them but also further disaster for the bush and for Australians.</para><para>At the end of the day the consumers out in the bush will not be fooled by the pork-barrelling that is being envisaged under this current privatisation deal between the National Party and the Liberal Party. Those who deserted the National Party are definitely astute enough to know that a temporary pork barrel does not have an infinite limit, as my colleague Senator Crossin pointed out. When it runs out, what will the country, the rural and the regional people have? Nothing; absolutely nothing at all. They will have no powers for the minister to intervene. They will have no safety net.</para><para>In the longer term, a fully privatised Telstra will be concerned only about where the telecommunications operators see that they can make real profits. That area, of course, is in the golden triangle—the Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra area—and you can exclude other parts of Australia. Those operators will seek to water down and to weasel out of any commitments that they have had to give to date. They will use classic catchcrys such as, `When we gave that undertaking things were different.' How often do you hear that? How often does one hear that? `This is an unexpected contingency'—they will find any excuse, no doubt, to get out of their commitments, their community service guarantees. They will weasel out of them. So the losers will be the rural and regional people in 
 the longer term. The diamonds might look sparkling from afar now but, once people get to test them, they will see that they are mere glass.</para><para>In a world that is becoming more information technology dependent on a daily basis, the rural and regional areas of Australia and in particular my state need some guarantee, not the mealy-mouthed propositions that are coming out of the government at this stage. The government's pork-barrelling in this instance will be only a bandaid approach. It is interesting to look at the <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline> of 9 July. If the other warnings have not been enough for the National Party and the Liberal Party, then they should note the few words of Kevin McMenemy from the Western Australian Farmers Federation. The report says:</para><para>Rural WA overwhelmingly opposes Government plans to sell the remaining two-thirds of Telstra and use some of the profits to fund bush infrastructure, says the WA Farmers Federation.</para><para>WAFF general president Kevin McMenemy said yesterday that Liberal MPs with country seats would pay at the ballot box if they supported the sale. This could drive farmers into the arms of Pauline Hanson.</para><para>Therein lies a lesson in Queensland as well for the Liberal Party. The Liberal Party should well and truly be aware that, where One Nation candidates stood against them, they found themselves in great difficulty—indeed, so much so that, as I have said earlier, they cannot even make up a cricket team in the Queensland parliament. So the warnings are there for the government. Yet, in spite of those warnings, they are not heeding them.</para><para>I will look at a couple of other issues which concern me. There will be large job losses out of the privatisation of Telstra. We have already seen in the order of 25,000 jobs go, with another 2,000 more to go. There are spurious claims that these jobs are transferred to the private sector, and that cannot be substantiated in any way. This government should be about job creation, not about job destruction. There are two more issues that I wish to address.</para><para>There is no need for this sale. It will generate an estimated $800 million in service fees to stockbrokers. This has already been addressed by some of my colleagues, but it is 
 completely obscene and immoral that we are passing $800 million to stockbrokers and the like when this money could be otherwise used to great purpose and great intent out there in the community at large on a wide range of issues. There is no doubt in my mind that this is one of the real obscene parts of this proposed privatisation.</para><para>Last but not least, I want to quote <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of 9 December 1996. In response to a question from Senator Mackay about the then one-third sale, Senator Alston said:</para><para>Can I just get to this other major issue—that somehow selling one-third means you inevitably sell the lot? Just for your information, NTT, Nippon Telephone and Telegraph, sold 35 per cent in 1984. They have not gone further since that time. There is no inevitability about anything in this life or in this field.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>TW4</name.id><name role="metadata">BOURNE</name><name role="display">Senator Bourne</name></talker><para>—Obviously not!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>7L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Hogg, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HOGG</name></talker><para>—No, but it gets better as we go on. The impression he was trying to create there was: whilst we are selling one-third, there is undoubtedly no inevitability that we will go beyond one-third. The response continues:</para></talk.start></continue><para>The fact is that unless you somehow think this parliament is about to change beyond recognition, and I do not think it is, it would mean that the Democrats or the Labor Party would have to change their position in order to repeal a provision of this very bill that is before us because this bill does not allow the parliament to go beyond the sale of one-third of Telstra. That is a fact. You know our commitment.</para><para>Senator Alston went on to say:</para><para>If you are about to propose that, I would be very surprised. I have not seen any sign of it. You can run that argument as much as you like, but the fact is that there is no inevitability about it at all. It would require a conscious vote in favour by a majority of both houses of parliament. I do not see that in the Senate in the foreseeable future, and I do not think you do either.</para><para>Then there was an interjection—and I think Senator Bourne will enjoy this—by Senator Kernot:</para><para>What's the foreseeable future?</para><para>Senator Alston replied:</para><para>The foreseeable future for me would probably be six years—probably longer than you and I will be here . . .  
</para><para>You have to give credit where credit is due. He got one out of two right. The rest he got wrong, and he was the minister. So what hope do Australians have in putting faith in these people?</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>5506</page.no><name role="metadata">Bourne, Sen Vicki</name><name role="display">Senator BOURNE</name><name.id>TW4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is worth remembering that we are here today—and we will be here for quite a bit longer, I suspect—to debate a bill, which I am sure the government hopes to pass, which will put into effect something which was not mentioned at the last election and which will not be proclaimed until after the next election. Obviously there is no urgency in this whatsoever. Putting that aside, there are two fundamental problems with the government's current approach.</para></talk.start><para><inline font-style="italic">Senator Kemp interjecting</inline>—</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Senator Hill interjecting</inline>—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Murphy)</name></talker><para>—Order!

The first problem is that passing this legislation has nothing to do with a mandate. The government obviously never had a mandate to sell any of Telstra. We all know that our constituents vote for a myriad of reasons. People simply do not vote on one issue. How will the government know, for example, whether they have been voted in or out of office at the next election on the basis of their decision to sell Telstra, funding cuts to the ABC, funding cuts to education, funding cuts to health, the way they have handled nursing home funding, native title or a host of other reasons? Of course they will not.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Secondly, the government says they have stuck to their promise not to sell all of Telstra because they intend not to proclaim this legislation until after the next election. Why are we debating it now and why is there an open-ended commencement clause in the bill? This kind of open-ended commencement hands a blanket cheque to the executive to 
 determine whether legislation passed by the parliament will ever come into effect.</para><para>Accordingly, the government should now abandon this bill and campaign on the sale of Telstra—the sale of Telstra alone—not on taxes or anything else. If they are re-elected, they can debate this bill in the session of parliament after the next election. This is a fairer and a more honest approach to the community and to parliamentary procedure. If they make their arguments well enough, they will get more than 50 per cent of the Senate and they can do absolutely anything they like.</para><para>The other problem behind the government's decision to sell Telstra relates to the basic assumption with the privatisation agenda of successive Australian governments. Over the past decade and a half the privatisation agendas of both the ALP and the coalition have typically been undertaken with very little consideration given to the alternatives or any medium- to long-term consequences.</para><para>The key question we have to ask in this debate is: who is going to gain from the sale of Telstra? Governments had neither the integrity nor the ingenuity to push for alternative ways of expanding their revenue base. They have not had the imagination to devise better ways of improving our national savings. And for largely ideological reasons they have not wanted to formally acknowledge the significant contribution that public investment makes to this country. Instead, it is far easier to sell off public assets and attempt to convince the Australian people that it is in their best interests to do so. The Democrats do not believe that selling Telstra is in this country's best interests. It is not very convincing to be told that just because other countries are privatising their national communication carriers Australia should do likewise.</para><para>The government also seeks to convince us, without adequate evidence, that we will be better off with a privatised Telstra. If `we' are the taxpayers and the general public, I do not think we will be better off. If `we' are the big end of town—the stockbrokers and the lawyers who will sell Telstra, or the overseas investors who will buy it—certainly, we will be better off. But that is not an argument. 
 That is just a pressure tactic and one which lacks any intellectual credibility. It is nothing more than appeal to fashion and one which seeks to deny Australians the right to make up their own minds whether partial or full privatisation of our national communications carrier is in our best interests.</para><para>There is no intrinsic merit in blindly following what the UK or New Zealand have done, let alone—as Senator Alston was so fond of reminding me—what Cuba or Albania have done. Every country has its own unique geographical, historical, political, social and cultural circumstances. It is simply ridiculous to compare Australia with countries like Cuba and Albania in terms of privatisation issues.</para><para>What we have with Telstra is a privatisation agenda which, like privatisation in general, is being largely driven by two key concerns. The first is that privatisation provides an immediate source of large amounts of revenue for the government. The government claims it will use the revenue it expects to generate from the sale to reduce net debt, thereby saving money on interest repayments. The government also says it will use a proportion of the sale to fund new social bonus packages.	But, apart from rumours about spending on a major regional development package on roads and rural health initiatives, the government has not announced where, or on what, it actually intends to spend this money. The questions of whether the proposed expenditure and the regulation of the industry are desirable are independent of the sale of Telstra.</para><para>Secondly, the sale is being driven by the belief that private enterprise is inherently more efficient and more accountable than the public sector. But, generally speaking, the history of privatisation in Australia and overseas has not got a good track record. Companies tend to be sold too cheaply and they do not deliver the goods after they are privatised to the extent that they have promised beforehand.</para><para>Let us look very closely at these two concerns. I do not believe they provide sufficient justification for turning our most profitable public enterprise into Australia's second biggest private corporation. First of all, let us look at the financial implications. 
 Not surprisingly, it has been proven to be very difficult to get a clear indication of the full financial implications of this sale. Of course, this may not be unrelated to the large number of players with a vested interest in not telling the Australian public just who the big winners and losers might be.</para><para>This is one of the reasons why parliamentary scrutiny of the proposed sale was so necessary. What a pity the government insisted on such a short committee inquiry. The bill was referred to the Senate Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts References Committee on 1 April 1998—somewhat symbolic—and reported on 26 May 1998, after the Senate agreed to a two-week extension. So four weeks went out to six weeks and that was all the time the government permitted the Senate to investigate and report on these issues.</para><para>It is not unreasonable for the federal parliament, on behalf of the Australian public, to take a close look into the sale of the government's most profitable business enterprise. However, the short time frame for the inquiry—something this government appears to be very keen on lately, although they were not when they were in opposition—has not allowed the federal parliament to do that adequately. But, even during that short time, the expert evidence presented to the inquiry indicated that the sale of Telstra would significantly reduce the net worth of the public sector as a result of the interest saving in public debt being less than the future profit stream forgone.</para><para>John Quiggin, Professor of Economics at James Cook University, and Dr Allan Brown from the Economics Department of Griffith University have argued strongly that this is most likely to be the case. They believe the privatisation of Telstra will result in a substantial loss to the net worth of the public sector and will represent a bad deal for taxpayers. In his submission to the first Senate Telstra inquiry in 1996, Professor Quiggin estimated that the value of Telstra in public ownership was $54.4 billion. This estimate was based on Telstra's after tax profits compared with the net sale proceeds required to generate similar savings in public 
 debt interest. Fifty-four billion dollars is more than twice the market price that analysts believe Telstra will realise if sold. One of the reasons for this, he argues, is that private equity holders demand a far greater rate of return on their investment than the real rate of return on government debt.</para><para>According to Professor Quiggin, only under the most unrealistically pessimistic profit scenarios would the government's partial privatisation scenario appear attractive. In his opinion, the partial privatisation of Telstra has so far resulted in forgone earnings of $520 million, as against interest savings of $450 million. That gives us a net loss of $70 million—and that is just so far. The loss to the public sector is expected to increase over time because earnings are expected to grow while interest savings remain constant.</para><para>But let us consider for a moment the situation where the interest saving in public debt from selling Telstra is equal to the future profit stream forgone. What then? For a start, the government would not be any better off; it would simply have realised the value in cash terms of an asset valued at that amount. The net worth of the public sector would remain totally unchanged.</para><para>If the government uses the proceeds from Telstra's sale to retire public sector debt, the debt would fall and so would assets. Again, public sector net worth would remain unchanged. The government would simply have reduced the stream of future interest payments on the debt by the same amount as the income flow from the enterprise which would have been used to pay the interest on the debt. Where is the value to the nation in that? It can surely be argued just as legitimately that it is better to retain Telstra in full public ownership and use the cash flow generated to repay public debt and fund existing programs or new ventures from consolidated revenue than from promises of one-off grants.</para><para>When assessing the impact of privatisation on the net worth of the public sector, we also have to look at the transaction costs involved. We have to look at the fees paid to the lawyers, to the accountants, to the bankers, to the stockbrokers, and to the marketing and the advertising agents. These costs are often 
 conveniently overlooked in public discussion about this privatisation. The partial privatisation of Telstra cost $260 million—what sort of social bonus programs could that have funded?</para><para>Moreover, underpricing of public assets is one of the hallmarks of privatisation in this country—it happened with the Commonwealth Bank, it happened with Qantas, it happened with the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories and it happened with the first third sale of Telstra. That means that a relatively small number of people—the new shareholders and those administering the transaction—make a gain at the expense of all the taxpayers of Australia. There are simply no guarantees that this will not happen again with the sale of the remaining two-thirds of Telstra.</para><para>This all adds up to the sale of Telstra involving selling off our highest income earning public asset for no net economic gain. In fact, on John Quiggin's figures, Australian taxpayers could be paying for the sale for many years to come. That is just not good public policy.</para><para>Let us have a look at the government's claim that the privatisation of Telstra will result in overall efficiency gains. If taxpayers are to be sufficiently compensated for the potential loss in public sector net worth, then spectacularly large efficiency gains or improvements in customer service need to occur as a direct consequence of a change in ownership. I see no reason to anticipate efficiency gains beyond those that would have occurred without a change in ownership.</para><para>The most recent figures from the Australian Communications Authority indicate that Telstra's efficiency has fallen in the last two quarters since partial privatisation. Even Mr Frank Blount, before he became an advocate for the government's privatisation agenda, said that it was the marketplace, not who owns the company, that is the real reformer.</para><para>A significant amount of research has been undertaken which indicates that efficiency and consumer responsiveness are not inherently dependent on ownership but, rather, on a combination of good management, effective competition, technological progress, regulation 
 and consumer pressure. There is no direct or inevitable association between economic performance and the type of ownership. The fact is that the performance and efficiency of government owned enterprises can and have been extensively improved under public ownership—look at Australia Post.</para><para>A 1995 study by the Industry Commission found that Telstra had reduced its prices since 1989-90 by 16 per cent in real terms while doubling labour productivity and increasing payments to government by over 60 per cent since 1990-91. Remember, that was in 1995. It is simply propaganda to claim that privatisation offers some magic recipe by which Telstra will automatically make significant efficiency gains. Efficiency is not about privatisation; it is about management; it is about a commitment to service provision. Australians should be seriously questioning the government's commitment and the capacity of Telstra's management to deliver the sort of service that we want, irrespective of whether or not Telstra is sold.</para><para>Moreover, even if efficiency gains are made under private ownership, there is no reason to assume that they will be passed on to consumers in the form of lower prices, rather than being captured as profits by shareholders. In fact, if the partial privatisation is anything to go by, all that we are likely to see after full privatisation is a sharp rise in the salaries of Telstra's senior executives, efficiency measured in terms of the number of job losses, and no great increase in customer service outcomes.</para><para>The ideological basis which claims that private enterprise is inherently more efficient than public enterprise fails to take into account the fact that government enterprises have more objectives than just maximising profits. Government enterprises are charged with social objectives, or community service obligations, which are equally as important as profit making but which successive governments have portrayed as sources of economic inefficiency. Their importance for promoting the national interest should never be underestimated.</para><para>I acknowledge that the provision of the universal service obligation is not directly 
 related to the issue of privatisation. The universal service obligation can be continued under legislative direction, irrespective of Telstra's ownership. I am concerned, though, that privatisation will inevitably place the provision of the USO under increasing pressure, along with other regulations, such as price capping, which are presently imposed on Telstra.</para><para>There is also much debate about the optimal means for delivering the universal service obligation. This issue is not directly related to privatisation, but this should not mean that we avoid discussion on a very critical issue at this time. The importance of the USO is reflected by the number of submissions to the Senate Telstra inquiry which have commented on this issue from a range of perspectives.</para><para>The Democrats will continue to advocate that the USO be funded from carriers themselves rather than from consolidated revenue. As soon as the payment for the USO is transferred from those who are responsible for delivering it, to the budget, it is far more vulnerable to elimination or reduction in effectiveness. As soon as governments start looking for an area in which to save a few extra dollars, you can be sure that the USO will come up for review. But, if the ownership of carriers is an important issue for delivering efficient service, carriers should also be responsible for funding the delivery of the USO, as that is, in effect, their contribution to the good governance of this industry.</para><para>The community has a legitimate expectation that the government will pursue social objectives in the provision of telecommunication services. This inherent tension will only be exacerbated by privatisation. A privatised Telstra will be governed by a board of directors acting not in the national interest, not in the interests of remote communities whose services are largely subsidised, but in the interests of the company and its shareholders—a company which will be one of Australia's largest, wielding tremendous economic and political clout.</para><para>A privatised Telstra means a high risk of losing our ability to set, maintain and deliver community service obligations in the national interest. If the government were serious about 
 the USO, it would have ensured that the bill's preamble, at the very least, reflected all three tiers of the universal service obligation; at the moment it only has two.</para><para>We also recommended that regular reviews of the USO be enshrined in legislation. That would enable it to be amended if it were seen to be ineffective and not dynamic enough. Even the government acknowledges that it cannot simply give a privatised Telstra free rein to do whatever it likes. The very existence of a customer service guarantee acknowledges that a liberalised, privatised telecommunications market will not, of itself, deliver adequate levels of service to all Australians.</para><para>The customer service guarantee sets mandatory service levels in a number of areas. We note the minister's recent media release concerning increased penalties for failures to meet the customer service guarantee standards in non-metropolitan areas. Of course, customer service is important; no-one would deny that. But the only way to ensure that the service provider complies with the standard is through tougher regulation and enforcement—not merely increasing the scale of charges. The scale of charges should reflect the lack of service provided, not just a geographical area.</para><para>The crunch will, of course, come when the government is called upon to impose customer service guarantees on Telstra. It claims that a lack of service can result in a carrier being fined $10 million—a drop in the huge telecommunications ocean in any case.</para><para>The only other argument the government has put forward to justify the sale of Telstra is the one that is the most intellectually bankrupt and economically irresponsible of all: the attempt to link the sale with funding of so-called social bonus programs. Consider the precedent that this sets: government funding for programs which all parties and a vast majority of the electorate deem desirable being made conditional on Telstra's sale—a highly contentious policy still opposed by the majority of the electorate; that majority do not want Telstra sold.</para><para>Social programs deserve to be funded in their own right from the federal budget. Imagine the outcry if the government stated that ongoing funding for schools, hospitals, 
 nursing homes or employment programs were all dependent on the sale of Telstra. The simple fact is that the sale of assets has no bearing on the government's capacity to afford current expenditure programs. The Treasurer (Mr Costello) knows this, and I can remember many occasions when the coalition pointed this out to previous Labor governments, chastising them for attempting to use asset sales to conceal budget deficits. The importance of this point should not be lost, and Australians should not be misled into believing that the government will not be able to afford to meet its obligations if it does not sell Telstra.</para><para>The government's inclusion of the proceeds from the sale of Telstra in the latest budget figures is arrogant and misleading. The Democrats are joined by the majority of Australians who oppose the sale of Telstra. Clever accounting will not detract from the fact that debt reduction through the sale of public assets is not in the national interest. The Democrats believe that the opponents of Telstra's sale have at least as compelling a case as those in favour of it. That is because the sale of such a vital public asset comes down to principles and values, not just to the government's economic imperatives. There are sound social, economic and political arguments for not selling Telstra—and I will be voting against its sale.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>5511</page.no><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGAURAN</name><name.id>WH4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise to speak—</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>AW5</name.id><name role="metadata">CARR</name><name role="display">Senator Carr</name></talker><para>—He speaks!

The <inline ref="r482">Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 1998</inline>  provides legislation for the final two-thirds sale of Telstra, following the success of the initial one-third sale in October 1997.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The first Telstra share offer opened on 15 October 1997 and, by the close of applications, over 1.8 million Australians had applied for shares. This resulted in the float being five times oversubscribed. Over 92 per cent of Telstra's employees took up the offer at the time. The one-third float of Telstra was the largest in the history of the Australian Stock Exchange, raising—well over budget estimates—$14.2 billion. At the close of the first day's trade—and since, may I add—the average investor who purchased over 900 shares was about $650 better off.</para><para>I make that point to indicate the demand for and the popularity of—at least the popularity of it with the 1.8 million Australians who took up the share offer—the one-third sale of Telstra. Just as the mandate was sought by this government for the one-third sale of Telstra prior to the last election, the government is seeking a mandate now for the two-thirds sale of Telstra prior to the next election. If we are given that mandate at the next 
 election, we will have the political authority and the legislative ability to trigger the final two-thirds sale of Telstra.</para><para>It is fair to say that there are four main concerns raised with regard to the sale of Telstra, and privatisation as an issue as a whole: firstly, `Why sell the family silver?' is the most commonly asked question; secondly, the rural and regional areas will lose out; thirdly, and it is the most popular concern, the foreign corporations will buy up this key Australian asset; and, fourthly, there is the concern that the sale of Telstra will lead to job losses.</para><para>Each concern can be answered. Firstly, with regard to the sale of the family silver: it is true that a full sale of Telstra does follow this government's strategy of selling major government utilities, like the Federal Airports Corporation, raising well over $4 billion; the Australian National rail network; and the Australian shipping service, ANL. It is also true to say that Telstra is the largest privatisation undertaken in Australia and ranks highly on the world scale.</para><para>Privatisation is not unique to Australia. There has been a movement over the last decade for governments worldwide to sell government owned assets, and there are two primary reasons put forward to explain this economic strategy. The first is that governments should not be in the business of running a business, that private enterprise does it better. Inevitably, the government assets are a monopoly having the dual evils of monopoly pricing, which is always far too high, and monopoly customer service, which is always far too poor.</para><para>Therefore, the sale of a government monopoly, along with allowing new entrants into the market, opens up the sector to competition and market forces, which in the long run brings improved customer service and improved pricing. Telstra is the perfect example of this. As a monopoly, it overcharged and underserviced. Ask anyone who tried to ring through to Telstra when it was a monopoly.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Senator Carr interjecting</inline>—</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGAURAN</name></talker><para>—What a difference competition has made to Telstra. Today, 
 competition, primarily from Optus, has given a choice to the consumer which has led to the fall in phone call prices and in particular a fall in the cost of an international call.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The second reason advanced for the argument of privatisation is to reduce government debt. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s governments across the world have racked up high levels of debt, burdening their budgets with interest payment commitments. It is worth noting that the legacy this government was left in regard to debt was $100 billion. Incredibly, that figure jumped in the last four years of the previous government. From a manageable $32 billion in 1992, by 1996—coincidentally, the Keating years—the debt had jumped to $100 billion. Governments have a choice in meeting their debt commitments. Either they increase taxes or they sell their assets. Given that many countries have reached the zenith of their tax raising abilities, the sale of a government asset is the best choice. In the case of Telstra, it is estimated that some $40 billion will be raised, which will go towards reducing the government's debt legacy.</para><para>The benefits of the debt legacy are obvious. Firstly, a government with a low debt ratio to GDP or with a debt reduction strategy of some sort in place gains the confidence of the market towards its currency and, moreover, it secures a high credit rating. Let me give the Victorian example, Senator Carr.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>AW5</name.id><name role="metadata">CARR</name><name role="display">Senator Carr</name></talker><para>—How many jobs have been lost in Victoria?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGAURAN</name></talker><para>—By improving their credit rating back to a AAA rating, their borrowings are taken out at a lower interest rate, saving the Treasury billions of dollars.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>AW5</name.id><name role="metadata">CARR</name><name role="display">Senator Carr</name></talker><para>—Jeff Kennett was right!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGAURAN</name></talker><para>—Secondly, it will free up government expenditure for other initiatives. While it is true that the government receives a dividend from Telstra each year, which also can be used towards budgetary purposes, it does not match the $1.5 billion saving on interest payments through the debt reduction program.</para></talk.start></continue><para>An example of how some capital and interest savings can be directed as a social 
 bonus can be seen in the funds resulting from the one-third sale of Telstra where they were directed. The highly successful $1.25 billion Natural Heritage Trust was a result of the one-third sale of Telstra. The Natural Heritage Trust is the largest environmental rescue effort ever undertaken by an Australian government. Furthermore, the Natural Heritage Trust allocated $163 million for one of Australia's most important agricultural regions, the Murray-Darling Basin.</para><para>The second major question people ask in regard to the sale of Telstra is whether the selling of a government owned asset would be detrimental to the rural and regional areas of Australia, because privately owned companies will not undertake to uphold certain social responsibilities. The answer to this is as follows: the government is not only genuinely committed to the rural and regional areas of Australia but we have enshrined that commitment in legislation. The government has legislated in two areas: the universal service obligation, the community service obligation—</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Senator Carr interjecting</inline>—</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGAURAN</name></talker><para>—In fact, this government has strengthened these obligations prior to full privatisation.</para></talk.start></continue><para><inline font-style="italic">Opposition senators interjecting</inline>—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Murphy)</name></talker><para>—Order!

Where Telstra incurs a loss in complying with the USO, it is entitled to recoup that loss. The amount is recouped by imposing a levy on all the other carriers, like Optus, in proportion to their share of the market.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The cost to install a new residential telephone connection is capped. This was done prior to privatisation. By law, the average residential connection cost must decrease in 
 every year by one per cent in real terms. This means that the amount paid by regional customers to connect to Telstra's network is capped even when the real cost of connection is many times higher. Further to this, the coalition government has introduced a special scheme to ensure that local call prices in regional areas do not exceed the average local call price in major capital cities. This protection stays regardless of who owns Telstra.</para><para>Perhaps the strongest response to concerns from the rural and regional areas that they may miss out as a result of privatisation is the enshrining and the strengthening of the community service guarantee. This CSG was introduced by the coalition government and took effect in January this year. Under the Telecommunications Act 1997, the guarantee means that telephone companies are legally required to meet service standards on things such as the time taken to connect a new phone service, the time taken to repair a faulty service and turning up for an appointment on time. If the service falls below the CSG performance standard, customers are eligible to compensation from the telecommunications company. An example of this is the $40 penalty that will be applied each day after five working days of delay in rectifying faults within a standard telephone service. What is more, that fine goes to the aggrieved customer.</para><para>Furthermore, in support of the rural and regional areas, the coalition government last year introduced the $250 million innovation scheme named the regional telecommunications infrastructure fund. This fund ensures that rural and regional phone users have access to the latest technologies and infrastructure agreements. To date, 96 rural and regional projects worth over $57 million have been approved. Of late, the government has also announced a dramatic upgrading in relation to the regional mobile phone services and also in regard to untimed pastoral calls. Those two announcements have been made in the last two days.</para><para>In relation to the third concern, that foreign companies will buy up this key asset, in short, this simply cannot happen. The rules of foreign ownership have been enshrined in 
 legislation. Telstra will remain majority Australian owned with no more than 35 per cent foreign ownership, and no single foreign owner is allowed to have more than five per cent of Telstra. The chairman and the majority of the board will be Australian.</para><para>The fourth concern relates to the impact privatisation will have on employment. However, the moving to full private ownership will not in itself impact on Telstra's employment levels. Telstra is two years into a downsizing program which has reduced total staff numbers from almost 77,000 in 1995 to 59,000 in early 1998. The announced target of around 51,000 will be reached by the year 2000.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>4J4</name.id><name role="metadata">SCHACHT</name><name role="display">Senator Schacht</name></talker><para>—Mr Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order.

The downsizing is driven not by the ownership—whether it is privatised—but by the combined effects of new technology, improved productivity and competitive pressures, as shown by the fact that it began while Telstra was still 100 per cent owned by the government. It was necessary to meet the new 
 entrants to the market, like Optus, on a competitive footing. But it is worthy of note that the employees have been picked up, probably by Optus. It is an industry that is growing by greater than 14 per cent. That is the employment figure. Most have been picked up; some have even got better jobs.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In conclusion, given the enormity of the full sale of Telstra and the importance of the industry it represents—an industry affecting every person in Australian society—it is little wonder that there is so much debate and interest in this issue. I have outlined the four main concerns, to which the government has responded in full, and I am confident that the answers given will ensure a mandate from the Australian people in the forthcoming election.

As is known from the register of interests, I have Telstra shares.</para></talk.start><para>This bill proposes the full privatisation of the rest of Telstra. I am utterly opposed to this, and I am appalled that the details of the deal—the buy-off of the National Party—are not even known to this parliament. Why is there such unseemly haste? Why is there such a claimed urgency to push this bill through this place? We know why. It is because there is an election coming very soon indeed, so it is necessary to settle this package to buy off the necessary votes. A lot of people have been complaining about the way this government has not been listening to people, particularly in rural and regional Australia. We know about that because of an inquiry on regional unemployment that we are doing at the moment, and I will come back to that shortly.</para><para>I do not believe that the majority of Australians will be fooled by this very cynical little exercise. Why would a package whose details are not known convince people that they should trust this government when it is clearly understood to be nothing more than a very cynical exercise to buy off the National Party votes? Those votes were very much threatened because the National Party knows two things: it knows that it is very seriously 
 under threat in the forthcoming election because of the recent ballot in Queensland, and it knows more than many people just how important Telstra is to people in rural and regional Australia.</para><para>It also knows that, despite its mistakes or insufficiencies, a public Telstra is better by far than a privatised one. In any polling, well over 60 per cent of Australians are totally opposed to the privatisation of the rest of Telstra. They are concerned about that because they know what will happen when Telstra is privatised. The services will fall off and the prices will rise. It is a very simple equation.</para><para>The other interesting thing about the benefits that have been wrung out of the Prime Minister through this package of between $400 million and $800 million—paid for by the rest of the taxpayers of this country—is that the services that are provided now could be provided with a public Telstra if there were a directive from the government. There is absolutely no need to privatise Telstra to achieve what the government is proposing to achieve.</para><para>This legislation and these decisions are not about policy, they are about politics. They are about the politics of cynicism and fear and it is something that will not be lost on the people of this country. They have made it very clear to us, particularly through the poll in Queensland, that they will not be taken for fools and they will not be taken to not understand the insufficiency of this government. They know about broken promises, they know about core promises and non-core promises, and they know that once Telstra is sold, it is sold forever. It is gone.</para><para>I want to read a couple of quotes that I think are very important, from a transcript of today's interview with Lex Buchanan from the Queensland Farmers Federation, who was being interviewed on ABC Radio's <inline font-style="italic">AM</inline> program. The journalist asked:</para><para>Do you think the Federal Government should hold off on its plans to sell off the rest of Telstra and implement new mobile phone technology and these other things that they've promised first?</para><para>Mr Buchanan replied:</para><para>That would probably be our preferred position. We have not been impressed, particularly by Senator Alston making the comment publicly that when certain politicians were coming to him to put the case that they were wasting their time. We would point out in return that these are the very things that have led to the change in the political structure here in Queensland.</para><para>This is not a paid-up member of the Labor Party making this point. This is a member of the Queensland Farmers Federation saying that they have been very disappointed and very unimpressed by Senator Alston's publicly dismissing their attempt to persuade him about their point of view in terms of Telstra and the requirements of people in rural and regional Queensland. In another interview from the same ABC Radio <inline font-style="italic">AM</inline>  program of today, the interviewer, Ms Kirk, is talking to De-Anne Kelly, a National Party member:</para><para>Ms Kirk: Dee-Anne Kelly, the Government is promising untimed local calls for an extra 3,000 to 40,000 people—</para><para>I would have to say a pretty imprecise figure—</para><para>in isolated areas and much, much more, because Telstra is to be sold. How could you knock that back?</para><para>Ms Kelly:	 I certainly wouldn't knock that back at all. It's a very welcome initiative. It's a pity that it had to be delivered under pressure from the bush over the sale of Telstra. I mean, that's one of the services that should be given as part of a fair go for all Australians. But very welcome. However, I would just point out that you don't need to sell Telstra, 100 per cent of Telstra to do that. Yesterday we had an announcement on CDMA upgrades for mobile phones in rural and regional areas, $250 million that Telstra could do for people in the bush and it is still in 66 per cent Government control. So, it can be done. You don't need to sell Telstra.</para><para>That is a member of the National Party in this parliament. The interviewer went on:</para><para>Ms Kirk:	 But your own National Party President pointed out the other day it's better to have privately owned Telstra with real benefits for rural customers that they'd not dreamed about 30 years ago . . .</para><para>I think there must be an error in this type, so I will end the quote there. Mrs Kelly went on:</para><para>Ms Kelly:	 Well, I respect my President but I'd have to say that the view amongst my constituency very much is that once Telstra is privatised and there's a one-off upgrade, such as untimed local calls, what happens next when there's another 
 technological leap forward, bearing in mind that we don't even have in many areas, access to the Internet as yet. But next time there's a big technological leap forward who pays for the upgrade for rural and regional Australians? I mean, Frank Blount has said last week that Telstra would only upgrade regional and rural services in an affordable and efficient way.</para><para>There is a great need for concern. The Labor Party has described, and will continue to describe, that concern. But it is very interesting when the concern could not be described better than it has been by a National Party member of Mr Howard's own government, the member for Dawson, Mrs De-Anne Kelly. It will be interesting to see whether she does hold to her threat to cross the floor when and if this bill is ever returned to the House of Representatives.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>9L6</name.id><name role="metadata">MACKAY</name><name role="display">Senator Mackay</name></talker><para>—It won't make any difference anyway, will it?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Crowley, Sen Rosemary</name><name role="display">Senator CROWLEY</name></talker><para>—Quite true. I want to talk about an area that I think is a very big concern, and it has not been particularly developed in this debate—that is, the impact of the privatisation of Telstra on women. It is interesting how women have very much dropped off the political agenda with the advent of a Howard government, despite the fact that, of course, he has a very significant number of women in his parliament. In fact, the Howard government boasted about the number of women. But time and time again we have seen those women vote for policies or programs that have disadvantaged women. They have voted for changes in Medicare, for increasing the costs of child care, for the need to sell your home before you can get into a nursing home, and for significant changes in industrial relations that have enormously disadvantaged women. Now they are going to vote for the privatisation of Telstra when they know, if they talked to just a very few women in the rural and regional areas of this country, that women will be principally disadvantaged by the telephone cut-off—the changes.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Many years ago when I was not too long elected—I think it was after I became a senator, but certainly back then—the women of South Australia organised a `Labor Party women listen to people in rural South Australia' forum. We held that forum in Port 
 Augusta. We asked many women to come along who were certainly anything but members of the Labor Party. We were concerned to know what were the principal issues for them.</para><para>The first issue, and the answer certainly surprised everyone there, went to the question of what is the highest priority issue for women in rural and regional Australia. It was water. The second highest priority was communications—the telephone. The women were particularly interested in the telephone as a way of maintaining friendships and contact with family, when they lived so much of their lives in pretty isolated and distant areas. They were very concerned about simply being able to maintain a community of contact by the telephone.</para><para>They particularly talked about the importance of the telephone for emergencies. It is one thing for us to be able to quickly get in contact with an ambulance for emergencies; it is another altogether when you are living in rural and regional Australia. They were concerned about the importance of the telephone in terms of dealing with emergencies or accidents but also for finding out about how to manage things safely.</para><para>I know about this, too, because of the concern many rural families have about child care, to assist families when they are under pressure of work and to make sure that their children are safe from the hazards of living on a farm where, indeed, more children are killed by accident per year than anywhere else in this country. The telephone is critical for advice about safety and advice about what to do should an accident happen.</para><para>We saw not too long ago the launch of a further package in the campaign against domestic violence in this country. While I certainly acknowledge the critical importance of that contribution by the current government to the domestic violence issue, I also point out that it builds on the considerable program and policies established under the previous Labor government.</para><para>There is no doubt, though, that if you are a victim of domestic violence in rural and regional Australia, the need of the telephone, and indeed a specifically established tele 
 phone hotline, to assist people who are dealing with the difficulties of domestic violence is just the sort of thing that is at risk. These women now may find that the costs of the telephone and their calls are significantly increased.</para><para>There is another point that I was pleased to pick up on from the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of evidence provided to the Senate Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts Legislation Committee by Mrs Smith giving evidence on behalf of the Country Women's Association. She said:</para><para>I guess another of the reasons why the quality of the service is very important—</para><para>not only, first of all, that there is a service, but that it is of reasonable quality—</para><para>is that telemedicine is becoming so much more prominent in remote areas now, too. If you were having your ECG sent down the telephone, you would want the quality to be pretty good, wouldn't you?</para><para>I cannot think of a better example, unless perhaps you are halfway through a telemedicine operation when the line jacks out or has some interference. These are points that I think are being brought to the government's attention by members of the Country Women's Association and that certainly were raised at the hearings of the ERCA committee.</para><para>They are very important points. People are concerned, first of all, that they have a service, secondly, that that service is of good quality and, thirdly, and most importantly, that it is affordable.</para><para>It is interesting to consider another factor that is not being told to people about the consequences of a privatised Telstra. I have mentioned that, on any evidence, once a major service of that sort is privatised, the service quality falls and the costs rise. But in this case, Mr Howard has a bonus issue for the people of Australia, particularly regional and rural Australia, and that is the GST. Every time your telephone is connected, the GST will be added to it. Every time your phone is reconnected, that service will enjoy a GST. Every time you have cable television connections made, that will enjoy the extra GST. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>YW4</name.id><name role="metadata">MACDONALD</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Macdonald</name></talker><para>—How do you know this?</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>656</name.id><name role="metadata">FORSHAW</name><name role="display">Senator Forshaw</name></talker><para>—You haven't got a policy, then?</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>YW4</name.id><name role="metadata">MACDONALD</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Macdonald</name></talker><para>—She doesn't know.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Crowley, Sen Rosemary</name><name role="display">Senator CROWLEY</name></talker><para>—Every time your tax bill comes, that will have a GST.

It is very concerning for those of us who have bothered to go out and listen to and talk with people in rural and regional Australia about their concerns, to learn that most people do not want Telstra privatised and to know that neither do so many on the coalition backbenches. Yet they have bowed to pressure from their Liberal coalition colleagues. They have been forced into this and then bought off at a considerable price to be paid by the taxpayers of Australia.</para></talk.start></continue><para>It is very clear that Australians have never minded about assisting our colleagues and our families in rural and regional Australia. There has always been the cross-subsidy impact. In my own state, under the cross-subsidy arrangements that operate at the moment, loss making infrastructure in rural and regional areas is supported by profits made in other parts of Telstra. That means that, for instance, throughout northern Queensland the average cross-subsidy is up to $1,000 a line, and in regions like north-west New South Wales it can be up to $4,000 a line. Up through remote parts of Western Australia, the cross-subsidy can be over $5,000 a line. In far western areas of South Australia—my own state—like Ceduna, for example, lines can be worth more than $6,000.

It is a perfectly splendid speech dated 27 March 1946 by the then Premier Tom Playford about the need to buy the private electricity company in South Australia back into public ownership because of the failure of a privatised service to deliver on behalf of the people of that state. That is what we have done in delivering Telstra and that is what some of us will fight to maintain. We know that privatised services do not care about community obligations. They care much more about profits.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In the remaining minutes available to me I foreshadow that I will move a second reading amendment on behalf of the opposition. The government's amendments are about competition issues. They are not to do with the central issue of privatisation. The opposition believes that these amendments should be referred back to the ERCA committee for consideration and report back by 2 November. This will give the industry the opportunity to also put forward further amendments on competition issues. The opposition is not necessarily opposed to these amendments but wants to give them more careful consideration. The amendment has been circulated.</para><para>In the last minute remaining, it is important to say once again that this decision—this privatising of the rest of Telstra—is a feeble 
 effort at policy on the run. It is not about policy; it is about rescuing Senator Parer. It is about politics and nothing else but. It is a complete breaking of the promise given by Prime Minister Howard that this would not happen. This is yet another of Mr Howard's broken promises. It is against the wish of a huge majority of the Australian people who time and time again in polling have opposed any further privatisation of Telstra. They know that privatising means a drop in services and an increase in costs. When you add the GST to all those services, the Australian people will suffer terribly if this legislation is passed and at any stage proclaimed. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>5519</page.no><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator MACKAY</name><name.id>9L6</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise today in complete and utter opposition to the sale of Telstra, obviously.

If he wants to sell the rest, he should—as he promised—firstly gain the support of the Australian people at the next election. It is for this reason that the opposition will be moving an amendment in the second reading debate which, if successful, will have the effect of deferring further debate on this bill until the first day of sittings next year. I foreshadow that Senator Faulkner will be moving the amendment, which I understand has been circulated in his name. This amendment will give all senators the opportunity to hold Mr Howard to his word.</para><para>Let us briefly go through what happened for Tasmania with the one-third sale of Telstra. As Senator Murphy so eloquently pointed out, the $58 million that was parish-pumped into Tasmania was already in the Telstra business plan. All it was doing was bringing a number of those initiatives forward, and I think Senator Murphy made that case. As I said, Mr Howard vowed and declared, hand on heart—and we are not sure that he has got one, Senator Bolkus—that he would never, ever sell the remaining two-thirds of Telstra and at that point he gloated about making Australia the greatest nation of shareholders in the world.</para><para>What an aspiration to have—making Australia the greatest shareholding nation in the world. Maybe he meant the greatest cabinet of shareholders in the world. Maybe that is what he meant because he is certainly on the way there. Irrespective of that, what an aspiration for a government to have: to make the greatest nation of shareholders in the world. It is absolutely outrageous.</para><para>What about people? Forget shareholders; I know shareholders are people but we have to look after people first. This bill is actually going to adversely affect people in regional and rural Australia—and this government knows it. That is why none of those opposite—with three exceptions—have had the gumption to get up here and defend it. That is why, because you know it is the wrong thing to do. But you sit here in a cowardly way and continually interject as we get up and put ourselves on the line and indicate what our position is. You do not have the gumption to get up and defend your own position. I think that says a lot.</para><para>Let us turn to Senator Harradine. Senator Harradine also said he would never, ever agree to the further sale of two-thirds of Telstra. He said that to the people of Australia. He said that to the people of Tasmania, and the people of Tasmania believed him. He was also saying, `I will never, ever support the further two-thirds sale of Telstra.' The people of Tasmania look like they were wrong and the people of Australia look like they were wrong. I must say I thought he would not do this. I genuinely thought that Senator Harradine would not support this. I was wrong.</para><para>I have to say that in my dealings with Senator Harradine in the portfolios that I have responsibility for, which are industrial relations and employment, I have found him a very honourable person. I have found him to be a person of principle with regard to those two portfolios. I have found him to be a person who actually genuinely cares about the people of Tasmania. I thought that, when he made that commitment, he would keep his word. I thought he was genuine; I thought he was telling the truth, and so did the people of Tasmania. But I was wrong and the people of Tasmania were wrong.</para><para>I was on talkback radio with Senator Gibson the other day and we had a number of calls. I think there was one caller who was equivocal about the sale of Telstra—this is in Tasmania—and everybody else was implacably opposed to it. A lot of the people who rang up were shareholders. They said, `We bought shares in Telstra on the premise that 
 only one-third of it would be sold, but we don't want Telstra sold.' This government is denying the people the opportunity of having a say whilst seeking a mandate. They are doing it the wrong way around. It is absolutely lacking in intestinal fortitude.</para><para>I notice today that Senator Harradine says he is `leaning' towards a further two-thirds sale of Telstra. Senator Harradine says:</para><para>I've got a list . . . against and for . . . in actual words, the against is stronger but it gets down to the issue, can the government deliver a cheaper and more efficient telecommunications service than can a commercially-oriented or private organisation.</para><para>The answer is no. He knows that. He was active in the labour movement for a long time. As I said, he has done nothing but the right thing with regard to industrial relations. He knows that it is wrong. He knows that it is the wrong thing to do.</para><para>The people of Tasmania do not want Telstra sold. They have already had millions and millions ripped out of the state. They know that, once the telco is sold, it can never be bought back. This is not about quick fixes for grubby, short-term political gains—well, it is for the government—but for those of us who live in Tasmania, who are paid to come here and represent this state, it is about future generations. It is about state of the art technology for future generations of Tasmanians. That is what it is about, and we will be behind the eight ball. It is outrageous that one person can actually make a decision for future generations of Australians—and it looks like he is going to make the wrong decision.</para><para>The government has already ratted on the deal with Senator Harradine because the 170 jobs that they committed themselves to have not been created.

Senator Alston went on:</para><para>This is not only having the shares in the company but your approach would be that you have the capacity to go in and tell them everything you want them to do—you would tell them how to run the business and which services ought to be made available across the board.</para><para>He continued:</para><para>But that is a very different proposition to saying that they ought to be forced to provide it wherever you think it ought to be introduced.</para><para>I think that response to a question from Senator Harradine says it all. There is absolutely no way this government is going to be able to honour its commitment. Senator Harradine knows it and I hope he reconsiders his position.</para><para>In regard to Senator Harradine, as I said, we heard this morning that he is leaning towards the further two-thirds privatisation of Telstra. I must admit—and I have had a lot of calls into my office at home about this—that people are getting pretty sick of this tactic of Senator Harradine's. Now you see him, now you don't; maybe he will, maybe he won't; and so on. If Senator Harradine does make this decision—and I hope he does not—he will have made it without consulting the people of Tasmania, the people who pay his salary and who he purports to represent.</para><para>We talk about the CSO that the government is lauding. This is the same government that were prepared to accept the recommendation from the National Competition Council for the abolition of the cross-subsidy on Australia Post. You cannot trust the government. You could not trust them on that. The Hanson phenomenon happened, so they reversed the decision on that. It was a knee-jerk reaction. The Hanson phenomenon happened, so they changed their minds on that. You cannot trust this government on the issue of the CSO.</para><para>What I want to know from Senator Harradine—and I do not know whether he is coming in here or not; I certainly hope he does come in—is why on earth he is doing this. It is actually beyond me. I cannot understand why he is doing this. With regard to Wik, whilst I completely disagreed with what he did, I could see that there was some symmetry to it. I could see that there was some logic to it. I could see that he was genuinely concerned about a race based double dissolution election. I disagreed with what he did, but at least I could understand it. Here, for the life of me, I cannot understand it. Given that Senator Harradine was one of the people who said he would never ever vote for the full sale of Telstra, I do not think the 
 people of Tasmania or Australia can trust him anymore either. Not only can we not trust the Prime Minister, Mr Howard; we cannot trust Senator Harradine anymore either.</para><para>If this bill goes through, the only way the privatisation of Telstra will be stopped is by voting this government out. I think this government has got some kind of a death wish, because I think that is precisely what is going to happen. As I said before, it is politically loopy to do this. As far as this government is concerned and as far as Senator Harradine is concerned, the people of Australia and the people of Tasmania will judge them, and history will judge them, harshly. If Senator Harradine supports this, as far as I am concerned, he will not have a shred of principle left.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Calvert)</name></talker><para>—Senator Mackay, you have to actually foreshadow the amendment.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>9L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator MACKAY</name></talker><para>—I have.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—No, you said `on behalf of Senator Faulkner'.

In between various negotiations today, I have been able to hear some of the speeches from the opposition. Some have been very worth while listening to, and indeed I note Senator Murray's observations this morning. Senator Murray's speech was of particular help and interest. But I felt that some of the contributions were simply personal attacks on me, blaming me for unemployment and the next tornado.</para></talk.start><para>I feel that I should briefly address those comments. Let us take the employment situation in Telstra. Why has that declined? The ignorant suggestion being made from some people on the Labor side is that it is the result of the one-third sale of Telstra. How ridiculous can you get? Everyone knows that the cause of the restructuring in Telstra, which started before the one-third sale, is the deregulation environment, which was promoted and supported by the Labor Party and the government. The cause of the restructuring and the consequence of job losses in Telstra has been that deregulated environment and the forthcoming competition. Also, much of it is the result of technological change not associated with the one-third sale. So let us get that right. That has been the refrain that has been going around the place for months and months and months. It is time you people were honest and accepted the blame—if it is blame—and accepted the situation that it was your doing that there would be deregulation in the telecommunications industry.</para><para>The Labor Party has been flogging off a number of organisations and instrumentalities, including the Commonwealth Bank and Qantas and a number of others that I cannot think of offhand. The fact of the matter is that those who are `in the know' knew that you were preparing to sell off Telstra. You were preparing to sell off Telstra, and you know that.

It is about time she got her ear to the ground.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The position is, as I have always said, that the government is elected to govern and the role of the Senate is to audit and control executive government actions and also to protect the rights of individuals and the rights of the state. I have attempted to do this for the 23 years that I have been in this place. I need to examine this matter on its merits, divorced from the nostalgia that I have for Telstra or, more particularly, for its predecessor the Engineering Division of the Postmaster-General's Department.</para><para>Somebody from the opposition said, `Brian, we are living in the late 1990s.' Yes, we are. I mentioned previously that I was opposed to, and would not support, the full sale of Telstra. I said that, `The principle in this case is that, if Telstra is a natural monopoly, then it should not be sold.' That is the context in which I made that comment. Telstra, as you know, is no longer a natural monopoly. One could argue one way or the other about that, but that is the fact of the situation.</para><para>One of the questions that must exercise our minds is: is the government able to deliver cheaper and more effective telecommunication services to customers than a part privatised or fully privatised Telstra? That is one of the questions we need to ask. What is in place to ensure that this is delivered effectively and efficiently in regional Australia? That is a matter that is exercising my mind and about which discussions have been taking place. Some people are concerned that, if Telstra is privatised, there would not be an ability of legislatures or government to ensure that the universal service obligations are adhered to. In fact, you do that through the legislation, through executive government decision and through audit by this parliament.</para><para>The other thing, of course, which is a bit difficult for me to assess—and I have asked various economists about it—is what the ultimate benefit to Australia will be if substantial amounts of the proceeds are spent on redeeming debt. That is one of the things about which I have had various pieces of advice. There is, of course, as the government said, a social bonus and I am sure as the years go by that it will be recognised that the government is prepared to deliver the social bonus.</para><para>This legislation does not mandate the full sale of Telstra. It allows the full sale of Telstra; it does not mandate the full sale of Telstra. A future government could sell another tranche of Telstra if, for example, the people of Australia expressed themselves accordingly.

On this legislation, all we have had is not a tissue of lies, because that would be too generous, but the most blatant misrepresentations and distortions of a policy which you espoused with unbridled enthusiasm in government. There can be no doubt about that at all. In government, when Kim Beazley was finance minister and communications minister, he was the most enthusiastic advocate you could ever come across. That is why people like Kenneth Davidson and Tom Burton say he does not have a shred of credibility, because privatisation has been something that the Labor Party took to like a duck to water. They saw privatisation as the panacea. It solved all their budgetary problems—none of this concern that somehow it was a capital item and it ought to go to repaying debt or to rebuilding the capital infrastructure of the country. No, it was simply a bottomless pit that you were prepared to dip into on a regular basis in order to meet all the black holes that you had otherwise created.</para></talk.start></continue><para>It is very disappointing that we have reached this stage in Australia. Having had 13 years of enthusiasm for privatisation, if you look around the world, what do you find? The Prime Minister of Estonia was out here about 10 days ago. One of the first things he said to me was, `Do you know what we are doing? We are privatising our telecommunications 
 carrier.' He almost apologised for being late on the scene, because he knows that Cuba and Albania and the African National Congress and every man and his dog have gone down that path and the only crowd that is left is North Korea. And, of course, their great mate Kim Il Beazley.

The opposition have gone from being the great privatisers in government—there is hardly anything left, I might say, and given the cast-iron guarantee that we have given not to privatise Australia Post, there is nothing left except Telstra—to the situation where less than six months ago they were out there wanting to sell another 16 per cent of Telstra; that is what they wanted.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>4J4</name.id><name role="metadata">SCHACHT</name><name role="display">Senator Schacht</name></talker><para>—That's a lie.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>LD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name></talker><para>—No, it is not, and you know it.

So what possible basis can there be for Mr Beazley to get out there and say that the government can direct 
 Telstra to produce cross-subsidised services to the bush. The fact is that no direction has ever been given to Telstra. The power of direction to Telstra came in at the very same time, the very year, that the minister for communications was requiring Telstra to operate commercially. Here it is—I am holding up the Beazley act—the Australian and Overseas Telecommunications Corporation Act 1991. Who was the minister between April 1990 and December 1991? Mr Beazley. Who was the minister that required Telstra to operate commercially? Mr Beazley. Who introduced competition into the telecommunications sector? Mr Beazley.</para><para>Just to pick up on a point Senator Harradine made that, somehow, the Labor Party was responsible by deregulating the market, it is actually worse than that. The Labor Party were responsible for Telstra being substantially inefficient. If you look at what Mr Blount has had to say on many occasions, the fact is they were 30 per cent off world's best practice because of very substantial overmanning and very poor productivity levels. It was necessary for them to slim down the work force, contract out more services and generally become more competitive—all your own work. You introduced competition, you introduced deregulation, you required Telstra to operate commercially and you put the universal service obligation in place.</para><para> Just to demonstrate once again the depths to which those who seek to smear and distort will stoop, the act makes it abundantly plain—this bill—that you cannot sell off more than one-third and you cannot sell more than five per cent to any one strategic shareholder. That is the basis on which there were no telecommunications carriers from offshore who bought a stake. They were not interested in being passive players, and the limits were such that it did not make it in any shape or form attractive for them to buy into Telstra.</para><para>What do we find? We find this creature, Mr Beazley, going around and encouraging his other acolytes. I don't know that you have done it, Senator Schacht, but I have seen career backbenchers—I forget his name from somewhere down in the sticks in Victoria—getting out there and saying, `This is going to 
 mean that Telstra will be sold off to foreign telecommunications carriers.' That is what Mr Beazley said.</para><para>Do you want to know how weak and sneaky the operation is? Mr Beazley has been on radio today peddling these sorts of distortions, but he has not boxed any of the transcripts. No, this is a narrowcast message. Unfortunately, he has been caught red-handed saying these sorts of things which are absolutely and demonstrably untrue. You do not need to take my word for it. All you need to do is look at the legislation. The legislation enshrines universal service obligations, it enshrines price caps and it enshrines and builds on the customer service guarantee which we introduced—in other words, all of those social safeguards are in place in quite separate legislation than the legislation we are considering.</para><para>We have never, ever contemplated changes, but you will not make commitment to support those protections.

But certainly there were some aspects of corporate governance that I think are worthy of further consideration. Certainly, if we had had a few more contributions along those lines, we might have been able to shed a bit more light on some subjects. I think Senator Cooney, to his credit, also raised some concerns about open-ended proclamation. But, apart from those instances, this debate has simply been an unadulterated diatribe. It has been the most ideologically based and, of course, election motivated campaign of dishonesty and distortion that one could ever imagine.</para></talk.start></continue><para>You look around the world and you find that the African National Congress thinks that privatisation is a good idea.

It does not. All of those obligations remain in separate legislation. You know that as well as I do. You cannot possibly be that thick, Senator Schacht. I know you do not pay a great deal of attention in this chamber. I must have said it so many times it is not funny. But you must on occasions have read the legislation. You must have asked for briefings. You must have attended estimates committees. You know the facts. But, tragically, even if you do not, a former communications minister does.

As we stand now at the beginning of the committee stage, I will also say that I will pursue, as briefly as possible, all the amendments that we have listed. Regardless of what some might say is the likelihood of any of them getting through, I want to make sure that I place on the record for the future my opposition, section by section, to what we are doing here tonight. I think that when we look back in five to 10 years time it will be one of the greatest acts of economic vandalism this country would have seen.</para><para>To begin with, I do not believe that the preamble can be supported because it simply is not true. Let us begin by taking the second paragraph and the allegation that government ownership inhibits flexibility. Nonsense. There has been a series of extensive studies by the World Bank, by the OECD, by Monash University and so forth, and the key message from all of them is: it makes little difference who owns the company; the key is the quality of the management, competition and, of course, regulation. I do not believe that we should put patent untruths into a preamble. Indeed, why let the totally unproven assertion that public ownership is somehow 
 second best actually be incorporated into law? It is simply a lie and should not be there.</para><para>The next paragraph is just as fallacious. Plenty of countries around the world have publicly owned telecommunications companies. In fact, one of the most efficient in the world, one of the best telcos, is publicly owned—and that is the Swiss telco. Again, this paragraph is a nonsense.</para><para>The fourth paragraph is the biggest lie of all. It says that Australia will receive a social bonus to the budget bottom line from the Telstra sale. This is absolutely and patently untrue. Within seven years the sale of the rest of Telstra will leave the budget a full $4 billion worse off than it would have been, even after taking into account the interest savings. That is certainly no social bonus in any terms that I would agree with.</para><para>Let us remember that the sale of the first third of Telstra resulted in windfall gains of $11 billion to the wealthiest 10 per cent of Australians at the expense of the other 90 per cent. The sale of the rest of it will again deliver a windfall gain for the wealthy few. I do not believe that the rest of us should be facing increased taxes to make up that $4 billion black hole.</para><para>The next paragraph reminds us that the legislation only takes effect after the next election. Why are we even considering the bill now? I think that point was made last night. Why is it only the cabinet of the day that decides what the people's mandate was? That is something that we will develop later as we come to other amendments.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>5540</page.no><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator SCHACHT</name><name.id>4J4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We rise to support the Democrat amendment.

To put the preamble into law—for economic assertions, and that is all they are, from some ideological bent out of a Liberal Party policy document to become the law of the land—is really absurd. Of course, if you asked any court to try to interpret those three or four clauses, if it got any challenge, any judge worth their salt would say that this has noth 
 ing to do with the actual working clauses of the bill. It is just rhetoric that a parliamentary majority carried. It is put there as a political explanation. This Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts (Senator Alston) and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) can wander around the country at any time saying, `It is in the law, it is in the bill, that all these wonderful advantages will come from the full privatisation of Telstra.'</para></talk.start></continue><para>Senator Lees correctly pointed out that the preamble mentions that they will deliver a `social bonus' of an undeclared size, but there is no mention anywhere else in the bill of the detail of that social bonus. By asserting that government ownership is in no way appropriate in the `highly competitive, global communications environment', the minister, as usual, confuses competition issues with ownership. They are separate issues.</para><para>The Labor Party has always separated those issues. That is why we supported the introduction of competition into the Australian telecommunications market in 1991-92. We believed that that would get a better outcome for Australian consumers. At the same time, we also recognised that then and for the foreseeable future Telstra would provide over 85 to 90 per cent and, in many areas of Australia, 100 per cent of the telecommunications services to ordinary Australians.</para><para>At some time or other, most of those competitive companies that may come in—other carriers, other service providers—will have to use the Telstra network to make the connection between their customers. We have always recognised that, and that will be the case for the foreseeable future.</para><para>The minister forgot to mention in his ludicrous wind-up speech, or second reading closure speech, that the evidence that was given to the Senate legislation committee of inquiry into this bill from even the great devotees of competition—those fully privatised companies like AAPT and many others—all said, `The worst thing you can do is privatise Telstra and let it loose against us. With its market dominance, it will wipe us out.' In this case, the representative of AAPT, who made it clear that his position was that 
 he generally supports privatisation, said, `Even if you fully privatise Telstra, for goodness sake, leave the power of the minister to direct in the act. We know that, with the dominance of, as the minister once described it, "the 600 pound gorilla", only as a last resort will we get some protection by knowing that we can go to a minister, to the parliament, and raise political and broader social and economic issues.' It is a joke to put in this preamble. I had a look at the preamble earlier on and thought, `Should we move an amendment to delete the first three pages?'</para><para>This leads me to the point of this whole committee stage. The Labor Party will be supporting many amendments—our own and other amendments of the Democrats and the Greens. The government will move some amendments on competition issues that at the moment we are agnostic about. We think they would be better dealt with as a separate bill, not tied into a privatisation bill. We take the view that, in the committee stage, our principal position is to oppose the privatisation of Telstra—full stop.</para><para>It is true, as people say—Senator Harradine said it and Senator Alston has repeated it ad nauseam—that the Labor Party privatised a number of other instrumentalities. The difference with Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank was that they did not have 90 per cent of the Australian telecommunications market. The Commonwealth Bank had, at best, 20 per cent of the market. In the case of Qantas, less than 10 per cent of Australians fly regularly and half the airline market was provided by another carrier. No-one can remember the last time Qantas paid a dividend. It was always calling for more government guarantees to buy more equipment, et cetera. The Commonwealth Bank did pay a regular dividend, although it was not a brilliant dividend compared to what Telstra has been paying. There is a world of difference, and that is the distinction the Labor Party made when it made the decision. Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank were not near all-encompassing monopolies, even with competition. That is the difference.</para><para>I know others in the political debate will keep throwing it up at us and saying, `In the 
 end, you'll do the same to Telstra.' The Labor Party has never equivocated in its national platform. In our policy statements for each election we have always said: `We'll keep Telstra in full public ownership, and we'll keep Australia Post in full public ownership.' There is an important message that we want to give the people of Australia at the beginning of the committee stage, now that the second reading has been carried. After talking with our parliamentary leader, Kim Beazley, we give a commitment that if we win the next election—and I am sure the government's privatisation proposal will help us win the next election—one of the first pieces of legislation presented to the parliament in the first week of sitting of the new Beazley Labor government will be legislation to repeal this bill.</para><para>The Labor Party will make a commitment in its election campaign that, on election, in the first week of the first sitting of the first Beazley Labor government, we will repeal this legislation if it has passed through its final stages in this place. That is a statement we will not walk away from. We will go around Australia making that very clear. We look forward to putting this proposition clearly and in stark terms all over Australia—not only in the cities, of course, but in the country areas, the regional areas.</para><para>We look forward to seeing the National Party squirming, given what they outlined to us today. I have to say that I have, on many occasions, admired Senator Boswell because of the courageous speeches he has made in this place opposing mad right-wing lunatics, including infiltrators of One Nation. He has stood up in his own party against competition policy. He has stood up in his own party against a whole range of what he would call `economic rationalist statements'. But today's performance was the most pathetic performance that Senator Boswell has put in as he tried to explain how he sold out the bush for not billions of dollars, not even hundreds of millions of dollars and not even approaching $1 billion, but at best a couple of hundred dollars.</para><para>I want to go to the issue of what has so far been announced and how already it is being 
 exposed. If the National Party have bought this as a package, they have already been sold short. I will give an example. The minister yesterday announced that the new CDMA network would involve expenditure of some $400 million plus—$450 is, I think, the round figure. He said there would be $176 million for the spectrum and a further $200 million for the provision of the capital equipment to make it work. As was pointed out by Telstra today, the $176 million has already been spent. The National Party have bought a promise that they will get $176 million as part of the social bonus, but that was spent by Telstra several months ago when they bid for the spectrum. Finally, we find that Telstra has spent the grand sum of $6 million to $7 million to buy the spectrum that will be used to provide this system in rural areas. The minister said there would be $176 million to spend on the spectrum to get this network running, but it will be $6 million to $7 million. The National Party should scratch $170 million off their expected pot. They have been dudded $170 million already.</para><para>The next thing that happened is that Telstra said this is a commercial decision of theirs; they were going to do it anyway. If they were going to do it anyway, why did the National Party claim it as a victory, as part of their pressure? Senator Boswell said today he and his members rolled into parliament, met with John Howard two or three times and that one of their great victories was the new mobile phone network when Telstra put out a statement saying: `This is a commercial decision.' Apparently, they were going to do it anyway. This Liberal-National Party government cannot have it both ways. They cannot say, `This is a special deal we got for the bush with $420 million,' when Telstra is saying, `It's a commercial decision we were going to make.'</para><para>If it is not a commercial decision and it was part of the deal, it means that Telstra was lent on and, after discussions with the minister, had to make this decision. Why? Because the minister represented the two-thirds public ownership. The good old Country Party with `Black Jack' McEwen would not have fallen for this. He would have rattled the coalition 
 to the very end. Did the minister either lean on or direct Telstra or is it a totally commercial decision to establish the CDMA? It cannot be both. Either he lent on them to get this deal for the National Party or it is a straight commercial decision. I think it shows the hypocrisy of this arrangement. </para><para>There is a first series of questions we would like to get answers to about this CDMA proposal. I think Senator Boswell said that it was one of three prongs. He mentioned this one and he mentioned the new call charges for remote areas. He said that he is not at liberty to describe the third prong at the moment because it is a secret deal with the minister after his meeting with John Howard. I notice that Senator Harradine, in response to an interjection, said he is not at liberty to divulge the full deal.</para><para>This is showing this place in contempt. A deal is being done to provide money for regional and rural telecommunications, yet this government and the National Party are not even willing to tell their own supporters what the deal is. Senator Harradine says, `There is a deal, but I cannot tell you either.' I am surprised that Senator Harradine takes that attitude, because he has always been such a stickler for Senate arrangements.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>6H4</name.id><name role="metadata">HARRADINE</name><name role="display">Senator Harradine</name></talker><para>—Madam Chair, I raise a point of order.

 issues that have come up. Until we get more detail of the deal, what justifies this bill being carried by this parliament, for the rest of the committee stage I am going to keep asking a whole range of questions for the sake of the people of Australia. I want to find out exactly what the government has given them and what has persuaded Senator Harradine to vote for the government's basic proposition. If we cannot get that in the parliament, what is the use of having a parliamentary debate or a committee stage? They are some of the questions I raise about the CDMA proposal. There are many more to come. During the rest of this committee stage debate, I will raise them and others. I hope the minister can provide some information. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>5543</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to indicate that the Greens (WA) will be supporting the Australian Democrats' amendment No. 1 on sheet 1124 to oppose the preamble.

This isn't what should be happening in legislation. Quite a lot of the elements within the preamble can be proven to be patently untrue. Therefore, they ought not be in the legislation.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>5543</page.no><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name><name.id>656</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—At the outset, in commenting on this amendment and the matter before the Senate regarding the preamble, I want to go back to some of the closing remarks of the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts (Senator Alston) in the second reading debate. During his speech the 
 minister accused the opposition of being engaged in some extensive delaying tactic. The supposed evidence for this was all the members of the opposition, with the exception of one, having spoken in the debate in an attempt to drag it out.</para></talk.start><para>Firstly, in order to correct that, let me say that I was one who did not speak, even though I was on the list. I and a number of other opposition senators took ourselves off the list of speakers today in order to allow the process to at least be kept on track, as it were. I would dearly love to have had my 20 minutes worth in the second reading debate and been able to spend as much time as I could in the committee proceedings putting my points of view. But, in the interests of getting that second reading debate out of the way and getting into the committee stage, a number of opposition senators took themselves off the list. If I had had that opportunity, I would have said a lot of things. I want to make a couple of points, and they relate to the preamble. Firstly, I note that Senator Harradine has indicated that he is of a mind to support the preamble.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>6H4</name.id><name role="metadata">HARRADINE</name><name role="display">Senator Harradine</name></talker><para>—No.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>656</name.id><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name></talker><para>—Sorry, to support the amendment to delete the preamble. I appreciate that, but it is well known as a matter of statutory interpretation that a preamble to any law or act of parliament is really only ever an aid in the most extreme and very rare situations where some ambiguity arises within the main body of the legislation and the court has to turn to the preamble or the second reading speeches to ascertain what may have been parliament's real intention. Whether the preamble remains in or is taken out—and we clearly support it being taken out because it is largely a statement of ideological claptrap, adopting Senator Margetts's words—it clearly does not matter at the end of the day because a future conservative government, and I am confident there will not be one, could take steps to amend other important sections of the legislation as well as the preamble. If anybody thinks anything here is set in stone or is cast iron, as the minister is wont to say all the time, then they should have another think.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Let me make a couple of other points, and I want to address this comment to Senator Harradine. I know Senator Harradine has been the target, if you like, of a lot of the speeches made today. He is a well-intended target, because what the opposition is clearly putting before the chamber and endeavouring to remind Senator Harradine of—as he is in this unique position of having almost the casting vote on this matter—is those commitments he has given in the past. It appears that there is no point reminding the government of the commitments they gave in the past because they long ago gave up any semblance of wanting to adhere to any of their commitments. This was a government which promised to make all Australians relaxed and comfortable, and then scared the living daylights out of the aged community with their attempts to force people to sell their homes to get decent aged accommodation. This is the government that told workers of this country that they would be no worse off, and then brought in draconian workplace relations legislation. Even in its watered-down form as a result of the agreement with the Democrats, they still nevertheless endeavoured to use that to beat-up on the maritime workers union.</para><para>I remind Senator Harradine—although I am sure he does not need any reminding—that he supported the Labor opposition in opposing the workplace relations legislation. Senator Harradine's support for the opposition on that occasion did not help us because the Democrats had reached an agreement with the government. I remind the chamber and Senator Harradine that the government claimed a mandate for their workplace relations legislation and, on at least one theory—having won the election and achieved a majority in the House of Representatives—it could be argued that they had a mandate to bring in their workplace relations reforms. We do not believe they had the mandate to bring in the reforms they did; nevertheless, it is arguable that they had a mandate to bring them in. Notwithstanding what could clearly be said at least on that occasion was a government mandate for workplace relations reform, Senator Harradine did not vote to let the government govern on that issue. He voted with us.</para><para>However, when it came to Telstra, there was a slight change, I would suggest, in the logic to the argument. After negotiating agreements with the government—which in his view were to be to the betterment of the state of Tasmania but which in our view have not been proven and have not been carried out—Senator Harradine voted with the government to support the sale of one-third of Telstra. Again, Senator Harradine and the government argued that they had a mandate to sell one-third of Telstra because they had gone to the people before the election indicating that they supported the sale of one-third of Telstra.</para><para>I have produced some figures in this chamber before—although I do not have them with me tonight—that interestingly enough show that, in the last federal election when the issue of the sale was clearly on the table and the Labor Party, the Greens and the Democrats had all made it clear that they were opposed to it, those parties in the Senate actually received a majority of votes in the election. My argument is this, and I would ask Senator Harradine to consider it: this debate has already been had in this parliament.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>C16</name.id><name role="metadata">HEFFERNAN</name><name role="display">Senator Heffernan</name></talker><para>—Let's go home.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>656</name.id><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name></talker><para>—Yes, let's go home. Move the adjournment and let's go home, Senator Heffernan. This debate has been had because, when we debated the government's proposition to sell only one-third of Telstra and the Prime Minister gave his solemn promise that he would not seek to sell any more of Telstra, implicit in the decision of this parliament and this chamber to allow that bill to go through was the rejection of the sale of the other two-thirds of  Telstra. It is not just an argument in terms of logic or semantics even; it is quite clearly the case that the reason Senator Harradine and indeed Senator Colston supported the sale of one-third of Telstra on that occasion was that guarantee and that commitment that no more was going to be sold, certainly within the life of this parliament, and that there would be no attempt by the government to introduce any further legislation to sell off the remaining two-thirds. </para></talk.start></continue><para>So the debate has been had. The Senate has made the decision, in giving its approval to the sale of the first one-third of Telstra. Clearly, implicit in that decision was its rejection of the further sale of any more of Telstra. I make this final point, as has been argued and put by my colleagues throughout this debate: why the sudden urgency for this legislation? Why didn't the minister and the Prime Minister announce after the float of the first one-third of Telstra, which they said was so successful when all the mums and dads in Australia went out and bought Telstra shares, `We think this has been such a tremendous success. We're going to sell the rest of the two-thirds'? Why didn't they say it then?</para><para>What has happened is they have got down to the 11th hour, they know they are in trouble electorally and they are trying to push this bill through this parliament now because they know that, whether they win or lose the next election—and it is becoming increasingly obvious that they will not win it—the composition of this Senate will change in June next year and there will be more senators in this chamber who are opposed to the sale of Telstra than there appear to be now.</para><para>The government knows that, if it can get the vote of Senator Colston, the vote that rightly belongs to the Labor Party and rightly should be a vote against the sale of Telstra, and if it can get Senator Harradine's support, it can get this bill through now. But, if it were to leave this legislation, if it were to allow the people to have their say at the next election, it knows that the composition of this chamber will change and it will not get that legislation through the new Senate because a number of government senators who currently sit in this chamber will not be back here. There will be more of us, and I am sure we will be sitting over there.</para><para>That is the reason for this haste. The government is, firstly, relying upon the vote that rightly belongs to the Labor Party and, secondly, relying upon the vote of Senator Harradine. I would just ask Senator Harradine to think of that. Whilst this parliament has dealt with the issue of the sale of the first one-third of Telstra—and there is certainly, as I said, an argument that can be advanced that 
 the government had a right to bring that matter before the parliament to be debated—the government has no right to put this issue of the sale of the remaining two-thirds of Telstra before this parliament. It should put it to the people first and then let the next parliament decide.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>5546</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would not normally respond to that type of tedious repetition of falsehood.

It is the government's right to put before us legislation. It is our right, of course, to amend it as we so desire, and I happen to be desiring to amend this preamble by deleting it.</para><para>Be that as it may, I wanted to make a point on the workplace relations legislation. Yes, they said they had a mandate for that but, because of my long years of experience in the trade union movement, I could see that the provisions of that legislation were inadequate to deal with the situation that the government desired to deal with. I voted accordingly, and I will do so on any similar occasion when that judgment is made, but the judgment has to be made at the particular stage.</para><para>On this matter, if this legislation goes through this parliament, it will not be proclaimed until after the next election. If you say that you are going to be over on the government benches, it will not be proclaimed. I think the government is very brave—I do not know whether it is wise—to say, `This is the way we are going to go. We're not going to proclaim it until after the election.' Therefore, it will become an election issue.</para><para>Those who feel so strongly about the matter know what they can do.

All this bill does is enable the government of the day to sell more of Telstra. It may choose to sell another tranche of Telstra, up to 49 per cent. In fact, you might want to do that. I do not know. The legislation is an enabling piece of legislation for a future government—after it has gone through an election with this issue well and truly on the agenda for consideration—to sell another tranche or the remaining two-thirds.</para><para>I know what is being said and understood all round that the preamble would only be used in exceptional circumstances as an aid to the interpretation of the law where the words are uncertain.

Incidentally, I might mention to the committee that I do have an amendment of my own in respect of the proclamation provisions. At the present moment, as has been adverted to by Senator Margetts, Senator Lees and the advice by the Clerk Assistant (Procedure), this is a fault in the bill. It leaves open-ended when this legislation will be proclaimed in the next parliament.</para><para>I am proposing that unless it is proclaimed within the two months of the new parliament then it is repealed. So, Senator Schacht, if you are in government you will not have to repeal it. That is the whole point of my amendment. If you had to repeal it, you might run into a difficult Senate or you may not. I am assisting you in that regard. I foreshadow that I will move an amendment which will ensure that if it is not proclaimed within two months of the new parliament then it is repealed. With those thoughts and statements, I indicate that I will be supporting the amendment moved by Senator Lees to delete the preamble.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>5547</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The minister talked about the reason why this legislation was necessary and why it had to go through now.

On that basis I will not be opposing Senator Lees's amendment to oppose the preamble.</para></talk.start><para>I will just make a few comments that are pertinent in the contributions made so far. The first point in relation to Senator Lees is that, unless I heard her incorrectly—and I must say I could not believe my ears—she quoted three particular surveys—one of them I think was a Monash University study. She said that their conclusion was that who owns it makes little difference; it depends on the quality of management. Game, set and match. Some people are prepared to die in a ditch over who owns 
 Telstra and your first contribution is to say that who owns it makes little difference. I agree entirely, and I am delighted that Senator Schacht also said that he agreed fully with the remarks of Senator Lees.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>DX5</name.id><name role="metadata">MARGETTS</name><name role="display">Senator Margetts</name></talker><para>—He didn't talk about public interest.

They were the words you quoted. If you meant to say something else perhaps you can elaborate. I am simply relying on the words that you put on the table at the start of this debate.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Senator Schacht gave a phoney commitment about repealing the bill in the first week of sitting. Given the Labor Party's track record, one could not possibly accept even that at face value. Even if they did, what would possibly preclude them from coming back five minutes later with another bill to simply sell down a part of or retain one per cent in public ownership. It is preposterous nonsense.</para><para>As we know, only a couple of weeks ago Senator Schacht put out a press release saying that he was in favour of retaining Telstra in majority public ownership. Senator Robert Ray actually squashed that very proposition—he has squashed a few things in his time, I know. He was at great pains to rebuke Mr Gareth Evans, the current shadow Treasurer, when he tried to float the proposition that they could sell down another 16 per cent. All this business of phoney defence of keeping it in two-thirds public ownership has to be regarded as one of the most flexible and open-ended commitments in history.</para><para>I also thought it was very significant that Senator Schacht distinguished the Labor Party's approach on Telstra from its approach on other government business enterprises. The point of distinction was that they were not situations in which the government held a substantial majority or a dominant position. That is telling you that he does not really object to private ownership or to privatisation at all; he is simply saying that, whilst you have a dominant government position in terms of the market share, then he is in favour of public ownership. Quite clearly, that means that, if Telstra loses market share, then his objection would fall to the ground and he 
 would then, presumably, no longer oppose the privatisation of the telecommunications carrier because it was just another player on the marketplace.</para><para>Again, I thought it was a very significant concession on the part of Senator Schacht, who I presume knows not what he says when he tries to make that distinction. Senator Schacht, I will repeat it for your benefit. In the one breath you say you are opposed to privatising Telstra. You say the difference between Telstra, Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank is that Telstra has a much greater market share.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>4J4</name.id><name role="metadata">SCHACHT</name><name role="display">Senator Schacht</name></talker><para>—Absolutely.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>LD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name></talker><para>—But what follows from that and what you do not even seem to appreciate is that, if Telstra lost a significant proportion of its market share, your objection would, therefore, disappear because that is the only defence you offer as to why you in government were prepared to privatise Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank—because they did not have a dominant position in the marketplace. It follows from that that, if Telstra does not have a dominant position in the marketplace, you would have no policy objection.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Senator Forshaw's contribution to the effect that we should be grateful that he did not speak in the second reading debate and then went on to speak for longer in the committee stage than some other people spent in the second reading debate is hardly a basis for us being very grateful.

But more important is the question of the government's mandate to do any of this.</para></talk.start><para>Unfortunately, Senator Harradine has left the chamber because I would have liked him to comment on a statement he made during the debate which led to the one-third sale of Telstra. He made a number of comments, but I want to point out two in particular. One comment relates to governments achieving mandates. We know what every single member of the government who spoke in that debate said with regard to the one-third sale and any further sale. Not one of them said that they would seek to do anything other than achieve a one-third sale before going back to the people.</para><para>We have legislation here now. Senator Harradine gives an indication in the first instance that, while he was not too sure about supporting the full privatisation, he is on the public record as saying that. Just now he has said that this is enabling legislation so it does not mean that the final two-thirds of Telstra will be sold; it could mean something different. But we know full well what this government means and we know full well why this government has brought this legislation—and I find, unfortunately, with the support of Senator Harradine—with a view to getting it through the parliament now. The government is very afraid that if, after an election, it does not have the numbers in this place—and that is quite likely—it would have no hope of getting this legislation through the Senate. That is the real reason why we have this legislation here now. The government is afraid that it will not be able to achieve it.</para><para>Senator Harradine says, `My amendment goes to proclamation and it has to be proclaimed within two months.' But that has nothing to do with this Senate. If this legislation passes, it is not a question of us coming back after another election in this chamber, the states house, as I have heard Senator Harradine put it so many times, and arguing the case and defeating something that Senator Harradine seemed to have held dear to his heart back in December 1996, when he said:</para><para>. . . the Senate should apply certain principles which if those principles and values conflict with the government's legislation in discharge of its mandate—</para><para>and that is even with a mandate—</para><para>then those principles should prevail. On this particular matter I would have voted very strenuously against the total sale of Telstra.</para><para>I understood that to have a very clear meaning; now I am not so sure. I ask Senator Harradine if he might explain to me what he meant back then versus the position he is currently adopting, understanding that he has said that this is enabling legislation, understanding that he has said it does not necessarily mean that there will be full privatisation of Telstra, and understanding that he also said back then that he was opposed to the total sale.</para><para>You have to wonder about this preamble. It makes all sorts of commitments about universal service obligations and continued access to untimed local calls, and it refers to various other pieces of legislation—one of which is the Telecommunications Act 1997. I would like to hear from the minister how they intended in the longer term to apply the Telecommunications Act 1997 with regard to commitments such as those mentioned when there is a fully privatised Telstra. That is why this preamble should be removed.</para><para>I ask Senator Harradine, through you, Madam Chair: on what basis are we supporting this legislation?

You ran the old thimbles around that many times that he did not have a clue which one the pea was under. He just bought it as it was. There he was tonight saying that the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister had got to know each other.

You only have to look through it to see what a load of nonsense it is. It has been denigrated by many reports. The minister said that even a one-third sale of Telstra would deliver all sorts of 
 benefits, that it would bring telecommunications up to speed, with the injection of private funding, et cetera, and this would make Telstra a more commercial organisation. All the reports have said that that did not happen. That is why we should support the Democrat amendment.

If it is not portable, this may be good for Telstra, and it may be why they have decided to do this anyway as a commercial deal.

First of all, I did hear Senator Harradine ask why we were discussing the preamble when he had committed to vote with us. As though that is the be-all and end-all. Thank you, Senator Harradine, we will not have anything more to say; we appreciate your support of Senator Lees's amendment. We will just decamp. Senator Alston, I thought, also gave some indication of impatience on this matter. After contentious legislation is carried at the second reading there will always be a small blow-out 
 on the preamble and the first clause, then the committee as a whole will settle down to solid work considering what will mostly be government amendments but amendments coming from others also and it will proceed in an orderly and structured fashion. But the committee stage provides us with our one opportunity to at least ask for further information. And that really is in three broad areas.</para></talk.start><para>With regard to the first area, we have had the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Timothy Fischer, proceeding around the country throwing money off the back of a truck as fast as he can. We are having difficulty keeping up with the promises he is making. We all saw him this morning ring John Laws and tell  him what a wonderful reception it was. That is the last we ever heard of him. The line dropped out and we heard nothing more. So we do not know precisely what the government's intention is in regard to providing services in the rural areas.</para><para>We know the other side of the coin. We know that it was an unequal negotiation field. We know that the slippery characters in the Liberal Party will always outdo their country cousins. I am a city boy; I can remember the good old days when two of my country cousins came down from Brewarrina. We fed them chocolates. The packet was actually labelled `Laxettes' but they thought they were chocolates. They just ate them up. And this is exactly the same. It is precisely the same thing.</para><para>On one level we have knowledge that a deal has been done, that offers have been made, with no precision and with no negotiating skills from those who are supposed to receive the offer. It would be nice if the minister would at least try to outline at some stage this evening precisely what is on offer in terms of recompense to rural areas of Australia to overcome their fears of the full privatisation of Telstra. The minister would at least acknowledge that there is some uneasiness out there about this particular policy. I want to know what the package is.</para><para>With regard to the second area, have there been any special arrangements made for particular states? When this tends to happen my state is the one that tends to get dealt out 
 because it is regarded as a safe area for the coalition. They have only one National Party senator, who does not amount to anything—absolutely nothing, as you can see from his contribution today; he threw his speech away and sat down with four minutes to go. We do not know state by state whether there are going to be winners and losers. Some people would say, `If you come from a small state and you have a pivotal vote and you want to leverage money into your state, fair enough.' I do not say `fair enough'. That is not good governance. It is not good governance if 10 or 20 or 100 Telstra workers in my state get the bullet for no reason other than political expediency, simply to bring over a crucial vote in another state. That is not what we are about. This may be a states House, but we are all Australians and we should all be treated as equally as possible.</para><para>The last area I raised earlier today. I raised the question: why was it that the vote in this Senate will be  determined by a corrupted vote, by someone who had been lured from our side of politics? I indicated, with some complaint and some justification, I thought, that I thought it was a bit red hot that he would come into the chamber last night and three times vote for a gag and make us sit to 12 o'clock tonight and tomorrow night, then jump on the plane and go back to Queensland.</para><para>But the coalition had an answer for us on that so we did not press it—`Oh, look, he had a longstanding medical appointment in Queensland.' We all understand that. It would have been nice if we could have debated the motion last night so that anyone on this side of the chamber—and right around it—who may have had urgent medical appointments could have at least put the argument. But we were not given that particular scope. I actually believed the situation. I thought, `That's fair enough.' Despite my particular concerns about this particular senator, no-one would begrudge the fact that he had to return to Queensland for some sort of medical consultation. None of us, in fact, would have objected to that. But what do we find tonight on the <inline font-style="italic">7.30 Report</inline>? Oh, no, Senator Colston is having discussions with the Prime Minister.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>8O6</name.id><name role="metadata">O'BRIEN</name><name role="display">Senator O'Brien</name></talker><para>—About what?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>UI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator ROBERT RAY</name></talker><para>—About what? And what was delivered? That is what we want to know before we continue to consider this particular piece of legislation. Through his normal source, the person he normally drip-feeds in the media, we learnt three things about his demands. We even saw—although we could not read it in full—what was purported to be a letter from Senator Colston to Mr Howard. The camera went on to about the first three paragraphs. I must say I did not bother on this occasion to freeze-frame it, blow it up and find out what it was about. But in the newspaper article written by a journalist very sympathetic to Senator Colston, he had three big demands. First, why wasn't he being consulted and why had no-one talked to him? That has obviously been solved today as he has flown to Queensland and seen the Prime Minister.</para></talk.start></continue><para>His second great complaint was that the government would not accept his vote, and he was still angry about that. His third complaint, apparently, was that he could not put a long list of smears, vicious innuendo and outright lies into this particular chamber. One wonders: if he put those propositions to the Prime Minister, what was the Prime Minister's reaction? Clearly, his reaction is that he has met one of the demands. That is, Senator Colston has met the Prime Minister.</para><para>But I do not think you could imagine that the Prime Minister of this country would have countenanced Senator Colston's other two demands. After all, it was the Prime Minister, having defended Colston all the way through until 8 April 1997, who called the Federal Police in and it was just eight days later that the same Prime Minister, against the opposition of certain senators in this place, said they would no longer count his vote. So I cannot imagine that the Prime Minister, having done that, would backslide on that at all. I would never accuse him of it. I would certainly never ever contemplate the Prime Minister of this country acceding to Senator Colston's demands to put those forms of slanders, innuendoes and intended attacks to pervert his own court case so that he could get off 
 without going to trial. No Prime Minister of Australia would do that.</para><para>However, after the Prime Minister having met him and having known that those were the demands, we are at least entitled to have some response to say—and I am sure it could be found in the next hour or so—that the Prime Minister of Australia rejected out of hand those two demands. Then all that remains to be said is this: were arrangements made—legitimate arrangements, even though we might not like them—so that special deals were cut with Senator Colston to get his support for this particular bill? Did that occur? If it did occur, what is the nature of them and has the minister been informed? He may not have been informed of those particular arrangements.</para><para>When it comes to considering this particular committee stage of the bill, we are entitled to see some of the detail of the arrangements that are not contained within the bill—if you like, the offshore deals that have been made which will reflect back into the consideration of this bill. We really want to know what are the detailed arrangements that have been made with the National Party so we can assess whether they were sold a pup and whether there should be further amendments in the committee stage to reinforce those agreements. We need to know whether there have been any special deals made for any states and whether, when you run the ruler over it, that is fair amongst all of the states of Australia and it is not just a political ploy to drag over votes.</para><para>The final thing we need to do is understand what the nature of the discussion was, in terms of the way it affects this bill—and only that part of the discussion between Senator Colston and the Prime Minister of Australia. If those questions can be somewhat answered, I am sure we can proceed to the more detailed consideration of the bill. But I do reiterate, in spite of what Senator Harradine and Senator Alston have said about the initial stages of the bill, that it is to be expected that there will be a few bombastic speeches and others made immediately after the second reading.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">FAULKNER </name><name role="display">Senator Faulkner</name></talker><para>—Steady on!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>UI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator ROBERT RAY</name></talker><para>—I exclude your noble speech earlier in the piece, Senator Faulkner—and, if you believe that, you would believe anything.

They go to the government's direction in ensuring that Telstra is not able to, in fact, thwart the stated purpose of the government to enhance competition in the telecommunications area.</para></talk.start><para>Minister, I would like to draw your attention to the experience in the United States, following deregulation, where the consumer benefits allegedly arising from competition policy were delayed by several years because many of the incumbent carriers chose to initiate legal activities and legal action against new entrants for fear that they were encroach 
 ing on their markets in a way that they did not think was fair.</para><para>Minister, I ask you for a description on the management of that transition, particularly in the context of Telstra's apparent willingness to take on the rulings and guidance of the ACCC in these matters. We have seen already Telstra vehemently try to hold on to the market advantage it has in Internet service provision. I think there is still a structural issue with respect to Telstra having the advantage of being the provider of most of the wholesale bandwidth to many of Australia's ISPs.</para><para>This is a particularly pertinent question for regional Australia because Telstra is one of the few providers of wholesale bandwidth to many regional Internet service providers. Whilst the way they subsequently sell their retail product has already been perused by the ACCC, there is a very clear case of price discrimination between metropolitan, rural and regional customers of Telstra's Big Pond home and business product. This creates quite a dilemma because, whilst Telstra continues to provide a wholesale product and a retail product for Internet services in the region, the ISPs that provide those services in the region are required to purchase the bandwidth from Telstra at a set price and then on-sell it. Telstra could obviously, within their structure, provide those ISP services at a much lower rate.</para><para>Indeed, we have heard evidence in estimates committees that the Internet service that Telstra Big Pond provides has an arbitrary pricing regime. For example, we heard at the estimates committee that Telstra imposed an 85-kilometre radius measurement around a regional point of presence for those classified for their Big Pond business product. Minister, I know that you have dwelt on the issue of points of presence and what a glorious development they are for regional Australians who want access to the Internet, but to impose an arbitrary distance radius around those points of presence for the purposes of jacking up the price, or the cost, of that Internet service seems to be quite bizarre.</para><para>It gets even more ridiculous when you consider the way that other Internet service 
 providers actually have to charge for services out in the bush. It is my understanding that the ACCC was challenged and asked about comparisons between what Telstra charges for these service and what other ISPs charge. Although Telstra could provide these services for a lower price, they will not. Why? Because it would be an uncompetitive practice because they would undercut the services being provided by other ISPs. I am describing an absolutely ridiculous situation where the ACCC is maintaining, through their regulatory regime, an artificially high price for Telstra Internet customers in the regions.</para><para>This whole issue of Internet pricing is highly pertinent, particularly when you look at some of the developments that are taking place with convergence. As the minister will know—and I have spoken on this issue many times in this place—the provision of Internet services has the capacity to actually overtake and become the new form of communications address in the same way as a telephone number is currently viewed. For many rural and regional Australians, their Internet IP address will possibly become their telecommunications address. Of course, the minister would only be too familiar with telephony across the Internet and the fact that the hardware and software necessary to support that technology is currently available and, certainly, will become more available as the satellite technology proceeds and PAS 8 is launched.</para><para>This comes back to the inherent contradiction of what we are dealing with here. We have a telecommunications carrier that does have complete or large control over the local area networks in the regions. The only opportunity for other competitors to come in is via these new technologies. But, until that happens, this government has the responsibility to ensure that these people are not at a disadvantage.</para><para>Minister, what is your view of Telstra's discriminatory pricing regime for rural Internet users who are utilising the Telstra Big Pond products? What is your view on the comparison between those products and other products offered by other rural and regionally based Internet service providers? How can you guarantee to rural and regional Austral 
 ians, in the context of the package we know nothing about as yet, that they will in fact have a fair, reasonable and affordable access to the Internet at rates comparable to the flat rates now being offered by the major ISPs in metropolitan areas?</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>5560</page.no><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name><name.id>SF4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—As I understand it, the preamble will be taken from the bill. I think Senator Harradine has indicated that he will be voting to have it removed, and that means it will be removed. It does contain much that can be properly discussed. Some of it is puff, sort of a philosophical war cry, but there is some good material in it which needs explanation.</para></talk.start><para>There is the statement that Telstra will be subject to a 35 per cent limit on total foreign ownership and a five per cent limit on individual foreign ownership. There is also the statement that Telstra's chair and the majority of Telstra's directors will be Australian citizens. I think people listening to this debate would say, `Yes, it should remain in Australia,' but there are a couple of questions that arise out of that. In his second reading speech, the minister said that the business run by Telstra is simply that—a business—and that it is not government's place to be in business.</para><para>What comes across from that is that somehow it does not really matter who owns Telstra—in fact, that has been said—and that it is the quality of the services they deliver that counts. But if that is so why, in the government's view, is it important that the majority of the shareholding remains with Australians? If the majority should be with Australians, why isn't all of it with Australians? Why do we seize upon a 35 per cent limit? Is there a reason behind that or is it simply a matter that seems to be about right, to be about a third? Doesn't that part of the preamble indicate that there are very important considerations as to who should own Telstra? The bill itself and the second reading speech indicate that.</para><para>It may be helpful, I suggest, if the minister could, as succinctly as possible, explain this: there is at one level a proposition that this is a business and that, as long as the business returns good service to the people who take those services and returns a profit to the 
 shareholders, it does not really matter who owns it. How does that proposition live with the proposition that I think we would all agree with that it should be kept in Australian hands? If it should be kept in Australian hands, why should 35 per cent of it be allowed to go overseas?

You put foreign ownership limits on in this area for the same reason that you put them on in a whole range of other areas and for the same reason you have the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act and FIRB restrictions. In some areas you take the view that there is a significant distinction between ownership and control and you can accept certain levels of foreign ownership, but you might want to draw the line in terms of control.</para></talk.start><para>The Labor Party would not, of course, put any foreign ownership limits at all on the radio industry.

I am sure Senator Boswell appreciated it as well. Senator Ray once again underlined the absolute disdain and contempt that the Labor Party has for rural Australians. He might think it is particularly amusing to tell his little stories about Laxettes, but he is revealing a great deal and we are very grateful to him. I promise to immediately be in touch with our advertising agency to ensure that he gets prominence in the campaign. It will be very enlightening, I think, for rural Australia to be told that the de facto leader of the Labor Party in this chamber takes that view of his country cousins.</para><para>As far as Senator Schacht is concerned, first of all he suggested that it was only today that it was pointed out that Telstra had already spent $276 million on acquiring spectrum for the purposes of mobile technologies, and he referred to the announcement in relation to CDMA.

Telstra well knew, and so did the other carriers, that they had 30 days in which to resolve their differences in the number of analog base stations that ought to be retained. If they did not reach a satisfactory decision on the basis of the ACA report, it would be important for them to decide on the extent of the digital roll-out. If they chose not to, they would have to, one way or another, face the consequences. On that basis, they decided that CDMA was a technology that they would prefer to adopt rather than simply upgrade the digital. That is not to say that they cannot do both. We very much welcome that decision, which is clearly one taken on the basis of their awareness of the situation which the government found itself in as a result of that earlier predicament.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I notice that Senator Schacht seemed to have difficulty reading to the bottom of that press release.

It states that the pastoral call rate will be replaced by a preferential rate of 25c for every 12 minutes. It will be a very significant benefit for those finding it necessary to make calls to the designated community service town. The big problem for many years, and 
 about which the Labor Party did nothing, was that calls to neighbours, friends or workmates within those outer extended zones were timed local calls. There was a great deal of resentment about that fact. This decision means that they will be able to have the benefits of untimed local calls within the zone to those people.</para><para>Senator Schacht asked whether this would be included in the CSO. The money will be spent essentially on a capital infrastructure upgrade, probably the installation of two megabyte links and other ancillary technology. Part and parcel of that will probably involve upgrading DCS connections. But it is a one-off, so it is a capital item. It therefore does not need to be included in the CSO. It is money that will be available from the social bonus and will, therefore, be clearly dependent upon this bill passing into law.</para><para>Telstra has agreed to these arrangements. You do not need legislation to ensure that because you already have in legislation a capacity to impose price caps if any agreements are not honoured. As Senator Schacht well knows, you have licence conditions that can be varied at any time. So let there be no doubt that we regard Telstra as acting very much in good faith on this initiative. We think it is a very important breakthrough for people in rural and remote areas. They have long bemoaned the fact that they were completely and utterly ignored for those 13 long years. They always failed to understand why they should not be entitled to an untimed local call when phoning within the outer extended zones. As a result of that decision, they will have that capacity.</para><para>Senator Schacht asked me about the price of handsets. Clearly, that will ultimately be a commercial decision. The indications we got are that we could expect $349 to be an early price of handsets. As you well know, it all depends on some of the arrangements made. You can have airtime reselling, for example, that might result in heavily subsidised or even give-away handsets. It is entirely a matter for the players and the competition that forces them to make differential price and quality of service offerings.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>4J4</name.id><name role="metadata">SCHACHT</name><name role="display">Senator Schacht</name></talker><para>—Number portability?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>LD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name></talker><para>—As I am sure Senate Schacht again well remembers, we decided to require number portability for fixed line services by 1 May this year.

She seems to think that it is engaging in price discrimination through the big pond Internet service provider. If that is the case, clearly the ACCC would have a role. It is a watchdog to ensure that people do not take advantage of a dominant or monopolistic market situation in order to price discriminate. I thought I heard her suggest that somehow if Telstra charges less it would be undercutting and that it would be anticompetitive. It is a bit hard to see that it can be acting anticompetitively if it overcharges or undercharges. At the end of the day, it is a decision by the regulator. We have every confidence that the ACCC will attend to those concerns.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>5562</page.no><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator SCHACHT</name><name.id>4J4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank the minister for some of those answers.

Is there any technical inhibition on switching the number? If someone switches from the Telstra CDMA carrier to the Optus GSM carrier where they have to take the new phone, they cannot actually switch the number from one to the other. In the competitive market, having full portability and being able to take your number with you when you change carriers is a very important aspect of developing a competitive market. That has already been dealt with in the fixed telephone market, with a local loop, et cetera. I just want to know whether there is any technical difference.</para></talk.start></continue><para>If that means that CDMA subscribers cannot take their numbers with them when they go to a GSM network, they are going to be formally trapped into sticking with the CDMA and will not have the advantage of full competition. I do not know whether that is technically correct, I just want to get it on the record and find out. If it is not portable for technical reasons—even if the ACA chooses to say this is going to be full number portability and then it finds technically it cannot be imposed—Telstra has walked off with a major market advantage in that the alternative network for mobile phones which will be established as the CDMA right across Australia will be the only choice people have got, particularly rural people. They will not be able to negotiate a lower price by going to another carrier. That is a question I would certainly like answered, because I think it is very important in the competition issue.</para><para>On the issue of untimed local call charges in pastoral areas, et cetera, which we have already asked some questions on, the minister 
 said that it would not be necessary for legislation because the $150 million was a one-off capital injection provided out of the social bonus from the statement. If it was Telstra doing it, it would get the $150 million, but I notice in the statement that the government is going to allow anyone who can bid to provide the service. Then the minister said that a proportion of the actual phone calls will still be timed telephone calls, even though they will be at a new lower rate for consumers in those areas, but that lower rate is not going to be set in legislation. The minister said that it is only generally covered by price caps, but those price cap arrangements are rather flexible. As I understand it, you get some flexibility as a carrier to average out the price. You do not automatically say, `The price cap is X minus the CPI figure for a particular phone call and carriers can take into account their discount amounts, et cetera.' If it were X minus the CPI, I would have thought that over the last few years the price cap for local telephone calls at 25c would have come down a few cents in this time of low inflation.</para><para>What I want to know is what would stop Telstra adjusting the price at some stage in the future? If it is not in legislation, if it is not a disallowable instrument and if it is only covered by a price cap, how do you control it? That was my point before. If I were a National Party senator, at the very least I would have insisted on writing this into the bill, full stop. No matter what they did elsewhere, I would have written this in the bill as an actual amount that could not be changed or increased in any way without referral back to parliament. That is the best protection I could imagine. As I said to Senator Boswell when he was here, I am very surprised they did not take that opportunity.</para><para>Minister, do we have any indication of how much revenue Telstra will lose by the new untimed rates that are being set and also the new lower timed rate? Is Telstra going to put that into the CSO or is it going to take that as a reduction of its profit by having a lower call rate charge and more untimed calls available? They are a number of questions I would like answered. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>5564</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I think the first point was whether there were any technical inhibitions—I cannot read my own writing—in relation to number portability.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>4J4</name.id><name role="metadata">SCHACHT</name><name role="display">Senator Schacht</name></talker><para>—Between the two systems.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>LD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name></talker><para>—Yes.

If you asked me how many people in rural areas make calls of more than 12 minutes, I would have to say I do not know, and I do not suppose anyone can really guess. You just have to test these things in the marketplace, but I would not imagine that it would make any significant difference.

I presume then that 17,000 get no untimed calls at the moment and the other 20,000 have access to some.

 my point. You did not need to have legislation to get an agreement with Telstra. You achieved it by political negotiation with Telstra because you owned two-thirds of the company.

As I just mentioned—although you probably would not have heard it, Minister, because you were talking across the chamber—I am of the view that many of the decisions that you have claimed are your policy in response to the needs of the bush are, in fact, inherently linked to commercial decisions of Telstra. As you have just stated yourself, a capital injection on behalf of the government has been what has determined a further expansion of Telstra's network to improve their market share in these areas. This is despite the fact that previously one of the great issues in the bush of all the competitors is that Telstra already has a structural advantage.</para></talk.start></continue><para>So I am saying yes, we need to enhance services in the bush and Telstra is the unique mechanism to do that while it is in public hands. The minute you privatise it, Minister, it does changes hands and then you start to impact and play a role within the varying competitive pressures within the open market. That contradiction cannot be resolved.</para><para>I want to go to another example where this contradiction is quite inherent. It is worth canvassing, and I did so in previous debate in this place. That is the current arrangements with respect to Telstra in partnership with a number of groups, including those advocates of the technology called Direct PC, Hughes and Ericsson, providing a satellite service to 1,000 rural and regional customers for Internet access via a company established by the National Farmers Federation called Farmwide.</para><para>I want to say a few words about Farmwide in the first instance. First of all, it is achieving its goals. It is getting rural and regional people on-line at less cost than it would otherwise have been. Farmwide is also doing a great service to rural and regional people in exploring their needs and establishing the type of content and the access regime that suits these people.</para><para>I preface my comments with respect to Farmwide in that way because I do not want my comments now to be interpreted in any way as suggesting that the aims and goals of the Farmwide project are anything but of the best intention and of very practical and meaningful support to their customers. But listen to this: the rural and telecommunications infrastructure fund—remember that this was the bribe that was paid out: a $250 million bribe to secure the passage of the one-third sale of Telstra bill—is funding the Farmwide project. It is a project that is handled under the auspices of the National Farmers Federation, which is very reasonably placed to provide services to rural and regional customers, but it is certainly not the only organisation capable of doing so.</para><para>The partnerships in association with the Farmwide project are Telstra-Hughes-Ericsson in the direct PC technology. This is an Internet technology which uses the capability of both the copper network and satellite technology, allowing a high bandwidth download with only a low bandwidth return. This partnership has the greatest strategic value to Telstra, because it gives Telstra access to a potential new market that is currently sought after by the new satellite technology's Internet access.</para><para>There is a fantastic commercial opportunity here for Telstra to participate in that project. Indeed, wasn't it handy for them to be able to get access to RTIF funding through the sale of the first tranche? In fact, it is quite ironic that Telstra had the opportunity to develop this particular technology—direct PC—from a government grant as a result of the payout, the bribe, to allow the one-third sale of Telstra through. I think people can see the irony that I am outlining. The point goes a little further with Farmwide and what is happening with that project. Telstra's Internet product, Big Pond, is the basis of the ISP, if you like, that Farmwide utilises to connect its project clients to the Internet.</para><para>In terms of strategic commercial decisions and partnerships, Telstra and its Big Pond product have recently entered into a partnership with 9MSN. Of course, 9MSN is a partnership between Kerry Packer's PBL and Microsoft Australia. Interestingly, Big Pond-Telstra and 9MSN have reciprocal arrangements in place which mean that everybody who dials up Big Pond—and there are 180,000 subscribers to Big Pond around Australia, and that number is growing—get immediate access to 9MSN. They are not required to subscribe to 9MSN. It is a reciprocal arrangement. In return, Telstra is providing some billing services to 9MSN and there are various other elements of the arrangement.</para><para>Inadvertently, through all these strategic corporate partnerships, there is a wonderful, fantastic commercial opportunity for Telstra lying in the heart of what, on the surface, is sold by this government as government policy on improving access for rural and regional Internet customers. Because of these arrangements, I believe that everyone in the bush who is accessing the Internet in this way is now doing so on a testbed of a commercial venture of the production of Internet-based content through 9MSN. Rather than our seeing publicly funded Internet content, either through the ABC or other national broadcasters, that has cutting edge digital content production, we see a commercial arrangement, such as 9MSN, utilising the backbone provided by our national telecommunications carrier to develop a cutting edge technology and 
 delivery of satellite Internet services to the bush.</para><para>When the minister stands up and says that this social bonus is such a win for the bush and that it has occurred through his efforts to negotiate these outcomes with Telstra, I wonder how captive he is of their boardroom considerations and how long it takes him to convince himself that it is not Telstra's corporate plan and what is going to advantage them commercially. Indeed, it is how you can dress up those strategies and present them to the public in a way that they believe is some form of altruistic government policy.</para><para>This is quite an untenable decision. Unless the public are aware of all the strategic partnerships and alliances that Telstra is currently engaged in, we can never know what is government policy being put in place for the purposes of enhancing the lot of consumers and what is, in fact, a commercial strategy on behalf of Telstra itself.</para><para>I have asked these questions on notice at estimates but, not surprisingly—like most of the questions I have asked that go to the heart of the matter—I do not get a response, or I get a highly inadequate response. Minister: can you provide to this committee some detail about the level of knowledge you have of the commercial considerations of Telstra? I know you are in a position to say what you like, but I think this is a matter of great principle.</para><para>As I have said, Telstra as a corporation have leaned on the fact that they have commercial considerations taken in confidence for their own competitive reasons. That may well mean the public never have the opportunity to assess where they are going with their commercial plans. This conflict is not going to go away without some quite confronting demands being made by the government. I do not believe this government is going to make those demands. They certainly have not indicated that they will to date. I certainly do not think the public will ever know the extent of Telstra's commercial strategic plans as compared with government policy whilst ever we have this coalition government in place and whilst ever Telstra is deadset committed to operating in the private sphere and not in the public sphere.</para><para>My warning goes out to rural and regional Australians and to the members of the National Party who are thinking that they have really extracted a commitment from Telstra. I have to say that relying on a commitment to Telstra in the way that you are over this commitment to untimed calls tells me one thing and one thing only—if you are not legislating along those lines then there is no commercial disadvantage. In fact, it will probably enhance Telstra's position with respect to providing those services in some way or another because, Minister, as you know, that is what competition is all about. They have to position themselves in the most effective way possible. Quite frankly, to do so just because you think it is a good idea does not wash with me or anyone else on this side of the chamber. I am sure that in due course the National Party members will wake up to themselves and realise how they have been duped.</para><para>On the other hand, legislating to provide these services gives a guarantee to Telstra that the government is putting in concrete the required service levels, and then they are able to structure their commercial decisions around it. There is no avenue for recourse other than legislative change. This might prove to be a bit of a shock to Telstra because, to date, they have been able to walk into the minister's office and mould him like clay. They allow him to espouse their views and construct them in such a way that it sounds as though Senator Alston has come up with a great idea for telecommunications policy. As I mentioned in my speech on the second reading, this minister's great strength is how to make a Telstra commercial strategy or a Telstra corporate plan look like government policy. It is a very lazy way to run a portfolio.</para><para>One of the most telling moments about the nature of the relationship between this minister and Telstra will come when there is a change of government, because all those bets will be off. No longer will Telstra be able to work with a compliant minister who is prepared to provide such a grand service to the national carrier as providing the political impetus and political excuses and taking the 
 political heat for any commercial direction that Telstra may choose to go in.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>5570</page.no><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator SCHACHT</name><name.id>4J4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Minister, you gave an answer that the ACCC is still considering the local call price parity measure. I find it extraordinary that, seven months into the year when it has to first operate, they still have not given you a determination. As I understand it, the consumer is supposed to get the benefit of it operating this year—that is, for calendar year 1998. Your second reading speech states that your ministerial determination:</para></talk.start><para>. . . came into effect on 31 December 1997 to enable lower prices for untimed local calls in markets with competition to also be shared by consumers in markets without competition.</para><para>So that means this year. When they finally make the determination, whenever it is, and there is a reduction which might be only ½c or 1c in some markets, how is it going to be passed on to the consumer when they have already paid half their phone bill for the year? They have paid on either a quarterly or a monthly basis. How are they going to get the benefit of it? Is it going to be a rebate system? And so on.</para><para>This is extremely lax for a promise that you fought so vigorously for in the debate on the telecommunications deregulatory bills of March 1997. Yet here we are seven months on from the date the determination came into effect and you have not delivered the consumers one benefit from it. Whether Professor Fels is more interested in chasing wharfies or something, I do not know, but why isn't this being fixed and an averaged figure determined? It should not be waiting on the wit of a mathematician down at the ACCC. Even a reasonable accountant could work out the figuring to see whether something applies. That is one matter I would like to be given more detail on, in view of the fact that you went to such great lengths to convince us—against my amendment—that yours was such a wonderful outcome.</para><para>I also want to ask the minister about the first amendment moved to delete the preamble and in particular where it mentions the `social bonus' in the second paragraph on page 2. Even though you do not know what the figure 
 is, if you are successful with the full privatisation of Telstra, with the sale of the remaining two-thirds, there are suggestions that it may be worth $40 billion over one tranche, two tranches—or it might be more; it might be closer to $45 billion. Has the cabinet determined yet, and thereby the government determined, what percentage of the total proceeds will be allocated to the so-called `social bonus'?</para><para>So far, on my figuring of two of the prongs of Senator Boswell's three-pronged deal that has got the National Party on side, I get that you have spent only $150 million. Telstra is spending all of the $256 million for the mobile phone; that does not have to be paid out of the social bonus. Thus, so far you have bought off the National Party for $150 million. We still have the pitchfork's third prong to come. But I would like to know whether there has been a determination on what percentage of the asset sale would go to the social bonus? I would appreciate those two questions being answered.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>5571</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The ACCC is still considering the precise mechanism.

In other words, you would have Telstra presumably providing a subsidy, a CSO, to the rest of Australia. That is what you would have said. By definition, there was no competition in that marketplace to justify reducing prices. That was an absurd proposition; fortunately, we were able to resist it.

It clearly took the view that, without this funding being available, it was not going to be provided commercially.

Why else would they want good money spent on something that Telstra was about to do anyway?</para></talk.start></continue><para>You asked me to provide my knowledge of Telstra's commercial considerations.

I am not really in a position to tell you how they go about making those sorts of decisions, but all I know is that they would much rather go on making them than have your approach, which is to basically second-guess them; in other words, you tell them what to do. You do not like the idea of their operating commercially, so you would be in there telling them how to run the business. I tell you what: anyone who owns shares in Telstra would be selling off right now if they thought you were about to get into government, because the idea of having shareholder value halve overnight would terrify them.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Senator Margetts interjecting</inline>—</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>LD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name></talker><para>—You have sold yours already, have you?

There has been no particular difficulty about that. The process has been following a normal course. It is not something that you would want to rush into because it clearly has very significant cost implications. I am sure you recall that, when we had the standard telephone service review chaired by Jock Given, we had a dissenting report from Professor Henry Ergas suggesting that it might cost $8 billion for higher levels. As you and I have discussed before,  Telstra has made it plain that you could be spending up to $26  billion if you were to espouse the 64 kilobit level as a mandatory requirement. It clearly has very significant cost implications. It is a matter that we want to get right.

The only one they have got is the $150 million in capital works for cheaper phone calls for the outer zones in rural areas.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The third prong is supposed to be coming. I suspect it is going to have something to do with online digital capacity. The minister abused us two weeks ago for suggesting it could be $26 billion.

 next argument is going to be about how they get the $26 billion.</para><para>Telstra has told him that figure is based on everybody—whether the cable goes past, comes through microwave, comes off satellite or whatever—who has got a modem all choosing together to use full online capacity. The telephone exchanges of Australia would explode or collapse. I have no doubt that this is Telstra's view. To scare the minister initially, they are saying, `We have got to rework every telephone exchange in Australia—every piece of switching equipment, every little switching pillar at the end of the street—to give it the capacity just in case every Australian household switches on the Internet at the same time and goes for full capacity at 64 kilobits.'</para><para>We know that is ridiculous. It will not happen that everybody will switch it on together. But, even if they did, there is the capacity for 96 per cent of Australians to do it now. What would it cost Telstra to meet the demand of 96 per cent of Australians, who have the digital capacity available to them, if they all went out tomorrow and bought a modem and connected themselves to the Internet? We know that Telstra knows that is not going to happen. The entire marketplace is not going to stream out and buy a modem just like that to access the Internet at the same time.

They would say, `Even if it does cost billions of dollars, we will put the infrastructure in because, at a rapid rate, at 15 to 25 per cent return per year, we will get the money back. It will be a magnificent investment.' Telstra would not even blink at the idea if it meant that more and more people were switching on the

 Currently, something like 97 per cent of households have the standard telephone service.

My understanding is that the $26 billion figure that you saw on the slide show—which is apparently the upper estimate; you mentioned the figure of $16 billion in relation to the lower estimate—applies to the mandated service of 64 kilobits per second to people's homes as opposed to the current capability program which is taking ISDN to the exchanges. Therefore, people have the capability, if they so choose, to subsequently connect themselves via ISDN to the exchange.</para></talk.start><para>The point I want to make is that to connect a 64-kilobit line or an ISDN line from your home to the exchange is, in fact, quite a costly exercise in itself. I might be wrong here, but it is my understanding that, because of the nature of that connection and the physical infrastructure, Telstra charges it on 
 a per kilometre or distance based regime. In fact, the further you are away from the exchange the more the ISDN line will cost. This has great implications for rural and regional telecommunications users who wish to have a 64-kilobit connection with their local exchange. Presuming, in the first instance, that you live near one of the 96 per cent of exchanges that have that capability, you also need to connect yourself up. The further away from that exchange you live the greater the disadvantage you have because it will cost you more.</para><para>My question goes to this: to what degree of detail were the National Party—and, through them, their constituents—misled when you talked about a 64-kilobit capability? Was it clear to those people that we were not at the time talking about a mandated standard telecommunications service of this nature to their homes? Was it made explicit to those people that in fact we were not talking about a 64-kilobit service to their homes; we were only talking about upgrading the capability of the exchange to subsequently provide that service to those homes if, indeed, the person had the capacity to pay the connection cost?</para><para>I think these are pertinent questions, particularly in the context of the way the $26 billion figure has been used by Telstra, and certainly by the minister, in providing what they described as a `preposterous' notion to mandate a 64-kilobit service throughout the country. To actually mandate that level of service, apart from the costing analysis that Senator Schacht outlined, the discrepancies between rural and metropolitan areas are absolutely vast. Minister, it would be interesting if, while you are pursuing the answers to Senator Margetts's questions about more detail, you could provide us with a level of detail that would show those costings across metropolitan and rural Australia so that we can see what the split is in that regard. That way, those rural and regional members will actually have an idea of the sort of structural disadvantage they have in seeking equitable telecommunications services.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>23:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>5580</page.no><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator SCHACHT</name><name.id>4J4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The contributions by my colleagues Senator Margetts and Senator 
 Lundy made a point that I agree with strongly. I cannot recollect that, when the opposition raised this issue in the bill in March last year, we talked about mandating 64 kilobits.

I always thought I was very careful—and I am sure I have been—to use the word `capability'. I have never argued that you should make it compulsory for someone to be connected to 64 kilobytes. You make sure the capacity is available and, if the consumer—whether they are domestic consumers, business people or farmers—want to connect, they know that at a reasonable time the capacity is there.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Lundy has pointed out that if you are more than about seven kilometres from the telephone exchange in the bush you cannot get ISDN.

Those states and their citizens are immeasurably better off than those in a place like Tasmania where you are very lucky to even be able to make a phone call if you live in some parts of the west coast; even if you are in the capital city of that state you are very much a second-class telecommunications citizen.</para><para>It is that last part that I really want to go to because later in his contribution, which I will come to in a moment, he commented on the declining quality of service in remote parts of Australia for rural consumers, in particular. That paragraph concluded:</para><para>. . . even if you are in the capital city of that state you are very much a second-class telecommunications citizen.</para><para>That was reported ad infinitum following the deal that Senator Harradine did to give his vote to the government to support the one-third sale of Telstra. The Hobart <inline font-style="italic">Mercury</inline>  of 7 December 1996 stated:</para><para>A spokesman for the Communications and the Arts Minister, Senator Richard Alston, said the $58 million from the Regional Telecommunications Infrastructure Fund was for projects in addition to Telstra's corporate plan.</para><para>Fair enough, but if we were second-class citizens then, the government is asking us now to accept that their proposal for the sale of the remaining two-thirds will mean that these things will change.</para><para>I go to the report entitled <inline font-style="italic">Telstra: to sell or not to sell?</inline> Commitments were put forward by the government with regard to the customer service guarantee, but what has happened since? In the Senate Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts Legislation Committee's 1998 report on the transition to 
 full private ownership, we find the same thing. On the one hand, $3,000 penalties were going to be applied for the non-provision of services, et cetera. However, the report did go on to mention that, ultimately, such penalties could only be applied through the courts. As I understand it, we are talking about $40 per day fines that will get paid to the customer, et cetera.</para><para>I would like to tell the minister for his benefit about a case in Launceston in Tasmania. This has just happened today, after we were supposed to have had some benefit from the $58 million RTIF. A small business set themselves up as an Internet service provider. I know that the minister is aware of this, or at least his office is, because this person contacted the minister's office. The small business wanted to put in place 100 lines and become an Internet service provider. Initially, they ordered 26 lines. They got a call from a Telstra officer who seemed to take great interest in the fact that they had ordered 26 lines. The events that followed went something along these lines.</para><para>The small business explained that they wanted to become an Internet service provider. They were told by this Telstra person that ISPs were now like video shops when they first opened—that is, they were everywhere, but soon the time would come when they would all be out of business and only the big players would be left. The small business went on to order 100 lines so they could provide the service. They were told that that was not possible but they could get 50. When the technician came out to put in the 50 lines—and he actually said he put 50 in—they only ended up with 30. The difference for their business amounts to some $600 per week. There has been no application of a $3,000 fine to them and no real step has been taken by Telstra. Being a small business, they probably do not have the revenue to chase the thing through the courts, so Telstra is not too worried about that, and we will get to their attitude again shortly.</para><para>That was only the start of their problem. Their microlink then mysteriously went off line. They phoned Telstra support in Melbourne—because that is where it now is; it 
 has been transferred out of Tasmania. Telstra support said, `It's got to be your equipment.' They said, `That's not possible because we've checked it all.' They had had it checked by Access One, which was evidently their carrier, and all was fine at their end. Their customers could dial locally and surf the local web pages, which showed that their equipment was fine. The next morning, the microlink suddenly started working again. After a short time, the same thing happened again. They contacted Telstra, which promised to get back to them before 5 p.m. Telstra did not ring back until after 9 p.m., when a technician said that he would come out to do the service but his hours were only between 8 a.m. and 9 p.m and there were huge after-hours fees. They were unwilling to pay those additional fees so they said no. But, mysteriously, the next morning the microlink came back on-line. That is without even getting a technician out there.</para><para>In December 1997, they made a decision to move from Access One to Telstra Internet and applied to become part of Big Pond, though they never signed the agreement. They then found themselves in the situation that Big Pond services were more expensive than another service called Vision Internet, so they phoned Big Pond and said, `We don't want to use you at all,' and they went back to using Vision as a carrier. That is, of course, when their real problems started to occur.</para><para>The current microlink number belonged to Access One, and Telstra needed to change it. Before they did that, however, they installed the new microlink and put things online, but nothing worked. After hours of frustration, they asked the technician to install the new number. Again, nothing worked. This is after they had had some months of successful work from their Internet service, albeit at less than 50 per cent of what they initially wanted.</para><para>They went on to check all of these problems out, and then they contacted Telstra again. The Telstra officer said that they could not be held liable because they have this law that covers them. This law allows them to reach a minimum set of standards, regardless of whether your network has failed due to their error. They are covered by a minimum 
 set of standards. That is what they said. No wonder people doubt, and no wonder we stand here and doubt, the commitment that you say you are going to give, that you are going to install through legislative means. Of course, this is all on the basis that Tasmania was supposed to get an extra $58 million. They were supposed to deliver services over and above what we had ever had before, but it does not seem to be working too well.</para><para>They did contact the minister's office, and something actually happened. I must say that, in part, the minister's office probably needs some congratulations for something happening. But I would ask the minister: on the basis of that example, and that is but one, how can we accept the guarantees with regard to the customer service obligations he says will exist, and this is with regard to only a partially privatised Telstra? How can we possibly even begin to accept that those things are not going to get worse under a fully privatised Telstra?</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>23:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>5584</page.no><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator SCHACHT</name><name.id>4J4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank the department for sending me today at my request the terms of reference of the review.

I am not happy with consistent reports of declining quality of service. Austel reports declining quality of service in rural areas. No-one seems to appreciate this.

Let me tell you what Austel said:</para><para>In general, the more remote parts of Australia have benefited last from the introduction of all types of new technology, and telecommunications has been no exception. Rural consumers in several parts of Australia have expressed concern that their services will not keep pace with improvements.</para><para>It is on that basis that I ask the minister again how we are expected to accept what you said then and what you have said now with regard to the customer service obligation—the obligation that you said would improve with the one-third sale, the obligation that you maintain will improve with a full sale, despite the fact that there have been even more recent reports that say that telecommunication services and the provision of them is declining. You have said nothing here tonight that would ease the concern of Australians with regard to the problems that confront them from time to time. You have said absolutely nothing.</para><para>I gave you an example in the city of Launceston in the `telecommunications backwater', as you referred to my state as being—the state that has the highest unemployment in the country—where people are trying to set themselves up in business under this service provider and cannot get service. I think the minister ought to at least have the decency to get to his feet and explain in plain English 
 exactly how he will enforce the sorts of criteria he says are in this legislation as an obligation to meet the customer service obligations. That is what you have to do, and I need to know that so I can determine how I will vote on this bill at the end of the day. These are the sorts of explanations, Minister, you have to give. It is my role to come in here and ask the questions; it is your role to answer them, so I hope you will get up and do that.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>23:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>5585</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I must say that I was intending to answer Senator Murphy, but I thought Senator Schacht was seeking the call first.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">FAULKNER </name><name role="display">Senator Faulkner</name></talker><para>—I was seeking the call.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>LD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name></talker><para>—You are a Johnny-come-lately.

I do not think the 3,000 figure that was mentioned ever found its way into law. If it did, it would have been by way of a proposition that was subsequently amended because the current maximum level of penalty that can be paid is $25,000. The rebate to which you are entitled for breach of the customer service guarantee is $11.65 for residential customers and $20 for businesses.

Why will things not get worse? I think I have explained to Senator Murphy that not only have they been bad for a period of years, well predating any proposal for privatisation, but also the way to remedy the situation is to impose performance standards to institute a customer service guarantee and to make sure that not just Telstra but all carriers measure up to their social responsibility. It is utterly unrelated to ownership. It is an obligation that the community requires, through the parliament, to be imposed on carriers. We are prepared to upgrade it as many times as is necessary to have them meet that standard, which they have told us they can meet.

You would renationalise Telstra. You would 
 buy it back. I know that is Senator Carr's favourite proposition. You would put a lazy 14 bill on the table and buy it back. You would then get in there and run the business. You would make sure that the boys performed on time and you would have a well-run telecommunications carrier. That is dreamland. It has nothing to do with ownership. It has everything to do with putting standards in place.

In the last two days, the Deputy Prime Minister of Australia, Mr Fischer, has taken over the job of the minister for communications; he has been making all the announcements on why Telstra should be fully privatised. This minister has been despatched to the outhouse. Mr Fischer has been let loose 
 to try to explain how the new mobile telephone system—which is part of the deal—is going to work, and how all the new cheaper phone calls in the outback for the bush are going to work. That is what I say on the point of order. It is completely relevant to talk about Mr Fischer because he has taken over the job of this hopeless minister and is explaining the policy.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>—Order!

I know that Senator Alston finds these issues very embarrassing. But eventually, after the phone link had been re-established, I think Mr Fischer was trying to give further publicity to the announcement of a $150 million package to extend untimed local calls to some people in the bush. That is what it was. As I understand it, it is called `extended zones in remote Australia'.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The issue is—and this is something that Senator Alston has not been honest about—that Telstra, of course, can afford to do that anyway, without being sold, without being fully privatised. Why did not the National Party, as part of the coalition, as part of the Howard government for the past two years, insist to Senator Alston that it be done before now? We know that there is a promise, as I understand it, of a new analog-digital combination system, costing some $400 million. We have already had admissions from senior ministers in the government that that particular initiative, again, was not predicated on the Telstra sale. That is the information we know.
