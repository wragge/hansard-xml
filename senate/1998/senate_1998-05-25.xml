Earlier we had a debate in relation to the Senate being in agreement about the injustice of making a demarcation between living at home and living away from home for over-25s. It would seem logical that we deal with Greens (WA) amendment No. 4, which is the other side of that. It does not fit in with the numbering on the running sheet but I just want to signal that if the Senate wished to deal with those matters now that would be wonderful because it would follow on from the debate we have had already in relation to the maximum rate of Austudy payment. The next debate logically from that would be on rent assistance and the implications of the differences between them. I wonder whether there is any agreement that we deal with that at this stage, rather than waiting till later? It 
 would not make any difference to the outcome but it just seems logical.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>2923</page.no><name role="metadata">Newman, Sen Jocelyn</name><name role="display">Senator NEWMAN</name><name.id>BE4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Social Security</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In times gone by, when we have jumped around on the running sheet, people have become confused.

I might be on the wrong question, but I have had raised with me by some students their concerns about this allowable time for study and the effect some of the interpretations are having on their applications for Austudy. Some people are saying they are being allowed 3½ years of Austudy allowance to study a three-year degree, but they may change their degree course in the process if they find that the course of study they were initially doing is not what they want to do, that it is not a course they are satisfied with. Yet they are being allowed only 3½ years of access to Austudy.</para></talk.start><para>I also know of students who have married in the third year of their course. They will be having to do four years because they changed after the first year of university and were previously not able to access Austudy because of their parents' income and asset level. Now the female finds that because she is married to another student she fits within the independent rate criteria very clearly but she will not be able to access Austudy for the last six months of her course. Her husband is in a similar situation. He had done two years of study previously and will be able to access only 3½ years of Austudy although he has now undertaken a four-year course. They will have a period of six months, before the female of the couple is able to get out into the work force and earn income, when they will have no access to Austudy and limited access to loans and things like that. That is of grave concern.</para><para>I have also had students complaining about the loan situation, in that the female students who apply are treated differently from the 
 male students who apply. There is a situation where twins—a male and a female—are studying. The male proceeded to seek a loan and it was granted overnight with no questions asked and with no major problems. These two people have identical economic set-ups, but when the female applied for a loan it took three weeks to be approved.</para><para>It is of grave concern to everybody, I think, that this sort of thing is happening. Certainly the students are very worried that they are only able to access Austudy for 3½ years. It is possible that they do not have some of the information terribly straight, but I doubt it: these students are involved in student representative council type activities and know their rights, their entitlements. They were most surprised to discover when they got married that the female was only eligible for another 12 months of Austudy, which will not take her through to the end of her degree. For a period of six months neither of them will be eligible for Austudy and neither of them will be able to have another source of income. It is of major concern to them, Minister.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>2924</page.no><name role="metadata">Newman, Sen Jocelyn</name><name role="display">Senator NEWMAN</name><name.id>BE4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Social Security</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I indicated last time we discussed this legislation that the government does not plan to oppose the Democrat amendment, that we do not propose to oppose the next bracket of Opposition amendments on the running sheet, and that we do not propose to oppose the next bracket of amendments by the Opposition, the Democrats and the Greens (WA) in relation to long-term income support for students.</para></talk.start><para>In the interests of speeding up passage of this legislation—if possible before lunchtime—I repeat what I said last time: we are not opposing these amendments.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>2924</page.no><name role="metadata">West, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator WEST</name><name.id>1X4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I just want confirmation, Minister, that the scenarios that I outlined will operate until this amendment is passed.

 there was some concern about how people were notified and what penalties they suffered if there was a failure to comply with that notification. As a result, some changes were made to ensure that there was fairness and that natural justice applied in relation to notification.</para><para>To ensure there is consistency in the notification provisions, these amendments are proposed by the opposition to relate to those people who are presently called recipients of Austudy. This will ensure that their notification provisions are the same as for those people who receive the youth allowance who were not previously called Austudy recipients. This now relates to students who receive youth allowance. I think it will be advantageous ultimately not only for the students themselves who will know what to expect but also for the department which will have one system.

It should be noted that under these amendments rent assistance will be available only to those students over the age of 25 who are living away from their parents' home.</para><para>Under the changes to payments made to students under the youth allowance bill debated early this year, the big carrot was the long-overdue payment of rent assistance to full-time students. The Greens did not agree with many of the regressive changes which were traded off for the provision of student rent assistance, which we did welcome.</para><para>Predictably, the government trumpeted the introduction of student rent assistance as reflective of their commitment to students and delivery of their promises made in opposition. We were chided for any criticisms that were made by Senator Newman in relation to this, but there were many people within the com 
 munity who had very good reasons for not swallowing what the government was trying to do as a package. We are trying here to redress the ridiculous position where a person who begins study when aged 24 years and 11 months and therefore receives youth allowance will be entitled to rent assistance, whereas someone who begins study at 25 years and one month and therefore receives the new Austudy payment contained in the consequential bill will not be entitled to rent assistance. All in all, there will be about 35,000 people around Australia who will be discriminated against by virtue of the fact that they have been unable to begin study until the age of 25. That is absolutely ridiculous and utterly insensitive.</para><para>It is highly ironic that some of the strongest statements about the importance of providing rent assistance to all students are from Senator Newman herself. On 18 June 1997, Senator Newman declared:</para><para>We are treating students and unemployed people on a fair and consistent basis. Payments to students will now be brought up to the level of unemployment payments and students will be eligible for rent assistance. This is long overdue, as Senator Payne mentioned, and desperately needed . . . </para><para>In answer to a question without notice from Senator Abetz, Senator Newman boasted:</para><para>The previous government paid not one cent of rent assistance to students. We are the first government to offer students up to $100 a fortnight to help pay their rent. Their housing costs will fall, not rise.</para><para>In answer to a question from Senator O'Chee on 28 August 1997, Senator Newman predicted that rent assistance would:</para><para>. . . make a massive difference to the living standards of young people who have to go away to study . . . </para><para>During her second reading speech on 2 March 1998, Senator Newman, somewhat dramatically, said:</para><para>How wrong it has been that young unemployed people have had access to that allowance while students have not. We are bringing the students up to the same level. Is that unfair? Is it unfair to anybody? I think not. I cannot understand how you could possibly be criticising it.</para><para>I hope Senator Newman heeds her own words and finds it impossible to criticise the Greens (WA) for proposing that all students, not just 
 those who the government wishes to win over with a flawed youth allowance package, be entitled to rent assistance. I assure all senators in this place that this issue will haunt those who do not support such a basic point of equity. I assure you that a situation in which students of the same age, studying the same course, and in exactly the same financial situation receive payments which differ up to $75 per fortnight will be an ongoing source of justifiable anger, frustration and disillusionment. I urge senators to support the Greens (WA) amendment to allow all students access to rent assistance. After all, isn't consistency what the youth allowance package is supposed to be about?</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>2929</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Democrats have identical amendments to the Greens (WA) amendment and also some consequential amendments, similarly identical, subsequent on how the vote goes on this particular issue and this particular request dealing with the issue of rent assistance.

Despite the quotations that Senator Margetts used from what I have said previously in this chamber, she was referring to what I have said about treating young people under the age of 25 consistently. Of course that is on the youth allowance and that is exactly what we have done.</para></talk.start><para>In this amendment we are now talking about people who are studying, who are of any age over the age of 25 and in different 
 circumstances in their lives. We are not talking here about encouraging young people under 25 to be students rather than be unemployed; we are talking about adults who have been financially independent for some time.</para><para>Our primary purpose when we put together the youth allowance package was to standardise as much as possible the various payments going to young people aged between 16 and 25—as Senator Margetts would know very well—to get rid of those disincentives to study and, of course, to stop young people falling between the cracks.</para><para>So a fundamental part of those reforms had to be providing rent assistance to students for the very first time, and providing pharmaceutical and remote area allowances. Then, when looking at those who were older, the intention was that we would be bringing in the new Austudy payment as a social security payment, but otherwise it would be as similar as possible to the existing Austudy. The intention was that those over the age of 25 would, in the main, neither be winners nor losers from the Austudy payment. So we have maintained the status quo.</para><para>I have not heard Senator Margetts in this chamber in the years she has been here—and she can correct me if I am wrong—claim that those students should be receiving rent assistance. It is suddenly a new-found interest.</para><para>Students over 25 are not losing a cent as a result of the changes to Austudy payment. There is no imperative to pay rent assistance in those cases. Senator Bartlett quite sensibly asked: what is the cost? I do not think Senator Margetts bothers about the cost, but perhaps Senator Bartlett is more concerned. I am advised that the outlay would be $25 million in the first year and then $11 million over each of the following years. So the Greens amendment would cost $60 million over four years, giving older students a benefit they do not currently receive.</para><para>We have maintained a view that the status quo for older students should remain and that is what we have largely delivered here.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>2930</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Senator Newman said I could correct her if she was wrong: she is wrong. 
 Consistently the Greens (WA) have been calling for rent assistance for students based on need.

I think the term used was `cut'.</para></talk.start><para>This is not a change to a benefit that currently exists for students over the age of 25. They do not presently receive rent assistance.

 benefits would be made in the context of our overall policy objectives and would be announced as a total education policy package as part of the opposition's bill, and not in this ad hoc way.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>2931</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The problem of course has been that the way the whole issue of the student youth allowance and student rent assistance was packaged was in fact a trade-off. The benefit, or the carrot at the end of the stick, was the rent assistance, but we all knew that there were other trade-offs.</para></talk.start><para>We had this debate. We looked at the impact for younger people and saw that the government was arguing that as long as it provided this rent assistance then the other things that were happening in terms of the program itself—including the cuts to education funding, the extra costs involved in education and so on—would be compensated. The increasing education costs, such as user pays, extra fees and so on, still exist for students over that age.</para><para>In reality we all know that the government have been arguing that to compensate for all these other things that they have done to reduce their bottom line—and not just this year, but in previous years—the big trade-off or the great, magnificent and magnanimous gesture, was student rent assistance. If you are an older student you are still going to be hit with a lot of user-pays charges.</para><para>Honourable senators will remember the arguments last year that these things had to happen because of the budget black hole. I think Labor should get up and argue now that, because of all those other cuts and increases in expenses for students, the reality is that it makes no logical sense not to extend that benefit to older students. Nobody has given them extra to assist them with the extra fees that they have to pay like anyone else.</para><para>The reality is that those budget cuts were the ones that have taken place over the last few years and this was going to be the reward; this was going to make up for all those other cuts to the education budget that have occurred and that have enabled the big tax give-back that is likely to occur. But no: instead of dealing with the actual justice of 
 the situation—of what is fair and what is not and what people are actually going to have to live on in that situation—they are making artificial distinctions, and that position from the ALP is disappointing. I believe that there were a number of people who contacted the ALP in relation to this—and so they should, because it is a matter one should judge on justice. I believe that $60 million over four years is the very least the government can do to redress some of the problems that have occurred in education. There are very good reasons for that if there are that many people above the age of 25 who are in higher education—and remember that education is a benefit and not a cost to the community.</para><para>I find it quite extraordinary what is being said here. A lot of the arguments that we give here are numbers benefits: `There are only this many,' or `There are too many.' One would think that what we should be dealing with in terms of the effectiveness of spending the community's money—public money; it is not money that belongs to the government—is how we effectively use the resources that are available to reduce the burdens that have been placed on them over time, especially over the last couple of years. So I think the logic is lost. In reality it means that that group of people do not have that sweetener, that carrot, to make up for all those other things that have occurred to them over the last couple of years.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>2931</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to ask the minister a question in order to get the information on the record and to flesh out some of the details we have been talking about.

I would expect to get that information at some time. Part of the issue relates to raising the age of independence and to some of the other aspects that Senator Margetts has been talking about. We have had a lot of cuts from the budget funds available to students, and it would not be inappropriate for some of that money to come back towards providing equal treatment for people. I am not sure what the precise change in circumstances is when people turn 25 so that those issues of having a disincentive to study which the minister has rightly addressed in terms of younger people should not also be applicable to people once they turn 25. There has been a lot of commentary these days about the importance of people being able to re-skill themselves. I think that that is an issue that applies to people of any age, not just in the earlier stages of their life.</para></talk.start><para>It is also important to emphasise that it is not simply a matter of consistency for the sake of consistency or of throwing $60 million at a certain group of people over four years because it looks nice. It is an issue of a basic amount for people to live on. It is probably appropriate to remind senators of the figures in relation to the poverty line. As my colleague Senator Stott Despoja has mentioned already in this debate, the Melbourne Economic and Social Research Institute set the poverty line, as at December last year, for a single person, including housing, at a little over $200 a week. At that time the unemployment benefit was $160.75 a week. Average rent assistance available to these people was $37 a week and that brought the total benefits available to an unemployed adult to a couple of dollars below the poverty line.</para><para>However, those students who are in the situation that these amendments relate to will 
 not have access to rent assistance; we will be leaving them in a situation where they will be significantly below the poverty line. And that is the basic issue here. That is a benchmark that we should continually refer to when looking at what people have available to them to enable them to live. We are trying to encourage people to access education and increase their skills to be able to make a more effective economic and social contribution to our community, but we are putting them in a situation where they are significantly below the poverty line. That is a situation that the Democrats believe is far from acceptable. We urge other parties to examine that in the context of these amendments proposed by the Greens (WA) and the Democrats.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>2932</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The figures that I have received, and the minister may correct me if I am wrong, indicate that something like 43,000 students are likely to be impacted by this level of discrimination.

You have then got 10,400 customers per year because the youth allowance students who subsequently turn 25 will remain on youth allowance entitlements until they finish their course. I would not want it to be misread as somehow there are a whole lot of people who are going to drop out. It is a question of people who were on youth allowance at the age of 25 who will remain on youth allowance.

In particular, the amendments seek to address the situation where a person earns a significant proportion of their allowable $6,000 additional earnings in the period before their student income bank, which currently begins with a balance of zero. Considering the amount of uncertainty there is for students, of course students have to take whatever opportunities present themselves and that obviously includes the gap between when they are working and when they are studying, or from when they have left school or whatever. It does not make any sense for students not to be able to support themselves, especially when it might be difficult to find means of support during that time.</para><para>If a person earns a significant proportion of their allowable $6,000 additional earnings in the period before their student income bank, which currently begins at a balance of zero, 
 they have to wait for it to build to a sufficient level so as not to affect their payments. This does not relate much to the real world. At present the student income bank actually acts as a disincentive to students taking up work in the period before their student income bank has accrued sufficient credit. Of specific concern are those students who will be taking up work in the upcoming vacation period, this July, who may unknowingly jeopardise their payments by earning more than has accrued in their student income bank but far less than the $6,000 they are currently allowed.</para><para>I would think that most people would think that this would be a good thing, students getting some experience in the world and students being able to provide a little bit in case of emergency, because we all know that the emergencies that occur in life are not necessarily ones that can be dealt with with $100 or $150. Some of them, if they are means of transport or something that happens at home or even some health issues that are not covered by health insurance and so on—and heaven knows how few students can afford health insurance—can result in a situation which is very problematical.</para><para>The Greens (WA) amendment seeks to remedy this problem by starting the student income bank at $3,000 for all those who come onto the youth allowance or Austudy payments. I believe every senator could think of a situation where this should apply. It is reasonable for students to be able to work during vacations and average that out over a year, but to suggest also that they have to start from an assumed balance of zero does not make any sense whatsoever. The reality is that a lot of the income earning opportunities are very lumpy.</para><para>I know from my own experience—when I was putting myself through university—work could be three hours an evening pulling beer in an English pub. I am sure there must be those in Australia who can understand that waitressing or doing other kinds of jobs accessible to students is not necessarily going to provide you with the income you need for, for example, technical equipment or just things necessary for living. I have mentioned the situation where you might get pulled over 
 by the constabulary who measure your tyres and say, `Look, only one of your tyres actually has the right amount of tread on it. You are going to have to get three new tyres,' and so on. These are not extraordinary kinds of expenses. It might be that someone has purchased an old car—if they have not got public transport—and suddenly the engine goes, or something else, and a major overhaul is needed.</para><para>It is not reasonable to suggest that you can accept the need for students to be able to use their vacation opportunities, where they have them, to earn that little bit of fall-back income to be able to provide some of the needs that will not be covered by the student income which the government provides to—as the government calls them—customers. Those people absolutely need that assistance but may need other things from time to time. This is the normal way of life.</para><para>We are not talking about large amounts of money. We are not talking about millionaires. We are not talking about people who can throw $50,000 around at the drop of a hat. We are talking about the ability of a person to be able to average out $3,000 as a starting balance. They are not cheating. They are not doing anything wrong, I argue. Simply by allowing some commonsense to prevail, you can assume that they can have up to half of the student income bank already in the bank when they start their year. I cannot understand why this would not be acceptable.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>2935</page.no><name role="metadata">Neal, Sen Belinda</name><name role="display">Senator NEAL</name><name.id>B36</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This is a problem that the opposition also recognises. With the changeover, students under 25 who were previously receiving Austudy go onto the youth allowance and those who are over 25 go onto the new form of Austudy. As part of this package of changes, there has been a transfer from a means test that previously was based on annual income to one based on a fortnightly income test. That puts it in line with many other social security payments. We have had the discussion before about the consequence of that and some of the benefits and some of the adverse effects. I will not canvass those again.</para></talk.start><para>But a difficulty has been created, particularly with the introduction of the income bank 
 in the middle of the year and when many students are in the middle of a holiday period.

Certainly we would not want to see that happen.</para><para>But the remedy being proposed by the Greens is a bit of a blunt instrument. In fact, it far exceeds what is necessary to remedy this particular problem. The effect of doing what is set out in the Greens' request would be to give the capacity for students to earn virtually any sort of income for about a six-month period, and we do not believe that is appropriate in the circumstances. We are moving our own request for amendment, which I think is the last item—request No. 1—listed on sheet 986. This will have the effect of giving a credit of $3,000 only to those people who were previously on Austudy and are now either transferring to the youth allowance or the new Austudy. This remedies the existing problem while at the same time not exceeding what is required to remedy the problem of that group of people. The opposition will be opposing this request proposed by the Greens, but we will putting forward our own request in similar terms later in the debate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>2935</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I indicate the Democrats' support for this amendment which probably will not get up.

That obviously is a problem—it is a problem that 
 will not be solved even by announcing over loudspeakers or on television that it is no longer reasonable or that there is no longer any expectation that students can earn income over the Christmas holidays and so on. There is going to be a problem because not everybody will know.

Our amendment will deal exactly with that position. The difficulty is that there was an income bank previously but, because the means test was based on your annual income, you could earn a lot during holiday periods—up to $3,000—and it did not affect your capacity to receive Austudy. The means test is now based on your fortnightly income. So, if you happen to look at the most recent fortnightly period when you, as a student, may have been working full time during the holidays, you might have found that you 
 exceeded the means test and would not receive Austudy.</para></talk.start><para>To remedy that unnecessary or unfair imposition, the government allowed the provision of an income bank so that, if you earned less than the income level, you could get a credit so that when you made up for that lost income—and maybe over a holiday period—you would not lose out. Because this bill is to take effect in the middle of the year—and in fact in the middle of a holiday period—most people will be starting their fortnightly income test during a period when they may well be earning quite substantial amounts of money, as students tend to do when they work full time during holiday periods. Our amendment is aimed at ensuring that students on very low incomes who had been studying earlier in the year and who, if the scheme had started on 1 January, would in fact have earned some sorts of credits, are not adversely affected just because this scheme has come into effect in the middle of the year and in the middle of a holiday period.</para><para>The opposition's amendment clearly deals with that problem. Any statement by Senator Margetts that the opposition is not dealing with this problem or is acting inequitably is completely unfounded. Frankly, as a member of the opposition, I find it quite offensive that, despite my attempt to explain the position to Senator Margetts, she feels the need to state that our position is otherwise. Our view is that those students in that position should not be adversely affected and our amendment is directed to remedying it. We do not support an unfair position which gives credit to those who have not been living in circumstances where they would have otherwise received a credit.</para><para>Senator Margetts is putting forward the proposal that those people who, if the scheme had started on 1 January, would not have earned any credits at all should just receive this windfall of credits notwithstanding. We will not go that far.

We are saying that perhaps $3,000 of that $6,000 might already be there, which still only gives them the chance to earn $3,000 during that year.

 of payment for Austudy. The rationale for agreeing to remove that injustice was consistency. Of course, that was most welcome and not only because it removed the injustice for about 1,000 people waking up to $90 less per fortnight from 1 July, but also because it recognised how ridiculous it was for those over 25 to receive a reduced amount of income because they happen to live in their elderly parents' home.</para><para>Greens (WA) amendment No. 4 extends the logic of the amendments which have already been agreed to. The ALP and others have correctly argued—and the government has accepted—that, if you are 25 or over, it should make no difference whether you live at home or not. That was done for the argument of consistency. However, the amendments that have been agreed to do not address that, in the future, many students over 25 will be in receipt of youth allowance—though I always thought that was a bit odd. I do believe that perhaps an over-25-year-old is not a youth in any legal sense, but they still receive the youth allowance, not the new Austudy payment.</para><para>The Senate would be aware that, if you begin study when 23 or 24, you stay on the youth allowance until you finish your course, which could be when you are 27 or 28. If the Senate wishes to be consistent—and this is what the youth allowance is supposed to be about—then those students 25 years or older who happen to be on youth allowance, should not be subject to a reduced living at home rate either. If this Senate is going to say to Austudy payment recipients, `Okay, you're 25; it doesn't matter whether you live at home or not.' it should logically and fairly extend the same argument to those over 25 who happen to be on youth allowance. </para><para>As the rent assistance issue has shown, there has been far too much inconsistency with these measures. The inconsistency is usually argued on the basis of bottom line and, where it happens to be cheaper to be consistent, funnily enough, it is argued on the basis of consistency. One group of students is being granted a benefit which other students are denied, and we argue on an arbitrary basis. Let us not compound the problem on 
 this issue.

I find it interesting that the same argument is being used on this inconsistency as has been used on a number of the gay and lesbian issues that have been brought up in terms of actual rationality and fairness. Any time we have chosen to amend a bill on the basis of commonsense and what potentially is, I would think, the policies of the Labor Party—that is, to provide for reasonable education opportunities, equity and fairness, and so on—somehow or another, amending a bill, in context, is ad hoc.

The return of that passport follows representations made by this government to the Spanish government. It was understood that Mr Skase would have to submit a passport when applying for the renewal of his residency permit in Spain, and we understand that his residency permit expired on 13 May. In expectation of the possibility that Mr Skase would nonetheless put his cancelled passport in as a means of seeking to apply for an extension of his residency permit, we asked Spanish authorities, should that happen, to seize the passport and return it to us. Spanish authorities complied with that request, and the Australian government is grateful for that cooperation from them.</para></talk.start><para>We have asked the Spanish authorities to refuse Mr Skase's application to renew his residency permit, and Spain is still considering that request. The confiscation of the passport does make life more difficult for Mr Skase. He may find it more difficult to renew his Spanish residency, unless he has a passport from another country—that is, unless in the meantime he has managed to acquire dual citizenship or manages to produce illegal documents that are not spotted as being illegal documents. However, whether we can renew his Spanish residency is a matter for the Spanish authorities, and we await their decision. No-one should be under the misunderstanding that this means Mr Skase will return to Australia. It does not mean that, but it does make it very difficult for him to stay in Spain, and it makes it more difficult for him to travel elsewhere.</para><para>There have been reports that Mr Skase can nonetheless travel freely in the European Union without a valid Australian passport. The practicality of that may be true; the legality might be otherwise. There are European countries that require visas from some nations and not from others. In order to demonstrate that you do not need a visa, you may need a passport—to demonstrate that, for example, you are an Australian, for example, 
 and therefore do not need a visa. Mr Skase is no longer in possession of such a passport, and that could create a significant difficulty for him. Equally, with his Spanish residency now in doubt, that may make travel through Europe even more difficult. If Mr Skase chooses to travel out of Spain, where he now rests comfortably in the knowledge that Labor failed in the extradition process and that that extradition process cannot be renewed, it would give us an opportunity to try an extradition process from another country. We would look forward to his travelling out of Spain.</para><para>The comparison with Labor is fairly clear. The coalition government continues to show a commitment to doing all it can to secure Skase's return to face trial on serious corporate crime charges. We have renewed court action to seize Skase's assets. We have had Skase's passport both cancelled and returned to Australia. In comparison, under Labor Skase was allowed to leave Australia. They failed in their attempt to extradite him back from Spain. They even renewed his passport while he was living in Spain. Labor in opposition has obstructed our attempts to secure the assets. This is the passport that Labor renewed. This is the passport they failed to cancel. This is the passport we cancelled. This is the passport we have had returned.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Centrelink</title><page.no>2945</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>2945</page.no><name role="metadata">Collins, Sen Jacinta</name><name role="display">Senator JACINTA COLLINS</name><name.id>GB6</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is directed to the Minister for Social Security.

We believe, on the best advice available to us, that it has given the species its greatest chance of survival in that region.</para><para>The honourable senator should also be aware that gill netting is only one of the activities that prejudices dugong. Other matters that concern them are, obviously, pollutants washing offshore and significant natural events. If Senator Woodley is interested in this matter, he would know that, in some of the areas of significant decline, it has occurred after major natural events that have had a detrimental effect upon the seagrasses. They are also affected by boat strikes and we have taken certain action in that regard as well. In other words, we have sought to look at the range of activities that detrimentally affect the dugong and we have introduced restraint in one of the key areas in which we believe we can influence a better outcome and that is, as the honourable senator has said, in relation to gill netting.</para><para>We are very pleased that not only were we able to take up this initiative, but also we were able to put it into action within a very short period of time.

There is no doubt that the Asian crisis has caused problems to the coal industry. It is not just the Asian financial meltdown but also some uncertainty about the future of demand created by the signing-on of the greenhouse gas emissions at the Kyoto conference. In some aspects the Asian crisis has opened up opportunities for what is our biggest export industry. One of the things we did as a government that has helped that has been the removal of the export controls. The export controls forced our major buyers overseas—whether it be Japan, Korea or Taiwan—to diversify their source of supplies to other countries. It was at some cost to those countries—particularly with a Labor government in power as they could not trust that government not to lower the boom on them in difficult times. The sole purpose of removing those controls was to say to overseas customers, `You no longer have to diversify between countries; you can now diversify within a country and that country should be Australia.' That is what we are doing to help promote the industry and in the difficult times it is encountering to improve the job opportunities within this industry.</para></talk.start><para>Yes, we did say that they should look at new and emerging markets. It is important for the industry from an Australian point of view to diversify its markets. We also made the point that they should participate in more energy efficiency type programs.

 encouragement of overseas buyers also to participate in those particular programs.</para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>2950</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Madam President, I ask a supplementary question.

The fact is that we are very much committed to lower CD prices. Of course, the ACA agrees with us in spades.

The Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics and the ACCC have both spelt out on a number of occasions how prices will fall as a result of this approach, and Woolworth's told a Senate committee recently that our plans would lead to reductions of between 25 and 30 per cent in the retail price of CDs. Sanity made similar comments. The ACA survey indicates that, of 22 consumer organisations in Europe, Asia and America, our CDs are about $6 higher by price than world standards.</para></talk.start><para>It ought to be fairly clear, Madam President, that we are on the side of the angels on this one. But let me just tell you who isn't. Let me tell you who launched their anti-cheaper CDs policy yesterday: Mr Beazley. Mr Beazley started off by saying this:</para><para>I'm not going to pretend to be an expert about contemporary Australian music. 
</para><para>Not a bad start; not a bad studied insult if you really want to rub it into them in the lead-up to an election.

He went on to say:</para><para>I know what it takes to set up a small business.</para><para>Of course he does. He was the finance minister when he put in place record deficits. He not only set them up, he king hit them, and small business is only just starting to recover. If we look at what the policy goes on to say, we see that it says this:</para><para>In government we will assist the industry by ensuring that the ban on parallel imports remains in place, but in return we will ask the major record companies to increase their production and promotion of contemporary Australian music.</para><para>How cynical can you get? What an absolute joke. More than 12 months before the 1996 election, they got the industry supposedly signed up on an industry assistance package of $270 million. I have got to say that is despite the best endeavours of people like Senator Cook, who were violently opposed to this approach because they knew the record industry's track record. What happened? The record industry never delivered; they welshed. Over a 15-month period they never delivered. And to think that the ALP's policy now is to ask the record industry to increase its production and promotion. It really just shows you what a hollow charade this is. They are going to encourage local commercial radio stations to play more contemporary music, then they introduce a backdoor arrangement in terms of a quota that will actually result in less.</para><para>It gets worse. They go on and pledge themselves to a contemporary music development fund, $6 million over four years. Is this in addition to or in replacement for our contemporary music development fund, which is already funding people to go offshore, and our expansion of the Playing Australia and the festivals initiatives, which again are designed to assist?</para><para>This policy is really one that is demonstrating beyond doubt that the Labor Party has learned nothing from the last election. They are captive to elites. They are simply determined to ensure that one particular group 
 does better than the rest. One thing is absolutely for sure: the ALP will get much more out of the record industry and its record profits than will contemporary music artists. All I can say in conclusion is that I have to agree entirely with Senator Schacht when he said a couple of years back:</para><para>The Australian Record Industry Association, which has been conducting what I can only call a wicked campaign of misinformation about what would happen if changes to parallel imports were allowed in the record industry . . . which in my view has been putting forward some demonstrably false claims.</para><para>He said it all.

Legal aid however, continues to be available for matters where there are differences of judicial opinion which have not been settled by the Full Court of the Federal Court or the High Court, or where proceedings seek to challenge the lawfulness of detention.</para><para>The changes made to the guidelines for legal aid funding in refugee matters recognises that Australia has a world class system for determining claims for Australia' s protection and that genuine refugees need only be able to relate their story to officers of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs or to the Refugee Review Tribunal. This is not "a complex legal system" and legal expertise is not necessary in order for applicants to present their claims for protection.</para><para>(2) The figures available to us do not support Senator Harradine' s estimate. I am advised that legal aid commissions spent an estimated $1.35m on refugee matters in 1995/96. This is in addition to the $1.89m available annually to assist visa applicants eligible under the Immigration Advice and Application Assistance Scheme administered by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs.</para><para>The Government' s intention in introducing the new legal aid guideline is to ensure that legal aid funds are not spent on the unnecessary duplication of services already provided through the Department 
 of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. We accept that the new guidelines may result in legal aid commissions doing less work on refugee matters. However it is too soon to conclude that the effect will be to reduce the availability of advice services for asylum seekers.</para><para>The intention of the new guideline is to enable the redistribution of scarce legal aid resources so that, from the Attorney's point of view, more legal assistance can be directed to matters of priority to the Commonwealth arising under Commonwealth law.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>WATERFRONT REFORM</title><type>Miscellaneous</type><page.no>2955</page.no></debateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>2955</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I seek leave to make a short statement on behalf of myself and Senator Hill.</para></talk.start><para>Leave granted.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>LD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name></talker><para>—On Wednesday, 13 May, the Senate agreed to a motion moved by Senator Murray for the production of various documents relating to waterfront reform.

What Senator Murray does with that statement is a matter for him, but all it is indicating is that the government has the entire matter under review, including whether or not any documents may or may not be able to be released at a later point in time.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>2955</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I must say I interpret the minister's statement, and I heard most of the original statement by Senator Alston, much 
 differently from the way Senator Murray has interpreted it. The opposition, through Senator O'Brien, a long time ago moved two returns to order for the production of documents in the Senate. Both of those found majority support amongst senators in the chamber and the government has consistently refused to comply with those orders of the Senate. Senator Murray's subsequent motion—which also found majority support within the Senate—for production of documents appears to me to have had a response that is not dissimilar to the one that was the government's approach to the first two motions that were agreed to that stood in the name of Senator O'Brien.</para></talk.start><para>The point needs to be made that we have a situation where well in excess of $1 million of public money has been spent on a variety of reports and consultancies in relation to the waterfront. Those consultants' fees and those reports that have been produced for government, only a small proportion of which have been made available for senators to peruse, I think ought to be quite clearly made available for the benefit of the parliament and the benefit of the public.</para><para>We believe that the Australian people are entitled to see how the government has spent this money. We are very concerned about the use of taxpayers' money for what we believe is blatantly political market research, public misinformation and public relations campaigns. We believe that these consultancies, campaigns and reports ought to be made available.</para><para>Of the consultants to the government on the waterfront, we have had Mr Paul Houlihan, who is a former IR specialist with the National Farmers Federation and director of P&amp;C Stevedores, and that consultancy was $20,000. We have had two reports from ACIL Australia, and the second ACIL Australia report included a number of subcontracts. Those subcontractors involve people like Mr Mark Textor, the Liberal Party polling consultant, and Jonathan Gaul of Canberra Liaison. We have the consultancy of Dr Stephen Webster on Mr Reith's staff, that of Dr John Davies and a range of other legal and media consultancies that have been paid for by taxpayers 
 that have obviously been fundamental in the government developing its waterfront strategy. The opposition continues to say we are entitled to sight, given their significance in relation to public policy in this country and given their significance in the development of Mr Reith's and Mr Howard's strategy on the waterfront.</para><para>We do know at a minimum that at least $1,191,989 has been paid to a range of consultants for a range of consultancies that we know have been contracted by this particular government. We say that the vast majority of those that have not been made available for parliamentary and public perusal ought to be. I interpret Senator Alston's statement to the Senate very differently from Senator Murray. As far as the Labor Party is concerned, we have made it absolutely clear what our view will be. Contingent on the government's failure to provide this material, which we believe is in the public interest and in the parliament's interest—if that material is not provided—the opposition will be proceeding with its proposal to establish a select committee into why that material has not been provided and a range of other matters in relation to the waterfront dispute.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>2956</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—Thank you—</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>N26</name.id><name role="metadata">ABETZ</name><name role="display">Senator Abetz</name></talker><para>—Oh, no!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3M6</name.id><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name></talker><para>—Thank you Madam President, and I thank the Senate, with the exception of Senator Abetz, who, I think, disagrees.

I have in my possession a copy of an animal quarantine policy memorandum, under AQIS's letterhead, dated 18 May and under the signature of Dr Sarah Kahn, Assistant Director, Animal Quarantine Policy Branch, in which AQIS was seeking comments on a proposed approach to a review of quarantine policy on the importation of pig meat. Amongst other things, that document says:</para><para>AQIS intends to conduct a quarantine import risk analysis (IRA) which will consider the importation of pig meat from any source, ie a generic IRA.</para><para>The IRA will include assessment of all potential disease agents that may be introduced to Australia via the importation of pig meat, including human and animal pathogens.</para><para>AQIS was seeking comment on the proposal. It is interesting that the return date for comment on that proposal was 18 June, and I am given to understand that the intention was to 
 proceed. Senator Parer did not say that the minister had asked AQIS not to proceed, and certainly the memorandum that I have was not directed to the minister but to members of the industry, the National Farmers Federation, the EU delegation, state and territory veterinary officers, et cetera. So what we have now is that either AQIS has, prior to the closing deadline for its own memorandum, made a decision and conveyed it to the minister or it has made a quick political decision and decided that it was not politic for this matter to be in the public domain at the moment.</para><para>It is of concern to the Labor Party that everyone except the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and the Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer) appreciates the gravity of the situation currently facing the pork industry. The Senate does because it supported my motion on 7 April to investigate the impact of the flood of imports on domestic prices. State ministers for agriculture certainly do. They have been pressuring Mr Anderson to move quickly to protect the interests of pork producers and those who depend on that industry for their livelihoods. The Liberal and National Party backbench certainly appreciates the gravity of the situation. Members and senators know first-hand just how bad the situation is because of the pressure that is being applied in their own electorates. They had in excess of 40 people at their committee meeting a couple of weeks ago interested to hear pork producers. Even the personal staff of the Prime Minister do because they have been ringing producers direct to find out what is going on.</para><para>The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy needs to understand that government action in support of the pork industry is time sensitive. Mr Anderson does not have the luxury of directing agencies to inquire into this matter at their leisure. He does not have the luxury of having the Rural Adjustment Scheme Advisory Council travelling around looking at the state of the industry and then spending weeks preparing a report that is handed to him for consideration and to then spend weeks looking at that. The intensive nature of the industry means that Mr Anderson must act, and must act now.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>EP5</name.id><name role="metadata">FERGUSON</name><name role="display">Senator Ferguson</name></talker><para>—What would you do?

If the current prices mean that the average producers are losing, then lose they will: I am told that producers are losing around $1,200 a week. It is not like waiting for rains before you plant a crop, or holding your cattle until the price picks up, or storing your woolclip until the prices improve. I think the Senate has taken action to get the minister to do something. Unfortunately, the minister has chosen to act in a rather slow fashion; so slow that he has infuriated this industry Australia wide. My office has had a lot of calls about the problems this industry is facing. No doubt coalition senators are receiving the same sorts of calls and hence the concern of some of the coalition backbenchers because there will be pressure from their electorates. Pork producers are seeing this government as a government of inaction; a government that will not do what is necessary to give them some temporary relief, as is permitted under the GATT rules.</para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>2958</page.no><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator ABETZ</name><name.id>N26</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I think the Senate just heard a very well-prepared speech but one that was very poorly delivered by Senator O'Brien.</para></talk.start><para>Yes, we on the government side are receiving representations about the difficulties currently being faced by the pig industry. But you have to ask the questions: how come? And why are these difficulties being experienced? It should be remembered that, prior to 1990, Australia's quarantine protocols prohibited imports of live pigs and fresh or processed pig meat except for canned hams and some imports of fresh pork. Imports of uncooked, frozen Canadian pig meat have been permitted since July 1990.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>EP5</name.id><name role="metadata">FERGUSON</name><name role="display">Senator Ferguson</name></talker><para>—Who allowed it in?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>N26</name.id><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator ABETZ</name></talker><para>—Senator Ferguson asks, rhetorically: who allowed this to occur? It was the Labor Party whilst in government. It was before your time, Senator O'Brien, and so you might not have realised that what you were stumbling into was in fact a very harsh 
 criticism of the way your former Labor government did business in relation to these matters. The problems that we are experiencing today relate quite clearly to the changes that were made during the previous regime.</para></talk.start></continue><para>A lot has been said about the Canadian pig imports, and import levels are small in absolute terms. For 1996-97, for example, they represented 5.36 per cent of domestic consumption, albeit that the high value leg market represented some 27.14 per cent. So there are clearly some difficulties.</para><para>Yet in recent months import levels have decreased substantially from an average of 1,065.85 tonnes per month for the December 1997 quarter to an average of 604.48 tonnes per month for the March 1998 quarter. This suggests that the current drop in pig meat prices may well be attributable to a range of factors and not solely caused by pig meat imports.</para><para>Indeed, if we have a look at the other side of the equation, it is very interesting to see that, in dollar terms, pig meat exports seem to be outweighing pig meat imports. The value of exports to Japan, for example, rose from $1.7 million in 1996 to $15.2 million in 1997. But this, of course, reflected the difficulties that Taiwan was having.</para><para>Further, Woolworths has recently announced that it has contracted to supply a Japanese customer with pork valued at $20 million per year; and exports to the Russian Federation have also been increasing steadily. What is more, Mr Fischer has just led a trade delegation to the Russian Federation, and representatives of the industry joined with that delegation with a view to increasing sales to the Russian Federation.</para><para>In the period July 1997 to February 1998, Australian pork exports, including wild pig, were valued at $40.3 million, still in excess of the rising value of imports for the same period of $28.9 million. For the benefit of Senator O'Brien, they are figures sourced from the Australian Pork Corporation. So there are a number of issues.</para><para>One issue that is of real importance in this whole debate is product labelling—something that the Labor government never got together, 
 but which we have. We are now pursuing truth in labelling, under the Trade Practices Act, to clarify claims of product of Australia. I am sure that the Australian consumer will benefit from that legislation and, more importantly, so will the pig producers in this country.</para><para>The real difficulty that Labor faces in this debate is that they are trying to make cheap political capital out of a situation which has been occasioned by the Labor Party's embrace of protocols which were entered into prior to this government coming into office.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:25:00</time.stamp><page.no>2959</page.no><name role="metadata">Woodley, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WOODLEY</name><name.id>HX5</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I listened very carefully to Senator Abetz, and I guess the pig council listened very carefully too—and I am sure that they are convinced there is no problem.

This problem is the issue of unpackaged pork, and that will not be covered by labelling laws—even though Senator O'Chee has said that it will be covered by the middle of 1998.

We need to look at this in its total context and in terms of the source of the problem we have today.

That is where the fundamental problem lies today in terms of the importation of pork into this country.</para></talk.start></continue><para>There is another aspect we need to look at very carefully when we deal with this. I am sure Senator O'Brien, although his adviser may not be up to it in terms of that, is sensible enough to realise that the collapse in the beef market and the collapse of the lamb market are having a far greater impact on the 
 price of pork today than any import into this country at this particular time.</para><para>While we continue to have the current situation in Indonesia and a huge surplus of cattle in the north of this country, the pressure on all prices, whether lamb, pork or anything else, is going to be extreme for a considerable period of time. But can I deal with a couple of the issues here. It was certainly believed in terms of the GATT round and what occurred then that it was important to put some rules around agriculture. That was sought right across this country by all major political parties—I will not include some of the minor political parties in this, because they were not part of it. But the previous government fell down in three major areas. One was the emergency WTO safeguards.

It must be recognised that, in total world terms, we export five times the amount of food we import and, with Canada, four times more meat than we import from them. Where Senator Woodley was very misleading in terms of his comments is that there is no tariff or any barriers against pork into Canada. You could export pork into Canada tomorrow, if you wanted to put things together and go and do it. Whether or not you would make any money doing it is another question. But that can be done tomorrow.</para><para>The full range of the products that we are exporting to Canada through the NAFTA arrangements must also be recognised. The recent announcements on wool, for example, have been very beneficial and will be very beneficial in the future. When we look at other aspects in terms of beef, we see we have an oversupply on the domestic market in Australia right now. If we were to move to 
 restrict pork, what do you think the Canadians would do? They would immediately restrict our beef going into Canada. What would happen from that? You would have even more beef on the domestic market and even more depression of the prices than we have now. So there has to be a bit of commonsense and rationality on this.</para><para>We have to resist taking a political swipe when a much more commonsense approach to the problem needs to be adopted by everybody in this chamber. Senator O'Brien, we supported your motion in a sensible and proper manner. You need to work on solutions to the problem. Let me deal with three of them. We are activating immediately these exceptional circumstances, and that is being fast tracked through the process. Right now, as has already been mentioned, we have moved on the implementation of truth in labelling. Why haven't you people on the other side of the chamber done something since 1990 on truth in labelling?</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>8O6</name.id><name role="metadata">O'BRIEN</name><name role="display">Senator O'Brien</name></talker><para>—We did.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>UW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Crane, Sen Winston</name><name role="display">Senator CRANE</name></talker><para>—You did not. Let us go a bit further. We have brought in—and it is before this place right now—countervailing and anti-dumping legislation. That is being done right now by this government. You should have been dealing with these issues, as a walk through, when you negotiated the changes. You have left half the job undone. We have had to pick that up. That is the fundamental problem we have in terms of this today, combined with the collapse in the other areas of the meat market. If you do not believe it has collapsed, just go to a lamb sale and see how the price of lamb has gone down; go into a butcher shop or to one of the major retailers and see what the pricing structure is today. Beef is meeting the market. Beef has gone under the price of pork. What are consumers doing? They are buying beef in preference to pork. That is a major problem, combined with a major increase in production. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>2961</page.no><name role="metadata">Murphy, Sen Shayne</name><name role="display">Senator MURPHY</name><name.id>FX5</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We are taking note of the answer to the question asked by Senator O'Brien with regard to why AQIS is commencing import

What obligation is AQIS under, given the current circumstances? I suggest they are not under any obligation; they are probably being directed by this minister, a minister from the National Party, who is supposed to represent all interests in rural Australia and is simply not doing the job. He is being criticised not only by the pig industry but also by a whole range of other people  within the agricultural sector. Senator Abetz wanted us to believe that, somehow, because we are improving our exports of pork, everything is okay. But that is not the case.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The other adage that this government seems to use because it does not really want to accept its responsibility as being a government is, `Don't blame us, blame them. They didn't do anything for 13 years.' With regard to the pig industry and the labelling issue on which they say we did nothing, I say we did do something. We had an agreed set of rules—something the industry supported. We would have had them implemented but we had an election. You won government and you would not front up to your responsibilities—and you scratched them.</para><para>Two years on they say, `Oh, we've done something. We're about to introduce into the parliament a new bill on labelling laws.' Two years! Likewise, anti-dumping and countervailing. What have you done as a government? We have had to drag you up to the line on every occasion on industry policy. It does not matter whether it is the car industry, the textiles, clothing and footwear industry or in this case the pig industry, we have had to keep dragging you up to the line.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—Order!

As I said, we have had to keep dragging this government up to the line to get them to take some action rather than constant 
 ly carping, `Well, blame them over there.' The fact of the matter is that they have to realise that they are in government. They are responsible for taking decisions. I think it was Senator Abetz who said, `There's not a problem in the pig industry.' At least John Anderson, the minister, recognises there is a problem. He put out a press release saying:</para></talk.start></continue><para>MINISTER ACTS ON PORK COUNCIL REQUESTS</para><para>There are a number of factors which have affected pigmeat prices during the last six months, and I am acutely aware of the difficulties currently facing the pork industry.</para><para>That is recognition of the fact that there are difficulties. Some strategic thinking is needed within the government—which is currently lacking—about what sort of policy, what sort of direction, is required to provide some benefits to this industry and how the government might ensure that the pig industry in this country continues to survive. That is what this is about.</para><para>The government cannot achieve that by directing the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service to go off and conduct a free-for-all risk analysis of pork to be imported from anywhere in the world. If the government does not have in place a strategy for its own industry, it should not do that. We have not only seen the government doing this to the pork industry; it has occurred in other industries. It has occurred in the salmon industry and it has occurred in the chicken industry, and yet this government has not taken any steps toward getting in place a proper industry strategy for any of these agricultural industries. Nothing the government has done will secure for these industries a long-term future.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">FAULKNER </name><name role="display">Senator Faulkner</name></talker><para>—They are a failure.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>FX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Murphy, Sen Shayne</name><name role="display">Senator MURPHY</name></talker><para>—I will respond to the interjection by Senator Faulkner: they have failed.

They have led the pork producers of Australia to think that they can fix the problems when in fact they cannot do anything at all because all the things that we are trying to fix are things that they put in place when they negotiated the protocols that are currently in place.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>DX5</name.id><name role="metadata">MARGETTS</name><name role="display">Senator Margetts</name></talker><para>—And you voted for it.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>EP5</name.id><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">Senator FERGUSON</name></talker><para>—I have never denied that we voted for it, Senator Margetts.

The information that Senator O'Brien is getting is well sourced because he has a staffer who was involved in primary industry prior to this. But the information that he is getting is information that we are all well aware of.</para><para>I was really amazed to see Senator Woodley make a fleeting visit to the chamber—and it was not much more than a fleeting visit. He came in and told us that he has received a number of letters from the pork producers of Western Australia, South Australia and Queensland—I am sure Senator O'Brien has exactly the same letters, and we have exactly the same letters—and he then told us he is so knowledgeable about the 
 industry because several months ago he visited a piggery. Senator Woodley really ought to know that pigs need to be fed seven days a week and usually twice a day. If Senator Woodley only makes fleeting visits to piggeries as often as that it is not surprising how little he knows when it comes to the issues that confront the pork industry today.</para><para>Senator O'Brien mentioned a backbench committee meeting that some 40 members of the coalition attended because they were so concerned about the situation in the pork industry. Senator O'Brien, Senator Crane happens to chair that committee. It is always a very well attended committee. One of the reasons that 40 people attend every week is that we happen to hold 42 out of the 45 rural and regional seats, and a number of other senators attend on top of that. So it is no wonder that in excess of 40 people attend the backbench primary industries meeting. That is what happens every week.</para><para>All the members of that committee are particularly interested in primary industry matters and any other matters that relate to rural and regional affairs. They attend regularly and service their electorates and their communities so well because they are aware of exactly what is happening. They are doing everything in their power under the protocols that the previous government put in place to make sure that we as a government can deliver some relief for those people in the pig industry in Australia who are suffering—we acknowledge the fact, and I did so the other night in a speech, Senator O'Brien—as badly as I can ever remember.</para><para>As Senator Crane so rightly mentioned in his contribution, many of these problems are associated with factors that are outside the control of pig meat producers. They are due to a downturn in the market for beef and lamb and all meat production. All meat products are currently much cheaper than they have been for a long time.</para><para>In conjunction with all these matters that we have to contend with, a particular issue is affecting the pig industry at this time. The minister concerned, the minister for primary industries, has put his mind to it, as have all his staff, because they realise the urgency that 
 is confronting the pig industry. We know and you know as well, Senator O'Brien, that in this industry the costs are far greater on a week by week basis than they are for all those other industries like the beef industry and the lamb industry where, unless the animals are fed in a feedlot, the expenses are not as great as they are for this particular industry.</para><para>When it comes to supporting the industry, I can promise you, Senator O'Brien, that all those rural electorates which are currently represented by coalition members will, after an election, continue to be represented by coalition members because you proved during 13 years of government that you were not prepared to do anything at all for these people. You were not prepared to do anything at all for them to make sure that their future was secure under the protocols, negotiations and agreements you made while you were in government. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—Order!

As such, the scope of the discretion in the hands of the "authorised officer'' is so precisely limited to that sole circumstance as to render review unnecessary. (The public policy reasons for bestowing this very limited discretion on the "authorised officer" are set out below.)</para><para>Secondly it is worth observing that the regulations do not permit an authorised officer to make a decision refusing a permission; subregulation 4(1AA) of the <inline font-style="italic">Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations </inline> provide that, where an authorised officer forms the view that a permission should not be granted, the authorised person is to refer the application to the Minister.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Background</inline></para><para>By way of background, this amendment to the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations gives effect to an essential element of the Government's legislative measures to combat the practice of fuel substitution.

</para><para>During the previous parliamentary sittings Parliament passed the Government's Fuel Substitution package—a package of seven Acts designed to give effect to the Government's announcement in the 1997-1998 Budget that it would take action to crack down on the practice of fuel substitution.</para><para>These 7 Acts are:</para><para>EXCISE TARIFF (FUEL RATES AMENDMENT) ACT 1997</para><para>CUSTOMS TARIFF (FUEL RATES AMENDMENT) ACT 1997</para><para>FUEL MISUSE (PENALTY SURCHARGE) ACT 1997</para><para>FUEL SALE (PENALTY SURCHARGE) ACT 1997</para><para>FUEL BLENDING (PENALTY SURCHARGE) ACT 1997</para><para>FUEL (PENALTY SURCHARGES) ADMINISTRATION ACT 1997</para><para>CUSTOMS AND EXCISE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT ACT (No. 2) 1997</para><para>The seven Acts in this legislation package provide the authority to ensure <inline font-weight="bold">that both excisable and imported fuels </inline> which are cleared from Customs control at a concessional or free rate of duty, for use otherwise than for on road transport, contain a <inline font-weight="bold">prescribed chemical marker </inline> before the fuels enter home consumption. The presence of the marker is designed to ensure post clearance audit of sale and use.</para><para>The above Acts provide authority to impose a <inline font-weight="bold">severe penalty surcharge </inline> when <inline font-style="italic">designated fuel </inline> has been misused, sold for use other than the intended use, or blended with unmarked fuel, and severe penalties are imposed for various offences under the legislation.</para><para>Central to the fair and efficient operation of the above legislation package are the provisions which ensure that the chemical marker is added to both locally-produced and imported fuel in the correct proportion prior to that fuel proceeding into home consumption. Concessional fuel which has the correct proportion of the chemical marker is referred to in the legislation as <inline font-style="italic">"designated fuel'.</inline></para><para>Importantly, the threshold level of the chemical marker at which the sanctions and penalty provisions apply is significantly less than the level required to identify the fuel as <inline font-style="italic">"designated fuel". </inline> Such fuel is referred to in the legislation as <inline font-style="italic">"marked fuel", </inline> and the significantly lower level of marker prescribed in the legislation for this purpose recognises the mischief to which the legislation is directed, namely the blending of <inline font-style="italic">"designated fuel"</inline>  with unmarked fuel, such that the chemical marker contained therein is diluted. 
</para><para>Great care is required on the part of local manufacturers to ensure that <inline font-style="italic">"designated fuel" </inline> (ie the concessional fuel) contains the correct amount of chemical marker, since carelessness at this stage could result in "marked fuel" being unwittingly passed on to consumers, exposing them to penalties under the legislation. Locally-produced fuel is closely monitored at the time of its entry into home consumption under the Excise legislation to ensure that it contains the correct amount of chemical marker.</para><para>In relation to imported fuel, this task is not quite as straightforward. In the case of a vessel arriving at these shores with incorrectly marked fuel, it might cause great hardship to deny entry of the <inline font-style="italic">"marked fuel" </inline> at the barrier. For this reason, the amending regulation allows importation of that fuel, but subject to the condition that the fuel be converted into <inline font-style="italic">"clean fuel" </inline> or <inline font-style="italic">"designated fuel"</inline> . It is not intended that this decision be subject to review, as the public interest requires that no "marked fuel" should be capable of finding its way into the general commerce of the country, thereby exposing the public to the severe penalties contained in the legislation.</para><para>I trust this meets the concerns of the Committee.</para><para>Yours sincerely</para><para>WARREN TRUSS</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Financial Management and Accountability Orders 1997 made under s.63 of the  Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Financial Management and Accountability Regulations Statutory Rules 1997 No 328</inline></para><para>11 March 1998</para><para>The Hon John Fahey MP</para><para>Minister for Finance and Administration</para><para>Parliament House</para><para>CANBERRA ACT 2600</para><para>Dear Minister</para><para>I refer to the Financial Management and Accountability Regulations, Statutory Rules 1997 No 328, and the Financial Management and Accountability Orders 1997, which give effect to the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997</inline> .</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Financial Management and Accountability Regulations</inline></para><para>Regulation 6 provides for the Chief Executive of an Agency to issue Instructions.

A reference to the guidelines issued by the Minister for Justice is also found in suborder 2.2.1 of the Financial Management and Accountability Orders 1997. These provisions appear to authorise the 
 delegation of a legislative function which is sanctioned by the enabling Act. That Act does not, however, require either the Instructions or the Guidelines to be tabled or to be subject to disallowance.

While subregulation 23(5) may be regarded as acceptable in relation to a person who was the owner of goods or other property immediately before its sale, the provision would appear to affect adversely any person who held a right other than ownership in the property, such as a lessee or bailee.

</para><para>Thank you for your letter of 11 March 1998 seeking my advice on four matters of concern to the Committee in the Financial Management and Accountability Regulations and the Financial Management and Accountability Orders.</para><para>First, the Committee suggested that the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Management and Accountability Act </inline> 1997 (the FMA Act) should be amended so that certain instruments made under the authority of the regulations would be disallowable. Those instruments are: Chief Executive Instructions issued under regulation 6; the Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines issued under regulation 7; and, the Fraud Control Guidelines issued under regulation 19.</para><para>While the instruments are of a legislative character, in my view they only cover matters of administrative practice within Agencies, are directed only to officials and have no impact on the rights or obligations of others. I am aware that under the <inline font-style="italic">Audit Act 1901, </inline> the Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines were disallowable instruments. However, as noted in the Explanatory Memorandum to the FMA Act for section 64 (which allows the regulations to authorise Ministers to issue guidelines), "the reason for this change is in the light of experience, including that the provision is little used and that control by the Parliament can be effectively exercised at the regulation making stage"—that is, control over the scope of the guidelines. Accordingly, I do not favour amending the FMA Act as suggested and suggest that no purpose would be served by making them disallowable. Indeed, in the case of Chief Executive Instructions, it would make simple modifications of basic procedures quite cumbersome.</para><para>Second, the Committee notes that paragraph 22(b) of the regulations extends the definition of "authorised investment" in section 39 of the FMA Act to include professionally managed money market trusts. This is subject to the Finance Minister (or delegate) being satisfied that individual trusts meet two prudential criteria, namely:</para><para>.	 the trust's investments are only in the other forms of "authorised investments"—securities of, or guaranteed by, the Commonwealth or a State or a Territory, deposits with a bank, and bills of exchange accepted or endorsed only by a bank;</para><para>.	 no charge over the assets of the trust is incurred in support of borrowings.</para><para>The Committee is concerned that this "discretion" has considerable commercial implication but is not subject to AAT review.</para><para>I am not convinced that what is involved here is a discretion, rather, whether or not a particular trust meets these prudential criteria, can be ascertained as a matter of fact. If a trust met those criteria, it would simply be one of a range of investments between which a delegate could choose to invest or 
 not. There seems to be no compelling reason to amend the regulations to create a right of review.</para><para>Third, the Committee is concerned that regulation 23 may operate to adversely affect the rights of persons who hold a right other than ownership in property found on Commonwealth premises when that property has been disposed of in accordance with the regulation. The examples of such persons were bailees and lessees.</para><para>This is a matter that would probably require legal advice, perhaps on a case-by-case basis. There may be other remedies available to such persons. However, the regulation mirrors provisions which had been in regulations made under the Audit Act 1901 for many years. I am advised that no issues of this kind are known to have arisen in that time.</para><para>Finally, you have raised FMA Order 6.2.1 which permits the Finance Chief Executive to determine that certain Agency operations should be treated as "business operations". The Committee is concerned that the Order provides for a subdelegation of legislative power which is not authorised by the FMA Act.</para><para>The determinations, if any, will be made on a case-by-case basis for particular Agency operations. The intention, as noted in the Explanatory Statement, is to provide a trigger for the production of separate, auditable financial reports, in accordance with the FMA Act, for those particular business operations.</para><para>Yours sincerely</para><para>JOHN FAHEY</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Public Service Regulations (Amendment—Interim Reforms) Statutory Rules 1998 No 23</inline></para><para>26 March 1998</para><para>The Hon Dr David Kemp MP</para><para>Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service</para><para>Parliament House</para><para>CANBERRA ACT 2600</para><para>Dear Minister</para><para>I refer to the Public Service Regulations (Amendment—Interim Reforms), Statutory Rules 1998 No 23, which seek to improve the efficiency, effectiveness and ethics of the Australian Public Service.</para><para>The Committee understands that the Public Service Bill 1997 was reintroduced into the House of Representative on 5 March 1998. This Bill proposes to introduce far-reaching reforms to the APS and the Committee suggests that, given the timing of this legislation, it may be appropriate for the Regulations to be delayed until the fate of that Bill has been determined. The Committee suggests also that it may be appropriate for some of the content of these Regulations to be placed in that Bill rather than in delegated legislation. 
</para><para>Regulation 12 provides merely that the Commissioner must report to the Minister on the state of the Service, and that the Minister is to present that report to the Parliament. There is, however, no provision specifying the time within which the Minister must present the report to Parliament after it has been received. The Committee considers that it would be appropriate that the Minister be required to present the report to Parliament within seven sitting days of receiving it.</para><para>The Appendix to the Explanatory Statement helpfully divides its explanation of the provisions in the Schedule to the Regulations into two parts, the second of which relates to the technical and consequential amendments made by the Schedule. This Part advises, for instance, that provisions relating to the Public Service Board are omitted some 11 years after the abolition of the Board. The entry for 42.1 advises that r.74B omits an obsolete reference to a repealed Act, which appears to be the <inline font-style="italic">Arbitration (Public Service) Act 1920-1934</inline> . This Act also seems to have been repealed some time ago. The Committee would appreciate the reasons for this apparent delay in bringing the Regulations up to date.</para><para>The Committee would be grateful for your advice.</para><para>Yours sincerely</para><para>Bill O'Chee</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Chairman</inline></para><para>Senator Bill O'Chee</para><para>Chairman</para><para>Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances</para><para>The Senate</para><para>Parliament House</para><para>CANBERRA ACT 2600</para><para>Dear Senator</para><para>I refer to your letter of 26 March 1998 which raises a number of issues arising from the recent Public Service Regulations (Amendment—Interim Reforms), Statutory Rules 1998 No 23.</para><para>First, the Committee has suggested that the Regulations be delayed until the fate of the Public Service Bill 1997 has been determined. The House of Representatives has now rejected the amendments passed by the Senate to the Bill and has resolved that the Bill be laid aside. If the Bill had passed, it would have included in it the substantive provisions of the Regulations in relation to the Australian Public Service (APS) Values, the Code of Conduct, Public Interest Whistleblowing, the State of the Service Report and amendments to the application of the Part IV mobility arrangements. I agree with the Committee that this would have been the preferable course. However, in the absence of such a Bill, it is essential that we deal with these 
 important issues, if we are to improve the efficiency, effectiveness and the ethics of the APS.</para><para>Second, the Committee suggested that regulation 12 might be amended to include a provision that the Minister be required to present the State of the Service Report to Parliament within seven sitting days of receiving it. I think that that would be a useful requirement, which would increase the Minister's accountability to Parliament. I agree that such an amendment should be made and I will amend the Regulations to include that requirement.</para><para>Third, the Committee questioned why there has been an apparent delay in bringing the Regulations up to date. With the passage of the <inline font-style="italic">Administrative Arrangements Act 1987, </inline> the <inline font-style="italic">Public Service Act 1922 </inline> was amended to repeal those provisions establishing the Public Service Board and to substitute provisions establishing the office of Public Service Commissioner. While various separate consequential amendments to the Public Service Regulations have been made since then, it appears that no comprehensive set of amendments were drafted. These matters ante-date my responsibility as Minister but I understand that there was an expectation that in the longer term the 1922 Act and its Regulations would be replaced. A number of reviews of the Act have been carried out in recent years, including that chaired by Mr RN McLeod AM in 1994. The timeframe for implementing legislative change has been subject to a number of delays. It was only when significant amendments were being made to the regulations earlier this year, that the opportunity was available to repeal those regulations which have become obsolete since 1987. I agree that the time taken to complete the updating is unfortunate. I would hope that such a delay would not occur again.</para><para>I hope that these comments are helpful to the Committee's consideration of the amendments to the regulations.</para><para>Yours sincerely</para><para>DAVID KEMP</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Superannuation Contributions Tax (Members of Constitutionally Protected Superannuation Funds) Assessment and Collection Regulations Statutory Rules 1997 No 371</inline></para><para>5 March 1998</para><para>Senator the Hon Rod Kemp</para><para>Assistant Treasurer</para><para>Parliament House</para><para>CANBERRA ACT 2600</para><para>Dear Minister</para><para>I refer to the Superannuation Contributions Tax (Members of Constitutionally Protected Superannuation Funds) Assessment and Collection Regula

Is a person required to comply with such a request? If so then there would appear to be no protection of privacy or against self-incrimination. On the other hand, if there is no obligation on the part of the person to comply with the request then it is difficult to see the purpose of this regulation. The regulation also does not specify whether the request must be written or oral, or the form of the response.</para><para>Subregulation 15(2) raises various presumptions relating to the service of notices by the Commissioner, but there is no corresponding provision relating to the receipt of documents by the Commissioner. The inclusion of a provision specifying the circumstances in which any individual may be assured that, in the absence of proof to the contrary, a document or other notices has been received by the Commissioner would seem to be appropriate.</para><para>Regulation 19 and Schedule 5 specify the expenses which a witness may claim if he or she is required to attend a hearing under s.32 of the enabling Act. Schedule 5 provides that such expenses are to be the same as those specified in the High Court Rules. The effect of Schedule 5, when read with the High Court Rules, is that a person who is remunerated by salary, wages or fees may recover the full amount of that remuneration which is lost through attendance as a witness, whereas one who is remunerated in any other way—such as by commission, or out of the profits of a small business—may claim no more than $64.40 per day.

This contrasts with paragraphs 11(2)(b) and 20(1)(c) where the ACCC is either bound or permitted to take account of matters which are objectively relevant to the issue. The Explanatory Statement provides no explanation for this difference.</para><para>Subregulation 9(1) requires the ACCC to provide the parties to a dispute with a draft determination, prior to making a formal determination under subregulation 9(2), of a dispute that has gone to arbitration.

I understand that the Department of Communications and the Arts advised the Office of Legislative Drafting (OLD) on a number of occasions of the importance of consistency in the formulation of the two sets of provisions, given that some disputes may be arbitrated under either the Telecommunications Act or the Trade Practices Act and the resulting potential for forum "shopping" by parties to disputes. However, I am advised that OLD reserved its right to vary the formulation where it</para><para>considered there was scope to improve on the formulation of the relevant provisions of the Trade Practices Act or the Trade Practices Regulations.</para><para>Subregulation 8(3) and paragraph 20(1)(c) of the regulations follow the formulations used in the relevant provisions of the Trade Practices Act. Paragraph 11(2)(b) differs from the formulation 
 used in paragraph 152CT(5)(b) of the Trade Practices Act, on which it is based. Paragraph 152CT(5)(b) provides that the ACCC must have regard to "such other matters as the Commission considers relevant". Had this formulation been followed by OLD, as requested by the Department of Communications and the Arts, it would have been a subjective test like the test in subregulation 8(3). I will ensure that paragraph 11(2)(b) is amended at the next available opportunity to make it consistent with paragraph 152CT(5)(b) of the Trade Practices Act.</para><para>Subregulation 9(1) is based on subsections 152CP(1), (4) and (5) in Part XIC of the Trade Practices Act, dealing with the telecommunications specific access regime. These subsections are in turn based on subsections 44V(1), (4) and (5) in Part IIIA of the Trade Practices Act, which sets out the general access regime. I have asked the Department of Communications and the Arts to consult with the Department of the Treasury and the ACCC on whether a minimum time period between delivery of draft and final determinations should be specified in both the Telecommunications (Arbitration) Regulations and the Trade Practices Regulations. I acknowledge that the absence of a minimum time period tends to weaken the safeguard provided by the requirement for a draft determination, however I would also note the benefits to parties to disputes of a fast and effective dispute resolution process.</para><para>Regulation 10 is based on section 152CS of the Trade Practices Act, which is in turn based on section 44Y. Neither section 152CS nor section 44Y provides for the delivery of a preliminary finding or draft conclusion for persons who may be adversely affected by a decision to terminate an arbitration.</para><para>As for subregulation 9(1), I have asked the Department of Communications and the Arts to consult with the Department of the Treasury and the ACCC on whether the Telecommunications (Arbitration) Regulations and the Trade Practices Regulations should both be amended to provide for the delivery of a preliminary finding or draft conclusion for persons who may be adversely affected by a decision to terminate an arbitration. Again, I would however note that both sets of regulations are intended to provide a process which is as fast and efficient as possible.</para><para>Subregulation 17(1) is based on subsections 152DD(2) and 44ZH(2) of the Trade Practices Act, which permit the presiding member of the ACCC to summon witnesses to arbitrations of access disputes. Neither of these provisions makes provision for such witnesses to claim travelling expenses. I have asked the Department of Communications and the Arts to consult with the Department of the Treasury and the ACCC on whether the 
 Telecommunications (Arbitration) Regulations and the Trade Practices Regulations should both be amended to make such provision.</para><para>I trust this information addresses the Committee's concerns.</para><para>Yours sincerely</para><para>RICHARD ALSTON</para><para>Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Veterans' Entitlements Regulations (Amendment) Statutory Rules 1997 No 372</inline></para><para>5 March 1998</para><para>The Hon Bruce Scott MP</para><para>Minister for Veterans' Affairs</para><para>Parliament House</para><para>CANBERRA ACT 2600</para><para>Dear Minister</para><para>I refer to the Veterans' Entitlements Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1997 No 372, which seek to simplify the administration of the payment of travelling expenses for veterans.</para><para>New paragraph 9AF(1)(a) allows the Commission to question, and seek written evidence for, travel claims made by a veteran at any time within six months of the completion of the travel.

However, in a situation where a veteran was to lodge his or her application towards the end of the three months period as stipulated in paragraph 170B(5)(b)(ii) of the VEA the Commission technically only has three months to request the evidence. This circumstance is likely to be not uncommon. The inclusion of the six month period is to cover this scenario. If the period was three months it could expire at the same time as the veteran lodges his or her claim.</para><para>In any event, in most cases, the relevant documentary evidence will accompany the application as required by subsection 170B(5)(c) of the VEA. Further, in the event of a veteran not keeping records of his or her travel, the Commission will accept a statutory declaration.</para><para>In relation to your second query, in light of your comments, the Office of Legislative Drafting will be instructed to amend this subregulation and delete reference to the requirement to take into consideration only the evidence that was before the Commission when it made the first decision.</para><para>I hope these comments are of some assistance.</para><para>Yours sincerely</para><para>BRUCE SCOTT</para><para>9 April 1998</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Jabiluka Uranium Mine</title><page.no>2973</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>2973</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I give notice that, on the next day of sitting, I shall move:</para></talk.start><para>That the Senate—</para><para>(a)	 condemns the Northern Territory Government for sanctioning the arrest and charging by Northern Territory police of Mirrar senior traditional owner, Yvonne Margarula, on 19 May 1998 for `trespassing' on her land near the proposed Jabiluka uranium mine site; and</para><para>(b)	 calls on the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron):</para><para>	 (i)	 to immediately write to the Northern Territory Chief Minister and Minister for Police seeking:</para><para>		 (a)	 a full and detailed explanation of the decision by the Northern Territory police to arrest and charge Yvonne Margarula for trespassing on her own land, and</para><para>		 (b)	 a full and detailed explanation of the Northern Territory Government's current policy with regard to the access rights of traditional owners, and</para><para>	 (ii)	 to send a letter of apology to Yvonne Margarula for the indignity and violation of rights she has suffered.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Indonesia</title><page.no>2974</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>2974</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I give notice that, on the next day of sitting, I shall move:</para></talk.start><para>That the Senate—</para><para>(a)	 views Indonesia's leadership succession as the beginning rather than the end of a process of change and reform needed to create political and economic stability based on the full participation of the Indonesian people and on respect for human rights;</para><para>(b)	 calls on the Indonesian Government to adopt Amnesty International's agenda for human rights reform, and in particular its call for:</para><para>	 (i)	 the immediate release of all political prisoners in Indonesia and East Timor,</para><para>	 (ii)	 a public commission of inquiry into recent killings and disappearances in Indonesia,</para><para>	 (iii)	 ensuring the independence of Komnas Ham, the Indonesian National Commission on Human Rights, to investigate cases of killing and disappearance and allow it to act on its findings,</para><para>	 (iv)	 the repeal of the anti-subversion law and the articles of its criminal code which are used to repress and detain political activists, and

However, the taking note debate is very time constrained and I want to put some additional matters before the Senate concerning this issue.</para><para>This matter has the focus of rural Australia fairly and squarely upon it. It is interesting that, even though the document has been presented to the Senate, it has not been communicated to the Senate. Our office was not made aware of the contents of this response, even though it has been on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline> since this morning.</para><para>In relation to that matter, I have had quite a number of contacts from pig producers and from the Pork Council. I have had visits to my office in Launceston from producers who are extremely concerned that action needs to be taken swiftly to deal with the problems of this industry. I have said it before and I reiterate: these producers cannot hold their pigs for sale until the market suits the sale of pigs; they have to sell them or dispose of them. As a result there have been articles, Senator O'Chee, in Queensland newspapers about producers shooting their producing sows because they are just not in a position to continue in the industry on the scale they are currently involved, if at all, because of the problems that they are facing.</para><para>I did say earlier that Minister Anderson has been rather slow in taking action in relation to this matter. I note that the response regarding the Australian pork industry is from the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism and I am curious to know why the response is not equally from the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, who I would have thought would have had a critical role in the drafting of any response to the Senate's resolution on this matter. Coalition senators have conceded in this place that the industry is in one of the worse crises that it has faced over many years. Senator Ferguson was unequivocal in that regard, saying that this industry has had its crises but that in his experience this is the worst crisis it has faced. He said that he has been involved—I am relying on my memory—for 28 years and he has not seen a crisis as bad as that which faces the pork industry at the moment.</para><para>We were debating earlier the question of whether access to the Australian market would be opened up to other markets as a result of an animal quarantine policy inquiry by AQIS. At the moment the problems in the industry are significant enough to render this industry extremely fearful of even talk of opening it up to external markets because it is just not able to cope with the situation at present. It has been suggested that the real problem for this industry lies in the overall economic circumstances that producers are facing resulting from perhaps the crisis in 
 Indonesia and the general Asian financial economic crisis, which is forcing down the prices of other commodities in Australia and causing price competition between pork and beef, for example, in the Australian market.</para><para>If it is the case that there are severe economic problems in this industry combined with an increase in imports then surely this government is in a position to activate its rights under the World Trade Organisation rules with regard to special and interim protection—and I do stress that it is interim protection because I think the Labor Party would have the agreement of the coalition that a protection measure is not an option for a permanent long-term solution for this industry. But the government does have the ability to take action to introduce a temporary measure. If the circumstances are as described, that is, that a combination of the introduction of greater imports together with the economic circumstances of the industry caused by the Asian economic crisis have given rise to this problem—and that is the implication I have received from the statements made by coalition senators in the debate earlier today—then the government needs to expeditiously put in place measures to protect the industry while it is faced with that temporary crisis, if indeed the government is saying that it is a temporary crisis.</para><para>On the other hand, if the government is saying, `This is a permanent crisis. This industry does not have any means of extricating itself from this problem in the short term; this is a long-term problem,' then the government really holds no hope out to pork producers in this country. The government is effectively saying, `We can't deal with this problem in the short term. The industry is going to have to restructure itself. That is going to mean that a lot of people are going to have to go bust. That will remove a lot of product from the Australian market and perhaps then people can survive.' I hope that if the government is not saying that the industry does not have a great deal of hope that someone is going to put clearly on the record that that is not what they are saying. I for one believe that there is the opportunity for the government to take action to put in place interim 
 emergency measures having regard to its rights under the trade treaties that this country is party to. Japan has in place interim emergency measures in relation to pork products at the moment. That measure is triggered by a certain level of imports. That measure was introduced earlier this year. If Japan can do it, why can't Australia?</para><para>I did hear an argument earlier today that if we took such a step it would trigger a protection measure by Canada in relation to the import of beef. That was the argument that was presented earlier today—that if Australia took action as permitted under the provisions of its trade treaties to give interim emergency protection to the pork industry that would trigger a trade war over beef with Canada. I suggest that that is a rather alarmist statement. Not only is that extremely unlikely to occur but there is no logic in the statement. Canada, and any other country, would be looking for access on a long-term basis to any market on equitable terms. Canada would not be interested in being involved in a trade war about any product, be it beef, pork or any other, which would have the effect of causing a long-term deterioration in trade relationships.</para><para>Having said that, I want to have a close look at the response by Minister Moore in relation to the Senate's resolution. I had expected the response to be from Minister Anderson. Be that as it may, I seek leave to continue my remarks later in the week after I have had a close look at this document.</para><para>Leave granted; debate adjourned.</para></speech></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>BUDGET 1998-99</title><type>Miscellaneous</type><page.no>2980</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Portfolio Budget Statements</title><page.no>2980</page.no></subdebateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Knowles)</name></talker><para>—Pursuant to standing order 166, I present a corrigendum to the Department of Social Security portfolio budget statements which was presented to the President on 20 May 1998.

This seminar assembled some of the most authoritative speakers from across Australian government departments, business and academic fields, to share their views on the origins, the regional economic and political ramifications and the likely effects on Australia of the so called `Asian Currency Crisis'.</para><para>It is well known that since the floating of the Thai baht in July 1997, a number of regional economies have seen the value of their currency plummet by record amounts. The reactions of Governments as they sought to meet the effects of the financial crisis have seen marked political turmoil, and in some cases social unrest with dramatic consequences, as we have witnessed over the last week. The crisis is set against a seven year period of stagnation in the region's largest economy, Japan. With Japan as Australia's largest trading partner and 20 per cent of our GDP derived from trade with the embattled South East Asian countries, many had speculated on what might be the effects on Australia? Whilst the Government and a variety of analysts had forecast a down turn in the Australian growth rate, the Committee felt it was appropriate to consider the wider ramifications for Australia. Hence this seminar sought to inform the Parliament, and the wider public through open discussion of the impact of the crisis in Asia on Australia</para><para>The Deputy Prime Minister, in opening the seminar, commented upon the Australian Government's response to the situation, highlighting the contribution to the IMF assistance packages for Thailand, South Korea and Indonesia—an action that has received bipartisan support. There is little doubt 
 that there would be an impact on the Australian export performance, but Australia remains committed to Asia as more than just a fair-weather friend. The recovery period will not be without some pain for Australia, but in the end should provide opportunity and gain.</para><para>It is interesting to note that the prospects for Indonesia were covered in three of the presentations and whilst the possible scenarios included the essence of what we have all witnessed over the last two weeks, it is fair to say that no one was able to predict the rapid fall of President Suharto.</para><para>From the initial discussion of the countries most effected by the crisis—Thailand, The Philippines, Malaysia, South Korea and Indonesia—it became apparent that each had its own set of unique challenges to contend with. A `standard' remedy was therefore probably not appropriate. The various responses, under the auspices the IMF, subsequently came under critical analysis. Why did a package that called for profound macro economic reform appear to work in one country, whilst in another it was considered too insistent and extending too far into the sovereign rights of the effected country? Was there a distinct east-west discord developing? These issues were addressed by a number of the seminar presentations.</para><para>Similarly, the effectiveness of the role of the regional forums, such as ASEAN and APEC, was carefully considered during the seminar. On examination of the prospects for China, Japan, Taiwan and Singapore it is evident that regionally, nations are divided in their views as to what to do. Subsequently, ASEAN and APEC were seen as unlikely fora for addressing the core problems of the crisis. Whilst it can be argued, in APECs case, that it not designed to address financial issues, it was determined during the seminar to have the best prospects of any regional organisation to address politics in the region. That it failed to exert any real influence during this crisis should not preclude its use in the future to provide coordination, by various regional agencies, to assist countries in the region to set circumstances to avoid the same situation reoccuring.</para><para>Acknowledging that the direct impact of the crisis on Australia is an unfolding situation, a number of broad points of consensus were discussed. These ranged from the current state of the domestic economy, impacts on specific export sectors, effects at State and Territory level and the prospects for employment growth. These issues, together with the presentation on the prospects for Australian business, provide a number of interesting viewpoints on which to reflect as the real effects become apparent over the next financial year or so.</para><para>The Committee, in reporting its views of the seminar, chose to keep its remarks brief. In so doing, the words of the individual speakers have 
 been allowed to stand by themselves. While individually noteworthy, these presentations collectively provide a comprehensive overview of the social, economic and political impact of the crisis, not just on Australia, but also for other regional nations.</para><para>In conclusion, I would like to thank the many members of the foreign affairs, academic, business and diplomatic communities who participated in the seminar, and particularly the talented group of speakers who generously contributed their time to ensure its success through the quality of their presentations. I believe their efforts have contributed to the creation of a valuable reference source on the initial effects of the Asian Currency crisis on Australia.

The bills amend the legislative framework for the Federal Interstate Registration Scheme (FIRS) for heavy vehicles engaged in interstate trade and commerce.</para><para>The amendment proposed by the Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill 1998 will provide a formula for calculating registration charges for periods of less than one year for heavy vehicles registered under FIRS. The Interstate Road Transport Amendment Bill 1998 takes account of self government in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) and provides for the appointment of additional enforcement officers in the ACT.</para><para>The Interstate Road Transport Charge Act 1985 provides for registration charges on FIRS registered vehicles. All revenue from charges, collected by the States and Territories, acting as agents of the Commonwealth, is returned to the States and Territories for expenditure on road maintenance.</para><para>At present this Act provides only for annual registration charges. The Act needs to provide for less than one year registration charges to allow charging to reflect the amendments to the Interstate Road Transport Regulations   which permit less than one year registration of FIRS vehicles.</para><para>The proposed amendment reflects the charging formula to be used in the  Road Transport Reform (Heavy Vehicles) Registration regime, which is to be adopted by States and Territories. Both the Federal and State-based schemes will, therefore, have the same charging formula.</para><para>The general provision of registration periods of less than one year is one of the ten priority road transport reform initiatives, endorsed by the Ministerial Council for Road Transport at its February 1997 meeting. The package was developed by the National Road Transport Commission (NRTC) in conjunction with Federal, State and 
 Territory governments and the road transport industry.</para><para>Short term registration provides flexibility to operators who wish to register their vehicles for periods of less than one year. This flexibility provides reduced costs to the operator. For example, farmers can nominate a period which coincides with when they need  to transport crops, instead of paying for a full year's registration, and smaller operators may opt to pay registration charges at three-monthly intervals, helping to maintain their cash-flow.</para><para>The amendment demonstrates the Federal Government's commitment to road transport reform and its recognition of the important role the road transport industry plays in Australia's economy.</para><para>The second bill in the package, the Interstate Road Transport Amendment Bill 1998 is required to enable the appointment of additional enforcement officers in the Australian Capital Territory. Following self government in the ACT, the Commonwealth can no longer appoint ACT enforcement officers. The amendment will enable the appointment of inspectors by the ACT Government.</para><para>Other minor amendments to this Act convert the existing monetary penalties to equivalent penalty units and insert appropriate references to provisions of the Crimes Act 1914.</para><para>The net budgetary impact of the amendments will be nil.</para><para>The amendments are to come into force on the day on which they receive Royal Assent.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Conroy</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>AUSTRALIAN RADIATION PROTECTION AND NUCLEAR SAFETY BILL 1998</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>2983</page.no><id.no>r496</id.no><cognate><cognateinfo><title>AUSTRALIAN RADIATION PROTECTION AND NUCLEAR SAFETY (LICENCE CHARGES) BILL 1998</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>r498</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate><cognate><cognateinfo><title>AUSTRALIAN RADIATION PROTECTION AND NUCLEAR SAFETY (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 1998</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>r505</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>2983</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bills received from the House of Representatives.</para><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ellison</inline>) agreed to:</para><para>That these bills may proceed without formalities, may be taken together and be now read a first time.</para><para>Bills read a first time.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>2983</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>2983</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Schools, Vocational Education and Training</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><para>That these bills be now read a second time.</para><para>I seek leave to have the second reading speeches incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> .</para><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The speeches read as follows</inline>—</para><para>AUSTRALIAN RADIATION PROTECTION AND NUCLEAR SAFETY BILL 1998</para><para>This bill introduces regulatory controls for all Commonwealth radiation and nuclear safety activities for the first time in Australia.

We know that the common youth allowance determines an independent age for unemployed people at 21 and for students at 25 years. All through this debate on this consequential bill and on the bill before it, the Democrats have raised our objections to defining a student as being a child until independent at the age of 25. It is ridiculous. It is a ludicrous, shameful, concocted notion of independence that determines that people until the age of 25, if they are full-time students, should therefore be financially and otherwise dependent on their families. All through this debate the Democrats have said that that is inappropriate.</para></talk.start></continue><para>For that reason we will support this measure as a measure that alleviates for at least 950 students the potential pain or economic hardship that this legislation would otherwise impose. We will support this amendment so as to alleviate the worst aspects of this bill, but we will not let it go past without acknowledging and putting on record the fact that this amendment would not be necessary in the first place if the opposition actually had the guts to stand up to the government and say, look, 25 is a ridiculous notion. It is a ridiculous age at which to define independence for full-time students. It is ridiculous to assume that 25 is the age of independence when in nearly every other area of law, certainly where governments can save money, it is convenient to determine independence at the age of 16, 17 or, usually, 18. Whether it is the Child Support Act or the tax rebates for families, we notice that they do not define the age of independence as over 18 or indeed over 20, let alone 25.</para><para>Again, I put our very strong objections on record and I draw to the attention of the opposition a press release that I read from earlier from the President of the National Union of Students, Rose Tracey, and its education officer, Katrina Curry, who plead with the opposition to reverse its stance so that people are treated fairly and treated as independents at a rightful and appropriate age, 
 as opposed to 25. I find it ridiculous that we are even referring to people theoretically as children—and they are 25 years of age!</para><para>So a commendation to the ALP for this particular amendment that alleviates one nasty, but shame on them for not actually going the whole hog and ensuring that students are treated as independent ideally at 18, less preferably at 21 but definitely not at 25.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>2987</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I back what Senator Stott Despoja was saying on behalf of the Australian Democrats.

I would like to 
 comment on the experiences in the United Kingdom and Chile in respect of the introduction of choice, because we do have two case studies of what occurred with those two systems.</para></talk.start><para>In the United Kingdom, in the 1980s, the then Thatcher government decided to allow employees to opt out of their company pension fund and, instead, to set up a personal pension arrangement. Many employees were persuaded to give up a generous employer financed benefit and move into a personal pension vehicle, where the only contributions were their own. Employees in many cases were inappropriately lured into these products by life insurance salesmen using unrealistic projections of expected retirement benefits.	So many people were disadvantaged by this system that the Thatcher government was forced to introduce a complex system under which those disadvantaged could claim compensation and/or be reinstated in their former scheme. The whole affair is now universally acknowledged to be a total debacle, and the mess is still being sorted out.</para><para>Although the circumstances differ slightly, similar risks apply in Australia under a proposed choice of fund regime. There is a danger that members of well run and generous enterprise based funds or industry funds will be persuaded by aggressive sales techniques to give up existing entitlements and rights to future benefit accruals for other arrangements that are less attuned to their needs.</para><para>Just an update on the United Kingdom pension problems: the misselling scandal losses to consumers were recently revised upwards from £4 billion to £11 billion. Ninety per cent of the 560,000 people who transferred out of their occupational products were literally ripped off and, interestingly, the then Thatcher  conservative  government  launched 
 its initiative, wrapped in the rhetoric of freedom and, of course, the words `choice for the individual'.</para><para>Briefly, to Chile. Chile operates a compulsory accumulation style private sector superannuation system. Most of the population is in one of 15 private sector funds, all of which compete actively for members. The <inline font-style="italic">Institutional Investor</inline> magazine reported in its June 1997 edition that 29 per cent of members switched funds in the previous 12 months. Much of the switching is triggered by sales people working for the funds being paid for each switch. Some 38 per cent of the entire cost of managing the Chilean superannuation system is related to switching between funds. Members are convinced, cajoled, induced and even seduced by a wide range of offers to switch to a new fund, with gifts such as mobile phones, mountain bikes, and many other initiatives. Such practices are illegal in Chile but widespread, nonetheless.</para><para>I seek leave to table two documents: one on choice in Chile, and the other on lessons from the United Kingdom that were presented to the recent conference of major superannuation funds.

role="display">Senator SHERRY</name></talker><para>—This document, prepared by Industry Fund Services, shows the benefits generated by an industry fund compared with those by a trio of leading master trust providers. They are not selected because they are the worst performers; they are, in fact, among the better ones. Under most 
 master trust structures, small-scale employer based members and personal direct-paying members are treated identically. The old distinction between the two styles of product have largely disappeared. So the worst excesses of the personal superannuation products are behind us in respect of high front-end loading 
 commission. There are still a few small operators selling this form of product—and, frankly, this form of product is largely rubbish.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The real issue with master trusts is not the additional administration fees; the impact they have on end benefits is only a fraction of that of the management fee levied by the promoters in addition to the investment managed fees levied by the fund managers. Typically, fund managers charge between 0.5 and 0.6 per cent for wholesale funds, and up to 1.2 per cent for retail fund management. Master trust providers charge an additional one to two per cent. So it is not unusual for two per cent of the actual fund accumulated by the member to be levied each and every year, especially as many fund managers charge their retail, rather than their wholesale, rates in master trust investment funds.</para><para>What is the outcome of this? The document that I have had incorporated, as I have said, is a comparison between industry funds on average and three leading master trust providers—and the three leading master trust providers are Colonial, AMP balanced and Mercantile Mutual balanced. The comparison shows that a person earning $32,000 a year, contributing over a period of 41 years, with a declared return of six per cent under an industry fund would end up with a total balance of some $376,000. With Colonial balanced, the final balance would be $285,000; AMP, $295,000; and Mercantile Mutual, $287,000.</para><para>In other words, the comparison shows that in three what are reasonable, by any private industry standards, balanced	funds, with Colonial you would be $90,000 worse off at retirement, with AMP balanced you would be $80,000 worse off and with Mercantile Mutual you would be $87,000 worse off. That is, approximately one-quarter of your final retirement income is reduced as a consequence of being in what are not, frankly, unreasonable products, compared with what is the best product on the market—and that is an average industry fund.</para><para>This highlights the most significant problem that will emerge as a result of the govern 
 ment's so-called choice of superannuation model: it is deregulation of superannuation at the retail end of the market; it is deregulation in an environment where people will simply not have the product knowledge in order to make an informed choice. Competition, per se, is good, but competition is based on individuals having product knowledge. As I have already said in this debate, how on earth do the, at the very least, 2½ million people in this country who are either certainly illiterate but also functionally illiterate develop the product knowledge in order to make an informed choice and be better off? Labor disagrees with this government's proposed choice of fund model and I hope the amendments we put forward will be supported.<inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>2993</page.no><name role="metadata">Hogg, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HOGG</name><name.id>7L6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise in this debate on <inline ref="r421">Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1998</inline>  to look at a number of issues. Before so doing I just want to look at the background against which this issue of choice is set. I think it is summed up very well in the evidence that was given before the Select Committee on Superannuation's inquiry on Thursday, 19 February 1998, in Sydney by two witnesses: Mr Rankin, the Executive Director of the Institute of Actuaries of Australia; and Mr Kenneth Lockery, Principal of Towers Perrin. Dealing firstly with Mr Rankin's evidence: he said:</para></talk.start><para>. . . if choice is not properly exercised, there will be no net benefit to the individuals trying to accumulate savings for their retirement, and no benefit to the nation. If choice is poorly exercised, individuals and the nation will both be the losers. There is plenty of evidence to suggest that, without the capacity to make informed choices—that is, without addressing this asymmetry of information problem—people are likely to make poor choices. They will make choices which are either too conservative for their personal circumstances or too risky for their personal circumstances.</para><para>That is the very point that Senator Sherry has been making in this debate. The problem that we are confronted with is people making proper choices, not poorly exercised choices, choices that are either too conservative or too risky, but choices that will provide them with a net benefit. Clearly, the evidence of Mr Rankin throws real doubts upon this whole issue of choice. One could look further, at 
 what Mr Lockery of Towers Perrin said in response to the view that the government has taken on the issue of choice. This is what he said the government believes this will lead to:</para><para>. . . greater competition leading to improved investment returns and lower administrative costs.</para><para>Indeed, some members of smaller funds may achieve these benefits. On the other hand, we submit that such economic benefits will not be achieved for the vast majority of employees in large employer based or industry funds. Instead, in aggregate such employees are likely to suffer a net economic loss as a result of greater individual choice of superannuation funds.</para><para>Whilst they are two opinions, I believe those two opinions do sum up the problems facing this issue of choice of fund, because we see that choice not properly exercised will have no net benefit, and we find that—and this was reasonably well supported by evidence before the committee—greater competition will not provide improved returns, will not lower administration costs and, whilst some in smaller funds may benefit, the vast majority of people will have no net benefit whatsoever.</para><para>One must remember that superannuation is a retirement benefit and as such it must be worked to maximise the benefit for the employee. There is a misconception around that superannuation money is the employer's money, the insurance company's money, the bank's money or the fund manager's money, but it is by no stretch of the imagination any of theirs whatsoever. It is purely and simply the funds of the member and it should be maximised so that person can have a reasonable expectation of a reasonable retirement. There is an overriding moral obligation, I would put to you, for those entrusted with the money of the members of a fund to maximise that return and not to be frittering it away in the useless exercises which seem to be giving people, or pretend to be giving people, additional retirement benefits.</para><para>Choice is not, or should not be, about lining the pockets of some individuals or corporate entities. Choice must be informed. That was the key thing in the evidence that was presented to the committee at all stages: choice must be informed. Otherwise, we are going to end up with the British or Chilean experience, as outlined by Senator Sherry. I have real 
 doubts about, firstly, many people's ability to make an informed choice—I will come to that in a few moments—and, secondly, whether many people want to make an informed or real choice at all.</para><para>The ability to make an informed choice, as my colleague Senator Sherry alluded to, is very much governed by their capacity to interpret the data on the various funds that will be put before them in key feature statements. To that end I want to refer as well to the ABS survey, `Aspects of Literacy: Assessed Skill Levels Australia 1996', where there was a ranking of levels 1 to 5. That particular survey showed that some 2.6 million Australians were at level 1—that is, of very poor skills in terms of literacy and numeracy—and 47 per cent were at levels 1 and 2. That meant that there were some or considerable difficulties in using many of the printed materials encountered in daily life. If that is the case, one must have real doubts that many Australians will be able to make an informed choice.</para><para>It is interesting to look at opinion on the issue of the social costs of adequate literacy by looking at an article by Robyn Hartley on that very issue: `The Social Costs of Inadequate Literacy'—a report to an international literacy year symposium in 1989. On social costs, she says:</para><para>Even highly literate people have trouble understanding some documents and forms. Those with inadequate literacy skills have no chance of understanding them. Documents which are based on legislation often tend to be particularly obscure.</para><para>She goes on to say:</para><para>However, much still remains to be done. Re-design of forms may well help the majority of people, but those who cannot read will still be unable to cope without assistance.</para><para>That is the problem being confronted in this issue of choice of fund. Many of the people who will be called upon to make a choice of fund do not have the requisite skills to be able to read the literature to make an informed choice, so we have a major problem with the proposition that is being put forward in this legislation. Many people will not be so disposed to make a properly informed decision such that there will be a net benefit to them in the longer term, because we are not 
 just dealing with `choice' but with `informed choice'.</para><para>Whilst we have the international experience in the UK and Chile on the issue of choice of funds, we have no similar experience in Australia. But it is interesting to look at the issue of choice of investment where there is an opportunity under Australian law for members of superannuation funds—where a choice is made available to them—to so make a choice. I looked in particular at one company in Melbourne which had 1,400 to 1,500 employees. Over a five-month period they put their employees through sessions of up to one hour at a time. The employees were presented with very sophisticated communications techniques on the issue of choice of investment as opposed to choice of fund. At the end of a rather protracted period of time—as I said, five months—where there had been considerable employer cooperation and sponsorship, less than 25 per cent of employees made a choice of investment.</para><para>The reason that they made a choice of investment was that the older members at that particular site wanted to see their money invested in a more conservative investment—to be put into cash—whilst younger members went very much for more equity in their mix of investment. The remainder, 75 per cent, opted for the default fund because in that they saw there was a reasonable return for them.</para><para>Mrs Birkensleigh of Coopers and Lybrand gave evidence to the committee of choice of investment in a number of other funds. For example, in 1995 in the Hesta fund, a very substantial fund indeed, only 54 people out of 125 exercised choice. In First State Super, 10 per cent made a choice, according to Mrs Birkensleigh's evidence, while 90 per cent did not. In BOC Gases, 12 out of 2,000 made a choice of investment. Coca-Cola Amatil won the prize for the best communication program for employees on choice of investment. Coca-Cola Amatil's experience was that, even with a prize-winning communication program, only 64 per cent made a choice, so 36 per cent chose to remain with the default option in terms of investment. In Telstra, a more recent example, only two per cent out of 72,000 made a choice of investment, whilst in 1996 
 Optus ran an intensive campaign which saw some 75 to 80 per cent make a choice of investment.</para><para>In the limited experience with choice of investment, there seems to be no clamouring on the part of those people who are participating in funds out there now to want to make even a choice of investment, let alone be devilled with the option of having to choose a fund. On the contrary, the evidence that the inquiry received showed that 70 per cent of people would not want to make a choice at all, which is contrary to the belief that people are clamouring to make a choice of superannuation fund in which to invest their money.</para><para>If this legislation is to proceed there needs to be some  substantial amendments to take cognisance of the fact that, firstly, there is a literacy and numeracy problem and, secondly, there is not an overwhelming demand for choice of fund. Choice of fund cannot, of course, rely on a default fund which is simply low risk and low return; that ignores the moral obligation of the trustees of the fund to maximise the return because it is a retirement benefit for those people who are members of the fund.</para><para>Likewise, it cannot be a high risk product. So the quality of a default fund becomes most important in the issue of choice of fund. It seems to me that there needs to be some mechanism by which a middle of the road fund which meets the aspirations of most people is somehow the default fund, and in many instances that is the existing industry fund.</para><para>In the brief time that I have left I want to mention the issue of education. It seems to me that, if choice of fund is to proceed, education will be paramount. There is no doubt in my mind from the evidence that came before a select committee of the Senate that it cannot be a one-off, glossy campaign. It is not a hit and miss issue. If informed choice is to be made, then the material that is used needs to be appropriate to the varying educational needs of those targeted by the campaign. There is a general lack of awareness of superannuation in the marketplace. So any campaign needs to be not a flash in the pan, one-off campaign but an ongoing con 
 certed campaign. It needs to be directed not only at employees but also employers, particularly small business employers for whom I believe this will pose a number of concerns. They have enough on their plate trying to run their business.</para><para>The other group that we heard from during the inquiry could be broadly described as community employers, the likes of P&amp;Cs at schools and some community organisations such as child-care centres, where the people serving on these P&amp;Cs and community organisations serve for only a relatively short period of time and are not across the minutiae of superannuation legislation. There would need to be a specially constructed campaign to meet their needs. Whilst they are not a large group, they are nonetheless an important group. If the legislation is to be complied with, their needs must be met.</para><para>Without a proper program, I believe we will see misinformation flourishing. As misinformation flourishes, any purpose that may have been there in giving people the right to exercise choice will be defeated completely. Choice is about one thing: that is, providing people with a better benefit. It is not about a reduction in benefit. As I have already stated, there seems to be a degree of scepticism about the ability of choice of fund as opposed to choice of investment to provide people with a better return for their retirement.</para><para>The government should not proceed with choice, in my view, and in the view of those who participated in the inquiry, until it can be satisfied that, as per the non-government senators' report at page 93 on choice of fund, there is a substantial recognition of what choice of fund means and how it applies. This is a challenge in itself, because it means overcoming the literacy and numeracy problems that seem to be so deep and profound in the community. If this is not done properly, we will not have informed choice. The words that kept ringing in my ears throughout the whole of the inquiry was that people had to make an informed choice—not just choice but an informed choice.</para><para>If choice is not properly exercised, it will not be of benefit to anyone. The education 
 program needs to be well tested to allow an informed choice. Otherwise we will see people making a choice that is too conservative or too risky. There seems to be no real demand for choice, and that must be a mitigating factor in the final package that is delivered if choice is to be made available to people. There is not a clamouring out there in the community by a large number of people to be able to make a choice. The majority are not going to benefit, in my opinion, from the option of making a choice of fund. They are likely in many instances to face a net economic loss. The bill needs to be modified to protect the interests of the owners of superannuation money—that is, the fund members. Fund members are entitled to have an expectation that there will be a maximisation of the return on their investment for their retirement. They are entitled to a retirement in dignity.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>2996</page.no><name role="metadata">Collins, Sen Jacinta</name><name role="display">Senator JACINTA COLLINS</name><name.id>GB6</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="r421">Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1998</inline> —or the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill No. 7 1997, as it was titled before it went before the Senate Economics Legislation Committee—includes a large number of unrelated taxation matters. Whilst, like others, I might be tempted to focus on the very important issue of choice of funds in superannuation, I am leaving those issues to my colleagues because I think it is equally important in the brief time I have in my speech during the second debate to deal with some of the other measures covered by this bill. In my speech I will be focusing on the restriction of choices in relation to anti-avoidance measures included in amendments to schedules 8 and 9 and the savings rebate scheme.</para></talk.start><para>These tax measures beg the question of why are we proceeding with this bill in the climate of anticipation of the government's tax plan for the election; why are we proceeding now with these measures? It was put to the committee that it was a priority of the government to proceed with the issues relating to superannuation, but there were other options than to try to rush, as this government did—or, in Senator Murray's words, to squeeze—this process through the parliamentary process.</para><para>The other big question I will be focusing on in this speech is how effective will these anti-avoidance measures and the savings rebate scheme be, given the limited consideration that has occurred of the proposals in the bill. In fact, we have considered various amendments also, as it became obvious that the original framing was inadequate. If in our consideration there are still areas of serious concern, why proceed now? Why not wait until these measures can be incorporated into the wonderful tax plan that we are all anticipating will come from the government in the next few weeks?</para><para>I would like to refer to comments made by Labor members of the Economics Legislation Committee in their report on these issues. We said quite clearly that Labor senators considered that the whole process adopted regarding this bill reflected poorly on the government and, regrettably, on the Senate process. The report was brief because we had very limited opportunities to consider concerns raised by various parties. Labor senators noted in the report:</para><para>The government has engaged in an appalling process which involved rushed hearings and inadequate public consultation. The Assistant Treasurer released 49 amendments to the legislation at 4 p.m. on Friday, 27 March, in the full knowledge that the hearings on the legislation were scheduled for the following Monday morning. Not surprisingly, the witnesses were not adequately able to deal with the legislation and the amendments and the quality of evidence was compromised.</para><para>To attempt to overcome this disgraceful performance by the government, the Labor senators proposed to the Senate that the committee report in May. This motion was amended, by the government and the Democrats, to the current inadequate reporting schedule. However, this action by Labor at least ensured another day of hearings was facilitated on 3 April 1998. Incredibly, when this further hearing was held, witnesses to the committee still did not have the complete bill to provide evidence about. In addition, the witnesses had to deal with the untenable situation where the government had introduced further legislation, <inline ref="r485">Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1998</inline> , earlier in the week, which impacts on the operation of the 
 bill before the committee. Why is the government pushing through these initiatives when we are waiting for that very broad plan?</para><para>I reiterate that it reflects the management by the government of these tax bills, but it also reflects the management that the government is going to put in relation to the overall tax debate. Adopting Senator Murray's phrase, I think we will be looking at a squeeze on the GST, where it will be impossible to have a rational assessment of the overall proposals in an attempt to squeeze through an alternative measure. The government does not want to line up some of these measures before us now with the GST, so it is trying to push them through now.</para><para>Let me start with schedule 8, with respect to dividend streaming. Senator Cook, in his speech during this debate, has already addressed this issue and applied what I will call the Parer test of efficacy. Again, the big question is: how effective will these measures be? Senator Cook and I are awaiting the minister's response about whether these anti-avoidance measures will void the behaviour of the likes of Senator Parer in avoiding their obligations.</para><para>With respect to schedule 9, there are two areas I would like to comment on. The relevant amendments look at distributions from private companies. This area covers measures directed at $110 million over three years, according to the Treasurer, Peter Costello, in what he is calling tax rorts.</para><para>Senator Cook briefly touched on a concept called notional dividends, which are declared as shares not yet issued but disguised as non-taxable loans. Again, we have another Parer test. The really concerning thing about this Parer test arose in questioning before the Australian Taxation Office during the estimates process. The tax office indicated that they do not even understand the concept of notional dividends. If this is the case, the tax office has a fair bit of work to do in order to bring themselves up to speed if they are going to enforce this legislation and deal with practices in relation to these sorts of avoidance rorts. If these fairly blatant ones, which have become public through Senator Parer's behav 
 iour, cannot be dealt with, what are they going to do with the more complex cases?</para><para>I would appreciate the minister's views on the arrangement masterminded by Senator Parer on whether notional dividends disguised as shareholder loans will be caught by this legislation. If the minister is unable to provide an appropriate answer in his speech at the conclusion of the second reading debate, then I suggest that he should be prepared for the committee stage, where we will be seeking—in the more detailed discussions of the bill—an explanation as to how they would apply. We will not have very effective anti-avoidance measures if we are not able to pick up this sort of behaviour, but that also does not seem to concern the government greatly.</para><para>Another area in relation to schedule 9 that Senator Murray touched on was that of employee ownership schemes. Senator Murray had a concern—and it was raised in discussions in relation to the bill—that such schemes might be caught up in schedule 9. Whilst the Labor Party supports employee ownership schemes and incentives towards such schemes, we do not do so with respect to schemes that would operate at the expense of revenue. In other words, not all schemes are appropriate as employee ownership schemes. Again, the Parer test highlights the issue that, in some cases, employee ownership is really a fraud because it is not open to employees—it is only open to some very select employees who get a massive tax advantage.</para><para>Let us look at the QCMM (ESP) scheme and highlight the problem there. The employee share plan was, in essence, an executive remuneration scheme for Senator Parer and his fellow directors. Ralph Willis described such schemes—in response to Peter Costello's announcement that the then opposition would oppose a crackdown on such arrangements—as schemes designed to convert salary into shares or share rights in order to take advantage of the open-ended tax deferral opportunities.</para><para>As in the Parer case, three associated companies—QCMM Pty Ltd, AQRM Pty Ltd and Tremell Pty Ltd—collectively contributed $2.7 million to QCMM (ESP) Pty Ltd in 
 consideration of the issue of UNC employer class shares. However, the purchase of these shares was tax deductible, yet, in essence, no economic loss was borne by the companies involved. Parer and his fellow directors, in turn, subscribed for employee class shares—Senator Parer, employee class shares! QCMM (ESP) Pty Ltd paid to the value of 1c each. They then became entitled to the pool of $2.7 million, through the creation of employee contribution accounts, in proportion to the number of shares they had subscribed for. In Senator Parer's case, it was a total of 44 one cent shares.</para><para>The tax lurk is that the companies can immediately claim $2.7 million in tax deductions yet no tax is payable by any of the holders of the employee class shares until they redeem them with QCMM (ESP) Pty Ltd. This is where the unlimited tax deferral opportunity arose, and I am interested in how the minister will respond in relation to whether the proposed amendments will effectively deal with this sort of rort.</para><para>Lastly, I would like to look at the government's discredited savings rebate. This measure is so important to the government that we are only now debating it, one year after it was announced, and it is within a mixture of unrelated tax measures. The fact that we are debating it after the 1998-99 budget has been announced shows how important the government thinks it is. What we know, though, is that, far from making a contribution to national savings, it will actually lead to dissavings, thus Senator Cook's suggestion that it should be called the dissavings rebate.</para><para>When announced last year, it carried with it a $3.8 billion cost to revenue over three years. So before we see any contribution to national savings—again, the efficacy test—this $3.8 billion has to be made up through increased private sector savings. The cat was let out of the bag—although we had been saying it for some time—that to qualify for the savings rebate all you had to do was receive income outside of the PAYE system. As Annamaria Carey of the Taxation Institute stated:</para><para>The savings rebate in reality is a tax cut because income—not savings—is the sole criteria for the rebate.</para><para>So we have a tax cut before the government's income tax cuts that are meant to be coming. Why are we dealing with this now if this is meant to fit in with an overall tax reform? The answer is obviously that it is not genuine.</para><para>It is also significant that 74.5 per cent of all income generated in Australia is from salary and wages and therefore will not qualify for the rebate, as opposed to trusts and partnerships which comprise 7.4 per cent of all income and gross rent at 3.4 per cent. This means that the two top sources of income in Australia after salary and wages, which only comprise 10.8 per cent of all income generated in Australia, will qualify amongst other sources for the savings rebate. And, as we know, there are not too many battlers out there with partnerships and trusts, unless we are talking to the battlers from Brighton or the struggling families from Toorak.</para><para>But, as we know, this government—particularly half of its front bench—has put its trust in trusts. Who is at the epicentre of the trust owning members of the coalition? It is none other than Senator Parer. Who stands to gain from the savings rebate? Again, it is the Parer test. We have Parer, a battler, a struggler—he has remained in the ministry—and the very type of person that this government intends to benefit from the savings rebate! After all, there are hundreds of thousands of struggling Australian families out there with $60,000 just sitting in the bank earning five per cent interest, or $3,000, in order to qualify for the maximum rebate!</para><para>But the best part is that every beneficiary of the Parer family coal trust who receives $3,000 by way of suspect trust distribution—the things we are trying to avoid—will receive the full $450 rebate and, what is more, they do not even have to save it. Not a bad lurk, one might say. But, for Senator Parer and his like, this is par for the course or probably a bit at the low end of the tax minimisation scale. For some, paying tax has become an optional exercise and this government now subscribes to the Parer principle: 
 don't pay what you don't have to and, importantly, don't get caught.</para><para>We will continue to highlight the hypocrisy of this  government: it wants to impose a GST on battling Australian families yet is quite happy to allow or, I should say, assist the likes of Senator Parer to milk the system for what it is worth, regardless of the public cost. I therefore seek an explanation, again related to the Parer test, from the minister on how the mere distribution of moneys from a trust such as Senator Parer's contributes to national savings when the money is received by beneficiaries who do not even have to save it.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5F4</name.id><name role="metadata">CALVERT</name><name role="display">Senator Calvert</name></talker><para>—Mr Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order.

But let us stick to the topic, which is to do with superannuation. The context of the whole debate on choice of fund is: why was compulsory superannuation introduced in the early 1990s by the Labor government? It was introduced because this country had a national savings problem and it had a potential problem down the track of coping with the aging baby boomer generation. Those were the twin objectives; that is what superannuation was about. Probably the most malicious policies that have been followed by this government since it came to office have been in superannuation and they have been put in place on the surface to improve national savings and deal with these issues. But when you strip them down and actually have a look at them, you find that each of these proposals has actually sabotaged those aims and objectives.</para></talk.start></continue><para>First we saw RSAs—retirement savings accounts. If ever there was a crock, it is an RSA. If ever there was a payback to their mates who financed them in the last campaign—the  banks—it is RSAs. They are a low return product guaranteed to leave you hundreds and thousands of dollars worse off if you are a young worker and you are put into an RSA and you stick with it. There was no attempt to give what was known as a `health warning' to try to cap it so that if your RSA got to $10,000 you would be given real information by the supplier of that product. No, you could just sit there for your working 
 life and at the end of the day find yourself hundreds of thousands of dollars worse off.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>NB5</name.id><name role="metadata">CAMPBELL</name><name role="display">Senator George Campbell</name></talker><para>—That even had visions on the pension.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name></talker><para>—That is exactly right, Senator Campbell.

Ordinary workers' superannuation funds paying; their returns reduced because of the extra administrative costs introduced by this government—reducing the returns to funds and the retirement incomes of ordinary working Australians. Again, coming up soon to the Senate we have superannuation to be taken out as an industrial matter—an attempt by the government to again reduce the impact on national savings. As shown in information given to the Senate Committee on Superannuation by the Institute of Actuaries, if you move from the award obligation of monthly payments to the minimum SGC requirement of annual payments you are, on average, three to four per cent worse off just by the stroke of a pen—that is $20,000 to $30,000 worse off at the end of your working life just because the government have a fixation. That is less national savings yet again.</para><para>And now we have choice of fund. After all this time you might begin to ponder why the government is actually pursuing this policy. Mr Miles, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister, when introducing the first of the backgrounds on this bill, which was the implementation date, said, and I am quoting from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>:</para><para>It is clear that the opposition amendments are all about denying Australian workers the choice of superannuation funds. This really is the Labor Party's agenda, similar to what the agenda was many years ago when these other funds—</para><para>other funds—</para><para>which the Labor Party set up came in.</para><para>That is what this really is about. This is about a mean spirited, ignorant understanding and an attack on industry funds.</para><para>What sort of national policy premise is the vindictive approach of this coalition—an approach to undermine and destroy industry funds? That is what it is all about. Mr Miles is the one who has finally let the cat out of the bag. We all knew it in here. We have talked about it before. That is what it is about: the Labor Party's other agenda. I would like to talk about that other agenda item, industry funds. Since their inception in the early 1980s, industry funds have provided for rapid and sustained reductions in costs to their membership. In that time weekly admin fees have fallen from an average of $4 to less than $1 today. These charges compare most favourably with those imposed by banks on, for example, their business transactions. According to Christopher Butler, managing director of Sedgwick Noble Lowndes, in the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline> dated 9 January 1998, page 19, the average charges for non-profit industry and corporate funds are half the average of those funds that are in the market for profit—half of the profit. I plead guilty to that agenda. We have halved the costs in that area alone in the few years since industry funds were created. I plead guilty to that agenda any day of the week.</para><para>The most significant improvements in service delivery are the adoption of member protection of small account balances, the administration of the extremely complex `surcharge' arrangements and the implementa 
 tion of member investment choice within the one fund. That is right; industry funds are at the cutting edge of member investment—not holding back, trying to keep members' funds. Fund asset management charges have been halved, from 0.6 per cent of assets under management to about 0.3 per cent today. Industry funds have introduced bulk death and invalidity insurance, and they have also provided these at about half the cost of the same retail insurance product. Half the management fees gone and half those on death and disability gone. I will plead guilty to that any day of the week, because that is what industry funds have done.</para><para>Before Senator Kemp comes into the chamber and says, `But, Senator Conroy, you have not mentioned where you used to work,' I proudly state that I used to work for an industry fund, the TWU superannuation fund. I am absolutely proud to declare that I have been a part of reducing those charges. `What about returns?' you might say. `Those industry funds run by unions must be not delivering to their members in terms of investment returns.' At the same time industry funds have credited members with investment returns in excess of 10 per cent on average each year since their inception. This demonstrates that industry funds have delivered superior returns to their membership by comparison to other super vehicles. The AMPs and the National Mutuals have not been able to deliver that sort of return. National Mutual practically went broke and gave $100 million to John Elliott to go and play with in a little frolic with Elders.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>NB5</name.id><name role="metadata">CAMPBELL</name><name role="display">Senator George Campbell</name></talker><para>—AMP is too busy turning itself into a bank.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name></talker><para>—Exactly, Senator Campbell—a bank. So what we have seen is a vicious attack by this government on workers' retirement incomes because it is paranoid about industry funds. It does not matter that these funds have improved national savings; it does not matter that they pay out hundreds of thousands of dollars back into retirement incomes; it does not matter that they have introduced competition—what the government says it is about here today. 
 Industry funds are the competition in this issue.</para></talk.start></continue><para>But who has asked for choice? Have employees asked for choice? Have employers asked for choice?

Well, they are not; they are quite specifically not. It is their money but, despite the deception of the name of this bill, they are still not going to get choice of fund.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Probably the most vital question, though, that has to be dealt with by the chamber and by the government is the question of an informed choice. There was not one witness, not even the government itself, that was prepared to say, `We don't want informed choice.' That is the nub of the argument if this legislation gets passed in its current form: informed choice. We have got a situation where this choice is going to have onerous administrative costs and possible legal action down the track. It has attempted to take away some of the liability. Whether that is able to be achieved is still a matter of some discussion. There was plenty of evidence before the committee that it was not going to be able to take away the liability. Even the government admitted that there is still the common law. There are legal aspects that cannot be legislated away.</para><para>The government have failed on all counts on this bill to deliver to Australian workers. Choice will not lower the costs. Probably the biggest furphy in this debate is a claim that choice, through their competitive process, will lower the costs to ordinary Australian workers. We had the Commonwealth Bank come before us and I asked them, `After choice has been introduced, the winds of competition, 
 can you guarantee me that your RSA product will be one cent cheaper in one year's time than it is today?' They had to say that no, they could not. The banks could not even promise that an RSA would be cheaper after the winds of competition have swept through.</para><para>Who is benefiting, then? It is certainly not the workers. It is the competition that we introduced that has forced down the costs—not the bogus competition that this government are introducing.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>NB5</name.id><name role="metadata">CAMPBELL</name><name role="display">Senator George Campbell</name></talker><para>—Real competition.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name></talker><para>—Real competition. We introduced it into this area, not the government. Many of the submissions illustrated to us the increased costs, especially in marketing. There is no question that marketing is going to have to massively increase. One industry fund said to me that they are going to have to double their admin budget just to cope with the possible marketing extras. They are going to be up against the AMPs and the National Mutuals and all the TV advertising, and they are still going to be competing. I have got a prediction for the government and their narrow-minded agenda here: not only will industry funds survive choice but they will prosper. Down the track, when the government sits back and thinks, `How much damage have we done to industry funds?', they are going to say, `We have failed.' Industry funds will grow under this legislation. Industry funds are not afraid of this legislation. Industry funds are happy with choice, but they want employee choice, not employer choice.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The government's model increases costs. It sees employees possibly forced into expensive entry management and exit fee regimes. That is what the choice is here. You could see employees forced into funds, especially new employees, that in actual fact are far more expensive with lower returns. And they do not have to be in RSA. We have already had Senator Sherry give us some excellent examples, tabled in the chamber, of how much more expensive, with poorer returns, master trusts can be. One example that I have, based on an eight per cent return and a range of other figures, is that you can be, over your 
 working life, $30,000 worse off again by being forced into a master super trust instead of your industry fund. Another $30,000 of national savings gone, of a worker's retirement income gone, just because the government want to be narrow-minded.</para><para>We will be asking Senator Kemp or Senator Ellison, if he is here for the committee stage, some questions about the education campaign. If the government is really fair dinkum about this bill, they will tell us what sort of budget they are looking at—what sort of education campaign. We introduced what at the time was the biggest change in superannuation in years, in the early 1990s, and we spent about $14 million on the money tree campaigns. There were a couple of them. Most people would remember them nowadays—the little growing money tree you saw on telly. That was a national campaign, on prime-time television, just to educate people that compulsory superannuation was coming. It was the most basic of concepts. But this shake-up we are seeing is even bigger. If you looked at our campaign in the early 1990s, which in today's dollars was probably about $16 million or $17 million, you would think that this was a bigger change and that you would therefore need a bigger campaign. What have we seen so far from this government? Four million dollars. You could not run any decent sort of advertising campaign anywhere with $4 million on even the simplest of concepts.</para><para>This government is not fair dinkum about this issue.

Are you prepared to do that? Those are the questions you are going to have to answer when we get to the committee stage.</para><para>I could go on extensively but I am running out of time and I did want to get to the savings rebate. As has already been mentioned, the great lie of the savings rebate is that it will improve national savings. It will not. Why do I say it will not? Because Ted Evans, the Secretary to the Treasury, has admitted it will not. He has admitted that it is possible to obtain the full rebate if you have not only not increased your savings but also if you have decreased your savings. You still get the rebate. How can you justify, on equity grounds or even economic efficiency grounds, a rebate that is completely contrary to your policy, on the admission of your senior bureaucrat?</para><para>In my last minute I would like to turn to an article in the `Smart Money' section of the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline> on 2 May 1998. The heading is `Rebate can be milked for more'. The report is by Alison Kahler and it reads:</para><para>At first glance, $225 seems a trifling amount but the new savings rebate can be milked for much more.

There has been a continual call from the Greens to ensure a greater level of choice in obligatory retirement savings schemes. The Greens WA believe that choice, in principle, is a worthy goal that allows consumers to identify and promote their individual interest. It allows them to have control and ownership of their investments and to choose to support investment companies that are in line with their own financial or ethical interests.</para></talk.start><para>Choice gives credence to different values, priorities and ideas. Choice is a great concept in theory. In reality, the choice scheme presented by the government comes with a whole lot of problems for consumers, employers and fund providers. In reality, the problems are so significant that it is dubious that there will be an overall positive outcome for this regime.</para><para>Before I launch into a discussion of the bill at hand, I would like to make a point that I have made many times before. There has been a call from the Greens to recognise that obligatory investment programs, such as compulsory superannuation or RSAs, are not necessarily the best investment vehicle for workers. We have continually pointed out that investment in such things as a small business or a home may provide more substantial and far reaching benefits. This goes beyond the direct benefits as financial investments and recognises that there may be substantial or ongoing human benefits in terms of use value of such investments and, in the case of investment in small business, ensuring the capacity of older people to continue working.</para><para>Getting back to the bill, there is a plethora of extremely worrying issues in relation to the issue of choice in superannuation funds. The government's approach is haphazard, inconsistent and ideological, and it fails to recognise the realities of the superannuation marketplace. The government has been claiming it has been doing a wondrous thing for Australia's citizens by providing them with choice in their superannuation funds. The reality is less than wondrous.</para><para>Firstly, the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation received a substantial amount of evidence indicating that employees were not especially interested in choice, nor were they equipped to handle it. The government's push for choice seemed largely based on an ideology that sees liberty as paramount in all circumstances, rather than on a genuine pragmatic interest in responding to community desires.</para><para>Secondly, the regime provided is significantly substandard. What they have really provided is a regime that offers employers choice. Employers are the ones that choose what range of choice they will offer their employees. Employers will benevolently decide to offer unlimited choice, and employers will still have the power of veto over their employees' choices. To rub salt in the wound, there is no independent arbiter to whom the employee can appeal.</para><para>It is a regime that leaves underinformed consumers with an uphill battle to understand the differences in funds. It is a regime that diminishes the longstanding union involvement that has protected union rights. It is a regime that gives consumers few opportunities to gain redress if funds are sold for the wrong reasons. It is a regime that increases compliance for employers, and marketing costs for fund holders. It is interesting that this government, which calls welfare beneficiaries `customers', seems to think that the customers of superannuation do not have the right to have some accountability in what has been happening.</para><para>It is a regime that may not actually usher in real investment choice. A choice of four different funds does not necessarily translate into four substantially different investment 
 choices. The focus of choice is not on which financial institutions can make similar investments but on the choice of investment targets. It is a regime that does not consider or accommodate people who may want to invest ethically or locally. Despite all these problems, it is a system that, until a short time ago, the government was attempting to rush through parliament before 1 July 1998.</para><para>Let us look at real choice. The crux of offering real choice, we believe, could be seen as threefold. Firstly, real choice offers the ability for employees to choose substantially different funds. The funds must provide the ability to choose the level of risk and growth, the locality of the investment—it could be off-shore or in Australia, and it could be regional—or the type of investment, ethical or otherwise.</para><para>The Greens WA have continued to call for options that support the Australian economy and employment within an ethical context. We have frequently pursued options within superannuation funds for investment in locally or regionally owned small or medium business; ecologically sustainable investment; non-military oriented, peaceful investment; investment that does not exploit people from developing nations; or options which do not force individuals to invest in industries that they believe are unethical—because my ethics may not be the same as everybody else's, and in fact I am sure they will not be.</para><para>Secondly, real choice requires comprehensive education so that each individual can determine what their interests are and which fund matches those interests most closely. Thirdly, real choice involves uniform disclosure among competing funds. Consumers must be able to accurately and confidently distinguish between the products offered. Associated with education and disclosure is the notion that real choice involves the absence of unrelated influencing factors. The lure of a kickback for an employer or the promise of a get-rich-quick scheme by rascally commission agents should not be considerations. It is broadly agreed that education and uniform disclosure standards are crucial.</para><para>These suggestions have been coming from a whole range of participants in the industry. 
 Yet the government plans to make this change without ensuring or providing the resources for education, as Senator Conroy has mentioned. The resources are downright inadequate to provide clear and easily accessible information on which to base decisions. The Australian Consumers Association has estimated, by looking at the budget of the Australian Taxation Office, that the government has allocated the hearty sum of $1.60 per fund member, to be spent over four years. Whoopee!</para><para>The decision about which super fund to invest in is, for many people, perhaps the most significant investment in their lives, and the government gives them that princely sum to find out what they are doing. Without adequate resources, even the most creative education campaign cannot operate effectively. The government's pledge of $12 million over four years is judged to be hopelessly deficient on all fronts.</para><para>The Greens WA applaud the deferral of the operation of the choice provisions in the bill. The deferral was ostensibly necessary for a proper education campaign to occur. The government, however, did not indicate that they would defer the starting date for such substantive reasons. Their commitment to proper education, therefore, is questionable. The deferral was actually out of necessity, because the legislation was slow in moving through the parliament.</para><para>The other fundamental prerequisite for real consumer choice is the establishment of uniform and comparable disclosure requirements. The committee report extensively outlines the need for clear information that is easily digestible and allows consumers to make accurate comparisons between different options. Simple and meaningful key features need to be in a standard format to enable rational and accurate comparisons. The Greens acknowledge that the government is working on this aspect, and we will be keen to scrutinise the regulations.</para><para>Let us go to the default fund. The government's treatment of the default fund shows a fundamental misunderstanding of the superannuation marketplace. There is a fundamental refusal to accept the realities of the willing 
 ness, or lack thereof, of the community to take an interest in superannuation. The government has provided that the default fund can be any fund that the employer chooses. There is a fundamental refusal to accept that there are risks involved in leaving this choice to employers. Those people who do not think that coercion exists in the workplace are naive in the extreme.</para><para>Let us look for a moment at the inconsistent reasoning behind this whole issue. Let us look at the reason that Australia has decided to have a compulsory superannuation scheme in the first place. The very first point that comes to mind is demographics. It raises a good question: why did this happen? I guess partly it was because Labor did not want to look at what was necessary to provide properly funded pensions, but one fundamental reason is possibly that they thought it was impossible to rely on all Australians to make long-term financial decisions in their own interests.</para><para>Of course, on a deeper, structural level, compulsory superannuation was introduced to ensure that government could reduce its obligation in respect of older people on a per capita basis. It is a crucial step on the road to dismantling and stigmatising the universal pension. It fits very neatly with the economic fundamentalist philosophy of absolving governments from all responsibility to maintain equitable living standards for all Australians throughout their lives.</para><para>Where there is a compulsory superannuation scheme in place, there will always be a certain number of people who will not actively choose a super fund. Regardless of the amount of education that is offered by the government, there will always be a certain percentage of people who will not investigate which super fund will best meet their needs. It may be for reasons of financial illiteracy or because it is not an issue that they care to turn their minds to, but realistically there will always be this percentage. Indeed, this has been the experience in state schemes in New South Wales and Queensland offering choice, and where choice has been offered between funds. The government, however, has a naive belief that its education campaign can overcome all apathy or ignorance in the communi 
 ty. Clearly this is at odds with reality and experience.</para><para>When the reality of apathy is taken into account, the default fund becomes a crucial and important instrument. The employees who do not actively choose a super fund will be left to the whim of what the employer chooses. Granted, this may not always be a bad thing: some employers may choose very good funds to have as default funds. However, this is not assured. On a most conservative calculation, if only one per cent of the work force end up in bad default funds and they lose only $20,000 each, this will total a loss of $2 billion. This possibility does not seem to concern the government.</para><para>A major concern is that employers are not subject to any legal action if they fail to act prudently. Employees effectively have no legal redress for negligent decisions by employers. The government has stripped the AIRC of its power to arbitrate on superannuation matters, and the constitutionality of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal is questionable. Employers will have a distinct incentive to go with the fund that offers the lowest rate of compliance cost or some kind of kickback. There is a clear need for an impartial dispute resolutions body in light of the introduction of the high level of discretion for employers.</para><para>The Greens (WA) support the committee's view that minimum requirements should be applied to default funds to ensure their integrity. Such requirements are not especially burdensome as many funds worth their salt would comply with the minimum standards anyway. In addition, the Greens (WA) see merit in determining the default fund by reference to the relevant industrial award where that is applicable.</para><para>As I have made clear on previous occasions, I clearly reject the right of an employer to influence in any way the membership of an employee in a retirement savings account. There are clear drawbacks to these accounts. They have no minimal control of some group at least theoretically representing their contributors. RSAs represent investment that is not transparent and which is determined by banks.</para><para>Investment in the banking sector is open to international players. Increasingly, even those banks whose character is presented as `Australian' have substantial investments, including ownership of banks, abroad. Ownership of foreign banks often entails a management structure where foreign interests are directly represented and funds are freely transferred and invested in any nation, and assets collected in this nation may be lent in any nation. The interests of management in such banks may be totally divorced from the interests of Australia, Australian investors, Australian industry or the Australian economy. The Greens will be supporting measures to ensure that incentives to commission agents and any kickbacks to employers are prohibited.</para><para>The legislation seeks to strip superannuation of its status as an industrial relations issue. Significant superannuation gains have been made by unions through both the judicial and legislative process. The industrial setting of superannuation is currently manifested by union representation on industry funds and superannuation clauses in awards. This bill effectively removes superannuation clauses from industrial awards and establishes super as an issue for direct determination between an employer and an employee. Any kind of collective decision making for superannuation arrangements will be watered down significantly. The expertise built up by unions and their important role in consumer protection will be largely lost.</para><para>I believe the industry funds have been sensible, secure and valuable investment funds for members in the past. Many of the industry funds already provide choices to employees regarding how their funds are invested. The presence of the unions has meant that many workers have had a strong and informed voice to advocate for consumer benefits on their behalf. In addition, many industry funds were able to keep administrative fees low by economies of scale and minimal marketing.</para><para>The proposed choice regime is supposed to provide, as indicated in the minister's second reading speech on the bill, `greater choice and control over their superannuation savings'. As outlined, there is no assurance it will provide 
 choice, and whether it will provide control is highly questionable when many employees have little education or expertise in investment funds.</para><para>This industrial relations change is a significant change that should not be lightly dismissed. I notice the Democrats and the ALP have recognised this significance: their respective positions on this issue both attempt to ensure that superannuation remains within the award system. This, we believe, is a valuable goal. The issue for the Greens is going to be whether or not the issues of choice within this bill and within these schemes are realised; so we have a dilemma and we are still listening to the debate as it goes on.</para><para>This change is indicative of a broader government plan that undermines unions and other longstanding institutions that were formed to address systematic inequalities of wealth and power. We have the work for the dole scheme and its transfer-the-problem-to-the-individual musical theme of `search for the hero inside yourself'; so if you do not have a job, it is your fault because you have not looked for that hero far enough inside yourself.</para><para>The problem comes down to putting the finger on making people feel bad about being recipients of welfare. There are a lot of issues here tied up in these kinds of things about whether or not people have the right to continue to be involved with industry funds, but there is also the issue of whether or not these industry funds can offer the real range of ethical choices that exist.</para><para>The savings rebate—or the `tax offset' as it is referred to—is totally inappropriate in the context of the government cutting the services and benefits for the most disadvantaged in our society. It does not even come close to ameliorating the wads of funding the Treasurer has slashed in the last few budgets. The savings rebate is a replacement of the Keating-Willis superannuation contribution matching where the government could match employee contributions. As we pointed out at the time, that scheme had major problems as it used taxpayers' money collected from all to fund retirement incomes on the basis that 
 those who have more shall receive more and those who have less shall receive less. It amplified and extended the imbalances in working life into retirement.</para><para>Despite this fundamental inequity, the Keating-Willis plan was worth nearly seven times the benefit of this Costello rebate. The rebate promises a maximum of 15c in the dollar, as opposed to a superannuation contribution that was matched dollar for dollar—thus there is an 85 per cent reduction in benefit. Worker contributions of $1,000 would have gained an extra $1,000 under the Keating-Willis plan. Under the Costello plan, they receive a princely $150.</para><para>The savings rebate is typical of the kind of smoke and mirrors approach the government tries to use when it is trying to sell an inequitable measure as a positive for all. For the savings rebate to be characterised as a benefit for all, certain assumptions must be made. There must be an assumption that everyone is financially capable of making superannuation contributions, or that everyone has sufficient savings or investment income to be able to take advantage of the rebate. Clearly, these assumptions bear no resemblance to reality.</para><para>Low wage earners and social security recipients spend a high proportion of their income on basic necessities and have a limited capacity to save. Even if these people could save, the level of savings would not enable them to take full advantage of the rebate. They would have to contribute $3,000 per annum to superannuation or save between $50,000 and $100,000 in other savings vehicles to receive the full $450 rebate each year. The main beneficiaries of this rebate are high income earners and wealthy retirees. It is not a progressive measure.</para><para>With respect to payment of PAYE, PPS, RPS and so on to the Australian Taxation Office, this bill requires remittances by electronic means. The government has created a curious situation. While an attempt to rationalise and streamline the system of remittance is positive, negative and unfair implications have been ignored. The government has obviously turned a blind eye to the implications that the change has for business. Forwarding payments by cheque has previous 
 ly been a perfectly legitimate form of commercial transaction in this country. Now it is not even an option for large remitters. Beyond the expensive and time consuming compliance measures that businesses are faced with, it will be an offence, and there will be a penalty, for failing to pay electronically. These fines are downright unfair and misguided. They are not aimed at what they are trying to prevent—that is, stopping large payers from deferring payment because a cheque is not cleared for some days.</para><para>All in all, I think there are some major problems. The situation that has been presented to us is clearly unacceptable and unfair. It is another example of the government turning a relatively simple concept into a dog's dinner. The bill is a disaster. Nearly every aspect contains anomalies and injustices. This is not a bill to be proud of. It is an embarrassing bill that has wasted a lot of people's valuable time and energy.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>3008</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator CHRIS EVANS</name><name.id>AX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My remarks on the <inline ref="r421">Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1998 </inline> will go mainly to the question of the choice of fund provisions contained in the bill. In the short time available to me this evening, I would like to make some comments on that issue and I will also make some comments during the committee stage of the bill.</para></talk.start><para>It is important to say at the outset that superannuation in Australia is compulsory and the Australian population is ageing. So superannuation is a particularly important issue, and it is particularly important that parliament deals with it very seriously and provides not only good laws in terms of superannuation but also clear policy that allows people to have confidence in the superannuation system and to plan for their retirement in a secure environment.</para><para>The shemozzle that we have seen in relation to the government's plans for choice has worked against confidence in the superannuation system in Australia and has provided people with reasons to be concerned about the future of the superannuation industry and about their retirement income. I think that is unfortunate. The government's decision to defer some of the measures proposed in terms 
 of choice is a good one, but it would have been much better if, in doing so, the government had dealt with a range of other concerns—some of which I will allude to tonight—that have been raised by people in Australia involved in the industry.</para><para>I think it would be a good thing if the national superannuation policy encouraged real choice so that people could choose investments which were as secure and as rewarding as possible so as to provide them with the best possible retirement income. It is very hard for anyone to oppose the principle of choice, but when you try to implement the principle it is much more difficult to ensure that you give effect to the very laudable motives that it represents.</para><para>The government is very keen on the theory of competition, which will make for lower prices in superannuation and greater efficiency. It says, `If you give choice, the market will apply those pressures and we'll all be better off as a result.' I think that is far too simplistic a notion. It does not take account of a range of issues like the costs of advertising and other competition costs that will be built into profit margins. The government really has to make the case for its model to prove that it is more efficient and that competition will deliver some of the things that the government claims. I do not think the government has made that case out.</para><para>We in the Labor Party think that a good superannuation policy should be based on a range of key principles. They include: availability to all workers; real choice through education, freedom from employer pressure, and dispute resolution; secure, higher returns; and administrative simplicity. When you apply those sorts of criteria to the government's proposal in this bill, it really fails the test. What the Labor Party has been arguing for in recent months provides sounder principles on which to build a choice regime in Australian superannuation policy and, obviously, we will be seeking support for amendments to reflect what we think is a sounder basis for a choice regime.</para><para>Tonight I will not have time to cover all of the issues I would like to in this debate, and obviously we will do that in the committee 
 stage. However, the first thing I would say is that this bill ought to deliver a real choice of products to people who are on superannuation in Australia and that the government would have been better off taking an evolutionary, rather than a revolutionary, approach in dealing with this policy.</para><para>I believe that requiring choice internal to funds would have been a better first step. It would have allowed for a more gradual introduction of a choice regime which, in turn, would allow for education and for monitoring of the take-up and the experiences of providing choice to people. As I say, I believe an evolutionary approach rather than a revolutionary approach would have been a far sounder way of dealing with this very major change to superannuation in this country.</para><para>As we have seen in the international experience, competition and the opening up of superannuation do not necessarily lead to the sorts of outcomes that we all think are desirable. You only have to look at the British or Chilean experience to know that there are real pitfalls in this area if we do not proceed with caution. So, while one can agree with the theory and the principle of choice, one does have to take very responsible attitude to the implementation of that theory. I believe that the government has allowed its ideology to override proper, sound principles and caution in the development of the choice regime.</para><para>One of the real ironies of this whole thing is that the government's proposition, as it has finally evolved, gives most of the choice to the employer. The employee does not enjoy the widest choice available; in fact, they get to choose between schemes offered by their employer, schemes chosen by their employer. So this is very much a question of employer choice as much as employee choice. That is the government's reaction to the very real difficulties of providing unlimited choices.</para><para>No-one pretends that there are not real administrative and other difficulties associated with providing an open choice of any fund to any employee. But the government, in responding to that difficulty, has very much taken the availability of choice away from employees and put that choice in the hands of 
 employers. That is of great concern because I think it gives too much ability to the employers to apply pressure to employees, and it upsets the balance that I believe should be established in terms of the choice regime.</para><para>Coming from Western Australia as I do, I have seen this choice theory applied in industrial relations by the Western Australian state government. The experience there has been that a regime of offering choice in terms of award or workplace agreements to employees has, in fact, now seen the state government implementing a system where they only provide the choice of workplace agreements to new starters. The choice that supposedly surrounded the rhetoric of the new industrial relations regime has been replaced by conditions that remove any choice of the employee. So I am a bit cynical about the Liberal Party's attitude and understanding of choice. As I say, the industrial relations experience in Western Australia means that that has given power to the employer rather than the employees. I believe that that is a real concern also in this area of superannuation.</para><para>There is also the question about prevention of the pressure on employees from sorts of high pressure sales techniques. One of the good things about the development of superannuation in this country over the last 10 years is that a lot of those practices that were evident in the personal superannuation and life insurance area 15 to 20 years ago have gone. The complaints you used to get about people buying products they did not want, the lack of understanding by people purchasing products not delivering what they thought they would deliver—all of those complaints about insurance sales and superannuation sales—have not been eradicated totally but have been greatly diminished as the superannuation regime and proper accountability measures have been put in place by this parliament.</para><para>I very much worry about what this choice regime will do in terms of the reintroduction of commissioned selling agents and the pressure for people to go out and sell various schemes in competition with other schemes. We should be very concerned that we do not take a backwards step to the days where that sort of pressure, manipulation and coercion 
 really hurt people in very serious ways and resulted in people making very poor choices about their financial affairs, as I say, in terms of superannuation and insurance.</para><para>That leads me to a whole range of issues like education—which has been talked about by other speakers and which is obviously very important—about disclosure and the need for the key feature statements to be a key part of any regime. The government still has not provided satisfactory progress on the key feature statements, in my view and in the view of a number of senior commentators in the financial area. That is a very important part of any regime of choice—that people are able to make an informed decision between various products and have standard reporting of fees and conditions. That is not, I think, satisfactorily in place at this stage.</para><para>There is a range of other issues, which we will debate in the committee stage, regarding the likelihood of employees choosing the appropriate investments. The theory that people will necessarily choose the best investment option for themselves is, I think, not supported in practice. My own personal experience of trying to encourage people in a fund that I had some responsibility for was that they often took very conservative choices—particularly women—which did not result in their getting the best benefit at the end of their time. These are serious issues that will impact on people's retirement incomes and lifestyles; they will affect the whole Australian community.</para><para>So there is a whole range of issues that I believe really needs to be taken much more seriously by the government and the parliament. The fiasco regarding the timing of the introduction of the choice and the concern about the government failing to respond to industry criticisms have led to a sapping of confidence in superannuation and a confusion about where we are going. The government really has to step back from its sort of neo-liberal idea of choice at all costs and work with the parliament and the industry to have a much more constructive outcome than the one it currently proposes.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Sitting suspended from 6.30 p.m. to 7.30 p.m.</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>3011</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I wish to speak on just one aspect of the <inline ref="r421">Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1998</inline>  tonight and that is the schedule dealing with superannuation choice. This aspect of the bill has been the subject of a comprehensive Senate inquiry and in the course of that inquiry I think there were some very substantial holes identified in the government's choice policy provisions.</para></talk.start><para>The government has claimed that its choice policy will increase competitiveness and efficiency in the superannuation industry and lead to improved returns on superannuation savings. However, the evidence to the committee put this claim into some considerable doubt. The simple problem is that it is unlikely that the vast majority of workers are in a position to make an educated or informed choice on superannuation or, I suggest, are actually interested in doing so. Evidence from the United States suggests that workers are very risk averse in respect of superannuation and often opt for low risk profiles, with the result that their final returns are reduced considerably.</para><para>The choice proposal also opens up the compulsory award based super system to competition from the commercial funds like the AMP, National Mutual, MLC and such like. These funds carry considerably higher administration costs than the award based industry funds because of the need to advertise and to build up market share. The superannuation committee heard evidence that industry fund admin costs were up to 80 per cent lower than that of commercial funds, particularly when commissions, marketing and exit fees were taken into account.</para><para>The choice regime will also add quite considerably to competition costs of the superannuation system because of the need for funds to handle what could be frequent transfers between funds. Certainly this has been the experience in Britain and Chile where choice regimes have been introduced. In short, I think that the government has failed to make out a compelling case that their choice arrangements will reduce costs or add to industry efficiency. I think in fact the exact opposite will occur.</para><para>So that leaves the argument that competition will increase returns to members. That assumes that members want to choose higher risk funds to get higher returns. The risk averse nature of workers with low levels of knowledge of superannuation is in fact likely to see returns reduced over time compared with leaving the decision on risk return balances to trustees.</para><para>But the government also downplays the level of competition already existing in the superannuation industry. We know that trustees are forcing fund managers to compete intensely in their investment returns. Investment managers that fail to shape up are very likely to be replaced quite quickly and fund administrators who fail to deliver low costs are also likely to be moved on.</para><para>The trustees in pursuit of their onerous trustee obligations are expected to keep these issues under constant review, and experience suggests that they certainly do that. The evidence tends to suggest that, as a result of the intense competition at the finance management level, industry funds are delivering average rates of return at least comparable with the commercial funds. And when you take into account the low fee structure, the overall result is one where the industry funds on average are delivering better retirement income outcomes over time than most commercial funds.</para><para>The real attraction of having competition at the fund management level rather than the fund level is that the trustees are in a position to make a fully informed decision on investment returns and risk profiles. Few fund members would be in command of as much independent advice, knowledge and experience as their fund trustees. The trustees are acting in the interests of the members. So again I doubt that the benefits of competition on returns will on average deliver a better result for the vast majority of workers than existing arrangements. An article by Beth Quinlivian in <inline font-style="italic">Personal Investment</inline> magazine recently concluded that the low fee nature of industry super funds would result in a final super payout $100,000 higher than the average master trust fund. That is the sort of 
 outcome which is at risk from the government's choice model proposal.</para><para>There is a further flaw in the government's plan, which rests on the removal of award clauses on superannuation as a condition for their scheme to operate. With the demise of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal, the removal of superannuation as an allowable award matter would also prevent the Australian Industrial Relations Commission from determining disputes about superannuation. So there would be nowhere other than the courts to which workers could take a dispute about superannuation and, given that superannuation became universal only as a result of industrial disputes and given the enormous power over the nature of choice offered that this bill gives to employers, I do not believe that it is good policy not to provide for an effective dispute resolution mechanism.</para><para>Superannuation is part of remuneration. Remuneration is at the heart of industrial relations, a decision which was confirmed by several High Court cases. To deny workers access to dispute resolution on a key aspect of remuneration is quite clearly contrary to the intention of industrial laws in this country. Yet without deleting award clauses, the government's choice regime cannot operate. I think that is a most unsatisfactory policy outcome.</para><para>So, in short, after careful analysis the Democrats have concluded that the government's choice model will not deliver the objectives that the government has set for it. It could add quite considerably to disputation about superannuation and it provides no avenue for effective resolution of such disputes. I do not believe that the vast majority of workers will benefit from the government's choice model. Some will, but most probably will not. The real beneficiaries will be the big financial institutions which will be able to get around award clauses and access occupational superannuation. That is what this bill was always about: delivering superannuation to the government's financial backers in the banking, insurance and finance sectors.</para><para>So what do we do about choice? I think that a better approach is to look at the occupational superannuation industry that we 
 already have and work out how it can be improved. The better industry funds are moving from strength to strength, reducing administrative costs as economies of scale improve, becoming more aggressive about investment strategies and choices and providing better information back to their members. But of course there are duds. Workers do need to be able to exit industry funds that are not performing.</para><para>Further, industry funds are not sufficiently portable. There remains the problem that moving from one industry to another too often results in moving from one industry fund to another. We are a country of eight million and workers and 18 million superannuation accounts, and that is not an efficient outcome. I believe that there is a case for modifying current award clauses to provide some flexibility to improve the operation of industry funds. These amendments should allow employees to leave a fund which is not performing, allow workers to take a fund which is performing with them to another employer and provide them with more choice within the fund on how their money is invested.</para><para>Last week the Democrats announced our own managed choice proposal to improve the operation of the award based industry superannuation system. Our proposals sought to retain the key benefits of the existing industry based award super schemes while giving employed within that system more options if they choose to exercise them. Our first proposal is to require the AIRC to amend award clauses to provide for choice of at least two industry funds. It should be noted of course that many and probably most award clauses already provide choice of at least two industry funds. We propose that, by 1 July 2000, the AIRC extend this to all award clauses.</para><para>These funds would be required to provide employers with information for distribution to their employees so that employees can make a choice between the two funds based on their performance and change that choice if necessary if they fail to perform. On top of that, an employee should be able to take their industry fund with them. Provided the employer agrees, this should be an automatic exception 
 to the award clauses, and our choice model would allow for that. But choice should be more restricted when an employee wants to move outside the award system. Here, the employee needs to be clear about what they want and why. The decision to move outside the industry fund must be employee driven. it must not be driven by employers, banks or finance companies, but by employees.</para><para>Our model provides for this but, as it would be an exception to the relevant award clauses, the employee would need to apply for such an exception to be granted. We have proposed that this be done through the Office of the Employment Advocate. The advocate would simply check that the decision was that of the employee, not the employer, that the employee knows what they are doing, and then tick it off, as it were. This safety valve would prevent employers delivering their work forces en bloc to some inappropriate financial institution. It would also be a safety valve to prevent less informed workers being sold inappropriate and ultimately costly superannuation products. It would also be flexible enough to allow workers who know what they are doing to actually go ahead and run their superannuation as they see fit.</para><para>The final change that we are proposing is to give employees investment choice within their fund. This is, I believe, the most essential issue in building up employee ownership of their superannuation. Investment choice should cover not just risk profiles but also investment vehicles. I believe that many workers would, for example, want to have a say in how much of their superannuation is invested overseas, creating work opportunities in other countries. They might also like to have a say in how much is invested in venture capital, R&amp;D infrastructure, housing and so forth in this country. At present, the onerous duties on trustees prevent them making these sorts of policy decisions because of the need to pursue the highest return wherever it is available. Giving employees more choice about where and how their money is invested could, over time, help bring some of the $60 billion in superannuation invested offshore back into Australia, creating new Australian job opportunities.</para><para>In conclusion, I believe that the choice model of the Democrats avoids the problems inherent in the government's proposals whilst addressing some of the problems with the current system. It retains the benefits offered in the existing system whilst also fixing some of its shortcomings. As such, I think it represents a fair and reasonable evolutionary improvement to current superannuation arrangements. It is my hope that the Senate supports our amendments when I move them during the committee stage.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>3013</page.no><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name><name.id>SF4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to take up the issue of choice which has been taken up again and again by those who have spoken before me and which will, I think, lead to a very interesting discussion in the committee stage. In that context, I would like to go to chapter 5 of the explanatory memorandum to <inline ref="r421">Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1998</inline> , which talks about choice of superannuation funds. I do so because if we are going to debate this bill, as we certainly will, it would be very useful to know on what basis the government is insisting upon giving choice to the people involved. Paragraph 5.13 says:</para></talk.start><para>The Government announced in the 1997-98 Budget, that it would introduce measures that provide employees with greater choice as to the superannuation fund or RSA to which their superannuation is paid. As a result of extensive consultation with superannuation funds, industry associations and employer and employee representatives, the government announced on 25 November 1997 a range of enhancements to the original Budget proposal. These enhancements are designed to significantly reduce the administrative burden on employers while ensuring the key objective of providing choice of funds to employees is achieved.</para><para>I am not sure whether choice of funds is given the importance that it is in this explanatory memorandum because of employees' civil rights—therefore, since they have civil rights they ought to have choice—or whether they are given the choice because choice is an economic force which will increase the resources of a person if that force is allowed to operate properly.</para><para>I think that is a significant distinction to make because if employees are being given choice because of their civil rights then not a great deal of argument can be made about that 
 because civil rights are self-evident truths. I know that the minister is a great reader of Thomas Jefferson's declaration of independence in 1776.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="metadata">KEMP</name><name role="display">Senator Kemp</name></talker><para>—Quite right!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>SF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name></talker><para>—He established the proposition that the truths that we talk about, including civil rights and the rule of law, are self-evident truths. If, on the other hand, a person ought to have choice because of the economic principles involved, then that is a different matter. In those circumstances, the truths are not as self-evident. As I think any economist would agree, there has to be some evidence about that before we go ahead with the proposition. As has been pointed out by speakers before me, there is no evidence that has been brought forward, at least in this explanatory memorandum, which would support that proposition. Senator Sherry said during the meal adjournment that if I quoted the United Kingdom and Chile, those supporting this bill would know that they were cases in which the proposal put forward here did not succeed.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I think it is time that explanatory memorandums were more informative about evidence. I know that we have standing committees and legislation committees which bring forward a lot of evidence, but I think it would be useful for people writing explanatory memorandums to put in such evidence as they have to support the bill that is being explained by the explanatory memorandum. I say that for two reasons. First of all, I think it would clarify in the minds of the people who prepared the explanatory memorandum, and who no doubt had a significant part to play in the preparation of the bill, the parts of the particular bill that are not supported by evidence. It would also help people who do not attend upon the legislation committee understand what the government is putting forward.</para><para>A lot of explanatory memorandums are like opinions or advice from consultants, not from lawyers because lawyers are very serious about the advice and opinions that they give. At times an opinion or advice is just run off to suit the reader for whom it is meant. It is not a good thing to use a language that will be attractive and not have any real thought 
 put into what is put. For example, paragraph 5.6 of the explanatory memorandum states:</para><para>The arrangements will increase competition and efficiency in the superannuation industry, leading to improved returns on superannuation savings and placing downward pressure on fund administration charges.</para><para>That flows like poetry to our mind because we have heard so often the words competition and efficiency, downward pressure, savings and improved returns. They are the sorts of phrases that resonate around the country and come no doubt from particular economic schools that people might have attended.</para><para>When you read words like that, you are immediately on your guard that this is something that has not been thought out. It has been put down because someone has to prepare an explanatory memorandum. I imagine a lot of this stuff is on computers and that all you do is change the name of the act, press a button, there is a rumble in the system and out comes the explanatory memorandum. In my view, that is not good enough because it ignores the case that can be put against it, which has been so eloquently put by previous speakers.</para><para>There is nothing here about the effectiveness or otherwise of the retirement savings accounts, which I remember some time ago were spoken about by Senator Lundy. In one of her early contributions in this chamber I think she said that there were some real problems with retirement savings accounts, but none of that is set out in this explanatory memorandum. It is my plea that we generally try to improve the quality of explanatory memorandums. We cannot always rely on the Scrutiny of Bills Committee to bring up issues. If this bill is based on the primacy of civil rights, that would be in accordance with the thoughts of the minister handling this bill at the moment, and that would be a good thing. It is my view that civil rights should receive a higher priority than they do in this parliament at times—not that they should command absolute heights but they should be given greater priority than they presently receive.</para><para>Madam Acting Deputy President, over the years you have given priority to civil rights, 
 the rule of law in indigenous people's issues, gender equality and rights of people living under the threat of nuclear disaster. People such as you have given emphasis to civil rights over the years. This is one case where the government—at least in the terms it uses—seems to have given priority to civil rights. We will be able to find out when we come to the committee stage how the issue of choice operates in the context of this explanatory memorandum.</para><para>One of the rights that I think would help in this area is the right of funds to sue on behalf of employees whose employers have not made the contribution that they should have made. We could help in this area by giving funds greater rights to require contributions to be made.</para><para>Much has been said tonight about choice. It has been said that people must have knowledge of all the facts to be able to make a choice, and that is right. But I am not sure how people can have that knowledge. How can we know the results of investments made by funds? If people invest in shares, are the values going to go up or down? If they invest in the money market, how much is that going to return? If they invest in property, is the property going to keep its value? These are all questions that cannot be answered, and yet the explanatory memorandum is written as if those sorts of issues are beyond doubt. In that sense, this explanatory memorandum—and perhaps the thrust of the bill itself—introduces propositions that are not supported by reality. In other words, no matter how well educated and practised you are in the share market, nobody can guarantee how those things are going to go.</para><para>When you talk about choice in this context, you are talking about it in a way which is unreal and tends to give a wrong impression of what things are all about. I think that comes about because of the cavalier—and I use the word advisedly—way in which some of these explanatory memorandums are written.</para><para>Let me repeat the main points. This legislation would be praiseworthy if it were based substantially on the concept of human rights. However, I think such an exercise in this case 
 has miscarried. In other words, any attempt in this bill to try to carry out the dictates of human rights has failed because it has not addressed the issues as they should be addressed. Also, there is not enough evidence to convince us that this bill is based on economic principles. Senator Sherry has produced evidence, as have others, to indicate that there is much to be doubted in the propositions that have been put forward.</para><para>This bill needs to be looked at further. It is not now in a proper state to be passed. A lot more discussion is needed. I think somebody with the generosity of heart of the minister in this case would understand the thrust with which we come at this bill and would go away and rewrite it. I do not suggest that he writes the explanatory memorandum himself—that would be imposing too much of a burden on him. But I would ask that he gets somebody who has a full understanding of this area—not someone who would go into a mantra mode of repeating the words that we have heard—to make a good and proper analysis of the issues involved.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>3015</page.no><name role="metadata">Lundy, Sen Kate</name><name role="display">Senator LUNDY</name><name.id>7G6</name.id><electorate>ACT</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I, too, would like to add my thoughts and comments on this issue. Having had the experience of being one of the earlier participants in a particular industry fund, I come from a perspective of first-hand experience about what participation in an industry superannuation fund means as a blue-collar worker.</para></talk.start><para>One of Labor's great achievements has been the establishment of such funds for transient workers, workers in blue-collar industries and workers who previously had no access to superannuation generally and the dignity that it can potentially bring in one's retirement. So it has been with great dismay and concern that we have traversed a fairly rocky terrain in respect of this government's attempts to manipulate change and thwart the principles that were put in place by Labor during our period of government. Indeed, these principles were supported generally by the current government—the then opposition. It was agreed that the role of industry super funds and superannuation generally would be supported in a bipartisan way.</para><para>However, since the coalition took government we have seen the structural dismantling of that superannuation retirement base for all Australians that Labor was certainly leading towards. We have had experiences with the superannuation tax. We have seen the government co-contribution for superannuation completely scuttled in return—at the time it was politically sold as some sort of recompense—for a family tax package. Ironically, those families fortunate enough to fit within the narrow confines of that family tax rebate and to benefit from it have seen it eaten away by the increases to child care due to the $821 million cut to the child-care sector.</para><para>Let us look at the government's superannuation policies in the wider context and at how other policy decisions have been made in relation to retirement incomes and costs to families. We have seen policies that have stifled job growth. We have seen industrial relations policies that have hampered opportunity, particularly for blue-collar workers and those in transient industries such as the building and construction industry. This collection of policies has actively targeted and actively disadvantaged those areas.</para><para>It points to a government that has a short-term approach. It is not a government that subscribes to long-term visions about where retirement incomes are going to come from. It is a government that uses these pressures to try to thwart and narrowly confine debate about taxation reform. It is a government that is prepared to compromise what was a sound and progressive program of enhancing retirement incomes for all Australians and turn it into a quick buy, a reallocation of only some of the money—not even all of it—from the potential co-contribution to a family tax rebate. This sort of petty politicking and lack of vision is something that effectively has become synonymous with the John Howard led coalition government.</para><para>One of the great ironies in this debate can be highlighted by conveying to you an experience I had as an organiser for the Building Workers Industrial Union at the time that the superannuation debate was still raging within the industrial relations forums. Indeed, it was the Liberal Party at that time, and its voice in 
 industry through employer associations, that argued so actively against the introduction of industry style funds because of the administrative burden that it imposed upon employers in those industries. It should be understood that in the building industry a large number of small subcontractors barely have the time to get their taxation records and their wage books up to scratch, because of the pressures of their work, let alone deal with the administration of a superannuation fund.</para><para>From recollection, the opposition at the time argued vehemently against this notion of industry super, specifically because of what they called red tape and administrative burden. In fact, at the time, this argument was largely fought out in an industrial forum. As a union organiser, I can remember having many debates with employers about the value of having an industry fund which could support and help small employers—it did not matter what job they were working on because they only had to get to know the processes associated with one fund.</para><para>There are a lot of issues relating to that but one, of course, was the recognition that small businesses in the building industry—I know this example can translate to many different industries—imposed quite a significant burden. It was a burden that was taken seriously by the Labor government at the time. Certainly it was taken seriously by the industry fund and by employer organisations, which embarked upon lengthy education programs and information seminars to try to bring the skills and knowledge of those particular subcontractors up to scratch.</para><para>A lot of investment was put in place for that and I believe over time its value was certainly recognised by those employers. I cannot begin to describe the benefit and the positive impact that it had on the workers in that industry. For the first time, employees, who perhaps had had numerous employers in a given year or in any given period of that cyclical boom of the construction industry, consistently had contributions going into one fund. The debate that occurred out there where it happens—on the sites and in the site sheds—ultimately led to a fund that that 
 industry and those workers can be particularly proud of.</para><para>So we get to the debate about a choice of fund. That history, that education and that knowledge that has been built up, and the contributions that have been building up and going towards the retirements of all of those workers, are now under question by this government. With this bill, the government is proposing to undermine the system that was put in place. It is proposing to undermine it through the choice model. The government, with its lack of vision and lack of acknowledgment of the industries working in this area—as in the particular example I used—has decided that no longer is red tape an issue and that no longer is the ability of these small companies to administer their affairs an issue. Suddenly, a greater issue is to create confusion and a situation that will make it more difficult for smaller employers to participate in employer contribution schemes for superannuation.</para><para>The government argues that its choice model is a question of competition. It is not a question of competition; it is not a question of efficiencies. If it were, the government would look at industry best practice. If it were, the government would look at what industry has chosen through natural evolution as the type of scheme that is best suited and it would take some stock in that, learn from that and appreciate that what is not needed out there in the small business sector is a complicated myriad of opportunities and approaches, all of which require, I presume, for many of these small businesses the hiring of yet another consultant, so many more hours with their accountant or perhaps even some legal advice in relation to the application of this new law. So not only are their administrative procedures potentially spread across four or five different superannuation schemes, funds, RSAs or whatever but, in making their assessment to check their legality in applying these new laws, small businesses will have to hire the services of advisers—professionals, I am sure. That will be very necessary given the complicated state of this legislation.</para><para>So where is this government doing industry a favour in this respect? You are not doing 
 small business any favours. They are not impressed by your arguments of choice and competition. They are only thinking about that extra bill from their accountant, their bank manager or their lawyer. And they are thinking about those extra hours spent in the office rather than out there scrounging and searching for more work—putting in their tenders and bids. That is where they need to spend their time at the moment.</para><para>Let us look at it from the point of view of the worker. Choice of fund—consumer heaven. I can just see all those building workers out there taking home a pile of propaganda from a bank or industry fund and comparing it—making a detailed comparative analysis of each of the four options that are before them. They have all that time on their hands in their busy lives to make those comparisons. This government is taking these steps to undermine superannuation for workers. I do not know too many blue-collar workers who have the sort of money to purchase advice from accountants or financial advisers. Many have, but many have not. It is those who have not who are going to be unnecessarily bombarded with extra costs associated with making their analysis. They may be under pressure from their employer to go in one direction or another, given the burden that the employer has in administering perhaps four different funds from their business.</para><para>Another point worth dwelling on is how the government intends to ensure the soundness of each of these options. As with any increased choice or wider variety, for effectiveness and for the quality required there must be, commonsense tells me, a greater imposition of regulation, compliance procedures and penalties for those who do not comply. So here we hit this contradiction. On the one hand you have the government saying that this choice policy is about consumer opportunity. On the other hand—and we know this from overseas examples—this form of deregulation opens the doors to players who are not always up to scratch. So another layer of analysis is required by the worker and indeed the employer, for which they will have to purchase advice to make sure that they do not breach their liabilities.</para><para>It also places an additional burden on the government. Deregulation must be accompanied by specifications about compliance to a far higher degree than before—otherwise they are opening the door to failure and to providers of these services who will not comply with the regulations. Experience with this government has shown us that they are very keen to deconstruct those authorities that have been put in place to monitor and regulate the quality of the services, schemes, funds, et cetera put in place. You cannot have it both ways. Providing greater choice means that you, as a government, need to reinvest in monitoring regulations, tracking compliance actively—not passively—and ensuring that accurate and effective disincentives in the form of penalties are put in place. But we see little of this. Instead we see rhetoric based on consumer choice; rhetoric that flies in the face of all of the messages and symbols we heard from you in opposition when you argued that measures such as this were a burden on small business.</para><para>Labor, on the other hand, is committed to the role of superannuation in Australian society. In every debate in this chamber about superannuation, we have reinforced our message that there is a place for a definitive, forward looking, effective and fully funded program of ideas and legislation that will lead to superannuation being an effective source of retirement income for Australians. The price for the backtracking and undermining by this government of that vision for superannuation for this country will be paid by generations who are still in the work force. The baby boomer generation was always going to be under pressure, caught in the space between having the time and the opportunity to build up their superannuation funds and the pressures on government provided pensions. Labor was addressing this problem. Our policies meant that for generations after that there was opportunity for all of us to have a dignified retirement. This opportunity has now been undermined, and with each year that the coalition remains in power this opportunity will be further reduced.</para><para>Labor has a series of amendments in relation to this matter of choice. Just as we have 
 attempted to amend previous legislation, we will continue to try to limit the damage being inflicted by this government. Labor's amendments will make this bill much fairer and will make it easier to understand. Our amendments will also still allow employees to have the opportunity to choose a superannuation fund—not to have one forced on them by an employer. If there is one thing that my experience in the building industry showed me, it is that you need the time and you need the opportunity to explain to people how it all works. A decent education program, not shrouded in rhetoric, not shrouded in tax buy-offs and short-term policies that have little to do with retirement incomes and everything to do with confusing the taxation debate, is the way that we will progress superannuation and its changing form in the workplaces of this country.</para><para>Labor's amendments limit the damage of this bill but they will not stop the structural undermining of the superannuation program put in place by Labor. As I said, it will be the generations to come that will suffer. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>3018</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We are debating <inline ref="r421">Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1998</inline> , which has a number of important aspects to it.

I have to say that with your track record and particularly that old union of yours, the building union.</para></talk.start></continue><para>As I said, that your amendments are in fact very similar to option 2 that we put forward. I do not know whether you appreciated that, but that happens to be the case. The final point is that, as far as undermining confidence in superannuation is concerned, it has been a great year for super. Super is growing at excellent rates. I do not know how you measure confidence in super. I know how Senator Sherry does but I do not know how you do. The truth of the matter is that, by every measure, there has been very substantial growth in superannuation and people are voting with their dollars to put their money into superannuation. Talk about rhetoric!</para><para>This bill implements two government initiatives: choice of superannuation funds and the savings rebate. The savings rebate commences on 1 July 1998. On 13 May 1998 I announced a new start date for the choice of superannuation measure for new employees. That will be on 1 July 1999. Secondly, it builds on the government's program of reducing compliance costs for small businesses by introducing a CGT assets register and changes to the withholding tax arrangements. Thirdly, this bill implements two important 1997 budget announcements which enhance the integrity of the tax system relating to franking credit trading, dividend streaming and private company loans.</para><para>The savings rebate will particularly benefit Australian families and older Australians who have saved for their retirement and individuals who have built up their businesses and derive a return. The rebate will apply to undeducted superannuation contributions made by employees and the self-employed and net personal income from savings and investment, including net business income up to an annual cap of some $3,000. In the first year it will apply at a transitional rate of 7.5 per cent and will increase to 15 per cent thereafter. This will deliver a tax saving of up to $450 per year. I know, after many conversations I have had with people around many electorates, that there are many people who, 
 as they should, are welcoming these proposals, which will provide further incentives for people to invest in superannuation.</para><para>The rebate, overall, will provide an incentive to save in a way which is fair, allowing individuals to choose the form most suited to their needs and recognising that individuals have to save for life cycle needs as well as for retirement. The bill also implements the government's reforms to choice of fund arrangements. They are designed to give employees greater choice and control over their superannuation savings, which in turn will give them a greater sense of ownership of their savings. The arrangements will increase competition and efficiency in the superannuation industry, leading to improved returns on superannuation savings. I will be moving amendments in the committee stage to amend the start to 1 July 1999.</para><para>The bill introduces an asset register for capital gains tax purposes. This will eliminate the need for taxpayers to keep source documents for lengthy periods and will reduce the compliance costs for all taxpayers with capital gains obligations. The new three-tier system for remittance obligations under the report or payment system, pay as you earn and the prescribed payment system will give small remitters the option to remit these payments on a quarterly basis rather than on a monthly basis. This will provide over 300,000 small businesses with the opportunity to defer the remittance of $500 million in withheld amounts in 1998-99. That is certainly a very substantial number of business operators who will benefit from this.</para><para>The bill also amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to ensure that payments and loans made by a private company to a shareholder or to a shareholder's associate are treated as assessable dividends to the extent that they are realised or unrealised profits in the company. I will be moving a very minor technical amendment to this measure in committee. This measure, together with the introduction of a general anti-avoidance rule and antistreaming measures, which formed part of the 1997 budget measures to prevent franking credit trading and dividend stream 
 ing, is designed to protect the integrity of the tax system.</para><para>The supplementary explanatory memorandum, which has been circulated, contains further guidance on the intended operation of antistreaming measures and the general anti-avoidance rules targeting franking credit trading transactions. The bill will implement two further budget measures relating to tax deductibility of expenses incurred in contesting election to the Constitutional Convention and donations to the National Nurses Memorial Trust.

They did not mention the $10.3 billion budget deficit that they left us when they were thrown out of office. Not surprisingly, it was omitted in their remarks. Not only that, but many of us are aware of the $70 billion deficit that they ran up in their last five years of office. This is a huge amount of money and I am delighted that at least the shadow Treasurer (Mr Gareth Evans) was prepared to concede recently the significant nature of the deficit which he left this government.

I will not be diverted by Senator Conroy. We say that the savings rebate is fair and equitable, unlike Labor's never delivered L-A-W law broken promises and co-contributions. I think that is worth underlining. We believe that it is fair, it is equitable and it will be beneficial to the overall structure of this industry in Australia.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Let me say why we regard the savings rebate as equitable. The opposition spokesmen in this area certainly have no right to talk about equity. They opposed a very significant move by government in recent history to improve the equity of Australia's retirement income system by their opposition to the superannuation surcharge. The surcharge was placed on those people with high income earnings, yet that was opposed by the Labor Party—not actually in the lower house but opposed in the Senate. That has always intrigued us but, in the end, that is the way the Labor Party operates.</para><para>The savings rebate will flow to people earning less than $40,000 per annum. Seventy per cent of Australian wage earners earn under $40,000. This is really a benefit flowing to the overwhelming bulk of Australian wage earners. In contrast, not one of these people need pay the superannuation surcharge. The opposition has been, I believe, somewhat misleading in its comments about what the so-called battlers will get from the rebate.</para><para>About one-third of wage and salary earners earning less than $40,000 a year made personal super contributions at an average of around $1,300; that is, they already passed the test for getting the rebate. We have given them the opportunity to get an even higher rebate by increasing their contributions. Those who are not making personal super contributions have a big incentive to do so. Each dollar they put in will give them back 15 cents. Not only that, but six million Australians will 
 benefit from this rebate, the vast bulk of whom are lower and middle income earners.</para><para>It has been a pity to listen to the debate on choice of funds. Let me make a couple of observations on the remarks which have been made in this debate. I come to this debate having far more confidence than, I believe, members of the opposition do in industry funds.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3L6</name.id><name role="metadata">CONROY</name><name role="display">Senator Conroy</name></talker><para>—Now don't start on industry funds.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name></talker><para>—Yes, I do have, because what I heard was how well industry funds were doing, and that is true.

The fact of the matter is that there will be industry funds which will perform well, and there will be industry funds which will perform less well. If you have not got confidence in industry funds, you certainly lack confidence in workers. If industry funds are doing so well, whom would workers choose, if what you say is correct?</para></talk.start></continue><para>All I can say is that the rhetoric which you have proffered in this debate seems to me to underlie a certain lack of confidence in the substance.

Choice of funds was a pre-election commitment made by the government in the lead-up to the last election, and the model the government has proposed in order to implement its promise has been the subject of extensive consultation with the superannuation industry, employers and employees. Enhancements to the government's original model outlined in the 1997-98 budget were announced in November 1997, after that consultation. </para></talk.start></continue><para>The first stage of the opposition's choice of fund models involves offering investment choice within superannuation funds.

I understand that, again depending on what the chamber wishes, it might be sensible to begin the committee stage with schedules 9 and 10—private company distributions and the savings rebate, respectively.

I would like to go back to some comments to do with the savings rebate that I was making earlier in my speech during the second reading debate. I draw Senator Kemp's attention to an article that was in `Smart Money' in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline>  on 2 May 1998 entitled `Rebate can be milked for more'. I had got some of the way through it but, given that Senator Kemp is here, I would like to go over it again. The reporter is Alison Kahler and it starts:</para></talk.start><para>At first glance, $225 seems a trifling amount but the new savings rebate can be milked for much more. Conceivably, a family of four with a sufficient income flow could receive a total rebate of $900—without saving a cent.</para><para>Income—not savings—is the sole criteria for the rebate, according to Annamaria Carey of the Taxation Institute of Australia.</para><para>"In reality, the savings rebate is a tax cut for any income generated outside of wages and salary. If you receive rental income, for example, you qualify for the rebate. The income does not have to be saved, just received," she says.</para><para>Carey says the income can come from just about any source, including bank accounts, share dividends, trust distributions, partnerships or business interests and contract or consulting work.</para><para>After-tax superannuation contributions also count towards the rebate, as do some pensions purchased with after-tax money. Even some non-investment income is relevant, including the annual leave and long service leave payments paid on resignation.</para><para>We go on to spokesperson Noelle Kellaher, of Ernst &amp; Young, and Liz Goddard, of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu. Liz Goddard says income splitting would mean couples could claim the rebate twice if a spouse were receiving non-salary or wages income. The article continues:</para><para>Goddard makes the point that the rebate can increase the $416 tax-free threshold for children by around 50 per cent. 
</para><para>Minors who receive distributions through family trusts—</para><para>you would know about family trusts, Senator Kemp; not that you, I believe, have got one, but many of your colleagues have talked to you about them, I am sure—</para><para>are the most obvious candidates, but Carey suggests it is possible to transfer shares to a child's name and that bank accounts can be opened in the name of children.</para><para>Carey says the best feature of the savings rebate is that it is automatically calculated by the tax office through tax returns. Taxpayers don't have to submit extra documentation, except in the case of superannuation contributions not recorded on annual income tax returns.</para><para>If that is not the most damning indictment of the so-called increase in national savings—the savings rebate—I do not know where it is possible to get a worse one because what is shown here Senator Kemp—through you, Madam Temporary Chairman—is that it is completely and utterly rortable. It says, go down and open some bank accounts for your kids, pay in some money out of your family trust and you can reap the extra money from the savings rebate.</para><para>What sort of system of increasing national savings is this? There is no savings involved by these people. These are artificial schemes. This is the `Smart Money' section of the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline>. There are no extra savings involved. Where are the extra savings in going down and opening a bank account for your kids through a family trust distribution? Is that savings? But you are going to give them money for it.</para><para>I would also like to return to some of the comments that I was making earlier to do with the choice regime. In particular, I would like to quote from the report, which I recommend to all senators. Even the Australian Bankers Association—who, as I have mentioned earlier, are the strongest of possible supporters—saw education as critical to the success of the policy.</para><para>Senator Kemp stands there and says no-one was interested. I have not been asked, as far as I am aware, Senator Kemp, to come and have a look at an education policy and what you are proposing. But what I have asked the tax office at estimates, when its representa 
 tives appeared before the committee, was: can you give me the figures of what was spent on the money tree programs in the mid-nineties? My understanding is that they have passed that information on to your office and your office is withholding it.

Most of what we have seen so far is a fairly ordinary attempt at an education campaign—even the little bits that we are aware of. The figures that have been discussed are possibly $4 million. Hopefully, through the course of this committee tonight, we will find out a bit more about the education campaign and find out how much the government intends to spend, but the rumours, the suggestions, are that it is about $4 million.

I hope you are going to stand up and absolutely prove me wrong. If the minister is not prepared, in the face of introducing the biggest shake-up—bigger even than when we introduced compulsory superannuation—to stand up and say, `This is bigger than the SGC. This needs more money. It is more complicated than the SGC. It involves serious ramifications for ordinary workers, serious potential problems if they get their choice wrong,' then the minister is not fair dinkum about the policy of education. But if you are going to hold an education campaign, then you are acknowledging that there is a need for education and that people are not well enough informed at the moment.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The question that the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation put to the Tax 
 Office was: at what point do you measure the success of your education campaign? I ask the minister: what is the success rate you believe is necessary before workers have to make the choice? Is it that 40 per cent of people have to be able to understand the education campaign and be able to identify the key feature statement and understand the comparisons that are going to be in there? Is it 50 per cent? Is it 60 per cent? Surely we should be aiming for something like 75 per cent to 80 per cent of the community that will understand the program being put forward by the government.</para><para>I am sure that, after the education campaign, they are going to be champing at the bit. They will be so grateful to the government; it will have to be a big election winner for you. All those people that you say are demanding choice and the democratic process will be in a position where they will say, `Thank you, Senator Kemp. Thank you, coalition government. We have had this great education campaign. We now understand what we didn't understand before and we will be in a position where we can make an informed choice.' But if the government finds that only 40 per cent of people actually understand the education campaign—what it is about, the choices involved and what a key feature statement is—then surely the government will be willing to reassess the introduction of choice until it is successful in mounting this education campaign—until it can go back to the market and test the consumer and say, `The consumer understands the downsides and the upsides.' But if your education campaign is successful, they are going to be grateful. It is a vote winner for you if it is a good education campaign.</para><para>I am hoping that the government is going to reveal all tonight. I am hoping that the government will tell us what is in its education campaign. I am hoping that the government will be prepared to accept that there are some tests that are necessary so that we can be happy and assured that we have an informed choice taking place. As I said earlier, the report says:</para><para>The ABA saw a significant role for Government in the education process, which they considered

There are low levels of literacy.</para><para>And I will return to the low levels of literacy. The ABA continued:</para><para>It is important that we understand the drivers of these views. This is critical to making the education and communication effective.</para><para>And that is what we are hoping to see tonight. We are hoping to see the effective education campaign.</para><para>Another of the witnesses, a Mr Silk, in his appearance before us cited—and this is where the literacy question really strikes home—an Australian Bureau of Statistics survey undertaken in 1996 that ranked adult Australians on their literacy and numeracy levels. The report says: </para><para>Mr Silk stated that this survey found that almost half of the Australian population have relatively low levels of literacy and numeracy and are likely to have considerable difficulty in understanding choice of fund information such as key feature statements.</para><para>This is critical; it is not something to make jokes about.

Every single witness said, `We want genuine, informed choice.' It was strongly emphasised that a well-planned education program be introduced, Mr Silk concluded. Also, the report said:</para><para>The Australian Consumers Association (ACA) also saw education as vital, and considered that there must be a `serious effort to educate employees and consumers so that they are aware of the potential implications of choice for their financial well being'. The Association listed a set of objectives for education, so that people understand, as a minimum: . . . </para><para>Again, tonight, as part of the regulations and all the other measures involved in this bill, we hope to hear of the sorts of minimum standards, the minimum things that the government wants to achieve. Hopefully, the government will pick up some of these points—and I am almost out of time, which I am sure Senator Kemp will be very pleased to hear—including: why choice may be important for people's retirement income; whether they have choice and, if so, of what sort; how and when they can exercise choice; what happens if they do not make a choice; why there may be no problem if they do not choose; that they do not have to move from the fund they are currently in—that is, to a new fund; the serious implications of shifting out of defined benefit funds—we do not want a repeat of the UK debacle; and, Senator Kemp, I am sure you watched <inline font-style="italic">Four Corners</inline>  as you were on it; where to go for further advice or information; and where to go if they have complaints problems. Those are the sorts of issues that it is critical the education campaign address—absolutely critical.</para><para>My time is up, so I will finish there.

If one were to follow what I had to say throughout the part of the hearing in which I was able to be involved—because at that stage I was filling in for Senator Sherry—it would be apparent that the thing that really caught my eye was the issue of literacy and numeracy.</para></talk.start><para>I really want that issue addressed this evening, after having read an article—and I think this really sums it up—in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of 13 September last year, by Tim Colbatch, headed `Literacy remains elusive despite teaching efforts'. That article refers to the particular ABS survey that I cited in my speech during the second reading debate. That article goes to highlight my concern about `informed choice' where it states:</para><para>Suppose some interviewer hands you two diagrams, those circular ones sliced up like cakes, showing how much oil different industries used in 1970 and 1989. Could you explain from the diagrams how oil usage changed over that time?</para><para>The article continues:</para><para>If you can, take a bow—or more likely a curtsy, you're a rare Australian. A national survey released by the Bureau of Statistics on Monday found only one in six Australians generally understand documents of that sophistication.</para><para>That is something that needs to be answered, and I do not think the answer has been forthcoming—although I am sure that during the committee stage it will be.</para><para>If I expressed a concern and directed a specific question at most of the expert witnesses who appeared before the select committee, it was on the issue of literacy and numeracy. I hold the fear that very few people who are ordinary workers will have the capacity to interpret the key feature statements on which so much reliance will be placed when these people need to make an `informed' choice. That was the other word that kept ringing in my ears throughout the submissions I was privy to hear whilst serving on this particular committee—that it needed to be an `informed' choice.</para><para>Another issue needing to be addressed, Minister—through you, Madam Chair—is the fact that there is a high turnover rate in Australian industry. As a result of the high turnover rate, a one-off campaign of itself will not satisfy the need to educate people about the issue of choice of funds. In my view, with such a high frequency of turnover in industry, there is the need for an ongoing education campaign.</para><para>A further issue of concern, but one which did not necessarily gain a great deal of prominence in the actual hearings, was the treatment of casual employees in the education campaign, because some of them will be exposed to the issue of choice of fund. Those are two issues that I will be looking forward to hearing about from the minister. I would also like to be told how the government intends to deal with an ongoing education program, and how it will deal with the issue of the turnover of staff as well as casual staff.</para><para>I was also concerned in that it would have been interesting to hear from the government on another issue on which I focused in my speech during the second reading debate—that was, how choice of investment which is currently available has not been taken up at a rapid rate. If the government is hell bent on going down this path of choice of fund, it would seem that their getting choice of investment working first would go a long way to getting the issue of choice of fund much more readily understood.</para><para>The cases that I cited in my speech during the second reading showed that, with few exceptions, what we found during the hearing was that, where choice was made available for investment, it could be said that relatively few people took up that option to exercise choice of investment. So I think we really do need to get some understanding from the government as to why that is not a practical step as a first step, given—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="metadata">KEMP</name><name role="display">Senator Kemp</name></talker><para>—It already happens; it happens now.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>7L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Hogg, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HOGG</name></talker><para>—Yes, but what I am saying, Minister—through you, Madam Chair—is that, even with there now being that right, so few people use it. I even cited the case, Minister—I think it was Coca-Cola— 
where they had a very extensive education campaign; it even received a prize for skills in communication with the members of the superannuation fund. Even then, under the best of circumstances, there was a limited take-up rate of investment choice—and that was in the best of circumstances.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I think that the government should give us some indication as to why there is not a more phased approach, given that this is going to be the most significant choice that many people will be confronted with in their long careers in the work force. It is affecting the most important part of their life—their retirement and their retirement savings.</para><para>The other thing that I would like some indication from the government on is the actual nature of the education campaign itself. I raise in particular the need to target small employers and also the need to target those employers that I describe as community employers. In Melbourne we did have evidence from a mother who was a voluntary member of the kindergarten committee. She came and pleaded that they were not aware of even superannuation changes that had previously taken place with other legislation. They found themselves in breach of the law in some instances because they had not complied with the existing legislation.</para><para>I am not going to say it is a problem that is rampant throughout the community, but there are a number of community organisations now in that position, particularly the likes of parents and citizens organisations which do employ people in schools. The government education program should be targeted in a specific way at those people. I would be interested to hear the response from the minister as to how that is going to be done.</para><para>Also, in that specific area, I would be interested in the government's ongoing response to those types of community organisations because one finds that the executive or the management committee of those organisations tends to change on an annual basis. There is no ongoing continuity of management other than, say, the director of the creche or the kindergarten. One finds, of course, that that person is generally not the person responsible for the management of the 
 affairs and the finances of the creche.	Those are the things in particular. There are other issues that I am interested in and will raise throughout the committee stage. Seeing that people under this legislation are having to make an informed choice, I await with interest what the minister has to say on those issues.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>3027</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—There are a couple of matters I do want to raise with the minister. One is the over-arching issue of the effect of these measures on private saving. There are two major schedules in this legislation that affect or impact on private saving. One relates to the rebate which formerly was to be delivered as a superannuation co-contribution. The other is in respect of the government's changes implementing `choice' with respect to superannuation, which must have some impact on private saving.</para></talk.start><para>Quite specifically, I would like the minister to outline in detail—it may not be tonight, it may be tomorrow or next week, hopefully not next year—with respect to the savings rebate: what is the precise addition to private and national saving of the savings rebate? I do appreciate certain assumptions would have to be made about the addition to private saving and to national saving, but it would be useful to have that modelling very precisely.</para><para>Related to that, the government maintains with respect to its `choice' superannuation regime—and I am only paraphrasing from memory, I am not quoting exactly—that efficiencies will be enhanced and competition will drive down costs. The logic of that argument is that if costs do go down—I do not accept it but let us assume, Senator Kemp, the position of your government—as a result of competition, returns will be improved. What will be the net effect to private saving and national saving as a consequence of your proposed changes to the retail delivery of superannuation, which is in effect the proposed model of `choice' that you are offering in this legislation? This is an important issue.</para><para>There are a couple of other issues I would like Senator Kemp to address in the context of private saving. I do not know whether he is aware but, in budget paper No. 1, it is 
 predicted that private saving will go down. That, I think we would both agree, is a matter of concern and it has serious long-term ramifications. If private saving is going down it has an impact on investment and jobs, it has an impact on current account and it has an impact on the level of Australian ownership, vis-a-vis overseas ownership. It has those important impacts.</para><para>But I am concerned about the words in Budget Paper No. 1, page 3-11, in respect of private saving—and I would like you to address each of these points, Senator Kemp. It says:</para><para>There is also the prospect that the improvement in public saving at the Commonwealth level will be complemented by structural increases in private saving over the medium term.</para><para>There is `a prospect', Senator Kemp. I would like you to explain the measures in the legislation we are considering. What is the view of the government, the Treasury, about how they will assist private saving? What is the medium term? Is it three, five or 10 years time? I think that is important.</para><para>There are other issues relating to private saving. There is an acknowledgment that the superannuation guarantee will add 2.1 percentage points to private saving. It would have been nice if there had been an acknowledgment that this was a Labor initiative. Whenever you blame us for something that you allege is wrong, it is a Labor initiative. Whenever there is something that you hold onto, you do not acknowledge and give credit. You have carefully modelled the superannuation guarantee and its impact—I think it was actually modelled when we were in government, and you have continued to quote but not acknowledge the government that introduced it—so you certainly should be able to give us some sort of reasonable approximation of the effect of the rebate, how it will increase private saving and the measures you are introducing in the name of choice.</para><para>The next subpoint in respect of the prospect of private saving increasing is the savings rebate itself, and I have dealt with that. But, Senator Kemp, the next sentence says:</para><para>More generally, the tax reform now in prospect has the potential to enhance private saving. 
</para><para>My assumption is that this is a reference to a goods and services tax. I do not want to debate that in any detail because this is not the time or the place, but I would like you to specifically address how a GST increases private saving and what comparative evidence you have for this assertion to be made in the budget paper.</para><para>Finally, there is the issue of private saving. I have to acknowledge, Senator Kemp, that you did deal with the general issue of private saving in your concluding remarks in the second reading debate on this legislation. The final point made about the prospects for increase in private saving puzzles me. It says:</para><para>Finally, quite apart from these policy influences, demographic change over the next decade or so is likely to see a rise in the proportion of the population in age groups which historically have been high savers and a decline in younger, low-saving age cohorts.</para><para>I do not think there is any argument that we have got an ageing population. I think the current number is about 12 per cent over 65 and, by the year 2050, the number will be 22 or 23 per cent—close to one in four. They are net dissavers, and that is a slow and steady demographic ageing of our population. How can it be claimed that the steadily ageing population, who are, as I understand it, dissavers—historically, they are high savers while they are working, but then they run down their savings when they reach retirement age—will increase private saving?</para><para>If you look at page 4-55 in Budget Paper No. 1, Senator Kemp, you will see that this is very well illustrated, because page 4-55 outlines assistance to the aged. By way of example, aged pensions and allowances in 1997-98 will cost the budget $13.4 billion. In 1998-99, this budget, they will cost $14.1 billion, rising in three years time—2001-02—to $16.5 billion. That is an increase in payment of aged pensions and allowances because of the ageing population. There is no doubt there is an increase in the number of people over the age of 65. That is an increase in four or years—five financial years—of $2.1 billion in assistance to the aged. I acknowledge it is quite proper and correct that that assistance should increase. It is not because of an increase in pension payments as a per 
 centage of average weekly earnings. Then we have residential care and subsidies for the aged. They will go up as well over that five-year period. Home and community care is going up. There is also the partnering allowance.</para><para>They are examples of increasing costs to the budget because of our ageing society. They are further evidence as to why I question the claim that demographic changes are likely to lead to higher private saving over the next decade or so. I would like you to deal with those issues in the context of savings.</para><para>There is another matter, Senator Kemp. As you would be well aware, the  Workplace Relations Amendment (Superannuation) Bill 1997  is part of the parcel of legislation that we are considering here, albeit it separately. It requires the removal of superannuation as an allowable matter from the workplace relations bill. I would have appreciated knowing that you had changed the operative date of the super choice regime—you have put the date back to 1 July 1999 for new employees. What is the precise position of the government with respect to the operative date for  Workplace Relations Amendment Bill 1997 [No. 2] ? You have changed the date for the operation of choice, but I have seen no announcement about the operative date for workplace relations excluding superannuation as an allowance matter should that pass the Senate. Again, I would like a response on that.</para><para>Removing superannuation as an industrial matter is an important issue. We will be considering the choice regime during the committee stage tonight. For this to work, there have to be changes to the Workplace Relations Amendment Bill. You have proposed removing superannuation altogether. The Senate select committee will be reporting on this bill tomorrow, and I will probably take the opportunity to speak to it at that stage. I will give you notice of my concerns now because we are effectively dealing with the same package of legislation. Whilst you are looking at the effect of private saving modelling as a consequence of the rebate and choice, have you taken into account in that modelling, if you have carried it out, the 
 effect of removing superannuation as an industrial matter? It has a number of effects which I think you would have to acknowledge.</para><para>The removal of superannuation as an industrial matter effectively removes issues from a number of awards. Certainly the two industries that were highlighted, but by no means the only industries, were the retail industry and the hospitality industry. There was evidence—and it was not refuted—that there would be tens of thousands of employees in the retail industry and the hospitality industry who would be covered by the SG minimum of $450 per month for super contributions. There are some tens of thousands of people who would miss out on superannuation contributions who currently receive it as a consequence of removing super as an industrial matter. I would like to know whether you have taken that into account in the modelling you have done of private saving. I am raising all of these matters now because they relate to the very important issue of the modelling of private saving.</para><para>A related issue is that, with the allowable move towards payment of superannuation half yearly or yearly rather than monthly or quarterly, the information that the superannuation committee received was that this would result in a reduction in end benefit of between 3½ and four per cent of superannuation over the total saving period. Have you modelled the impact of that as a consequence of payments of superannuation occurring not monthly or quarterly but half yearly and yearly? As a consequence, interest on interest is reduced, and therefore the savings in the accounts are reduced. This morning I had material incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> which gave examples of an industry fund at a consistent earnings rate of eight per cent, assuming 41 years in the fund, versus—<inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>3029</page.no><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name><name.id>3L6</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to finish off some of the comments I was making earlier about the education process. Hopefully we will find out where we are going, and hopefully the government will be able to give us some information. The superannuation committee also received evidence from Ken Lockery, the principal of 
 Towers Perrin, not someone who is naturally supporting of or opposed to choice for the sake of it. He is someone who made a very informed contribution to the debate. He stated:</para></talk.start><para>I guess I have already said that I think that, with the best will in the world, an education campaign will only affect a proportion of the population and that there will be a whole lot of other people who cannot benefit from that simply because of their level of English, understanding or whatever in that process.</para><para>I think it was Mr Lockery who cited the example that 40 per cent of Australians had trouble understanding a bus timetable due to a whole range of factors. That is a possible indictment of the education system and the lack of resources available to it. The point is that it is a very real problem. How can we address that? How we can make sure that we compare apples with apples? That is probably the second most important part of where we have to go to with the choice debate. It is the capacity to be able to look at those key features statements and the issues within them. Hopefully during the committee stage we will hear more about these features statements or hear indications of where you see that going. That would be of genuine interest to everybody.</para><para>Another witness who appeared before the committee was Ms Ann Byrne, the convenor of the Industry Funds Forum. This is the third time that I have been on my feet, Senator Kemp, and I am surprised that you have not mentioned the fact that I am a former employee of the Transport Workers Union superannuation fund. I am disappointed. I know that you normally never miss an opportunity to draw that to my attention as well as to the chamber's attention, but I put that on the record to save you the time and trouble.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="metadata">KEMP</name><name role="display">Senator Kemp</name></talker><para>—I used to think it showed you had some sort of expertise in this.

Ms Byrne was talking about how to deal with an apples with apples issue. In referring to comparisons of earning rates of funds, she said:</para></talk.start></continue><para>Some—probably, I think, the vast majority—have a reporting date of 30 June; some, though, have a 
 reporting date of 30 September and some have reporting dates of 31 December or 31 March. So if you are doing a comparison, particularly between the earning rates of those funds, it is very difficult unless you have the same reporting date.</para><para>It cannot be an accident that these different funds have decided to have a variety of reporting dates. They are quite deliberately seeking to minimise the capacity of people to make a genuine comparison. They are making sure you cannot compare apples with apples. So it is critically important for the government and the ISC to ensure that there are common points, starting with the reporting dates.</para><para>Ms Byrne also emphasised the importance of disclosing fees and charges in a form that permits comparisons to be made. She told the committee that public offer funds are already required to disclose fees and charges in their key features statements. However, the manner in which the funds disclose these charges does not always give an accurate picture. She told the committee:</para><para>In the current requirements for key features statements, which are only currently required for public offer funds, when you actually put together your management expense ratio you do not always have to put in all of your indirect investment expenses. It is my understanding that if your investments are in a pooled vehicle, because the return you get on that vehicle is less the expenses then that does not have to be declared.</para><para>Again, it is critical that workers are able to compare apples with apples. There is the capacity for the funds involved to disguise their management fees and their earnings ratios to make sure that you cannot make a genuine comparison. You cannot pick up two key features statements and say, `They earned X and they earned Y. Their management fees are A and theirs are B.' There is a deliberate attempt to minimise this capacity on issues like the management fees.</para><para>We had one witness from Perth who gave an excellent contribution by a telephone hookup. This person, who had been in the superannuation industry for 17 years, had attempted over two hours to analyse the reports and key features statements of two reputable firms. However, she was unable to draw comparisons between the reports and 
 key features statements of these two perfectly reputable funds. Although she had been in the superannuation industry for 17 years, she was not able to draw a comparison on the critical points regarding investment returns and fees.</para><para>If someone can spend 17 years in the superannuation industry and not be able to understand the information being provided, it really puts the onus back on the government to enforce a standardised criteria. We had witnesses before the committee who were opposed to that. Disappointing as that was, we had witnesses who suggested that you cannot standardise; you cannot force various reporting mechanisms. That was very disappointing but we are hoping that, tonight and tomorrow, we will hear about those standard reporting requirements. We hope to be given an indication of where we are all going on this adventure.</para><para>Another witness, Mr Grenfell, talked about some of the generic material that he hoped would be in the key features statements. He said:</para><para>We envisage that the KFSs would be specific to the plan. We recommended to the ISC that in addition to the KFS you need some generic material about superannuation. It would cover issues like risk and return, preservation, taxation, the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal—</para><para>if we manage to put something together collectively, which I know everybody is working on—</para><para>. . . and all these issues that relate to the market as distinct to relating to the plan.</para><para>What Mr Grenfell was suggesting—and this is part of the education—was not just `this is how you implement a choice.' He was recognising that, because of the compulsion aspects of the existing national superannuation plans, there would be almost a piggyback campaign—a building on earlier campaigns—to emphasise things like the benefits of super in general. Those are the sorts of issues we hope to be able to pick up and hear from the government about today and tomorrow.</para><para>Helen Hewett also talked about the difficulties in evaluating fees and charges from current key features statements. I quote:</para><para>Recently we had a training session where there were 17 representatives from different superannuation funds and people across the industry.</para><para>So this was an industry forum—</para><para>They were given a document that is put out in the marketplace by a very well-known provider of superannuation, and they were asked to calculate the fees.</para><para>There were 17 industry representatives with many years' experience—many more than you or I, Senator Kemp, would probably ever desire to have in terms of industry experience. How many different answers do you think they came up with? Fourteen. Seventeen people with many years of experience in the superannuation industry looked at the same document and came up with 14 different calculations of the fees.</para><para>I am sure there will be a cry from ordinary people to say, `You are forcing choice down our throats. You are making us do it because of your ideological fixation about industry funds.' This debate has been, and continues to be, about the government's attempts to run down and undermine industry funds, notwithstanding all the benefits.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>656</name.id><name role="metadata">FORSHAW</name><name role="display">Senator Forshaw</name></talker><para>—That is true.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name></talker><para>—It is absolutely true.

I am sure that was all taken on board. We are hoping to hear how he thinks we can improve the proposals before us tonight.</para></talk.start></continue><para>One of the things the minister talked about in his second reading speech was the question of choice, and how we are on a democratic merry-go-round, and how this is about choice and that everyone is going to be better off because they have a choice. Senator Kemp did not want to illustrate that, in the first instance, for new employees, the choice of a 
 default fund is not with the employee, it is with the employer. If the government wants to stand up in this debate and have an argument about choice, it has to be fair dinkum. That government has to admit up front that, in many circumstances, the choice is with the employer, and that every time someone leaves a job and goes to a new job they will lose a bit of choice.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="metadata">KEMP</name><name role="display">Senator Kemp</name></talker><para>—That's your model.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name></talker><para>—No, that is your model in your bill.

That was the exact word I used. Senator Kemp's baby is the RSAs. Does anyone have any idea what the take-up rate is? Perhaps there is someone in the gallery who would be able to tell us! It is critically important that the government accepts that some of the first people to be faced with this choice—whether their date is 1 July this year or 1 July next year—will be young people of 17, 18 and 19. How can we build it into the education system so that they can deal with it? We are hoping to hear from Senator Kemp on that.</para></talk.start></continue><para>If an employer is able to pick an RSA as a default for a 17-year-old or an 18-year-old, who is a new employee, then the government is culpable, the parliament is culpable, the industry is culpable and certainly the employer will be culpable. We are hoping that the government will be prepared to stand up and say, `RSAs are out of the default.' We do not think the government should do it. It is too risky. It will lower national savings and it will absolutely cruel the retirement incomes of those young people. They could end up being hundreds of thousands of dollars worse off if they are put into an RSA product by an employer, not in a deliberate, malicious sense but in the sense of, `We just want to make this silly choice go away.

The super fund would have to maintain a fair degree of liquidity levels to satisfy the possible demands that are involved in the right to choice of funds annually.</para></talk.start><para>That, I believe, is called `churning'.

I am sure that as we get to that part of the legislation we may get into a detailed argument about how it will exactly operate.</para></talk.start><para>The other thing I want to raise briefly is the issue of consumer protection. That has not been sufficiently addressed at this stage. Whilst it may be addressed in broad terms now, before we proceed into the main part of the committee's deliberation we need to know about the disclosure regulations and how they will apply in respect of SIS and the RSA legislation. Will there be clear standard disclosure by the funds, given that we are now in a new environment? In respect of consumer protection, and I know we are talking about a general education campaign, will there be any special funds put aside for a consumer rights campaign rather than just an explanation of the ins and outs of superannuation and if so what sort of campaign will that be?</para><para>The third thing I want to raise is that I understand that there is a need for a consumer protection or a conduct and disclosure bill. This would be seen as a key protection against what happened in the UK experience; as I understand it, in that particular regime we saw a lot of misselling take place. What sort of protection is going to be provided to the Australian consumer? Is that legislation ready to be  introduced? Will there be an overall protection there for the consumer that can be seen in black and white?</para><para>The next area of consumer protection is the actual consumer protection regulator. As I 
 understand it, we will see legislation here shortly for the establishment of the Australian securities investment commission. When that legislation is presented, will we have some idea as to what component or element of the ASIC will be for super fund regulation? Will we know what the actual funding will be to enable that section to operate and protect people's interests in the superannuation area? It would also be helpful to know whether there will be an internal task force in the ASIC dedicated to superannuation issues alone. This comes out of one of the government's initiatives—the Wallis financial sector reforms.</para><para>It is also important that the government explains the relationship between the ACCC and the new ASIC in relation to superannuation. Is there going to be a relationship and if so what will that be? Will there be a superannuation monitoring group established to oversee the implementation of this new choice of funds to instil some confidence in the consumer in the new processes that the government is advocating? If the government intends to have some monitoring group, which would be highly commendable in the circumstances, then the government should consider including consumers, industry funds and the industry organisations.</para><para>The last thing that needs to be raised is the issue of dispute resolution. We did hear evidence during the committee hearings of the `demise' of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal. How are issues going to be resolved where there are problems with superannuation? How does one see that being handled under the new legislation?</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>3033</page.no><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name><name.id>656</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I had not intended to participate in this debate. I have been happy to sit and listen to the excellent contributions of my colleagues. But an issue that has been raised, and one that I would briefly like to comment on, is the impact of this proposed legislation and the introduction of freedom of choice in such a major way on itinerant workers. I would like the minister to treat this issue as a serious issue and I would like to get a response from him.</para></talk.start><para>Back in the mid-1980s, when award superannuation was first coming into being, the organisation that I was working for, the AWU, had to fight right to the end to get superannuation for rural workers in this country. The National Farmers Federation opposed it bitterly. Indeed, at that time they were represented by a gentleman by the name of Mr Peter Costello. I must say it was my good fortune to have been involved in that case, and that was one of the ones that Peter Costello did not win, though that is something he does not often refer to.</para><para>In those proceedings we achieved superannuation for rural workers, the three per cent employer contribution. One of the stipulations put into the award by the commission at the time was that there could be a multiplicity of funds, because the employer organisations were split across the country. Some groups in Western Australia and South Australia wanted to support a fund run by the then federation insurance company. Other organisations, the New South Wales and Victorian Farmers Federations, wanted to support a superannuation fund run by Australian Eagle. Mr Houlihan, whose name pops up in these halls constantly, wanted to promote a fund which was run by Elders; I think he had some direct interest in that one. In Queensland, because the employees there were covered by state awards, there were a number of other funds run by other insurance companies.</para><para>One of the difficulties, and it has been a major problem for a number of years, is that, whilst superannuation became available for workers for the first time ever, the fact that many workers travelled from state to state working for different employers, even though they may be in the same occupation such as shearing, meant that they often found themselves in two, three, four or five different superannuation funds, paying multiple charges as the weeks went on.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="metadata">KEMP</name><name role="display">Senator Kemp</name></talker><para>—Under the current system.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>656</name.id><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name></talker><para>—Because of the stipulation made by the employers that they would not agree to an industry fund; they wanted five funds.

Many of the funds that operated in the pastoral industry have been amalgamated so that you now have essentially one major fund for rural workers in this country. Surprisingly, on the board of trustees of that industry fund you have representatives of the union and the NFF. One of the difficulties that this legislation presents is to go back to that period of confusion and chaos that commenced with a multiplicity of funds in the industry, but it would be exacerbated. What you are really doing, in my view, is essentially consigning many itinerant workers to getting no benefit long term out of superannuation. I would like the minister to respond to that issue, obviously the next time the debate comes on, as to precisely how itinerant workers—and there are hundreds of thousands of them in this country—are going to be protected and their investments in their superannuation are going to be protected under this proposal, because I do not believe they will be.</para><para>Progress reported.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ADJOURNMENT</title><type>Adjournment</type><page.no>3034</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—Order!

This is a vital bill for the thousands of Australians involved in agriculture, food processing and packaging and the 1.1 million people employed in manufacturing—and for all Australian consumers who wish to support Australian industry and Australian workers. Through this bill, the government seeks to overhaul the rules for using the terms `Made in Australia' and `Product/Produce of Australia'.</para></talk.start><para>Earning the right to use these terms is a valuable one. It is a commercial advantage. It sets your goods apart from others on the shop shelf. More and more consumers, I am sure, will respect these descriptions and actively seek out products marked in this way, to promote both Australian products and Australian produce. It is important for all of us that these terms are not devalued. However, several court cases and the actions of some companies have led to some confusion already in the community about which term means what. That is why this government has pushed so hard to put some clear definitions in place.</para><para>Our aims in this area are threefold. Firstly, we plan to introduce clear and simple tests to determine eligibility to use the terms. Secondly, we will make sure that both business and consumers understand the tests. Thirdly, we will be enforcing the rights rigorously against unscrupulous traders. The changes will be made by amending Part V of the Trade Practices Act.</para><para>Businesses will be able to claim that their product is made in Australia only if the product passes a substantial transformation test and at least 50 per cent of the cost of production is incurred in Australia. For example, the government does not regard adding water to concentrate to produce orange juice as a substantial contribution.</para><para>I know that pork producers are concerned that imported pig meat may be able to be labelled Australian after very little processing in this country. This will not be permitted under this new legislation. No goods containing imported pig meat will be allowed to carry the `Product of Australia' label. Making ham from imported pork is not considered to be a substantial transformation. Under the new arrangements, the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs (Mr Truss) will have the power to make regulations to exclude such simple processing from this test.</para><para>A car is a much better example. The components are assembled into a new and different product and therefore a substantial transformation has taken place. To determine whether the car is made in Australia, we would also need to consider whether at least 
 half of the production costs have been incurred here. If this is the case, the manufacturer can legally use the term.</para><para>Materials, labour and overheads will be included in the cost of production. General business costs, such as advertising and distribution, will not. Companies would be able to claim that their product was a product or produce of Australia only if the product was 100 per cent Australian or virtually so. So, in effect, only goods that have acquired their final form in this country will be able to claim that they are made in Australia or are product or produce of Australia.</para><para>Significantly, the minister will also have the power to regulate the use of special logos or labels where a particular industry wishes to set standards higher than the minimum test, to be set out in the legislation. Of course, this has been particularly so with a number of logos, like the Woolmark, which is an industry based logo that has been particularly successful in its recognition value and that will continue to be so in terms of wool mix and wool blends. Also, I understand that the `Australian Made' logo, which has been substantially devalued and has lost its legitimacy, will be able to be reinstated as something that has some value.</para><para>We recognise that policing the change is imperative. We plan to instruct the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to enforce the new test to ensure that foreign goods are not falsely represented as being Australian made. The government believes that clearing up some of the uncertainty in this area will be of benefit to Australian consumers, to Australian businesses and to our country's economic bottom line. We promised before the 1996 election that we would sort this problem out. Through a maze of difficulty, which the previous government found virtually impossible to work its way through or was unable to confront, we have made a substantial start. I look forward to the legislation coming into the Senate after the forthcoming debate in the House of Representatives. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Australia Post: Rural Services </title><page.no>3035</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>3035</page.no><name role="metadata">West, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator WEST</name><name.id>1X4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Tonight I rise to address an issue that is of major concern to people in rural areas, particularly in small rural communities. What plans does this government have in mind in relation to the changes to and the review that has been done very recently on Australia Post? In recent weeks the Labor Party candidate for Calare, Terence Corkin, has been working and talking to a number of these communities and they have expressed a great deal of concern to him about that. He organised a petition to go into a number of the small post offices. People signed with such great enthusiasm to actually register their protest that they had to stick pages of signatures on the back of the original wording, hence it is not in order. But I think it is important to recognise that, through the work of Terence, 849 people in communities such as Perthville just outside of Bathurst—with a collection of a couple of hundred people—together with Wallerawang, Portland, Kandos, Capertee, Glen Davis, Glen Alice, Carcoar, Manildra, Spring Hill and places like these around rural New South Wales in the electorate of Calare have had an opportunity to express their concerns about what they see may be the erosion of the postal services they receive in these small communities.</para></talk.start><para>Many of these communities have a high population of elderly people. The post office, with the closure of banks and other facilities in rural areas, has become very much the centre—though it has always been a very important part of the community—of that particular community's activities. With the closure of banks, as I said, the post office is taken over with EFTPOS and agencies, and actually now provides a facility and a resource whereby people, the elderly in particular, are able to access their pensions because of direct payments. They often also run small amounts of food items and convenience products, which means that people are not under the same pressure to find their way to the larger communities.</para><para>It is a major concern to these people that the changes in the report of the review that is currently with the minister will impact upon 
 these small post offices and will, in the long run, act upon the viability of these offices and cause them to close. That would be the final nail in the coffin for many rural communities. We have, in recent times in our areas, seen a report put out of some research done which has talked about sponge communities, the bigger communities that are attracting people from these smaller places such as Perthville, Wallerawang, Lidsdale and Portland into places such as Bathurst, Lithgow, Dubbo, Orange, Wagga Wagga and Tamworth. These people are very concerned that this is what will be happening.</para><para>We know that there is a $60 million cross-subsidisation within Australia Post and that enables them to provide a community service so that people in the bush pay the same amount for their stamps as people in the city areas. People in the bush, in a lot of cases, do not get the same number of mail deliveries a week as people in the city, but they do not want to see them reduced. They want to see them at least maintained and, in some areas, they would like to see them increased.</para><para>For people in rural areas, roadside mail deliveries become very important. For those that are on distance education, that is the way they get the paperwork for their schooling through to the students and pupils. That is the way the pupils get their paperwork back to their teachers to be marked. It is vitally important that people remember this.</para><para>According to the report, they are saying that cross-subsidisation should cease and that the universal service obligation should be covered by a payment from the Treasury provision each year that comes down in the budget. We all know what happens when budgets are tight and they want to save a little money. We get the one per cent efficiency dividends. I can just see this happening here. What happens? There is a one per cent efficiency dividend that has got to be applied to all programs in the budget. We have seen it for the last however many years this government has been in power. How do you have an efficiency dividend on a universal service obligation? But if you put it in the program, if you put it as a line item in the budget, that is what is 
 going to happen; and these people are very concerned about it.</para><para>I want tonight to recognise the hard work of Terence Corkin, the ALP candidate for Calare, who will be the next member for Calare, and I would seek leave to table the petitions—there are 849 signatures—from, for example, Perthville, Wallerawang, Rockley, Lidsdale, Lithgow, Cullen Bullen, Meadow Flat, Carcoar, Cumnock, Manildra, Neville, Black Springs, Oberon, Kandos, Spring Hill, Millthorpe, Forest Reefs, Guyong, Capertee and Glen Davis. If you look on a map, you will see that these locations cover a significant part of regional New South Wales around the central west. Those are just a selection of the locations. I seek leave to table those petitions so that the people who have signed them can have their work and their concerns recognised, and so that the work of Terence Corkin can be recognised.</para><para>Leave granted.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>West Northcliffe Tourism Group</title><page.no>3036</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>3036</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak about an industrious group of Western Australians known as the West Northcliffe Tourism Group, who are being threatened both economically and environmentally by a state government intent on environmental vandalism. Firstly, for those unfamiliar with Western Australia, Northcliffe is a township 30 kilometres south of Pemberton in the south-west of the state, small in size but big in Western Australian historical significance and fighting spirit. It is situated close to the Warren River, the D'Entrecasteaux National Park and the coast at Windy Harbour. Northcliffe has everything to offer the ecotourist.</para></talk.start><para>In an attempt to offset high unemployment in the area, since Bunnings closed its sawmill two years ago, many people have developed, and are still developing, alternative industries, mostly centred on tourism. The West Northcliffe Tourism Group consists of a group of owner-residents whose properties border the forest area known locally as Dombakup 24, and all are reliant on the old-growth forest remaining intact for the success of their planned ventures. Most of the private land 
 surrounding Dombakup 24 does not have a high traditional agricultural value and for this reason it has been subject to rezoning, with two locations already rezoned for multiple occupancy. This area is most suitable for the development of tourism-based businesses and alternative industries.</para><para>Just over three weeks ago, the residents of West Northcliffe were alarmed to hear heavy machinery at work in the forest behind their properties. For many, this was the first they knew of plans by the Department of Conservation and Land Management, CALM, to clearfell that area of forest. Within a matter of days, some 8½ kilometres of log road had been constructed through and around Dombakup 24, with hundreds of logs felled to make way.</para><para>Logging of D24 represents a direct conflict of interest with the proposed ventures of the West Northcliffe Tourism Group and the tourism industry of Northcliffe in general. CALM has made no attempt to compare the economic, cultural and social value of retaining D24 on the basis of tourism and ecotourism ad infinitum with the finite, once in a hundred years resource value of clearfelling it.</para><para>As the Senate may recall, Giblett Block near Pemberton was successfully rescued from clearfelling earlier this year, because of community recognition of its heritage value as old-growth forest. Hopefully that stay will continue. However, what most people do not know is that, in order to replace those logs and keep up the quotas, CALM scouted around for another forest to log, and that is when Dombakup 24 suddenly fell under the spotlight. D24 was never part of the original logging plan for 1998; it was simply added on.</para><para>CALM's planning for this project has been abysmal. The roadworks were commenced before completion of the roading checklist, before the concept plan was finished and certainly before any neighbour liaison took place—as is required. CALM has also chosen to ignore past studies on this tract of forest, but they cannot claim ignorance of Dombak 
 up's environmental value, because much of the research was undertaken by CALM itself.</para><para>For the record, the forest at Dombakup received interim listing on the National Estate Register in 1992, and CALM's own description of it in relation to national estate values is `high' and `moderate' in all six categories of vegetation and fauna. Dombakup is listed as being the habitat of two endemic and restricted fauna species and many special vegetation types. It is also registered as double value because it forms part of the proposed linkage system between D'Entrecasteaux National Park, Dombakup Conservation Park and Warren National Park.</para><para>Most of the private properties bordering D24 are classified as fragile wetlands with restricted land use, meaning clearing restrictions. One such neighbour, in an agreement with the Commissioner of Soils and Land Conservation under the Soils and Lands Conservation Act, section 30, has been required to fence off 20 hectares of his own land at his own cost, to ensure its protection. Another neighbour has had to develop a management contract to protect swamplands. These are very commendable, but all this seems ludicrous in the light of CALM's plans to clearfell nearly 180 hectares right alongside these very same properties which require protection.</para><para>This also directly conflicts with the federal government's plans, as stated in the Treasurer's budget speech, to introduce legislation to provide a tax rebate for landcare works. Primary producers will be able to claim the rebate for works on levee or contour banks to control soil erosion and on drainage works to control salinity. The Treasurer says his landcare rebate is an incentive for farmers with low taxable incomes to improve their land—one of our country's greatest natural resources.</para><para>Dombakup 24 presents the perfect opportunity for the government of Western Australia to act in a preventative way, rather than, down the track, having to act in a remedial way. The south-west of Western Australia suffers some of the worst salinity and wetland degradation in this country. The problem is a direct result of overclearing. In an area as 
 sensitive as that of Dombakup in Northcliffe, it is unimaginable that it be considered for such massive clearfelling operations.</para><para>The argument that areas of clearfelling are promptly replanted is hollow and unconvincing. Reforestation is a painstaking process. It takes more than 100 years for regrowth to be fully effective for a range of environmental functions and, despite expensive advertising to the contrary, anyone who has seen reforestation knows it looks about as natural as a hair transplant. Aesthetically and environmentally, there is no substitute for the real thing but commercial plantations—deliberately planted and cultivated as well as, but not in place of, natural old-growth forest—is the way of the future.</para><para>Based on information included in the regional forest agreement for Western Australia, I understand that plantations—tree farms—have been displacing native forests for the past 25 years and now account for two-thirds of timber for building purposes and 80 per cent of timber in paper production, a move largely unrecognised by the public and governments. Despite the commercial success of plantations, governments maintain subsidies for the commercial users of native forests: every dollar of welfare to native forest users undermines the competing, inherently superior plantation based forestry industry.</para><para>Northcliffe is a battling country town but it has spirit and it has a community that wants to see it prosper. It is a government's duty to assist sustainable growth in regional areas and not frustrate it. It is a government's duty to pave the way for people trying to be self-sufficient. Clearfelling does not generate employment. With today's modern equipment it takes three men three days to clearfell 100 hectares of forest and another handful of men to cart the logs away. Dombakup 24 could be a mere memory in less than a week, after which those few men will again be looking for work. Long-term, sustainable industries create employment. Tourism and service industries will see Northcliffe survive well into the future—but not if CALM has its way. In America people pay big tourist dollars to visit big, old trees. In Western Australia, our government makes sure that the 350 year olds 
 are cut down for charcoal, toothpicks and woodchips.</para><para>The people of Northcliffe want to see their town survive. They are willing to change and seek alternative employment opportunities but they are not willing to stand by and see the Dombakup 24 forest—a vital component for their futures and the future of their generations to come—destroyed for the short-term and very short-sighted gain of government and the woodchip and charcoal industry.</para><para>The WA Minister for the Environment argues that the forest must go for the benefit of all Australians. She is 100 per cent wrong: the forest must stay for the benefit of all Australians. How clearfelling 180 hectares of natural karri, marri and jarrah—more than 50 per cent of which will go straight to woodchipping—can benefit all Australians defies logic.</para><para>The regional forest agreement public consultation paper was released today. It sets out how much old-growth forest should be logged over the next 20 years. It offers three alternatives, and all three involve the wholesale destruction of old-growth forest. While we fiddle, the forests continue to fall.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Food Labelling: Country of Origin</title><title>Pork Industry</title><page.no>3038</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>3038</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I propose to continue the rural and regional theme of tonight's adjournment debate. Firstly, I want to respond in part to Senator Sandy Macdonald's comments about the government's proposals regarding the introduction of labelling legislation which will ensure that product which is produced with imported raw materials is not labelled as product of Australia.</para></talk.start><para>The opposition of course supports any proposal to give effect to the consumer's access to knowledge about the country of origin of the product that is being produced. Labor had a similar scheme ready to go at the end of 1995 and in fact that scheme, which was supported by the industries of Australia after a substantial consultation process, could have been implemented in early 1996. Unfortunately, the government has decided that it needs 
 to re-invent the wheel, as it were, and to proceed down its own path to arrive at the same conclusion and that appears, on the face of the information that Senator Macdonald put to us this evening, to be the situation that the government now finds itself in.</para><para>It finds itself with legislation which has industry support, just as was the case at the commencement of its term, which can now be put into effect. It will give the producers of this country the opportunity to ensure that their product is recognised as product of Australia and that competitors from overseas are not able to have their products used in a way which confuses consumers and allows an unscrupulous manufacturer to say, for example, this is a product of Australia by—and I will use Senator Macdonald's example—adding water to orange juice concentrate. So, having said that we support that, we do say that this measure has been some time coming, given the position in this regard that this government found itself in when it came to office.</para><para>While I am on my feet I want to touch further on the issue of the pork industry because some other information needs to be placed on the record in addition to that which was placed in the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> today. In relation to the Senate's resolution of 7 April which called on the government to take action assessing the circumstances of the pork industry and the effect on the industry of imported pork products, I must say that, as I indicated today, there have been a great many representations made to my office about the concerns of pork producers.</para><para>Shortly after the decision of the Senate on 7 April, I wrote to both Mr Anderson and Mr Fischer on 16 April urging them to move quickly to help this industry because of concerns being raised with me, particularly about the fall in the price of the producers' pigs, which had fallen well below the cost of production. Mr Fischer responded by telling me how important international trade was to the future of Australia. Of course I agree, but I also think that the thousands of pork producers and their families are important to the future of Australia. The many thousands of working men and women who depend on this 
 industry for their weekly pay packet are also important to the future of this country. Mr Fischer should go and ask the feed merchants in Queensland, South Australia, New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and Western Australia how important this industry is to them. He should ask them how they are coping with customers who once happily paid their feed bills on time but who now need 60 days or 90 days, or even more, to pay their accounts. Some cannot pay their accounts at all at the moment.</para><para>Despite the pain this industry is currently enduring, and despite the general recognition that a flood of imports last year was a contributor to this pain, a proposal to progress applications to import pig meat from countries such as the United States, Mexico, South Africa and a number of EU countries is under consideration. The comments by Senator Parer today in question time were to the effect that, at this time, no decision has been made in relation to such a proposal. Nevertheless, there is such a proposal on the table from AQIS, and it is under serious consideration. In fact, what might be termed a formal consultation process is under way, and that process ends on 18 June. The AQIS memorandum, dated 18 May, advises the industry—because it was sent industry wide—that, as a World Trade Organisation member, Australia must consider access requests from these countries in a timely manner. But the question is: timely for whom? I can assure the minister that, on this one, his timing could not have been worse for the Australian industry.</para><para>We do have trade obligations that must be honoured, but we also have obligations and responsibilities to those industries which might be adversely affected by trade liberalisation. We are talking here about working families and we are talking about Mr Howard's small business sector, because most of these producers are small businesses. There are some very large ones but in the main they are small businesses. We have to ensure that our domestic policy framework enables us to accommodate our GATT obligations in such a way that important industries, such as the pork producers, have the time and the means to adjust.</para><para>Before Mr Anderson ticks the box to allow pig meat from the USA, Mexico, South Africa and the European Union onto the shelves of Australian supermarkets, he must do a number of things. He must put in place a means by which Australia can respond quickly to surges in imports, as occurred last year. He must ensure Australian product can easily be distinguished from Canadian, South African, Mexican and USA pork. To the extent that there have been announcements about labelling, there may be some assistance in that regard, but he must significantly enhance the industry assistance package that is currently in place because assistance is needed at this time.</para><para>Despite the tough situation the industry currently finds itself in, it has an important role to play in the future of regional Australia. It also has the potential to be a significant exporter, particularly into Asia. But it requires the government to work with it, not against it.</para><para>This government has taken a number of decisions that have had a negative impact on this industry. The government allowed pig meat imports into this country. The government blocked grain imports, ensuring feed costs were higher than they might otherwise be, especially in times of drought. The government increased AQIS meat inspection charges by up to 300 per cent last year and only cut them back when it was forced to by the Senate. Therefore, it should be the government that puts in place a policy framework to enable the pork industry to realise its full potential.</para><para>In conclusion, let me repeat my call to the minister. Until there is a comprehensive strategy in place to secure the future of the Australian pork industry, Mr Anderson should not progress applications from the USA, Mexico, South Africa and the European Union to import pig meat into this country.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Ireland</title><page.no>3040</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>3040</page.no><name role="metadata">McKiernan, Sen James</name><name role="display">Senator McKIERNAN</name><name.id>1I4</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise tonight in a state of elation over what happened in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland on Friday of last week. The people of that country went to the polls and expressed their views on a 
 referendum as to whether or not they wanted peace in that very troubled Ireland. I am very pleased to note for the record that there was overwhelming support for a proposition that had been agreed to after many months of negotiations. It was finalised on Good Friday and it was put to the people in separate referendums last Friday. It was overwhelmingly carried by some 94 per cent in the Republic of Ireland and 71 per cent in Northern Ireland.</para></talk.start><para>That decision has been welcomed by all of the media outlets in this country. To the best of my knowledge, it has been welcomed by all political parties in this country, and I am very pleased that that is the case. In this chamber earlier today, we unanimously carried a resolution which recognised what had gone into the matters that were culminated in Ireland on Friday of last week. My local newspaper, <inline font-style="italic">The West Australian</inline>, had as its front page headline, `Ireland takes first steps to peace'. They have it slightly wrong there because it is not exactly the first steps; the first steps were taken many years ago.</para><para>Many individuals laid their lives and those of their families on the line to get to the position both countries got to last week. Those individuals are far too numerous to be named in a short adjournment here tonight. But I do make special mention of and pay special tribute to the work of John Hume—and not because John is a leader of a party that is an affiliate of mine. I think that my admiration for him goes far beyond that.</para><para>I admire John Hume because I have actually witnessed him in action in the streets of Derry, his electorate, meeting and talking with the people. He knew a large number of individuals, and I was envious of the fact that he was able to identify so many by name—a very good member of parliament. But he was one of the few politicians at that time—and I am going back to 1989—who did not go armed in public. Also, unlike many other politicians of the time, he did not have a bodyguard accompanying him.</para><para>For an Australian to make statements like that is obviously very unusual; you do not get circumstances such as those in this country, thank heavens. But in Northern Ireland it was 
 the case that at that particular point in time politicians were armed—and, obviously, we witnessed soldiers patrolling the streets of Derry.</para><para>Hume, on the day I was with him, showed me his home from the outside, particularly drawing my attention to the scars that could be seen there. The home had recently been firebombed, I think, for the fourth or fifth time. He explained the reasons why he and his wife actually had to live in some other place, that they still kept that terrace house as their home—and it is still their home—but that it had had to be reinforced. He persevered through all of this without the need to carry arms, either in private or in public, and without the need for a bodyguard. His philosophy at the time, he told me, was that to have a bodyguard and carry a gun would not enforce the view he had of wanting a peaceful solution to the problems of Northern Ireland.</para><para>I am sure that John Hume, as did the vast majority of the people of Ireland—and, indeed, did Irish people spread right throughout the world—celebrated wholeheartedly on Friday night, just as did we on Saturday in Australia, when the results of the referendum came through. This is, like the <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline> newspaper says, a step in the direction of peace. It is not peace in itself, as a lot of very hard work still remains to be done.</para><para>Despite the overwhelming expression of opinion by the people of Ireland, north and south, there are some who even now do not appear willing to accept the views of the majority of the people—and I particularly point the finger at Northern Ireland and to the public comments of one Reverend Ian Paisley. I hope that Mr Paisley and his supporters will see some sense and start putting their efforts into bringing about a peaceful resolution to the problems of Northern Ireland. The opportunity is clearly there and, hopefully, they will do so.</para><para>Today our Senate carried quite a lengthy resolution dealing with the results of the talks.

I finalise by recording again—and it is worth repeating—that Australia, through previous governments and the current government, has made some contribution towards the resolutions that were achieved in Ireland, north and south, on Friday of last week. We make mention in the motion that was carried that a former Governor-General of this country, Sir Ninian Stephen, acted as chair of some of the earlier peace negotiations. Indeed, Australia has made substantial monetary contributions towards the International Fund for Ireland. This fund is doing fabulously good work in the border counties above Northern Ireland and in southern Ireland, and we have made a contribution to that process.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I think, collectively, we can all be very pleased with the progress that to date has been made.

As this is a human carcinogen, exposures should 
 be limited to the lowest level technically feasible. Increases in exposure level to over 32mg/m3 (10 ppm) should be avoided. (Environmental Health Criteria 150: Benzene, WHO, 1993). The Expert Panel on Air Quality Standards in the UK recommended an air quality standard for benzene    of    5    ppb    (16 micrograms/m3) and concluded that 
 the risk of leukaemia in workers would not be detectable when average exposures over a working lifetime were around 500 ppb (1620 micrograms/m3). (Expert Panel on Air Quality Standards: Benzene, Department of the Environment [UK], 1994).</para><para>Toluene:	 The available data indicate that exposure of the general population and environment to toluene does not present any health and/or environmental hazards, at present. However, long-term occupational exposure and solvent abuse may be associated with permanent pathological changes and further investigations are justified. (Environmental Health Criteria 52: Toluene, WHO, 1985).</para><para>MTBE:	 The risk characterisation for MTBE does not indicate concern for human health with regard to current occupational and consumer exposures. Compliance with the occupational exposure limit of 90mg/m3 or 25 ppm MTBE (8-h TWA) is considered to protect workers from any potential hazards. (Methyl tert-Butyl Ether (MTBE) Health Risk Characterisation, European Centre for Ecotoxicology and Toxicology of Chemicals (ECETOC) Technical Report No 72, June 1997).</para><para>Xylene:	 There have been no long-term controlled human studies or epidemiological studies from which a guidance value may be calculated. A guidance value of 0.87 mg/m3 (0.2 ppm) derived from the lowest observed adverse effect level (LOAEL) reported for developmental neurotoxic effects in laboratory animals is recommended. (Environmental Health Criteria 190: Xylenes, WHO, 1997).</para><para>(6) The following information is provided about the effects of the named substances on human biology, as currently evidenced from recognised research.</para><para>Benzene:	 The major effect of high chronic benzene exposure is haematopoietic toxicity with resulting anaemia, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia and ultimately leukaemia, (Reese and Kimbrough, 1993). Benzene is a known human leukaemogen listed by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), (IARC, 1982). The WHO estimated unit lifetime cancer risk from benzene is 4x10-6 from a continuous exposure to 
 1 microgram/m3 for seventy years. (Desk Study—Octane Enhancers, RMIT, November 1994).</para><para>Toluene:	 The primary effect of toluene is on the central nervous system (CNS). The effect may be depressant or excitatory, with euphoria in the induction phase followed by disorientation, tremulousness, mood lability, tinnitus, diplopia, hallucinations, dysarthria, ataxia, convulsions, and coma. (Environmental Health Criteria 52: Toluene, WHO, 1985).</para><para>MTBE:	 Toxokinetic data do not indicate reasons for concern with regard to bioaccumulation of MTBE or any of its metabolites. Transient central nervous system depression and mortality occur at high doses/concentrations only. Skin and respiratory irritation are regarded as effects of prime concern following acute exposure. Following the findings in animal studies that MTBE increases the incidence of certain tumours in rodents following long term inhalation exposure, research is ongoing. The EEC has concluded that MTBE does not require classification as a carcinogen according to the criteria presented in Annex VI of Directive 67/548/EEC on Dangerous Substances (EEC, 1993b). (Methyl tert-Butyl Ether (MTBE) Health Risk Characterisation, European Centre for Ecotoxicology and Toxicology of Chemicals (ECETOC) Technical Report No 72, June 1997). MTBE is classified by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as a potential carcinogen. New Scientist, Vol 157 (2109), 22 Nov 1997.</para><para>Xylene:	 Xylenes are slightly toxic by inhalation and oral routes. Effects specific to xylene inhalation exposure in humans include nose and throat irritation, severe lung congestion, pulmonary haemorrhages and oedema (Reese and Kimbrough, 1993). (Desk Study—Octane Enhancers, RMIT, November 1994).</para><para>(7) The Commonwealth car fleet currently comprises self-drive vehicles provided through private leasing arrangements (mainly DASFLEET sourced) and vehicles provided through COMCAR (the government's car with driver service). With a view to improving the environmental performance of fleet cars, the recently established Joint Working Party on Energy Efficiency in Commonwealth Operations will be investigating a fuel efficiency and emissions minimisation strategy for leased fleet 
 cars, in conjunction with fleet providers and major user agencies.</para><para>(8) COMCAR is trialing LPG factory equipped Holden Caprice and Ford Fairlane vehicles. These trials are at a very early stage and it would be inappropriate to draw any conclusions on the available data. Data collection and monitoring from test vehicles will be used to make informed decisions on the suitability of a more substantial inclusion of alternative fuelled vehicles within the Commonwealth fleet through the Joint Working Party on Energy Efficiency in Commonwealth Operations.</para><para>(9) Environment Australia has commenced preliminary consultations on the accelerated phaseout of leaded petrol. These consultations will determine an appropriate date for industry to withdraw leaded petrol from sale.</para><para>(10) The Western Sydney Regional Organisation of Councils (WSROC), local businesses, NRMA and AGL are currently cooperating in western Sydney to develop a network of users and providers of compressed natural gas (CNG). Environment Australia has provided funds in FY 1998/99 to support this initiative and construction of the first refuelling stations is expected to be commenced later this calendar year.</para><para>(11) The Government is committed to a viable market for alternative fuels, such as compressed natural gas, and understands the importance of the industry having some certainty with regard to future taxation arrangements. It is not possible to identify at this time how long CNG will be exempt from excise.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Waterfront</title><page.no>3049</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 1119)</subtitle><id.no>1119</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>3049</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'Brien</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice on 31 March, 1998:</para></talk.start><para>(1) Did the Government of the United Arab Emirates speak to any representative of the Federal Government about an attempt by Fynwest Pty Ltd to train stevedoring workers in Dubai, prior to 6 December 1997; if so, who was contacted, what was discussed and what action was taken.</para><para>(2) Who in the Minister's Office spoke with Ms Grace Wells of Fynwest Pty Ltd or any other representatives of Fynwest Pty Ltd, regarding the facilitation of passports for stevedoring trainees seeking to travel to Dubai; (b) what assistance was provided, (c) was the Minister advised of this occurring; and (d) what discussions occurred on the matter between the Minister's Office and any other Minister or ministerial office.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>3049</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator Hill</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Environment</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><para>(1) The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has no record or recollection of any conversation between the Government of the United Arab Emirates and any representative of the Australian Government prior to Mr Brereton's question in Parliament of 3 December, about the proposal by Fynwest Pty Ltd to train stevedoring workers in Dubai.</para><para>Following the matters raised by the Opposition in Parliament on 3 and 4 December about the proposal by Fynwest Pty Ltd to train stevedoring workers in Dubai, on 5 December the UAE Ambassador, Mr Al-Falasi, called on officers of the Middle East and Africa Branch, Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to discuss the issue.</para><para>(2) (a) (b) (c) (d) The Minister's Office has no record or recollection of having been contacted by Ms Grace Wells or other representatives of Fynwest Pty Ltd or of any reference to Fynwest in any calls or to any project involving Fynwest or stevedoring training in Dubai.

Of this $925,900 was provided under the Riverworks Tasmania Program, $47,700 from the Waterwatch Program and $8,000 from the Coastcare Program.</para><para>A small part of the Tamar-Esk catchment falls within the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area and funding has been provided for the entire world heritage area under the World Heritage Program.</para><para>2 (a) The advice of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) was sought in answering this question.</para><para>I understand that properly managed fish farms can have a relatively low impact on riverine environments. Aquaculture, including fish farming, requires clean water to be sustainable.</para><para>I understand from the CSIRO that a variety of wastes emanate from fish farms. These can include uneaten feed, excretion from fish and activities associated with the operation of the farm such as removal of fouling organisms from nets and emissions from work boats. Impacts from farm operations are typically a minor source of contamination. Excretion from the fish can either be as solids (faeces) or dissolved matter (via gills or other pathways). The components of concern are suspended solids, organic matter (usually characterised by its biological oxygen demand—BOD), and the nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus. The action of these wastes is to reduce water clarity, deplete the concentration of dissolved oxygen and to increase the prospect of algal blooms.</para><para>In preliminary results from a Huon River study, I understand that the CSIRO has not found significant evidence of changes in water quality within 100 metres of salmonid fish farms in the lower Huon Estuary. Changes to sediments as a result of waste deposition beneath cages appears to be constrained to the farm leases and their immediate vicinity.</para><para>To date, I am informed that the CSIRO Division of Marine Research has not made any investigations of the Tamar Estuary, and are not aware of any other comprehensive work on this estuary. 
</para><para>2 (b) From a survey of published information on discharge of waste products from fish farms, or in studies of caged fish, I understand that the CSIRO has not found any information on salmonids (salmon and trout) under Australian conditions.</para><para>I am informed that most published information on discharge of waste products from fish farms derives from aquaculture in the northern hemisphere—mainly Scandinavia, UK and North America. Wastes from fish farms vary widely as a result of environmental conditions (for example temperature, season and water quality) and aquaculture practices (for example species and age of fish, stocking density and feed composition).</para><para>I understand that very recent data reported for waste loadings from a freshwater Atlantic salmon farm on the west coast of Scotland, over a two-year period, were 327-337 kg suspended solids/tonne of fish/year, 422-485 kg BOD/tonne fish/yr, 71 kg total nitrogen/tonne of fish/year (one year only) and 10.9-11.1 kg total phosphorus/tonne of fish/year (Kelly et al. 1996). There should be little difference for a farm operating in freshwater as compared to a farm in brackish waters of an estuary, and it should be reasonable to scale this figure up by 1000 for the units requested in the question.</para><para>A summary of salmonid information in the late 1980s provided by the CSIRO gives the following ranges: 293-4015 kg suspended solids/tonne of fish, 285-350 kg BOD/tonne fish, 78-117 kg total nitrogen/tonne fish, 9-51 kg total phosphorus/tonne of fish. The range of these figures doubtless originate from the differences in environmental conditions and farm practices. It is likely that with the advent of improved fish farming methods that the figures are now toward the lower limits of these ranges.</para><para>I understand that the CSIRO has consulted with a representative of the Tasmanian salmonid industry, and also with a member of the Marine Farms Branch, Tasmanian Department of Primary Industry and Fisheries. They are of the opinion that the northern hemisphere data are broadly applicable to Australian conditions. Australian feed formulation is possibly slightly more digestible than European and North American feeds, which should slightly diminish waste production.</para><para>(3) The Department of Primary Industries and Energy have advised that infectious pancreatic necrosis virus is not known to occur in Australia.</para><para>(4) Control over funding provided by the Commonwealth for State projects varies depending on the nature and purpose of the funding. Where funding is provided for a specific purpose the Commonwealth can exercise considerable control through grant or contract conditions.</para><para>Factors such as current and proposed use would be considerations in determining whether the 
 Commonwealth provided funding to a particular area. Where State managed activities were not consistent with Commonwealth environmental objectives funding would not be provided.</para><para>In the case of funding to the Tamar-Esk catchment, I am not convinced at this point that properly managed salmon farming would threaten the environment in this area. I also understand that salmon farming in the Tamar would be subject to a range of controls, including those under the Tasmanian Marine Farming Planning Act 1995, to ensure that significant environmental impacts do not occur.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Search and Rescue Training</title><page.no>3053</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 1137)</subtitle><id.no>1137</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>3053</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'Brien</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, upon notice, on 15 April 1998:</para></talk.start><para>(1) (a) Was there search and rescue (SAR) supply dropping training undertaken in October and November 1997; if so, when and where was the

A formula using these terms defines an A-unit. In 1993, 30.3% of A-units were compulsorily retired from the fishery. This resulted in a reduction in the number of active fishing vessels from 171 in 1992 to 130 in 1993.</para><para>(b) The reduction was based on a scientific advice from the Commonwealth Scientific Investigation &amp; Research Organisation (CSIRO) in 1986/87 that tiger prawns were overfished and as a consequence the annual yield was sub-optimal. Short term management measures introduced to reduce effort on tiger prawn stocks, low catches and low market prices resulted in need fro a reduction on an economic basis. The 1993 reduction was based on economic advice from the Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics and the Department of Primary Industries and Energy that a reduction in fleet size would result in improved economic efficiency and vessel profitability.</para><para>(c) The capacity caps on the number of A-units and the number of boats permitted to operate have remained since 1993 and is reflected in legislation under the current Management Plan for the fishery that came into effect in 1995. The maximum number of boats is 133 and the maximum is defined in the Northern Prawn fishery Management Plan.</para><para>(2) The number of vessels operating has ranged from a low of 125 vessels in 1995 to a high of 130 vessels in 1993 and 1998. The maximum number of vessels that can operate is 133. This maximum is defined in the Northern Prawn Fishery Management Plan.</para><para>(3) (a) Nineteen new vessels have entered the fishery since 1993, four of these entered the fishery 
 in 1994, two in 1995, eight in 1996, four in 1997, and one in 1998.</para><para>(b) All new vessels are replacement vessels and fish under pre-existing Statutory Fishing Rights. No new licences have been granted by AFMA, only the processing of replacement vessel nominations.</para><para>(4) (a) Yes, the CSIRO has estimated that due to factors such as technological innovation and vessel replacement effective fishing effort increases by an average of 5% per year. This phenomenon is called "effort creep". The Northern Prawn Fishery Assessment Group, on behalf of AFMA, adjusts the number of actual fishing days logged for all vessels for effort creep, and annually assesses the effective levels of fishing effort applied to the NPF.</para><para>(b) No, the latest assessment by the Northern Prawn Fishery Assessment Group shows that effective fishing effort applied to tiger prawns in 1997 was about 16% greater that the effective effort applied in 1993.</para><para>(5) (a) Yes, the Northern Prawn Fishery management Advisory Committee (NORMAC) first recommended a reduction in fishing effort to the AFMA Board in July 1997.</para><para>(b) The level of effort reduction recommended was in the order of 20 to 25% by the end of 1999.</para><para>(c) The level of reduction was based upon scientific assessment that at the end of 1996 the level of effort applied to tiger prawns was 10% above that needed to produce the maximum sustainable yield, and that effort creep adds, on average, a further 5% per annum.</para><para>(d) The measure of reduction was effective fishing effort, although the actual reduction was proposed to be in units of net length and partial closure of some fishing grounds for one month.</para><para>(e) The AFMA Board has supported the recommendation.</para><para>(6) After the proposed reductions it is estimated that effective fishing effort will fall by approximately 15% from estimated 1999 levels. This will result in effective fishing effort levels about 15% above that in 1993.</para><para>(7) (a) The NPF is usually closed from 1 December until 31 March and again from 16 June until 31 July inclusive.</para><para>(b) Yes, in additional to permanent closures of nursery areas and specific closures of areas to protect recruiting prawns, NORMAC has recommended an additional partial closure for the month of November. This proposed closure encompasses the main tiger prawn fishing areas around Groote  
 Eylandt, the southern Gulf of Carpentaria and Weipa. In addition, Joseph Bonaparte Gulf will also be closed at the same time to prevent an excessive translocation of fishing effort to that area.</para><para>(8) AFMA is responsible under the Fisheries Management Act 1991 and the Fisheries Administration Act 1991 for managing the fisheries under Commonwealth jurisdiction. The Minister for Resources and Energy only has the power to issue directions to AMFA concerning the performance of its functions and the exercise of its powers in exceptional circumstances, to ensure that the Authority's activities do not conflict with major government policies.</para><para>Nonetheless, the Minister has been briefed by AFMA and DPIE on the management of the Northern Prawn Fishery. The Minister has also met with a range of prawn operators to hear their views. AFMA has considered the possible impact of translocation of fishing effort on areas remaining open after seeking advice from NORMAC. In AFMA's view there is little risk to stock sustainablility because the areas remaining open are areas that are lightly or not normally fished because prawn densities are low. It is believed that not all vessels will continue to fish the full month of November. The closure will reduce fishing pressure on tiger prawn stocks without deleterious impact on other species.</para><para>(9) (a) Of 130 boats based on the east coast, 43 are based at cairns; 6 at Brisbane; 5 at Townsville; 2 each at Byron Bay, Innisfail and Hervey Bay; and 1 at Mackay.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Aged Care</title><page.no>3056</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 1179)</subtitle><id.no>1179</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>3056</page.no><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator Forshaw</name><name.id>656</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Family Services, upon notice, on 7 May 1998:</para></talk.start><para>With reference to funding of $370,000 for a community speakers program on aged care:</para><para>(a) which organisations will receive funding from this amount; and (b) what amount will each organisation receive.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>3056</page.no><name role="metadata">Herron, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator Herron</name><name.id>VW4</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Minister for Family Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><para>At this stage, $297,939 has been allocated to approved organisations on the basis of proposals submitted.</para><para>Funds have been allocated as follows:</para><para></para><table pgwide="1" border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><tgroup><thead><row><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para></para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para></para></entry></row><row><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>(a)</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>(b)</para></entry></row><row><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para></para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para></para></entry></row><row><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>Organisation</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>Amount</para></entry></row><row><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para></para></entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>New South Wales</para></entry></row><row><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para></para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para></para></entry></row><row><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>Aged Care Services Assoc.
