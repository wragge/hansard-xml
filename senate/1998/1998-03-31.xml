At least 15 submissions written and oral to the Senate legislation inquiry into the Child Care Payments Bill drew attention to the administrative difficulties the government was forcing on the industry. Why did the government ignore those views and go ahead with its changes to the system of payments of child-care assistance? Why did the government cause chaos in the child-care industry and cause chaos for parents by pushing through changes which it has now reversed and which it has now decided it can delay for a further 30 months?</para></talk.start></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>1585</page.no><name role="metadata">Herron, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HERRON</name><name.id>VW4</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank Senator Neal for the question.

I accept that interjection and point out to Senator Cook that Senator Neal has nailed herself because she has come up with an untrue premise. There have been submissions to the Senate inquiry—even recent media articles covering submissions to the Senate inquiry—that suggested only that dramatic increases in child-care fees and community centres are forcing parents, especially women, to change their work patterns. The Labor Party created an unsustainable child-care system whilst in government, and that is why I say Senator Neal has nailed herself because the system that the Labor Party brought into existence was unsustainable. Irresponsibly, it allowed centres to set up where they liked with no regard to need, creating an oversupply and problems of undersupply as well.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The Howard government has allocated more money to child care than any previous 
 government. There has been an 18 per cent increase in this year alone from the last year of the Labor government. This government is about targeting assistance to low and middle income families, in particular the battlers, not those like Senator Neal—and I can understand why she is concerned—but those who need it most, in providing equity and choice in child care. Before the removal of the operational subsidy to community based centres who provide child care for approximately 1.5 per cent of Australian children, some 70,000 families received the benefit of around $20 a week no matter what their income, while 210,000 families around Australia in private centres did not. Why should someone on $75,000—as Senator Neal—or $100,000 income receive the same assistance from government as someone who is on, say, $28,000?</para><para>To demonstrate the government's commitment to helping families in the work force, child-care assistance will now be provided to families using outside school hours care services from 27 April. Fifty-one thousand low and middle income families will receive financial assistance for the first time, and 19,000 families will receive improved assistance. The government has provided substantial assistance, over $8 million, to community based centres to assist them restructure. Child-care fees are set by service providers. Those community based centres choosing to increase their fees do so in consultation with families and management. Many are choosing not to keep their fees at reasonable levels.</para><para>Private sector fees are now on average $10 a week less than community sector fees—$152 a week compared to $162 a week. Accreditation standards are identical in both sectors. Ninety per cent of private centres and ninety-two per cent of community based centres achieved accreditation.

We fixed the problems that they created. We listened to the people who put forward submissions, and we have adjusted them as we are supposed to do. That is what good government does.

In the last week as a result of the Howard government's responsible economic management we have seen further positive indications on employment growth; improved business expectations for sales, employment and investment; a surge in export growth in our non-traditional markets; and, yesterday, a massive cut to interest rates for small business.

The small business interest rate decision of Westpac yesterday was truly historic. Reducing the base rate to 7.2 per cent—down to rates that have not existed since the early 1970s—is a tremendous boost to small business in this country. Small business have been looking for this for so long. But, of course, 13 years of Labor gave them nothing but misery. Labor never understood small business. We will never forget—and small business will never forget—that under Mr Keating interest rates were forced up to something like 20 per cent for small business, obviously resulting in so many going to the wall. That was Labor's achievement of 1989-90—20 per cent interest rates for small business.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>RF4</name.id><name role="metadata">COOK</name><name role="display">Senator Cook</name></talker><para>—1989-90!

Only two years later interest rates are down to 7.25 per cent, a four per cent improvement for all small business in this country. That is something of which we are very proud. And we give credit to Westpac for taking the lead. We would now like to see other banks in Australia pick up the challenge and provide competition to Westpac in this instance. We give credit in exactly the same way that we gave credit to the National Australia Bank when it led in the reduction of housing interest rates. Housing interest rates in this country are down to a 30-year low as well. All Australians benefit when 
 the housing interest rate is at a 30-year low. We achieved that in housing; we achieved that for Australian families and we are now achieving it for Australian business as well.</para></talk.start></continue><para>It has been estimated that Westpac's move will cut between $150 million and $400 million off the annual borrowing costs of small business around Australia—a tremendous boost. Huge money is being saved by small business: for an ordinary small business with a $100,000 overdraft the estimate is a saving of $275 a month. This did not come about by accident. It came about because we had a government in this country that had the courage to take the hard decisions on public expenditure—rein in public expenditure—get inflation down and allow it to flow through with lower interest rates to the benefit of all small business. Compare the figures—housing interest rates were at their high under Labor.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Senator Bolkus interjecting</inline>—</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>BH4</name.id><name role="display">Senator HILL</name></talker><para>—They were 17 per cent, Senator Bolkus. Now under this government they are 6.9 per cent. As I said, small business: a high under Labor of 20 per cent; under the coalition, 7.2 per cent. Credit card interest rates: a high under Labor of 25 per cent; now down to 16.2 per cent and still falling. And, of course, this translates into more jobs for Australians. This is part of the reason that an extra 220,000 jobs have been created since the Howard government came to office. And if the Labor Party had not blocked the reforms to the unfair dismissal laws last week, according to the Small Business Association another 50,000 Australians could have been employed. So there is no comparison in Australian politics at the moment on the issue of sound economic management. There is no comparison in the alternative that will benefit small business and give small business the opportunity to grow and expand and, most importantly, to employ. This good news is for the benefit of all Australians. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></talk.start></continue></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>1587</page.no><name role="metadata">Lightfoot, Sen Phillip</name><name role="display">Senator LIGHTFOOT</name><name.id>WP6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Madam President, as a result of Senator Hill's comprehensive and exciting answer, I have a supplementary question.

We have done it with the economy by addressing the $10.3 billion deficit we inherited and achieving these low interest rates. We have done it with IR—industrial relations—reform and it produced the lowest level of days lost in one year in 70 years. And we will do it in tax reform as well. We know that it is an area in which we can reduce the costs to small business again. But you asked me to compare it with others. Where does the Labor Party stand on tax reform? On 21 May last year Mr Evans said, `It is only a second or third order issue.' What did Senator Cook say in this place? He said, `There is a case for tax reform but not the overblown case that the government has made out.' At last the Labor Party is starting to come clean.

The 1997 increase in fees in community centres is above the trend over the last six years but has seen increases of around six per cent—or between $6 to $10 per year for families using full-time care. The increase in fees in private centres is below this trend.</para><para>So the government provided financial assistance—$8.3 million over two years—to assist community centres adjust to the loss of operational subsidy.

The first is the draft Multilateral Agreement on Investment (MAI), as at 13 February 1998. The second is Australia's latest Revised Schedule of Preliminary Reservations, dated October 1997.</para><para>It should be emphasised that the two documents are very much in draft form. The negotiations on the MAI are far from complete as is evidenced by the significant number of square bracketed provisions and alternative formulations in the draft. Many significant issues are yet to be settled, including the nature of the dispute resolution mechanism, the extent of any so-called "carve outs", the treatment of regional economic integration organisations and the nature of and processes for exceptions. Accordingly, negotiations are not likely to conclude for 
 some time. The OECD Ministerial Council Meeting (MCM) in late April 1998 will need to decide the future of the negotiations on the MAI, including whether to extend the deadline for negotiations, for example to next year's MCM.</para><para>Given the nature of the MAI negotiations, countries' lists of exceptions, or reservations, will form an integral part of the agreement. Australia's draft reservations should therefore be included in any assessment of the draft agreement. I stress that Australia's draft reservations are likely to be significantly revised and refined as the negotiations proceed, reflecting:</para><para>.	 further development of the provisions of the MAI, possibly involving significant changes;</para><para>.	 the outcome of ongoing consultations with Commonwealth and State agencies as regards the application of MAI provisions and policies that may impose more stringent requirements on foreign investors than on domestic investors, for which we will need to take reservations; and</para><para>.	 the outcome of negotiations on the form that country specific reservations should take and the types of reservations that will apply, including with respect to the question of applying standstill to particular reservations.</para><para>The Government believes that an appropriately worded MAI could provide benefits to Australia. For example, Australians who invest overseas would benefit from a more transparent and certain global investment framework and Australian offshore investments will be more secure because of the protection offered by the MAI. Australia would also benefit from the higher global investment promoted by an MAI. Strong global investment is critical to generating high levels of economic growth over the longer-term, and brings benefits from the creation of jobs, from higher income and from new technology.</para><para>The Government will not sign the agreement unless it is satisfied that it is in Australia's national interest to do so. In protecting Australia's national interest, the Government has stated that it will ensure that any agreement on the MAI will not override, or weaken, Australia's existing policies on foreign investment. Australia will lodge all exceptions required to protect current policies. For example, exceptions would be taken out in the areas of foreign investment, immigration and indigenous people. Australia is negotiating on the basis that general exceptions would apply to such things as tax measures, national security, public order and health and quarantine measures. Foreign investors operating in Australia would continue to be required to adhere to Australia's domestic laws and regulations, including our environmental and labour standards. 
</para><para>In conducting the negotiations, the Government is actively consulting with interested parties, including the States and Territories, business groups, the union movement and other non-government organisations.</para><para>The draft MAI has been referred to the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties for examination. The Committee has called for submissions and will undertake public hearings in most capital cities. For those who have expressed concerns regarding the MAI, the Committee process provides an opportunity to comment on the draft agreement and Australia's draft exceptions. The Government will carefully consider all issues raised by interested parties and the general public in participating in the ongoing negotiation of the MAI. The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties aims to produce an interim report on the draft agreement by 25 May 1998.</para><para>The Government will not take binding action on the MAI until it has been subjected to the new treaty-making processes established by this Government in 1996. These processes require treaties to be tabled in Parliament along with a National Interest Analysis (and thus subject to public and parliamentary scrutiny) before the Government takes binding action. This process also requires that the views of the States and Territories be taken into account before Australia agrees to become a party to, or indicate its acceptance of, the treaty.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title><type>Miscellaneous</type><page.no>1598</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Health Services: Rural Areas</title><page.no>1598</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>1598</page.no><name role="metadata">Herron, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HERRON</name><name.id>VW4</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Yesterday Senator Crowley asked me a question in relation to health services in rural areas and I seek leave to incorporate to answer in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> .</para></talk.start><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The document read as follows</inline>—</para><para>SENATOR CROWLEY: My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Family Services.

Despite the fact that Senator Herron seems to be incapable of appreciating that this is the case, certainly the rest of the community, families and women who have to take advantage of child care are very well aware of it.</para><para>You might have noted that this government has a history of refusing to acknowledge that they have problems. You might recall what occurred with nursing homes and what is happening now in the health system. This government believes that, if they consistently deny that there are any difficulties, that in fact there are none. But the community is a lot smarter than you. What Senator Herron and the government are saying is completely contrary to every piece of evidence that is available.</para><para>Three surveys have been done. On each occasion the minister has said that they are not to be taken seriously. He said that with the National Council of Community Based Children's Services, when they did a survey. He said that the New South Wales Council of Social Service survey should not be taken seriously. He said the Queensland Child Care Coalition survey should not be taken seriously. But these surveys all say very much the same thing, and when a number of surveys and people in the community are saying the same thing, that child care is in chaos, then I really think it would be worthwhile for this government to start listening. What they are saying is all the same; they are saying that child-care costs are going up all around Australia—they are going up between $11 and $25 a week per child.</para><para>The surveys are also saying that parents can no longer afford child care. The parents are being forced to either leave the work force or, alternatively, risk their children by putting them in unlicensed care.	They are also saying that parents are being forced to expect a lower level of service because of the cuts the child-care centres are having to impose. They are having to reduce the number of trained staff; they are having to reduce the equipment that is available to them.</para><para>All round, child-care centres are doing it tough. The refusal of this government and Senator Herron to recognise that is not going to make the problem go away because, on the twentieth of this month, the inquiry being conducted by the Senate community affairs committee indicated that the concern about the chaos in child care is not limited to three surveys. We have now received 850 submissions from child-care centres, from parents and from community groups that, once again, say the same thing: the changes that have taken place as a result of this government's policy are a disaster; they are causing chaos all around Australia for parents and their families. In this day and age, it is pretty difficult to raise a family. With the increased costs being introduced by this government, it is not just pretty difficult, but if you are also trying to meet the cost of child care then, for many people, it really is impossible.</para><para>I have to say that I was quite surprised to receive, as one of the submissions received by the community affairs committee, a submission by Catherine Cusack. Catherine Cusack I have known for many years and she is a very thoughtful and considered person. But I suppose it also interesting that Catherine Cusack is an adviser to Peter Collins, the Liberal Leader of the Opposition in New South Wales. Catherine Cusack was very forthright about what she thought about the policies of this government in child care and the damage that is being done by the policies of this government to parents and their families.	I would just like to read a small part of her submission, but I am sure most of the people in the Senate would like to hear much more of it. It is available and I hope that you will take the opportunity.

Living on the never-never, that was typical of Labor.</para></talk.start><para>They had no formal planning system for child care, resulting in some areas having an oversupply of places and others being totally undersupplied. They focused the majority of their assistance on the community based sector, which supplied only about 30 per cent of child care places. That resulted in an uneven playing field for the industry.</para><para>They left us with a legacy of mess, total lack of planning, total lack of facilities spread across where they were needed, oversupply in one area and undersupply in another area. The child-care industry was in disarray under Labor's poor management. From 1991, private child care centres were established in various locations. They were established with no directional support from government to indicate areas of greatest need and there was haphazard growth all over the country. There were, as I said, too many centres existing in one area, where there were no centres in another area—total undersupply.</para><para>This poorly planned access to child care created uncertainty in the child-care industry about their future viability due to too many centres in some areas, and it meant a lack of choice for other families in undersupplied areas.</para><para>Under Labor the low rate of child-care assistance provided to families outside school hours meant there was totally inadequate supply of places for children requiring care between the end of school and when their parents came home from work. That was totally inadequate to meet the needs of low- and middle-income families. So they effectively prevented about 51,000 Australian families using outside school hours care from receiving any child care assistance at all. That was neglected.	But do not worry about that, they left us a system which was totally in disarray and which also neglected a whole range of families that needed after school care.</para><para>In one of the questions, Senator Mackay went on about surveys.

They claimed there were huge fee increases and that the centres were closing down, and women were having to leave work because they could not get child care. This survey was done by the Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Workers Union, so I do not think that was an unbiased group of people doing the survey. I think it showed that the fees went up about $4 above those of the private centres. Also, when you look at what has happened in South Australia, overall, the restructuring there has been a net loss of two centres.</para><para>Money was given by the government to centres which did not see themselves as being viable—ones which, because of Labor's poor planning, were totally inappropriately placed. They were given assistance for restructuring. If they could not restructure, they were given assistance for combining some of those services together.</para><para>The industry now is getting the measure of this Labor Party. The Australian Confederation of Child Care has issued a press release, which states:</para><para>Australian Child Care Centres are the best in the world, and are as economical as $5.00 per day to families, according to the Australian Confederation of Child Care which represents over 1000 private child care centres.</para><para>I would rather listen to them than to some survey done by the Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Workers Union because the confederation is actually in the business—it represents 1,000 centres. The press release also quotes the president of the confederation, Martin Kemp, as saying:</para><para>Studies of overseas child care centres recently undertaken by members of the Confederation have confirmed that Australia has the world's best standards and facilities.</para><para>We want to completely refute recent comments about Child Care which appear to be politically motivated—</para><para>Appear to be? I would say they are politically motivated—</para><para>which suggest there have been substantial fee increases. This politically motivated campaign only serves to do long term damage to the Child Care industry as a whole. This campaign is trying to blame the current Federal Government for reduc 
 tions in attendance at Child Care Centres. Nothing could be further from the truth.</para><para>The confederation goes on to praise the current minister, saying that he has shown more understanding and leadership in child care than have ministers in previous times. This is damnation for all the previous child-care ministers on the other side, including Senator Crowley, who reigned over this raid that occurred in child care under Labor. This is just a furphy. The Labor Party has no policies on this issue. If Labor were back in power, we would have child-care centres being spawned in inappropriate places throughout Australia, like they were under Labor. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>1602</page.no><name role="metadata">Reynolds, Sen Margaret</name><name role="display">Senator REYNOLDS</name><name.id>XI4</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I have never heard such a load of nonsense from Senator Patterson. I have a great deal of admiration for Senator Patterson in a number of areas where she has worked most effectively. But, after listening to her contribution this afternoon, I really think she needs to do some homework.</para></talk.start><para>I want to direct my attention to the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, Senator Herron. He has tried to discredit the Queensland Child Care Coalition survey by calling it a Labor Party front. I am sure that parents in Queensland will be interested to hear this because parents are concerned about the lack of child care, the costs of child care and the disturbing trends under this government. They are not concerned about Liberal, Labor, the National Party and the Democrats; they want quality child care.</para><para>Senator Patterson has acknowledged that Australia has had, and still has, the framework for a very effective child-care system. I would agree. Who delivered that system? It was Labor when it came into government in 1983. What concerns so many of us, Senator Paterson, is how your government is whittling away at what is a very good and recognised system.</para><para>When Senator Herron, who in this place acts for the minister responsible, says, `Look, only one or two are affected, and you always have people affected,' I ask: when did he last visit a child-care centre? He acknowledged that he had not read this report. I am sorry 
 that he has left the chamber because this report is about his state of Queensland, and the survey was by both the community based and private child-care providers that Senator Patterson referred to earlier in regard to the survey report.</para><para>The Queensland child-care survey, released in February this year, found a disturbing downturn in quality child-care availability. This is one of the highlights: 3,255 Queensland children are estimated to be missing out on quality child care. That is why we are concerned. That is why parents are concerned. That is why child-care providers are concerned. Who is caring for those estimated 3,255 children who are missing out on quality child care?</para><para>The second point is that, because of child-care funding cuts, parents have been forced to reduce the hours of care by as much as 12,000 hours. This is what we know from just this particular survey: 12,000 quality child-care hours have gone missing because of the funding arrangements and changes that the government has introduced.</para><para>What about enrolments? Enrolments had decreased by 35 per cent in the first half of 1997 and by 50 per cent in the second half. I wonder what the figures are going to be for the first half of 1998 and the second half of 1998. The fee increase reported in the first half of 1997 was between 50c to $30 per week per child. That is alarming for families. No wonder they are withdrawing their children from child care. They cannot cope with that kind of increase in fees. The average fee increase for the second half of 1997 was $11 per week per child. Again, who can say what it will be for 1998 and, if this continues, the second half of 1998?</para><para>A community centre in Ipswich stated:</para><para>Mainly with fee increases, families have found it difficult as their wage had no rise to combat the rise in fees. Some parents were commenting about their security of employment. We are finding that the overall spirit of families is suffering as parents battle to meet costs not only with child care but elsewhere as well. Families are convinced that the government is determined to keep parents, particularly the mother, at home.</para><para>(Time expired)</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>1603</page.no><name role="metadata">Eggleston, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">Senator EGGLESTON</name><name.id>4L6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Senator Reynolds has just made the statement that the government is forcing increased fees on child-care centres. That is absolute nonsense. The government does not set child-care fees. In the community sector, child-care fees and other management decisions are made by committees made up of the parents and the staff in the centres. The government gave community child-care centres over 12 months notice that the system was going to change and provided substantial support—$8.3 million over two years—to assist them to adjust to operating without untargeted subsidies. In addition, supplementary funding of $4.1 million annually is being provided to services in disadvantaged areas.</para></talk.start><para>So, far from forcing fee increases, the charges now in place have nothing to do with the government; they are set by the committees that are running these centres. Far from what Senator Reynolds would have us believe about the Labor government's record in terms of child-care centres, the truth of the matter is that the child-care program was out of control under the Labor government, with an oversupply in some areas, while families elsewhere had little access to the kind of child care they needed.</para><para>The Howard government has made vast improvements to the child-care program. In fact, it is providing more equitable access to child-care places for families all over Australia. We have addressed the concerns about child care that have been raised by Australian families and the child-care industry in extensive consultations, and we have addressed the unregulated growth in the industry over the last six years. In fact, the Howard government has introduced a child-care system which is fair to all parents. One might sum it up by saying—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>B36</name.id><name role="metadata">NEAL</name><name role="display">Senator Neal</name></talker><para>—Yes, it makes them all pay more.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>4L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Eggleston, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">Senator EGGLESTON</name></talker><para>—a fair go to all families is being given by the Howard government child-care program.</para></talk.start></continue><para>There are six principles underlying the Howard government's child-care program—and I think I will run through those six principles for the benefit of senators on the 
 other side, who I am sure will be enlightened by them.The first principle is that the government believes it should assist low and middle income families to meet the cost of child care. Currently, around 77 per cent of families using long day child care receive child-care assistance. Of these, 42 per cent receive the maximum level of assistance. That is a very good thing, and it is something of which the Howard government is very proud.</para><para>The government believes, secondly, that families in like circumstances should be treated in the same way. This commitment is seen in the recent decision to increase the amount of financial assistance again to low and middle income families using outside school hours care. Thirdly, the government believes that extra resources should be provided to help children with additional needs. Extra funding is available to provide child-care services with the support needed to care for children with high needs.</para><para>Fourthly—and this is something which I consider very important—the government believes that it should provide additional support for services in geographically disadvantaged areas, such as remote and rural communities. Why should the people who live in isolated regional towns in Australia not receive good child care? Why should this all go to the kind of inner-city metropolitan electorates which the Labor Party funded? This is now being done. The Howard government is very proud of the fact that it is subsidising child-care centres and helping them to operate in remote rural communities.</para><para>Fifthly, the government believes that priority for new places should be given to neighbourhoods and communities with insufficient places to meet demand. The sixth point and principle under which the government operates is that parents should be confident that a high standard of child care is being provided. The government has gone out of its way to ensure that standards are not only maintained but improved.</para><para>So, overall, it can be said that the Howard government has a very, very proud and outstanding record of achievement in the field of child care—and the Labor government has 
 a lot to feel ashamed of in this area. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>1604</page.no><name role="metadata">Gibbs, Sen Brenda</name><name role="display">Senator GIBBS</name><name.id>6L6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—What we have just had from the other side is the greatest load of rubbish I have ever heard in my life.

 care. There is a recent article in the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline>  where commentator Miranda Devine examines in some detail the reasons for the much touted crisis in child care, which I certainly do not accept exists at all. It is very interesting because she quotes Lyn Farrell, the Director of Lady Gowrie Child Care Centre in Erskineville, who goes so far as to describe the so-called situation in child care as `precipitated by factors from changing work habits to the oversupply of centres.'</para></talk.start><para>She goes on to say that if you listen to the New South Wales community services minister, Fay Lo Po—and I would interpolate there, Senator Neal and those on the other side—the fault lies with the federal government which cuts operational subsidies to community based centres. The much touted surveys are referred to. Then Miranda Devine goes on to say—and I wholeheartedly endorse this—that the truth is much more complex. She says that there is a glut of child-care centres for two- to five-year-olds and refers to the pretty obvious fact that when the Labor federal government expanded child-care fee relief in 1991 it triggered an unplanned and unchecked explosion of child-care centres so that there was actually an oversupply of child-care centres when this government took office.</para><para>It meant that all sorts of entrepreneurial types—solicitors, merchant bankers and financial planners—said, `Get into child care; that is a good thing. There are plenty of subsidies for child care. It is a sure-fire money spinner.' In almost every area in Sydney, apart from the CBD and some isolated areas in the western suburbs, there is an oversupply of two- to five-year-old places. It is not just me saying so. Elizabeth Evans, a policy officer in the Department of Community Services, also says that. Before we get too excited about this, let us look at the causes of the problems in child care when we came to government. The private child-care centres had been established in locations with no direction, with no planning and with absolutely no support for looking at where child care was actually needed, that is, where the areas of greatest need were. The total chaos created was that created by Labor.</para><para>You need to look at what we are trying to achieve with our reforms. We are trying to put child care in locations where it is really needed. Secondly, we want to make it available for those children that need care where otherwise care was not available. Our child-care reforms are all about ensuring both fair and reasonable access to funded child care for more families rather than fewer families, to improved targeting for assistance to those families most in need—those in low income families that otherwise have no access to child care, those with children with disabilities that have no access to child care, and those children under two where there was almost no child care under Labor.</para><para>We now have a planning system to ensure that child-care services are established where families actually need them. Child care is now on a sustainable footing, which will help ensure that services grow at a rate to meet expected demand. We certainly have a commitment to build on the system of quality improvement across all service types. Our objective has been—and remains—to assist families with dependent children to participate in the work force and community by supporting the provision of affordable quality child care. What is most interesting of all is that the latest figures show that labour force participation by women with dependent children has remained constant since January 1996. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><petition.group><petition.groupinfo><title>PETITIONS</title><page.no>1605</page.no></petition.groupinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10001</name.id><name role="metadata">CLERK ASSISTANT</name><name role="display">The Clerk</name></talker><para>—Petitions have been lodged for presentation as follows:</para></talk.start></interjection><petition><petitioninfo><title>East Timor</title><page.no>1605</page.no><no.signed>135</no.signed><name.ids><name.id>TW4</name.id></name.ids><names><name>Bourne</name><name> Sen Vicki</name></names></petitioninfo><para>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in the Parliament assembled.</para><para>The Petition of the undersigned draws to the attention of the Senate Indonesia's continued denial of human rights to the people of East Timor.</para><para>Your Petitioners ask the Senate to call on the Australian Government to:</para><para>1. actively support all United Nations resolutions and initiatives on East Timor;</para><para>2. actively support the right to self-determination of the people of East Timor;

The Commonwealth's interpretation and application of s.135A permitted hormone recipients to have access to their own medical information once the identity of the hormone recipient had been verified. The Commonwealth did not rely on s.135A as a means of preventing disclosure of relevant material in discovery.</para><para>The Government also notes that the Attorney-General's Department is currently undertaking a review of secrecy provisions, including s.135A.</para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">Recommendation 4.	 That the process whereby a Department, being a defendant in a legal action taken against the Commonwealth, is placed in the situation of advising on the release (or refusal) of documents to a plaintiff—yet having full access to all documents themselves—is reviewed, so that procedures may be implemented to ensure that the process is transparent and that any conflict of interest, perceived or otherwise, is avoided.</inline></para><para>Response</para><para>In the Government's view, the requirements of litigation, which apply to all litigants, render it impossible to avoid the situation to which this recommendation relates. However, the Government accepts that in special circumstances, and where practicable, it may be appropriate to take steps to reduce concerns regarding transparency or objectivity.</para><para>Context</para><para>Discovery is a process whereby parties to court proceedings identify and disclose to each other all their own documents which are relevant to the issues in the proceedings. This of its very nature requires a party to have full access to that party's own documents to determine whether a document is discoverable.</para><para>Once documents have been identified as relevant, a party may resist disclosure of the contents of a document on several grounds. These grounds include a statutory secrecy provision, public interest immunity (privilege) or legal professional privilege. Once again, it is necessary for a party to have full access to documents in order to determine whether a ground to resist production exists. Even where the party is legally represented, the party needs to have a knowledge of the material relating to the case, in 
 order to be able to provide proper instructions to the legal representative.</para><para>Even if disclosure of relevant documentation is resisted, the existence of such documentation must be disclosed on discovery. Therefore, the discovery process prevents concealment of the existence of relevant documentation by a party in reliance on a secrecy provision. Overall, in relation to discovery, the Commonwealth is in no better position than a non-Commonwealth party to proceedings.</para><para>The Government acknowledges that adoption of normal practice may result in perceptions of unfairness in special circumstances, such as where relevant documents held by a department include the results of a public inquiry involving both parties to the litigation. In order to avoid that perception, for the purposes of the CJD litigation, within the Australian Government Solicitor (AGS) the discovery of the documents of the Allars Inquiry was  handled separately from the defence of the action. The discovery work was performed by a separate legal team ('the AGS Discovery team'). In deciding whether or not to recommend that documents be discovered in the Victorian proceedings, the AGS Discovery Team did not consult with AGS staff handling the defence of the litigation ('the AGS Litigation Team'). The AGS Discovery Team engaged separate counsel to advise on discovery issues relating to the documents of the Inquiry. The AGS Discovery Team did not at any stage work on the preparation of the defence of the litigation. Whenever Allars Inquiry documents were released to Rennick Briggs, the solicitors acting for the plaintiffs in the Victorian  proceedings, copies were provided to the AGS litigation team, but not before. In the NSW proceedings Macedone Christie Willis, the solicitors acting for the plaintiffs, have agreed that the AGS Litigation and Discovery teams may confer about the relevance of documents for the purpose of discovery.</para><para>In summary, the discovery process of its very nature requires a party to have full access to all that party's documents. Generally, a Commonwealth Department which is required to also comply with a secrecy provision such as s.135A should be placed in no different position to a non-Commonwealth litigant reviewing its documents to determine whether documents are relevant to the proceedings and, if so, whether disclosure should be resisted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">Recommendation 5.

It was a difficult inquiry for all senators from all parties to participate in because of the death of five individuals in recent years who had contracted CJD. The committee was made up of representatives of the Labor Party, government senators, a representative of the Australian Democrats and Senator Harradine.</para><para>The inquiry was conducted in a relatively constructive manner over two days in Canberra. A large number of witnesses came forward to give evidence of their experience and participation in the CJD program from the late 1960s until it was curtailed somewhere around about 1985. Those witnesses were under great stress. They expressed great feeling and great emotion to those senators who participated. Many of the witnesses saw the Senate inquiry as a forum in which they could seek some form of justice for themselves or their families who had contracted the disease and who had suffered some 
 horrible consequences. CJD applies only to infertile females who receive the treatment or to persons of short stature who take the growth hormone.</para><para>The report by the Community Affairs References Committee was brought down, from memory, last September or October. There were 32 recommendations in total in 18 paragraphs, one or two of which had multiple recommendations. After reviewing the government's response to the recommendations of the Community Affairs References Committee, I am pleased to note that the government has accepted all of the recommendations bar three. So some 28 or 29 of the committee's recommendations have been accepted by the government, as outlined in the document that has been incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> today.</para><para>The key recommendations can be conveniently subdivided into five areas: firstly, psychiatric injury; secondly, communications guidelines; thirdly, administrative procedures and processes within the relevant department; fourthly, the processes that individuals have to undergo to qualify for legal aid funding; and, fifthly, further review by Professor Allars.</para><para>The key recommendation may be found in paragraphs 6(a) to (d) of the Senate committee report, and the government has accepted that in total. The government has determined to allocate an additional $3 million in two instalments of $1.5 million each to be paid into the pituitary hormone trust account. Payment will be made on a sliding scale to those persons who are suffering what the government calls recognised psychiatric injury.</para><para>Another committee recommendation was that the government consider extending psychiatric injury to those persons who suffer psychological stress or significant life disturbance. The committee recognised that the latter two categories were qualitatively different from those persons who suffered from psychiatric injury. I have to acknowledge here that the government, in its response, indeed accepted our recommendation to consider extending the claimants to persons who are suffering from psychological stress or signifi 
 cant life disturbance but in its wisdom, having considered that recommendation, has rejected it.</para><para>The final worthwhile aspect of (d) is that an independent board will receive applications for recompense and make the appropriate determination to accept or reject. That will no longer be a process conducted by delegated authority from the minister's office.</para><para>The second most important recommendation from my perspective is recommendation 18, that Professor Allars conduct a further review of the additional scientific information provided to the committee. A lot of that information was, as one would assume, quite technical, some of it narrowly focused, a lot of it open to conflicting interpretations and a lot of it buried in the mists of time. I cannot comment for other senators, but I had difficulty in coming to terms with some of that technical information. In those circumstances, we recommended that Professor Allars, having had some considerable expertise in this area, be requested to further review that material.</para><para>I am informed by an officer of the minister's department that they have accepted that recommendation and that the additional scientific information that was provided to the committee in camera has been forwarded to Dr Allars, who is on some sort of temporary relocation in the United Kingdom, and she is in the process of reviewing that additional information. I look forward to receiving her report in due course to test whether the allegations that were raised in the committee process as to the damage that was done and the cause thereof have any substance.</para><para>In summary, it was quite a difficult inquiry. All senators who participated did so in a most constructive manner and, as a consequence, a unanimous set of recommendations went to the government last September or October. The government has, in its wisdom, accepted nearly all of those recommendations and rejected two or three that go to policy matters regarding legal aid funding. While we do not agree with the government's decision, we understand its reasoning. But I should stress that the government has accepted the key recommendations. </para><para>I am particularly pleased to note that an additional $3 million has been allocated to the relevant trust account for those persons who suffer psychiatric damage to draw upon in due course. I note, finally, that the government has accepted and is in the process of implementing changes to administrative guidelines within the relevant department and communications guidelines for those persons who suffer from CJD and their families.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>1620</page.no><name role="metadata">Herron, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HERRON</name><name.id>VW4</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I support Senator Bishop's remarks about the difficulty experienced in coming to terms with this particularly difficult subject. The Senate Community Affairs References Committee raised in its report on the CJD settlement offer a number of issues in relation to the Australian human pituitary hormone program, the response to the cessation of this program, the litigation and the settlement offer made by the Commonwealth.</para></talk.start><para>The government agrees wholeheartedly with the committee's general view that this is a tragic episode for all involved and that support must be given to those affected. The government acknowledges that there were some deficiencies in the operation and oversight of this hormone program and a small number of recipients have suffered distress and anxiety, which is deeply regretted. As a former Chairman of the Community Affairs References Committee, I recall this was something that we grappled with, and former Senator John Coulter had a particular interest in establishing an inquiry.</para><para>It should be noted that the establishment of this inquiry represented rather a sea change by the opposition. In 1995, when in government, those opposite did not agree to a proposal by the Australian Democrats that there should be a Senate committee inquiry into CJD issues. The principal grounds for this refusal, which we as the then opposition agreed with, were that there had recently been a comprehensive public inquiry by Professor Margaret Allars into the complex matters surrounding the human growth hormone program and that it 
 was very questionable that a Senate committee would throw any new light on these issues.</para><para>It was also likely that there were some people who would want to selectively revisit past events and use the opportunity afforded by the privilege of the parliament to make unnecessary and unsubstantiated statements about individuals and organisations, most notably CSL in the period when it was a Commonwealth government entity and when the issues relating to unconventional slow viral infections transmitted by hormones from collected pituitary glands were not understood as they are now.</para><para>I recall that it was Professor Gajdusek who won the Nobel Prize for his work on slow viral transmission of disease that led to the recognition of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. It is worth recalling what the Minister representing the Minister for Health said in this chamber in 1995, when rejecting a parliamentary inquiry:</para><para>. . . a retrospective judgement is very easy to make but it does not necessarily give us more truth or more accuracy. Particularly when you have diseases with such long lead times as CJD or HIV, I think historical backing up is particularly fraught.</para><para>We agreed with the government of the day on that when we were in opposition. I agreed with Senator Crowley on that occasion, and I and the government still do.</para><para>However, the perspective of those opposite has obviously changed since they lost the election two years ago. That said, it is very important to stress—as indeed both the then government and the opposition did in 1995—that CSL, a listed company, meets, as all other pharmaceutical companies are required to do, very high manufacturing standards. CSL holds a licence to manufacture therapeutic goods issued under the regulations of the Therapeutic Goods Act.</para><para>In its preparation of blood plasma products, vaccines and other biological products CSL is subject to rigorous audit by the Therapeutic Goods Authority and been found since the regulations came into effect in 1991 to comply fully with the TGA code of good manufacturing practice. CSL is an Australian success story. It is also essential that we 
 remember that many Australians have derived enormous benefit over many years from the products manufactured by CSL, which have enabled them to enjoy a better quality of life.</para><para>Turning to the committee's report, the government accepts the great majority of the recommendations made in it. The government has decided to allocate up to a further $3 million to the human pituitary hormones trust account to provide for one-off payments to be made to any hormone recipients who can show that they have a psychiatric injury caused by their being told they are at a greater risk of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.</para><para>All hormone recipients who have received human pituitary derived hormone made by CSL on behalf of the Australian human pituitary hormone program and who have suffered a recognised psychiatric injury, regardless of whether they have sued the Commonwealth or whether their treatment was approved or unapproved by the Australian human pituitary hormone program, are eligible to apply for a one-off payment from these funds.</para><para>The government will also establish an independent board to authorise payments from the trust account for a recognised psychiatric injury and to consider applications from hormone recipients. In this way the government will ensure that the decisions regarding such payments are made by an independent group of experts.</para><para>The government decided to allocate up to $3 million in line with the committee's recommendation 6(a) that the amount, as a minimum, be equivalent to the cost of potential litigation. In fact, the estimates received by the government for continuing the litigation were below this amount, but we have decided to make the greater amount available.</para><para>These funds will be available in two separate instalments. The first instalment of $1½ million will be put into the trust account straight away. The independent trust account board will then make a determination on the payments to recipients who make an application. The second instalment of up to a further $1½ million will be made in the 1999-2000 financial year.</para><para>These funds will be allocated after consideration has been given to the position of the trust account and of any new litigation costs that are borne by the Commonwealth. This particularly refers to any costs the Commonwealth has to incur in having to defend such litigation where a recipient has chosen to litigate rather than seek funds through the trust account mechanism that is being established. I understand that the recent APQ settlement offer remains open to all the recipients who are still litigating and that, if they accept the settlement, they will still be eligible to seek money from the trust account.</para><para>The government believes that this process will provide those suffering from a recognised psychiatric injury with additional financial assistance. The government also gave serious consideration to the recommendation that the trust account be extended to include—as the committee recommended in recommendation 6(c)—recipients who have suffered psychological stress or significant life disturbance.</para><para>After serious consideration of this issue, the government has concluded that the counselling support services that are already operating provide the most appropriate means of support to those who may be suffering in this way. Any recipient or member of a recipient's family can receive counselling in accordance with the guidelines in place from a counsellor approved by the expert counselling panel and the government will pay the bills directly.</para><para>In relation to the further information which the Senate inquiry identified as possibly not having been seen by Professor Allars during her independent Inquiry, I can inform the Senate that Professor Allars is currently examining these documents and the government is awaiting her report.</para><para>The government notes that, in addition to the comments made in the report in relation to the Commonwealth's activities following the end of the program, the committee concluded that, firstly, legal aid was not unfairly denied to APQ and, secondly, that the settlement offer was fair and adequate.</para><para>The government earnestly hopes that this further assistance to recipients will help to bring this difficult and tragic situation to something of a conclusion by providing 
 support and acknowledging the suffering being experienced.</para><para>I commend the government's response to the report on the CJD settlement offer to the Senate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>1622</page.no><name role="metadata">Lees, Sen Meg</name><name role="display">Senator LEES</name><name.id>8U4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Of all the committee hearings I have been a part of in my time in this chamber I would have to say that this was really the most depressing and in many ways very stressful for all members of the committee.</para></talk.start><para>I can imagine what it must be like for those recipients in this program and their families who have battled with this for years, some of them—as Senator Bishop said—since the sixties and seventies, and who now live with that cloud still hanging over them. For us this is over; for them it is certainly not over.</para><para>I wish to acknowledge in particular the work of my colleague the former Senator John Coulter and his efforts over many years to get what he considered to be justice, and also to Senator Brian Harradine another activist in this area who has worked long and hard with the individual families, particularly those families who have stood up and kept asking that the government listen to them.</para><para>On my first reading of this response I was rather disappointed, particularly with the refusal to extend payments to those who have suffered psychological stress or significant life disturbance. This was a deliberate decision of the committee. We listened to many stories from individuals about the stresses that they feel, the persecution they have come up against, the historic problems both they and their families have come up against and the problems they have had to face even in the workplace. For them now to have to go through the process of actually acknowledging that they really do have a psychiatric injury is in many cases another very daunting exercise. That is the only way that they are going to be able to tap into the extra money.</para><para>However, I am pleased that the government has acknowledged in dollar terms that there is still some recompense to go. On going back through all of this response I can see there are certainly quite a few positives in it. I must 
 congratulate the committee as a whole. The fact is that this was a unanimous report of all members who sat on the committee. I guess, in a way, this is the minimal response we could have accepted from the government because all parties, all members of that committee, felt very strongly about these recommendations. There was no dissent. I also must congratulate the staff on the committee for whom also this was a very intense experience and one where, as usual, they worked very hard.</para><para>Just to look at a couple of the positives: of the many recommendations that have been accepted, in particular I welcome the review of the National Pituitary Hormone Advisory Council's decision not to proceed with the epidemiological study. This will enable the council to obtain independent expert advice on the issue. I am also pleased to see the government has accepted recommendations relating to the rights of hormone recipients and their families to services and, as Senator Herron has gone through, a number of those issues were brought up time and time again during the committee process. It is vital that people affected by CJD be aware of their entitlements—and it was evident that all of them certainly were not.</para><para>I look forward to receiving further information from government on the progress of the review and the statement on human experimentation currently being undertaken by the Australian Health Ethics Committee. I also welcome the development of a protocol setting out the procedures for a recipient to access information about their treatment. I welcome the clarification in this document that a settlement offer does not preclude a plaintiff from making a future claim in relation to physical illness that might be contracted by recipients and which could be related to the long-term side effects of hormone treatment.</para><para>The report also states that the settlement offer does not preclude a plaintiff making a future claim that they have contracted CJD or other illnesses relating to program treatment as a result of being an immediate family member of a recipient. On balance, it is a minimal response but a good one and I hope 
 that for the recipients and for their families this is another small step on their path to finding justice and getting an acknowledgment from government that they have a major ongoing and very stressful experience to get through. I will be talking to them in the coming weeks and I hope that they do find this response by government positive.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>1623</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to reiterate what has been said in the chamber. This was a cooperative effort and it showed how the Senate can work. The Senate's functions include the protection of a person's individual rights and this was an example whereby experimental action was taken to overcome an infertility or small stature problem without, I believe, the prudence which should have accompanied those decisions. I do congratulate Senator Bishop on the way that he chaired the inquiry and all of those members of the committee, including the previous speaker, Senator Lees. I feel, as she does, that because the recommendations were a unanimous decision of the committee they carried a fair bit of weight.</para></talk.start><para>The government's response, however, whilst generally acceptable—and I acknowledge it to be generally acceptable—is in some respects questionable. I will give you a clear example. Recommendation 9 the committee made was that the Commonwealth formally acknowledge (a), (b) and (c), where (b) is `the experimental nature of aspects of the treatment under the Program'. The response by the government does not acknowledge the experimental nature, even though the chief medical officer, Tony Adams, told the committee that it was experimental. We had substantial information that led us to suggest that the Commonwealth should acknowledge the experimental nature of aspects of the treatment under the program.</para><para>It is disappointing because what we want to emerge out of this is not only justice and compassion for those that suffered this disease as the result of the experimental nature of the program, but also for the Commonwealth department and others to learn the message. Too often in this area of reproductive technology, prudence just goes out the window. In this case, the fact is that the infertile women 
 and persons of small stature had been treated as guinea pigs. That should not occur again.</para><para>There are a number of other matters to which I wish to advert, but I do not have time to do so now, so in a moment I will seek leave to continue my remarks later. Recommendation 3 states:</para><para>That should legal action proceed, the documentation requested from the Commonwealth through a discovery or further and better discovery process be complied with in a more expeditious manner than has been the case to date. In complying with such discovery processes the Commonwealth should refrain from adopting a restrictive interpretation of s135A of the National Health Act.</para><para>The government's response says:</para><para>The Government accepts that discovery in litigation should be undertaken by the Commonwealth expeditiously and without taking an unduly restrictive approach to secrecy provisions.</para><para>The Government notes that arrangements have been agreed between the solicitors acting for the parties . . . These agreed arrangements have been followed by the Commonwealth.</para><para>The Government notes the Committee's recommendation regarding the interpretation of s.135A of the National Health Act 1953 but does not agree that the Commonwealth in ensuring that s.135A has been complied with, has adopted a restrictive interpretation of the section.</para><para>Frankly, that is a disappointing response to our recommendations. Whether or not CJD litigation continues, it is possible that the Commonwealth will continue with its restrictive interpretation to frustrate discovery and/or procedural processes when litigation has been commenced against it. I believe that the government's rejection of the committee's findings in this respect is particularly strange, given the court's interpretation of the provision and similar secrecy provisions. I hope that this is not the attitude that is going to be adopted by the Commonwealth department of health in respect of this or other matters.</para><para>There were quite a number of people who were very helpful to the committee. Those people included Frank Peters and Karen Weeks. It is a bit invidious naming just two because there are quite a number of others. I feel it would be more appropriate for me to seek leave to continue my remarks now so that we can return to this matter more fully in due course.</para><para>Leave granted; debate adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Employment, Education and Training References Committee</title><page.no>1624</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report</title><page.no>1624</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>1624</page.no><name role="metadata">Crowley, Sen Rosemary</name><name role="display">Senator CROWLEY</name><name.id>ZF4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I present the report of the Employment, Education and Training References Committee entitled <inline font-style="italic">A class act: inquiry into the status of the teaching profession</inline> , together with submissions received by the committee and the transcript of evidence.</para></talk.start><para>Ordered that the report be printed.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Crowley, Sen Rosemary</name><name role="display">Senator CROWLEY</name></talker><para>—I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Leave granted.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Crowley, Sen Rosemary</name><name role="display">Senator CROWLEY</name></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start></continue><para>That the Senate take note of the report.</para><para>This report is very important indeed. It is called <inline font-style="italic">A class act</inline>  and reports on the status of the teaching profession. As our report says, it really gives a window into teaching in Australia at the end of the twentieth century. I believe the report will serve the needs of lots of people who have an interest in education, teaching and the state of our schools. Indeed, it follows very well our previous reports, particularly on the private funding of public schools.</para><para>I note with interest that my colleagues have just finished discussing a government response to a Senate report. I would be very pleased to be able to say that, in the area of education, the government had responded to any of our reports. But it is a sad fact that our committee, since we have been writing reports with the change of government, has not had any government response. We have written a report on early childhood education called <inline font-style="italic">Childhood matters</inline>; we have written a report on adult education called <inline font-style="italic">Beyond Cinderella</inline>; and we have written a report on the private funding of public schools. To this point, even though some of those reports have been outstanding for 21 months, contrary to the convention of responding within three months, we have heard not a word from the government on any of those reports. That is very disappointing for so many people who put such an effort into coming forward and making submissions, particularly in the area 
 of education. It is a major concern for the community, and this report only confirms that.</para><para>I would like to take the opportunity to thank those involved with the preparation of the report, in particular the secretariat principally responsible for the report—Brenton Holmes and Jan Connaughton. They were involved in the committee until very recently; they have now moved to other positions in the Senate. I also thank Jan Willis and in particular Mary Lindsay who at very short notice was asked to come in and assist the committee in preparing this report. Mary had not been present at any of the public hearings, and she had to read her way through all the submissions—well over 308 submissions—and the evidence and transcripts from all the public hearings, which were extensive. So I place on record my appreciation for the work that they have done.</para><para>One of the things that struck the committee very powerfully was the unanimity of views of all the people who put forward submissions. Everybody is of the view that there is a very significant challenge—from a crisis to major problems confronting the status of teachers and teaching in this country.</para><para>The second thing that I think is important is the unanimity of view between private and public schools. With regard to complaints against public schools, there was no way in which the private schools making submissions to this committee would be caught up with, or in any way sucked into, that old debate. They made it clear that the best thing for the private schools in this country is a strong and well funded and well appreciated public sector—that is, it is best for education if both travel together, and in no way is there any benefit to education to open the old sectarian debate between public and private schooling.</para><para>Most importantly, it was agreed by so many witnesses before the committee that the status of teaching and the status of education is not helped by governments blaming teachers for anything and everything connected to schools that may go wrong. It is one thing indeed to challenge teachers about the status of literacy of our school children, even though there has been considerable debate—and I will not 
 canvass it here, except to say that I do not think it was accurately represented by the federal minister, Dr Kemp—but it is another thing altogether to be saying that it is the schools that are responsible for unemployment. Teachers, indeed, began to feel that they were wearing responsibility for just about everything that could go wrong in our society, and that certainly does not make them feel confident or best able to provide optimal education for our children.</para><para>Neither is education in our country assisted by unseemly brawling between Commonwealth and state ministers about just whose responsibility it is for funding of our schools, and so on. We have seen the same kind of debate happening between the Commonwealth and states on the question of health. We have also seen it earlier on between the Commonwealth and the state ministers regarding funding for education in our schools. Governments brawling over funding for education, education ministers brawling between themselves about who is responsible for the cutbacks in funding for education, governments blaming teachers and teaching all send a very strong message to teachers and our schools that this is not an area that is highly prized; this is not an area that is highly regarded by government.</para><para>In days past, I thought it was the responsibility of governments in large part certainly to be seen as advocates for their area of responsibility. Of recent times, we seem to have had quite a change. The first thing that ministers do is offload some responsibility in their own areas of responsibility—in this case schools. That does nothing to persuade those teachers or the community that education is an invaluable and excellent contribution.</para><para>Our report also concludes that there is no way in which you can have a sophisticated, civilised and decent society without you have quality education; and there is no way you can have quality education without you have quality teaching. That is, the status of teachers and teaching is critical to good educational outcomes and the optimal way in which our society views itself and tackles challenges confronting it. If we want the best for our children, if we want the best for our families, 
 then we certainly need to back up a good education system with good teaching.</para><para>We have heard these complaints before and it is interesting to find them once again being raised before this committee—that is, the downgrading or the challenging of teachers. There are the increasing demands being put on them. For example, there is the crowded curriculum. More and more is being asked of teachers, and very few things drop off that curriculum.</para><para>We also have heard at length about the social work dimension of teaching. Many families now regard their children's teachers as the first port of call when facing difficulties within their own lives or within their own community. We also have heard of teachers, particularly principals—as highlighted very well in our previous report—who spend some of their professional teaching time in fundraising to assist their school to get the necessary funding to go on providing the salaries and support for teaching in that school.</para><para>Also, of course, we have heard many a time of the challenge for our schools and our teachers with the introduction of new technology, particularly computers, in our schools. They are just some of the areas that have been highlighted so well in submissions before this inquiry.</para><para>Our principal recommendation is that it is time to put beyond doubt the fact that teaching is a profession. It is not worth our arguing any more whether or not it is a profession; it is accepted, and it must be accepted, that it is a profession. Our first and principal recommendation therefore requires that, in recognition of that, there be the establishment of a national professional teaching standards and registration body to have the responsibility, authority and resources to develop and maintain standards of professional practice.</para><para>Listed in our recommendation are a number of critical areas of responsibility: standards of professional practice, certification for entry into the profession, recognition of advanced standards, accreditation of programs for initial teacher training, priority for national professional development programs, complaints about professional incompetence, register of teachers across the nation, and promoting the 
 value of teaching in the general community. Many of the other recommendations highlight and go to the points that I have raised in terms of the challenges to teaching.</para><para>We have a dissenting report, so this is not a unanimous report. It is disappointing to me in a way that we do have a difference of opinion here. But, if you read the dissenting report, you will find there is very little difference indeed. Indeed, at one hearing, when we were considering the recommendations, there was an understanding that there would be a unanimous recommendation. But the government members have introduced a dissenting report, and they have changed just a word here or there.</para><para>We have recommended that there be a national professional teaching standards and registration body; in particular, we say it should be built on what each state says. The dissenting report says that teaching belongs in the states, and so that is where the principal focus should come from. But anybody reading this report should look at the dissenting report and see that the recommendations are almost word for word; the difference lies just in who they ask to take responsibility for that.</para><para>I commend this excellent report to the Senate, and I urge the government to take seriously the convention of responding to Senate reports. We have had no response to any of our reports. Teaching, education in this country deserves that the government do the decent thing and let us know what they think of the recommendations in this report and all the previous reports from our committee.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>1626</page.no><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator CARR</name><name.id>AW5</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I speak to the motion and commend the report of the Senate Employment, Education and Training Committee to the Senate. The central proposition of the committee's inquiry is that high quality teaching stands central to the provision of high quality education systems; and that critical to the success of our educational experience is, of course, high quality teaching experience.</para></talk.start><para>This report demonstrates that across this country there is a profound sense of malaise amongst the nation's 250,000 teachers. This malaise is not confined to the public sector; it is also being experienced very widely 
 within the private sector. This is a result of the very complex changes that are occurring within society which are reflected in our schooling systems. It is a product of the changes that are occurring within curriculum development and curriculum delivery in terms of the technology that is available for teaching, and it is a reflection of the broader social changes which are occurring within society at large.</para><para>These changes are producing radically new expectations of what should be provided in our educational institutions. They are often presented as an overlay against the traditional view of what educational experiences should involve. In a sense there is a demand by society and by a range of authorities that teachers and schools do more and do it differently. At the same time there is a demand that they do it the same and that they produce the outcomes that people have expected over time. These are often contradictory demands which are supposed to be met by our schools and by our teachers at a time when there are fewer resources available and being provided by governments to meet those demands.</para><para>These are demands that require new levels of skill, of time and of increasing demands on the energy of Australia's teachers who are there to cater for some three million students in this country. This is occurring at a time when I think it is widely acknowledged that governments are retreating from their responsibilities to provide high quality education. You see it in terms of the cutbacks that are occurring at the state level. I see it in my state where some 8,500 teachers have been forced out of the system, where something like 360 schools have closed. The senator from the Northern Territory, Senator Tambling, is in the chamber. I point out that twice the number of schools in the Northern Territory have been closed in the state of Victoria.</para><para>We are seeing massive reductions in expenditure being provided on a per capita basis. At the Commonwealth level we are seeing the introduction of enrolment benchmark adjustment mechanisms to transfer resources from the private sector to the public 
 sector. You see the removal of funding through the various FAG agreements—the Commonwealth-state agreements—withdrawing some $400 million from the education system of this country. We have seen the abolition of national professional development programs. You see it in the scrapping of disadvantaged schools programs and various other equity measures by this government.</para><para>You see it in attempts being made by conservative politicians, in particular, to use the rhetoric of reform as the basis for presenting a perception of crisis within our educational systems. It is almost as if, in order to justify these massive attacks upon our education systems, conservative politicians in this country are attempting to create the atmosphere of crisis, the atmosphere of failure to legitimise downsizing and cost cutting. It is easier to get away with these attacks upon our education systems if you are able to first present an atmosphere of crisis, rather than have genuine debate about the nature of education in this country.</para><para>I noticed, when the senior minister in education was building his empire to remove Senator Vanstone from her place as senior education minister, that some eight weeks after he became the minister for schools he announced in a pre-emptive way that our education systems were failing; that it was a significant proportion of students who were failing to master the basics in literacy. He went on to say that he was going to produce a survey which would demonstrate that there were significant problems in this regard. Is it not surprising, therefore, that when the survey was finally concluded that was exactly what he believed he found. Those remarks were supported by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), who said that the reason we were having difficulties in our schooling system was that of trendy teaching methods. Reminiscent of his views of the good old days, if only we went back into the past, if only we were able to regurgitate the images of the fifties, the problems faced by our education systems could somehow or other be improved.</para><para>We saw it in regard to the statements made by Minister Vanstone that public education 
 was the cause of our employment problems. We have seen it in a range of measures taken whereby there has been an attempt made to manipulate data, manipulate surveys, manipulate various information in such a way as to create the impression of crisis within our education system. I note that Dr Kemp put out a press release in which he said:</para><para>The system is failing tens of thousands of children. It is feeding the unemployment queue and denying children basic skills to participate fully in society. This situation has been allowed to drift on for far too long.</para><para>All of this created the impression that our education system was in crisis. It helped create the environment whereby this government could legitimise its withdrawal of its responsibilities for the public education system in this country. It helped legitimise this government's attacks upon the life experiences of young people in this country as it took from them the real opportunities that can come from a fully integrated quality education program which can only be provided when there is adequate support from governments.</para><para>This committee has gone through and highlighted the needs for substantive change in our education system. It has emphasised that there is high quality teaching going on in this country. We do have a high quality education system, and it is not good enough to scapegoat teachers for problems in our society at large. We should acknowledge the successes, commend the successes and, at the same time, acknowledge that there are always ways in which things can be improved.</para><para>The key recommendation that this committee comes forward with is the notion of national registration of teaching. The national registration of teaching to me is that important step forward in protecting and improving the integrity of teaching in this country. It provides a vehicle by which we can enhance the standards of teaching. It can provide real growth in professional development. We now have extraordinarily high levels of ageing within our educational systems—the average age of teachers is about 46 years—and many of our teachers have not had access to professional development for many years.</para><para>The national registration board can enhance that level of professional development and ensure adequate standards are met by providing a vehicle through which the integrity of our teaching services can be ensured. Given the high levels of mobility that we are facing within this country as a result of population changes it is all the more important for there to be a national approach to these issues, an approach which covers all sections of teaching, from early childhood to government and non-government schools to vocational education and training to TAFE, to ensure that adult and community education is properly accorded its place within the system and that the community can enjoy the benefits of a high quality national approach to the provision of educational services in this country.</para><para>I commend this report to the Senate. It is a valuable contribution to the education debate. I note with some disappointment that the Liberal senators on this committee have chosen to take the mealy-mouthed approach that they have in the minority report and move away from the commitments given in regard to the national registration of teachers.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>1628</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to concur with my colleagues who have already spoken on this report by the Senate Employment, Education and Training References Committee entitled <inline font-style="italic">A class act—inquiry into the status of the teaching profession</inline> . It is the outcome of a very significant inquiry by the committee. As a teacher, I took great interest in this inquiry and in the hearings and I was able to closely relate to much of the evidence that was presented.</para></talk.start><para>The first and probably the easiest recommendation to implement and the one which had the most widespread report—from teachers, unions, academics and principals right across the board—was the establishment of a national registration body which could develop and maintain standards of professional practice. There was overwhelming support for taking this step and a complete absence of any evidence as to why this should not be done. For this reason it is very disappointing that the government members have not seen fit to support that recommendation. They are 
 saying that they support it after a fashion but that it should be up to the states.</para><para>It is interesting that we hear that the states have to decide on this particular issue when in other areas, also referred to in the inquiry, we have seen the most interventionist minister for schools possibly in history. It appears that the federal government can introduce national benchmarking and nationwide testing regimes and threaten to remove literacy funding from the states if they do not comply, but the government members do not think we can take that simple step to guarantee the quality of teachers in this country. I hope that the government members will be able to change their minds on this because it is one way in which this committee's work can make a real difference to the status of teachers.</para><para>The second recommendation is perhaps the most important of the committee's recommendations and it is that:</para><para>. . . governments fund public schools at a level sufficient to deliver the appropriate standard of education within the Eight Key Learning Areas, and commensurate with the National Goals of Schooling.</para><para>It says that we need a joint Commonwealth-state education costs committee to examine the real costs of delivering education. Hopefully, this will go some way towards raising the level of resources to schools and to overcome the very debilitating squabbles and buck-passing that we currently see in this area.</para><para>As we all know, spending on education has been in decline in real terms for some decades now. As the committee's last report, <inline font-style="italic">Not a level playground</inline>, showed, more and more parents, teachers and outside organisations are having to provide money for even the most basic educational needs. This is also an important issue for teachers, who are expected not just to teach but to be heavily involved in fundraising for the operation of their schools.</para><para>I would like to refer to an excerpt from the report from the Australian Education Union:</para><para>It is our view—and it would be recognised by many within the industry as well—that, at the moment, there is not a sufficient proportion of GDP expended on education. It is our view that both the public and private sectors need to be properly resourced so that the kinds of expectations put on 
 schools and on teachers can be fulfilled in a proper way.</para><para>We say in our submission that the status of teachers is inextricably linked to the restoration of a properly resourced, high quality system of public education.</para><para>They go on to note that in Victoria the budget surplus is around $800 million and yet Victoria spends less per head of population than any other state.</para><para>There was a lot of discussion during the inquiry about the enrolment benchmark adjustment and the abandonment of the new schools policy. Witnesses from both the public and the private sectors talked of the divisiveness and the unfair nature of the EBA. For instance, Professor Barry McGraw from the Australian Council of Educational Research commented on the EBA. He said:</para><para>My concern is that this is a change of policy that on the face of it looks minor—we shift a bit of money when each student moves. But in aggregate it could be substantial to an extent that people just don't anticipate.</para><para>. . . From the point of view of individual choice, lowered barriers to entry and easier movement to private provision has few attractions. From the point of view of quality of Government schooling, there is a serious risk of residualisation.</para><para>Parents with a serious commitment to education will be under increased pressure to choose private provision. Those remaining in the public sector are likely to be those with fewer resources and those without the networks and capacities to work for the improvement of the public sector.</para><para>The Tasmanian Primary Principals' Association said:</para><para>The public v private debate is highly relevant to the matter of teacher status, and particularly the status of that large majority of teachers in the public school system. The debate places their schools and therefore their quality under fire and is a major vehicle for attacks on their professionalism, integrity and performance. It is also a major source of their concerns about the security of their careers. Finally, it threatens, in their eyes, the interests of children.</para><para>Many submissions to the inquiry expressed regret at what was called the politicisation of education and the way that teachers were persistently attacked by politicians. Of course, teachers have very few avenues for comeback and so this inquiry was an important opportunity for them to express their anger and 
 their hurt at those attacks. They felt that politicians had a responsibility to show leadership and to defend and support the work that they do, and that politicians were responsible in large measure for the poor standing of teachers in the community. The report says:</para><para>. . . the nature of political involvement in education, at least with regard to its impact at the school level, can be narrowly focussed, ill informed, short term and sometimes very damaging in its consequences.</para><para>The Mount Lawley High School teachers said:</para><para>Our experience has been that the politicisation is present at state level, it is present at federal level and it is present on both sides of politics and that the old educational priorities that were to do with a liberal humanist model, where there was a holistic education of the individual and a whole lot of things that were very commonly accepted, are not even spoken about now.</para><para>The Tasmanian Principals Association said:</para><para>Perhaps the greatest effect on teacher morale arises from the continuing politicisation of education. The present drive for education to serve the needs of the economy strikes at the very heart of the professional teacher's ideals and the view of education and children's interests which stems from those ideals.</para><para>As might be expected, literacy was also a very big issue in this inquiry and it came up time and time again in that context of politicisation. The Senate will recall Dr Kemp saying our literacy and numeracy levels in Australia were a `national disgrace' and he blamed it on teachers' failure to devote sufficient time to teaching basics and on their lack of skills and training. I might add that this is the same minister who removed funding from the professional development program for teachers in the last budget. Our Prime Minister blamed the results on `faddish' teaching methods.</para><para>Those of us who visit schools regularly and talk to teachers know that this is really a load of nonsense. There is little doubt that teachers need to continually upgrade their skills, particularly in the fields of literacy at the primary level. Such professional development should be an ongoing part of our education system, and I think we all understand that. It is in many schools but others just do not have the resources to make that possible.</para><para>The report also calls for the reinstatement of the disadvantaged schools program. That, of course, would go some way to address this need. The report identifies weaknesses in teacher training and induction and it makes recommendations about the way forward, including reinstatement of the successful national schools network. The report calls for a reversal of the trend to put teachers on short-term contracts. In Victoria schools are expected to get 40 per cent of their staff on contract, and the message through this to teachers is very clear: we do not value you and your experience; you are expendable. Whilst this may save money—I understand it is not unknown for teachers to be employed on a term-by-term basis and therefore not get their annual leave—it is also very damaging for teacher morale and is simply exploitative. If we want teachers to be professional, we must be very careful in the way that we treat them and, in my view, putting them on contracts is not one way to do that.</para><para>I would like to conclude by thanking the secretariat for producing this fine document. I commend it to the Senate. It is a very good read. It is the result of a great deal of effort on the part of the committee, the secretariat and, of course, all of those people who made submissions and took the trouble to come along and talk to the inquiry.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Troeth</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>NOTICES OF MOTION</title><type>Notices</type><page.no>1630</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts Legislation Committee</title><page.no>1630</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>1630</page.no><name role="metadata">Troeth, Sen Judith</name><name role="display">Senator TROETH</name><name.id>GX5</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I give notice that, on the next day of sitting, I shall move:</para></talk.start><para>That the provisions of the Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 1998 be referred to the Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by 13 May 1998.

When section 36AA was inserted into the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973, it was not intended that such contracts would require ministerial approval.</para><para>The bill also amends the Health Insurance Act 1973 (the act). The most significant changes will:</para><para>.	 allow the claiming and payment of Medicare benefits by means of electronic transmission. This will substantially improve access to Medicare services especially for many people in rural and remote areas. Doctors will be able to electronically lodge claims for all Medicare services instead of only bulk billed claims;</para><para>.	 eliminate unnecessary consideration by a Specialist Recognition Advisory Committee of questions relating to the continued recognition of a specialist or consultant physician, where recognition was intended to be short term for the purposes of a locum tenans or the specialist or consultant 
 physician applies to have that status ended. This amendment is consistent with the government's policy to reduce the extent to which regulatory provisions intrude on the conduct of business and the professions;</para><para>.	 allow optometrists to charge in excess of the Schedule fee in circumstances to be specified in the Optometrical Undertaking. A revised undertaking will make exceptions in respect of domiciliary visits (as is currently the case) and those occasions where an optometrist attends a patient on the first occasion and the client had attended another optometrist in the previous 2 years;</para><para>.	 extend the application of subsection 10 (1) to a professional service rendered during a `domestic journey'. A domestic journey will include all forms of domestic travel whether prior to or at the end of an international flight. The provision would enable a person who leaves Australia for an international destination but who, before arrival, is required to return to Australia due to ill health to claim Medicare benefits for any professional services;</para><para>.	 inform the direction and management by the Commonwealth, states and territories of the immunisation programs by releasing de-identified data for research purposes from the Australian Childhood Immunisation Register. The Privacy Commission has confirmed that the release of information from the Register is not in conflict with privacy principles;</para><para>.	 insert a new clause 128C providing a penalty for charging public patients for the provision of public hospital services in prescribed circumstance. It will be an offence for a medical practitioner where a patient is known to be a public patient to raise a charge or receive any payment for a public hospital service in the circumstances as set out in regulations made under this section and provides a penalty of 50 penalty units; and</para><para>.	 insert a new subsection 130(4A) which corrects anomalies in the existing secrecy provision (section 130), which make the necessary transmission of confidential information in specific circumstances. It will allow the return of information relating to a Medicare claim to the claimant or practitioner who provided information associated with the claim, without the permission of other persons whose information is associated with the claim.</para><para>This bill also makes some minor but important amendments to the National Health Act 1953 governing the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS).</para><para>Firstly, it introduces a system which will enable a private hospital or residential care facility to be reimbursed for the administration of some pharma 
 ceutical benefits to its patients or residents from the institution's own stocks, in order to obviate the need for a prescription for the pharmaceutical benefits. The system will apply to pharmaceutical benefits determined by the minister to be appropriate for these arrangements and will come into operation on 1 May 1998.</para><para>Secondly, it provides for the appointment of an additional member of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee to represent the interests of consumers.</para><para>Thirdly, it amends the secrecy provisions, to complement similar amendments being made to the Health Insurance Act 1973, to correct an anomaly which inhibits the necessary transmission of confidential information in certain circumstances.</para><para>The bill also makes a number of minor technical amendments to the Health Insurance Act 1973 and to the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Family Measures) Act 1995.</para><para><inline ref="r383">TAXATION LAWS (TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 1997</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Self assessment measures</inline></para><para>The bill makes a number of minor changes to the self-assessment system of taxation.</para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">Assessment of section 102AAM interest</inline></para><para>The bill amends section 102AAM of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (the 1936 act) which imposes an interest charge on any distribution received by a beneficiary of a non-resident trust estate where the income of the trust has not been taxed at a comparable rate in a foreign country.

These amendments will not involve any new impositions on industry.</para><para>The National Residue Survey implements residue monitoring programs for agricultural products under the National Residue Survey Administration Act 1992, which also provides for recovery of the costs of National Residue Survey programs from participating industries.</para><para>These programs form the basis for documentation enabling the Australian Government to certify that food is not contaminated by chemical residues.</para><para>This documentation is a requirement for access to the European Union, United States and Japanese markets, and is also a requirement for access to Australian domestic markets for all meat products under the Agriculture and Resource Management Council of Australia and New Zealand health standards.  
</para><para>It is therefore very important that the National Residue Survey programs operate smoothly and that their funding base is secure.</para><para>The Government has been advised that the legislation supporting the National Residue Survey programs has technical faults that have the effect that liability to pay a National Residue Survey levy is dependent upon liability to pay another primary industry levy.</para><para>This was not the original intention of this legislation. It was intended that, in order to reduce collection costs, National Residue Survey levies would be collected at the same point in the process as other primary industry levies, but not that one would be dependent upon the other.</para><para>The current situation means that some industries wishing to participate in National Residue Survey monitoring programs will not be able to do so; that is, those industries not already paying another primary industry levy.</para><para>The legislation is also being amended to ensure that the National Residue Survey levy on onions is valid. Because National Residue Survey levies are now seen to be dependent on the payment of other primary industry levies, there is a problem where that other levy rate is set at zero.</para><para>This is the case for onions. There is some question as to whether a zero rate can trigger the liability for payment of a National Residue Survey levy. To clarify this, the act is being amended to ensure that levy payments made on onions in the past have been validly collected.</para><para>The amendments are designed to ensure that the National Residue Survey levies can now operate on a stand alone basis. There will be no change at all to the amounts being paid or the basis for calculating levies for any commodity.</para><para>However, in the case of horticultural commodities, a maximum levy rate of 2 per cent of the Gross Value of Production is being inserted in the primary legislation to accommodate the possible inclusion of new horticultural commodities at a later date. This provision will have no effect on the operative rate of levy for any commodity. Levies will still be set at the current rate for each commodity group.</para><para>There are negotiations underway at the moment with a number of horticultural commodity groups that could lead to their inclusion in the National Residue Survey monitoring programs. This approach will speed the process of bringing these new commodities onto the program when the need arises.</para><para>The bill also repeals the 22 National Residue Survey levy imposition acts, the contents of which are consolidated into the two other bills in this package—the National Residue Survey Levy 
 (Customs) Bill 1998 and the National Residue Survey Levy (Excise) Bill 1998. This move is being undertaken as part of a streamlining of portfolio legislation and should provide improved access to portfolio legislation by members of the public and make its administration simpler.</para><para>I commend the bill to honourable senators.</para><para>NATIONAL RESIDUE SURVEY (CUSTOMS) LEVY BILL 1998</para><para>This bill is part of a package of three bills.

That amendment would make it illegal to represent any therapeutic product as drug free. It would make it illegal for any therapeutic product, such as vitamin pills or various other forms of alternative or complementary medicine, to be labelled with the words `drug free'. Further, it would make it an offence if such products were labelled drug free, involving a fine of $5,000 for corporations and $1,000 for individuals. The amendment is a total and blanket prohibition on the use of the words `drug free', irrespective of the nature of the products in question and irrespective of the common understanding of the public.</para><para>I am sure honourable senators have received, over the course of the last couple of weeks, volumes of correspondence from persons involved in the alternative or complementary medicine industry—if I can use that term—as well as persons who are users of these products. Certainly, there has been a demonstration of public outrage at the process adopted here, which is a very heavy-handed bureaucratic approach, to use the regulations power to impose such a prohibition on the use of the words `drug free'.</para><para>It is important to outline a bit of history as to why this matter is being dealt with today. Back in the middle of 1996, a situation arose where the Therapeutic Goods Administration, the TGA, objected to the use of the words `drug free' on a herbal remedy called Arthri-eze. That was the brand name of this product, which was a herbal remedy. It consisted of fish oil and celery—and I do not mind eating a bit of celery; I am not all that fussed about fish oil—which I know are substances the general public would regard as safe and would not, by any stretch of the imagination, regard as drugs.</para><para>The TGA objected to the use of the words `drug free' which appeared in an advertisement for this product. The  advertisement for the product had in fact been approved by the Australian Publishers Bureau which, at the time of approving the advertisement, took the view that the general public in reading such advertisements do not regard such substances as drugs.</para><para>The TGA appealed to the Advertising Standards Council. They sought to prevent the use of `drug free' on this product. The Advertising Standards Council rejected the complaint from the TGA and noted in their findings that, in their view, this was:</para><para>. . . a case of the system getting in the way of the community's general understanding of drugs, both legal and elicit types.</para><para>Apparently, the Therapeutic Goods Administration takes the view that, by definition—and they would have it by way of legislation—all therapeutic goods are drugs whether they be pharmaceutical drugs produced by the pharmaceutical drug industry, whether they be herbal remedies, whether they be vitamins that you can buy on the shelf at your local Woolworths or Franklins supermarket, whether they be fish oil and celery, eucalyptus or some form of lemon drink that maybe has vitamin C added to it. In their view, all of these things should come within the category of drugs and not be able to be described as drug free. One could even conclude that, taken to its logical conclusion, water would be unable to be advertised as drug free under this type of bureaucratic approach.</para><para>It seems that this situation has arisen because of a view adopted by the TGA that the bureaucracy should be able to impose its heavy hand right down to the situation where products that are widely used in the community, that are safe and that may or may not work for people seeking relief from particular problems or illnesses and say, `You cannot label these products "drug free",' even though the community clearly understands the distinction between what is a drug and what is not a drug in the health industry.</para><para>The government here is taking the most narrow definitive approach. In our view, it is an overly legalistic interpretation and it 
 ignores the public understanding and the public interest involved. The public sees and clearly understands drugs as products, medicines and so on generally produced by the pharmaceutical industry. Of course, there are requirements for the labelling of such products. Indeed, we have a regulatory system which ensures that particular drugs or pharmaceutical products can only be dispensed by way of prescription. So there is a very good regulatory system that regulates this entire area.</para><para>We also have a whole range of products which certainly do not come within the category of pharmaceutical drugs, but this government wants nevertheless to catch them in the net and prevent their being described as drug free. I said the general public clearly understands the distinction, and there is evidence for that. A news poll was conducted on 14 and 15 March where the public was asked to classify a number of products as either a drug or drug free. The study revealed that the majority of the adult population displays a clear understanding of what constitutes a drug versus what would be understood to be a drug-free product. For instance, 88 per cent of people classified vitamin C as drug free. That is commonsense. Our knowledge of the public's understanding of this matter would back that up. Eighty two per cent of people regarded celery and fish oil capsules as drug free, and 90 per cent of the population regarded garlic tablets as drug free. In contrast, when asked about Panadol—something that is also bought over the counter or in supermarkets; paracetamol is a generic ingredient—and Prozac, 86 per cent of people clearly understood that Panadol is a drug and 69 per cent of people understood that Prozac is a drug.</para><para>This is how the public understands the distinction and has long understood the distinction. The position is that, really, there is no evidence at all to suggest that the public does not continue to understand the distinction and that individuals cannot determine, when they look at products—whether they be in a pharmacy or, in terms of alternative or complementary medicine, in supermarkets and places like that—what they are buying. This 
 is a very safe, reliable and responsible industry. Over half the population of this country—I understand it is in the order of 60 per cent—use these products—herbal remedies, garlic tablets and so on—as either alternatives to, or supplements to, more traditional remedies, which would be pharmaceuticals.</para><para>It is also interesting to note that the government's own explanation for the regulation that they want to impose actually differentiates between the complementary medicines and pharmaceutical drugs. The government's explanatory statement for amendment No. 401 states:</para><para>Therapeutic goods that are regulated under the act include natural remedies that rely on herbs and other naturally occurring substances for their effect rather than relying on synthetic substances made by pharmaceutical companies.</para><para>In that explanation there is a clear recognition by the government, and presumably by the TGA, that there is a distinction between substances made by pharmaceutical companies—generally called drugs—and natural remedies, which are classed as therapeutic goods. The government is therefore not seeking here to somehow regulate on the basis of safety, because that distinction they themselves have acknowledged is one, as I have said, that is understood by the population at large. It is our submission that what the government is really seeking to do here is to prevent false and misleading advertising, and it is taking a very strict and legalistic approach in that regard.</para><para>It comes down to this: that everything ultimately can be classed as a drug of some form or other, and therefore the government will legislate to ensure that no product can ever be labelled drug free, notwithstanding that that is what the population would understand many of these remedies to be. In any event, that is a power that is simply not necessary to be prescribed in these regulations. If it is the major concern, as we say it is, of the TGA and the government to ensure that people are not misled by false advertising—for instance, if something like Panadol were put onto the market and labelled drug free when it is very clear that it contains paracetamol, a drug—then they can ensure 
 that under the existing legislation such practices will not occur.</para><para>Both the Trade Practices Act and the Therapeutic Goods Act have provisions in them which prevent false and misleading advertising. So, as I said earlier, there is no safety basis to this regulation, because the public clearly understand and appreciate the distinction. There is no public interest requirement here on the grounds of preventing false or misleading advertising, because the power to do that already exists under the regulations. It is our view that regulation 401 is unnecessary and indeed, as I said, is overly bureaucratic to the point of absurdity.</para><para>I want to make one further comment in conclusion. It is that another regulation we are not opposing, regulation 400, has been gazetted. That regulation establishes the therapeutic goods advertising code and the Therapeutic Goods Advertising Code Council. It is a major change to the regulations in this respect. Those bodies will have the authority with respect to the approval of advertisements and review mechanisms and a complaints handling mechanism.</para><para>Under regulation 400 and the changes that have been implemented there, which we do not oppose, there is ample scope to deal with any issues that may arise with regard to arguments about whether a particular product—a natural herbal remedy, for instance—can or cannot be labelled drug free. We believe there is substantial scope already within the system, including that new regulation, to deal with any problems that might arise. Therefore we have moved that regulation 401 be disallowed.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>1640</page.no><name role="metadata">Lees, Sen Meg</name><name role="display">Senator LEES</name><name.id>8U4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I think most senators in this place have noticed an increase in their mail largely due to this issue over the last couple of months. It certainly has led to a lot of work on the part of my office, and I want to acknowledge those that are still fighting through the e-mails and the faxes. We have had an opportunity to discuss this issue with a wide range of groups—with consumers, with manufacturers and with retailers and lobbyists. Out of all of that, one of the very disturbing trends, which 
 has created a great deal of interest, is that in many cases people do not understand this particular amendment, how it works, what it is doing and its implications, as well as other issues in this area that the government is currently dealing with.</para></talk.start><para>There appears to be quite a bit of confusion about the regulatory environment for complementary medicines and the requirements in the various parts of the legislation. That is why I called for the development of a plain English guide to the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 and the accompanying regulations to provide information on the laws and regulations governing the manufacture and supply of therapeutic goods in an accessible form so that people can find their way through them—particularly some of the smaller manufacturers, and consumers.</para><para>I am very pleased to say that the government has supported this recommendation and has asked the Therapeutic Goods Administration to focus on this as a matter of priority. I congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Family Services, Trish Worth, for her efforts in this area and for all the work she has done, not only on the particular motion we have before us today but also on the other issues and legislation we have dealt with previously.</para><para>In relation to this amendment, the use of the term `drug free' in advertising is relevant only to the marketing of these products and not to their availability. I have received many letters from consumers concerned about availability, which has been one of the confusing elements for many people. I worry that there are people out there spreading misleading and indeed quite confusing advice. I really have to wonder about some of their motives, particularly when you have a bulk mail campaign that is based on an enormous amount of misinformation. When so many people receive so much misinformation, you really begin to wonder.</para><para>I understand that people have a perception of what the term `drugs' means in relation to therapeutic goods and that this meaning would not include many complementary medicines such as those already outlined—vitamins, herbal products et cetera. I also 
 understand that there are many products that fall into the grey area between drugs and natural products, and that in many cases people's lack of knowledge of the origins of a product could lead them to inappropriately categorise something as being drug free. For example, most people probably would not realise that most vitamins and vitamin supplements are completely synthetic, whereas many pharmaceutical drugs, such as codeine, are derived from natural sources. Whether or not these products would be considered to be drug free is a matter of considerable debate.</para><para>While I appreciate the term `drug' can have a different meaning in different contexts, I believe that we have to consider, as we are debating this today, the definition of `drug' used by the relevant legislation when looking at the issue of advertising products as being drug free. I thought it would be appropriate if I read it out so that those senators listening to this could realise what a complex issue this is. Drugs are defined in the regulations to the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 as:</para><para>(a) therapeutic goods that are represented to achieve, or are likely to achieve, their principal intended action by pharmacological, chemical, immunological or metabolic means in or on the body of a person or an animal; and</para><para>(b) any other therapeutic goods declared by the Secretary, by notice published in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> , not to be therapeutic devices.</para><para>If we try to put that into plain English, by definition any product marketed as a therapeutic good which is not a device is legally considered to be a drug. This means, if we move on in logic, that products marked drug free will be considered to be drugs under the act.</para><para>This inconsistency is what leads us to the problem we have today. It is of concern, but I do not believe an outright ban on the use of the term is the most sensible response to the concern. It is not immediately clear to me that the legal definition of `drug' is necessarily the most relevant one for the purposes of advertising. Where a product has been marketed to lay people, I believe that the common meaning attached to the term `drug' should also be considered as relevant.</para><para>I appreciate the government's concern that products labelled drug free could send out inappropriate messages to consumers that a product is safe and, indeed, could lead to some people taking considerable amounts of the product, possibly leading to overdoses or harmful results. I am aware that there are some natural products that certainly can be harmful when used inappropriately. I also appreciate the government's concern that the use of the term `drug free' has the potential to mislead some consumers. This concern is shared by some consumer representatives—we have had correspondence on this from them—who feel the term `drug free' does not provide useful information about a product. They believe the use of the term could lead consumers to make inappropriate judgments about the safety of products. They feel consumers may interpret the term `drug free' as meaning safe in any quantity and therefore take more than they should. 	I am concerned about the potential for consumers to put themselves at risk through the inappropriate use of any therapeutic good. However, I am not convinced that in this case the concerns about safety are so great as to warrant this blanket prohibition. If there are general safety concerns about products or the use of `drug free' in relation to specific products, there may be more appropriate ways in which they can be addressed. Consumers should also, I believe, be credited with some level of responsibility in reading what is on the label and adhering to the instructions and advice about recommended dosage levels on the product's packaging.</para><para>Due to the complex nature of this issue, the Australian Democrats support the government's moves to form a committee to examine the appropriateness of the use of this term in the presentation of therapeutic goods and also to consider the alternatives. Prohibiting the use of `drug free' through a regulation without a formal consultation process and without talking to industry and other stakeholders does not allow for all the options to be explored. I believe that the government, that is the department, needs to sit down with the stakeholders, with consumers groups, with interested parties, with the complementary medicine practitioners, and examine a range 
 of possibilities. Today I am going to list just three possibilities.</para><para>As we have already heard, the other regulation passing this chamber now, regulation 400, sets up the therapeutic goods advertising code. The use of other advertising terms are governed through this code, which is developed by a council comprising representatives of the major stakeholders. So, firstly, this code could be set up to ban the use of `drug free' or to specify conditions for its use. For example, in the case of the term `natural', the code specifies that a representation cannot claim a product is more efficacious or safer because it occurs naturally. We could have a similar restriction on the term `drug free'.</para><para>Secondly, the use of this term could be restricted through the development of an industry wide code of practice. The government could request that industry and stakeholders  develop a code of practice for the use of the term `drug free'. Codes of practice exist now, for example, for the use of terms such `low salt' in the advertising of food. The code of practice could be adopted into legislation if the government thought they wanted to take that extra step.</para><para>Thirdly, the regulation of this term could be left to the Trade Practices Act, if the minister so required. What is believed to be false or misleading advertising could simply be referred to the government. If the government thought a case was illegal under the TPA, it would be referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions. That certainly is not my preferred option. I am just giving the government some alternatives as to how to look at this issue.</para><para>This is a very complex issue. There is a high level of consumer concern, as I said earlier. Even though some of it has not been very well informed, the genuineness of the concern about alternative therapies, particularly their availability, is certainly very real and something hopefully this government is concerned about.</para><para>Given all of that and also the industry concern about how this will work, it would seem appropriate that all possibilities are fully considered before we totally prohibit the use of this term, as is now proposed. So I think 
 we first need to let the review process go ahead. Indeed, the preferred option for the Democrats today was that this regulation be withdrawn until such time as the review could take place and the committee had made its recommendations. As it was not withdrawn, we do not believe we have any option but to support the motion for disallowance in order for the review to go ahead.</para><para>I say in conclusion this is far from over. By moving to support the motion of disallowance today, we are not saying by any stretch of the imagination that this is fixed. This is just another step down the road to sorting out this issue and other issues related to the Therapeutic Goods Act and the associated problems.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>1642</page.no><name role="metadata">Herron, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HERRON</name><name.id>VW4</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On behalf of the government I will reply to, firstly, Senator Lees's statement. I welcome Senator Lees's statement that, given that the government has established a committee of key stakeholders to examine the issue, she will keep her mind open in the sense that perhaps she will allow the regulation to go through in the appropriate time. I believe in the fullness of time that will be the evidence that will come forward.</para></talk.start><para>There has already been a lot of consultation throughout the industry, but perhaps it may be that more information is required. The committee will report to Ms Trish Worth by 8 May, and its findings will be tabled in parliament along with the government's response to the recommendations. So there is not that much time to be taken up.</para><para>I can assure Senator Lees that a lot of consultation has already occurred. For example, the supporters of the changes to the therapeutic goods regulations include: the Proprietary Medicines Association of Australia; the chairman of the Therapeutic Advisory Committee of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians; the AMA; the National Health and Medical Research Council; the Australian Committee of Natural Therapists; the executive director of the Consumers Health Forum; the senior policy officer of the Australian Consumers Association; Professor Stephen Leeder of Community Medicine, Westmead Hospital; the president of the 
 Public Health Association of Australia; and the chair of the National Health Advisory Committee. It is not as if there has not been a considerable consultative process.</para><para>Years ago I learnt an important political point from the doyen of the press gallery, Alan Reid, now deceased. He said, `If you ever have a choice between a conspiracy and a muck-up, pick the muck-up every time.' I can only assume that that is what happened to Senator Forshaw. I thought at the time it might be a conspiracy in that he was trying to delay the passage of legislation, but I appreciate now that he really does not understand what his disallowance motion means.</para><para>Regulation 401 prohibits the use of the term `drug free' in any advertising of therapeutic goods. The point that we are making with this regulation is that the public have a right to know what is in the material they are taking. He, for example, said that the public accepts that vitamins are not dangerous—that they are acceptable. I can give him a whole list of vitamins that in excess can cause a whole lot of diseases. Vitamin D, for example, produces bone demineralisation, renal calculus, high calcium, metastatic calcification and hypertension if taken in excess. Vitamin A produces bone tenderness, chronic liver disease, hair loss, diarrhoea and vomiting. Vitamin K produces haemolytic anaemia and neonatal jaundice. Vitamin B6 produces peripheral sensory neuropathy. Niacin produces skin flushing, hypotension and arrhythmias. Vitamin E produces increased action of warfarin and vitamin C produces gastrointestinal symptoms and oxalate stones. I could go on.</para><para>Senator Forshaw is probably not aware that even water causes problems. Regretfully, Brisbane has no fluoride in its water. It is the only capital city that does not have it. Water is a process of delivering drugs, and fluoride is a classic example. Some months ago—perhaps a year ago—the <inline font-style="italic">Medical Journal of Australia </inline>reported somebody in Western Australia eating seaweed, thinking that it was perfectly safe, and ended up with mercury poisoning. Even fish oil and celery may produce problems in certain circumstances.</para><para>The point that I am trying to make to Senator Forshaw is that the public has a right 
 to know what is in the things that they are taking, even though they may believe them to be completely harmless. So fish oil and celery, depending on the source of their material, may contain toxic substances of one kind or another. It is not enough just to say that these things are simple matters that may contain no deleterious substances.</para><para>The point that we are making with regulation 401 is, first of all, that the public has a right to know what is in therapeutic goods. I quote for example, the president of the AMA. He said:</para><para>It is argued that it is not an issue of public safety; it is an issue of freedom of choice.</para><para>Dr Woollard would argue that it is an issue of ensuring that consumers can make an informed choice. They need to know what they are taking. Trish Worth, for example, said:</para><para>Health consumers have a right to timely and accurate information about the products they purchase. They also have a right to expect that the Government is protecting their interests in relation to access to information and safety of products.</para><para>This regulation is not a mechanism for restricting consumers' and practitioners' access to complementary medicines, as Senator Lees has said, such as herbal, vitamin and mineral preparations, but it is a mechanism for making sure that they are informed as to what they are consuming. Interestingly enough, as the opposition would know, under the therapeutic goods legislation introduced in 1989 while they were in government, therapeutic goods—that is, products which claim a therapeutic effect—fall into two categories, drugs and medical services. As the then minister responsible for the Therapeutic Goods Act, Peter Staples, clearly stated in October 1989:</para><para>Therapeutic goods are those goods for use for the prevention, diagnosis or treatment of diseases and other bodily conditions or which can be taken to be for such a use through advertising and other means.</para><para>I thought Senator Forshaw was a bit specious, saying that the Australian Publishers Bureau was approached and then it was referred to the Advertising Standards Council and they decided that it was allowed. I point out to Senator Forshaw that the Advertising Standards Council and the Australian Publishers Bureau would hardly be organisations that I would ask to decide on the therapeutic effi 
 cacy of materials that are advertised. Certainly they are professionals in the right to advertise, but they have no expertise in determining what is in the products—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>656</name.id><name role="metadata">FORSHAW</name><name role="display">Senator Forshaw</name></talker><para>—I just related the history that the TGA lodged the complaint.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>VW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Herron, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HERRON</name></talker><para>—I see. Thank you. I do not doubt Senator Forshaw's information. Here we have a Labor minister making it quite clear that products which make a claim about their therapeutic benefit are therapeutic goods or drugs. The fact that we are here today debating this fact is quite farcical. As I said before, I thought it was a conspiracy rather than a muck-up but I now accept that it is a muck-up rather than a conspiracy.</para></talk.start></continue><para>It was always thought that the law meant that you could not make a therapeutic claim about a product and then claim it was drug free. This was intended to ensure that consumers were not mislead about the nature or safety of therapeutic goods. I make the point that the government has a responsibility for the safety of therapeutic goods. When a producer sought to make such a claim, the government sought legal advice from the Australian Government Solicitor. Advice revealed that the legislation introduced by the former government was not completely clear on this issue, so there was a case to be made for it.</para><para>In order to fix that mistake left by the previous government and to clarify the existing law, the government introduced this regulation. This clarification will ensure that health consumers continue to have the right to accurate information about the products they purchase. Ensuring honesty and accuracy in the labelling and presentation of therapeutic goods is an important role for a government, and I would have thought for an opposition, but apparently not, gathering from their movement of this disallowance motion.</para><para>All this regulation does is ensure that the government continues to play this role. Why the opposition would choose to oppose a regulation change in line with its original legislation is beyond the government. I do not understand that, and Senator Forshaw has not addressed that situation.</para><para>Why the opposition would choose to pursue a line on this issue which is in such stark contrast to the views of consumer organisations, one of the two industry organisations and a range of health experts is also bewildering. You either accept the advice of the leading advisers in health in this country or you do not. If that is the place of the opposition, if that is their standard, I feel for the Australian public if they unfortunately ever got back into government. Professor Terry Campbell, Chairman of the Therapeutic Advisory Committee of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians, said:</para><para>To suggest that some substances for which therapeutic claims are made are not drugs purely by virtue of their being natural is a nonsense. Until relatively recent history, virtually all `drugs' were natural products after all. To further claim that a natural origin somehow confers safety is an even greater nonsense.</para><para>For example, a digitalis leaf, of course, is natural. It is a plant yet in excess or given inappropriately it can kill people. He continued:</para><para>Many of the most dangerous substances known are perfectly `natural'—botulinum toxin, snake and spider venom and strychnine being examples.</para><para>They are perfectly natural but very dangerous. I have gone out of the context by adlibbing, but I get back to the quote:</para><para>I would strongly support the right and the duty of a Government to regulate all substances for which therapeutic claims are being made as "drugs".</para><para>Also, Professor Stephen Leader, Professor of Community Medicine and President of the Public Health Association, said:</para><para>It is important that advertising of alternative medicines be as clear as possible. Consumers should be aware that these preparations contain substances that interact with body processes such as standard prescription and over-the-counter pharmaceutical compounds do. By convention these groups of chemicals have been referred to as drugs. It does not help the public understand the nature of alternative medicines to refer to them as `drug free'. This is simply not true if we take the word `drug' to `mean' medicine.</para><para>The government has recognised that there are some members of the complementary medicines industry and some consumers who oppose this drug free issue, and we have listened. As I say, there has been enormous 
 consultation with the community and with community organisations, consumer associations, medical associations and the National Health and Medical Research Council.</para><para>We have, as I have stated and Senator Less acknowledged, established a committee to look at the appropriateness of the term `drug free' and the advertising of certain medicinal products, and also to look at what alternatives might be used to appropriately promote such products. As the opposition knows, this committee is due to report by 8 May and the report will be tabled in parliament while this regulation is still sitting before the parliament for consideration.</para><para>I am mystified as to why the opposition should persist with the debate on this disallowance motion without waiting for the outcomes of the committee made up of key stakeholders on this issue. We will be opposing the motion by Senator Forshaw that the Therapeutic Goods Regulations (Amendment), as contained in Statutory Rules 1997 No. 401, be disallowed.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>1645</page.no><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name><name.id>656</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I will just make a couple of comments in response. Firstly, let me say in regard to the comments from Senator Lees: we note the position they have put and actually see some merit in the comments that you made about the need for a more wide-ranging look at some of the issues here. Indeed, that was implicit in the remarks that I made that this was taking an overly bureaucratic approach by way of regulation to prevent what is clearly understood as an advertising or marketing issue. If there are issues—as Senator Herron would argue and Senator Lees has also raised this—either existing or potential with regard to definitions in this area, then it is appropriate they be looked at by way of committee or an inquiry.</para></talk.start><para>With respect to the minister's comments that the parliamentary secretary has established a committee to examine the use of the term `drug free', we are aware of that, but there are a couple of problems. Firstly, the minister has stated that it is due to report on 8 May. The time period for consideration of this issue actually expires, as I understand it, on or about 8 May. It is, therefore, a very 
 hurried inquiry and the report may not be tabled before the time period expires for consideration of this matter.</para><para>Secondly, we are aware of some concerns about the structure of that committee in that some of the key stakeholders have indicated that they were not able to be represented. In any event, we believe that the appropriate approach is to move and carry disallowance of this regulation. If the disallowance motion is carried, we still have the status quo position, as it exists under therapeutic goods regulations at this time. Indeed, it is still then open for the propositions advanced by Senator Lees to be acted upon, as indeed it is open for the government to address the issues in a more broad ranging and constructive way.

I am pleased to see this bill here today because it fixes up a mess which the government made. But, by the same token, it is only necessary because of this government's misjudgment and the chaos that this government is presently creating. The situation would have been even worse except that the opposition saved the government from some of its excesses. 
 When the Child Care Payments Bill was first debated, I remember being assured by I think the same advisers who are in the advisers' box now that we could put this bill into effect by 1 January this year. I thought they would be over here shaking my hand thanking me for having saved them the necessity of doing that.</para></talk.start><para>One of the amendments that went through during the negotiations deferred the bill taking effect until 27 April. That saved them from being in an extraordinarily difficult situation because although a whole new administration for child-care assistance was in place in a legislative sense, the necessary mechanics were not. As I understand it, Centrelink is nowhere near ready to perform the role that was envisaged. That is why we find ourselves here tonight debating the Child Care Legislation Amendment Bill 1998 .</para><para>This bill was debated for some eight hours, and the Community Affairs Legislation Committee also took evidence for two days. In all that time the government seemed unable to understand the practical difficulties of putting into effect this new administration of child-care assistance. During the hearing of the Community Affairs Legislation Committee, we received a large number of submissions. This was quite surprising, bearing in mind that the hearing was held over only a very short period. In fact, the submissions were made only by invitation. At least 15 of the submissions that we received at that short notice pointed out the impracticality and unfairness of a system that was being established by the Child Care Payments Bill.</para><para>Despite that, the government persisted with its course of action. At the end of November the bill was passed. It was not very long after that—in fact, 23 January this year—that the minister announced that he had changed his mind; that all of the things they refused to acknowledge and concede during the debate and during the Community Affairs Legislation Committee hearing were all true; that it would be impossible for the system to be established to allow Centrelink to pay  parents directly. In fact, it was conceded by the minister that he had made the decision to reverse the implementation of the new system because of 
 representation made by parents and by the industry.</para><para>You have to wonder why the same sorts of representations that were made at length during the debate on the bill were suddenly riveting to a minister who had completely ignored them less than 60 days before. Maybe it was that over the Christmas period Minister Warwick Smith had time to really think. I suppose that suggests that he did not think prior to that time. If we give him the benefit of the doubt, we can say that the minister had some opportunity to reflect and see that the matters that have been raised by the opposition and by the industry were not just rhetoric but a serious, practical proposal about a change in the system.</para><para>I suppose the minister might also have suddenly realised during his period of contemplation over the Christmas break that the mess they were making of child care was going to rebound on them; that it was going to rebound very strongly during the coming election when many families who rely on child care were going to express at the ballot box their dissatisfaction with the way this coalition government has dealt with child care.</para><para>I do not believe that the reversal on this piece of legislation—this backflip—will mean that the community will forget what this government has done to child care. They have done a few backflips so far, I suppose the most obvious one of which is nursing homes. The elderly in Australia still have not forgotten the callousness of this government in terms of the fees they wished to impose. The new version of nursing home fees that has been introduced is still seen as being very difficult for families who are looking after their elderly parents. It is seen as very callous by the elderly people themselves.</para><para>The opposition will be supporting the bill that is now before us because the government basically accepts the argument that we put during the debate on the previous bill—that it would be ridiculous to have two major changes of administration of child-care assistance within a period of some 12 months; that it would not be possible for this to happen in such a time period. What Warwick Smith 
 actually announced was that the new form of administration would be delayed until the introduction of the smart card. He was very vague about exactly when that might be. Note that in the bill it says that the bill may be delayed for a period of up to 30 months. That is 2½ years.</para><para>That is quite extraordinary when you recall that, through various debates and in the estimates, the minister and her representatives at the time expressed very strongly the view that the smart cards would be introduced about, or shortly after, 1 January 1999. I am now told that the introduction of the smart card is a much more difficult task than this government ever imagined and that when they called for information—I am not sure of the term; I do not know whether that commits them to doing anything—they discovered that there is this huge task that they are unable to perform in order to introduce the smart cards before that date.</para><para>They are very vague about exactly when those smart cards will be introduced, but you can rest assured of one thing: we will not see smart cards emerge before the election. Despite the protestations of the government and their minions, the main reason they are not introducing the smart card is they realise that in addition to some practical problems involved it is a major political problem for them. What they have done in child care is already rebounding on them and they do not wish to make the situation any worse.</para><para>Despite the backflip, I do not believe that the electorate is going to forget what has been done in child care. It is not going to forget that over two budgets this government cut $820 million from child care. The electorate is not going to forget that child-care assistance has been reduced by an average of $10 per day per child—that is, $126 million. That largely affects children in family long day care and in vacation care. Fees have risen. The community based and private sector long day care centres say that fees have increased somewhere between $11 and $25 a child per week, depending on the type of service and, obviously, what its competition is.</para><para>Let me remind the government that those who run child-care centres in the private 
 sector are small businesses. They say that their usage rates, as a result of these price increases, are down somewhere between 20 per cent and 30 per cent and that, as a result, many of them are not viable. They say that though few centres in the private sector have yet closed, they anticipate large numbers of closures in the near future. As we all know, many community based centres have closed already—my office has documented almost 50. The difference in timing between the two sectors is largely a result of the way they operate. Most community child-care centres are run by community management committees and if they are told by their accountant that they are running up a debt—and knowing that they have personal liability for that debt—most community based centres make the immediate decision to close. That is why you are seeing them close much earlier than those in the private sector. Although many centres in the private sector are having great difficulty with their usage rates, and their financial viability is a big problem for them, particularly in Queensland, many of them have tried to hold off, making little profit or in some cases accumulating some debt, in the hope that other centres around them will close and they will again become viable. For many, a return to viability, at least under the policies of this present government, will not occur.</para><para>I am not given a lot of hope by the response of the minister representing the Minister for Health and Family Services, Senator Herron. In question time today in this chamber he continued to deny that there is even a problem, despite the evidence of three surveys—not just of the community based sector, as he insists on misunderstanding, but of both the private and the community sector—and despite the evidence of 850 submissions from individuals—mainly parents—and organisations involved in the industry and child-care centres. He refuses to acknowledge that there is a problem. I strongly believe that if this government does not even acknowledge there is a problem then we do not really have a great deal of hope that the matter will be solved.</para><para>The child-care centres that have been most harshly dealt with as a result of this backflip 
 are those in the outside school hours sector, which is in an extraordinarily difficult position. Their operational subsidy has been taken away, effective as of 27 April. That is a substantial amount of money; in fact, to those centres it is equivalent to about $14 per child. Most of these centres—and I am sure that the minister does not have a real understanding of how they operate—operate in schools and halls after hours. They certainly do not operate out of purpose-built facilities. They operate on the smell of an oily rag. They normally have staff who are casual—they come in for a few hours in the morning and again in the afternoon. Most of them obviously enjoy their job, but you could not say that it was a particularly lucrative job. Any administration that they do is largely done while the children are there or half an hour or so on either side. In most cases the additional work done by carers outside care hours is on an unpaid basis. It is just an extra contribution that they put in.</para><para>So to take away this operational subsidy for before and after school care is an extraordinary difficult proposition for them. I note that, despite the reversal of the child-care payments bill, I have seen nothing from the minister to indicate that, in fact, their operational subsidies will continue until it actually comes into play. It is a shame that the minister scooted out because I would be very pleased to hear from the minister or his representative—someone else has his brief—whether they will provide an undertaking that the operational subsidy for outside school hours care will continue until the child-care payments bill—I suppose it is an act now—comes into effect because many centres in that situation will have to close.</para><para>I have had personal contact with an outside hours centre just up the road from me at Currarong on the central coast of New South Wales. What they tell me, having done their sums and been responsible, is that, even with the changes in child-care assistance, they are required—to make ends meet—to increase their fees by 50 per cent. They said that a discussion that they had had with the parents indicates that many of them intend to leave as a result. They anticipate that, shortly after 27 
 April, they will be closing their doors. I am advised day in and day out by centres that I have contact with, both in person and by phone, that they are not a once-off, that there are many centres in this position.</para><para>The minister has obviously recognised that there is some sort of problem because he has announced that this sector will be provided with $8 million—according to the minister's press release—to try and put in place a new system of administration of child-care assistance. I will just remind you that this is a sector operating largely on a casual basis and, except for a very small group of people, has never had to operate or administer child-care assistance. They will have to administer child-care assistance for a very short period—we do not know how long because the government cannot tell us when the smart card will come into place, but it will be within 30 months—while at the same time losing an operational subsidy of $14 per child.</para><para>As I said earlier, the minister announced in his press release that some $8 million would be provided to assist in this changeover, but the industry itself—the before and after school centres—calculate that just to put in place this new system will cost them $12 million, which means that they are all out of pocket to start with, without dealing with the operational subsidy at all.</para><para>I do not have a great deal of time but I really believe that the government might be assisted in understanding the problems that do exist in the child-care sector by having a look at some of the submissions. I would really recommend that the minister read them if he can. I certainly am going to. I will just read you a few extracts. This is the comment of Robin Monro Miller from the National Out of School Hours Services Association:</para><para>What we are effectively doing is implementing all these changes at once on services which are primarily parent management and parents are struggling to find out what is happening. Through working with a variety of parent managements, I have heard quite a few incorrect versions of what is about to happen. I think we need that time in order to get everybody in line. Really, it is to give everybody a fair go and know about the changes so that services do not throw their arms up and say, `This is too hard; we will not survive,' and pack up 
 their bags and go home. We will lose services. They—</para><para>referring to the government—</para><para>need to take note of the fact that the sector is not highly organised and has not had the back-up support. They did not have the admin. people, they did not necessarily have trained staff and they do not have their own venues.</para><para>That is just a plea from that particular sector to have regard for their circumstances. I noticed that the government liberally quoted from a particular press release that it had received from Ian Weston of the Australian Confederation of Child Care, but I have to say that the confederation and all its members are not always as positive about the government's changes. I have been unable to obtain a copy of that letter.</para><para>Brian McFarlane said:</para><para>There was an announcement made by the minister there would be a national child care advisory council. I am wondering which ought to come first.

The Democrats support the government's decision today to delay streamlining the payment of child-care assistance and the child-care cash rebate until 1999. It is, of course, too early for us to sign off on the proposal to link this measure with the introduction of a smart card. Although it does sound like it could be a step in the right direction, we always with this government in particular want to see the small print. We also strongly support the government in their decision not to place an increased responsibility on parents in relation to estimating and reporting their use of child-care services and I, for one, am particularly pleased to see that, with these changes, the harsh criminal terms which were contained in the previous bill will no longer be applicable. I have to say that I found those particular measures to be incredibly objectionable. The thought that by some government action all of a sudden we were 
 going to make parents liable for prison terms seemed to me to be quite an appalling proposition.</para></talk.start><para>It is heartening to see that at least in this instance the government has been willing to acknowledge that it got it wrong. It is also heartening to see that at least in this instance the government has been willing to reverse policies which would have had a negative impact on families, making life even harder for many who are already suffering the ill-effects of earlier policy decisions. Asking parents to take more responsibility for estimating and reporting their usage of child care would have been a big mistake. It would have been a big mistake simply because it fails to take into account the enormous pressure many families are already under. It fails to recognise that many families already have enormous difficulty just trying to juggle their existing work and family responsibilities. And it fails to recognise that for many families it is a huge challenge just trying to make ends meet and hold their family together.</para><para>This measure was one of the major issues raised with the Democrats prior to the Senate's consideration of the earlier bill, and it was one of the reasons we suggested that it should be examined by the Community Affairs Legislation Committee. That hearing was held and I believe we gathered from that some very significant evidence. We are pleased to see that, as a result of this committee hearing and subsequent representations, the government has finally seen the light. This is a positive outcome for Australian families.</para><para>The bill we are considering today contains the remaining changes which were originally contained in the earlier bill. These are: the 20-hour cap on child-care assistance for non-work related care; the long overdue planning system for private sector child-care places; and establishing immunisation requirements for child-care assistance eligibility. In the interest of not taking up too much of the Senate's time and recognising the enormous legislative load we have—which I have got to say is not because the Senate has blocked legislation but is because the government has failed to in any way get its legislative program in order, and I would be happy to 
 debate that point at any time—I am not going to go into any great detail on the nature of these changes. We have already debated these and it is on the record what the Democrats' position is. It is there in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> to be read, as a result of the debate we had last year.</para><para>As we did then, the Democrats will be supporting the first of these two measures. As I also did last time, I will also be leaving my colleague Senator Bartlett, for Meg Lees, our leader, to outline the position the Democrats will be taking in relation to the immunisation requirements.</para><para>Notwithstanding this, however, I want to take a moment to put on record the fact that the Democrats have been critical of the way this government has handled the whole area of child care. As I have said on other occasions, one of the problems is that it is not the Minister for Family Services who ought to be criticised, because I think both the former minister, Judi Moylan, and the current minister have been doing their very best to make the policy work. The problem is with the Treasurer, who has taken so much money out of this area that any policy would be almost bound to fail. The government needs to be condemned for a number of the changes that have already been introduced and the effects that these changes are now having on many families. And I want to put on the record, despite the exchanges in this place this afternoon during question time following a number of questions from the opposition to the government, despite the government's very poor defence of their record, that it is true that for many families things are getting worse.</para><para>Centres across the board, both private and community based—not simply community based centres, as the minister seemed to be suggesting but also private centres—are now reporting that they are operating at somewhere between 10 per cent and 15 per cent less than their capacity. This is following the previous experience when those same centres all had waiting lists. The problem is that many parents have had to make the very difficult decision to withdraw their children from formal child care. For many two-parent families, this has meant that one of them has 
 had to leave the work force, and in many cases this has seen the mother being forced to return to the home on a full-time basis. For many single parents, this has meant that they have been left with no alternative but to withdraw from the work force or from study altogether, simply because they can no longer afford the cost of having their children cared for. For others, this has meant finding alternative, less formal child-care arrangements, with grandparents and friends being asked more and more to care for children while their parents are at work or studying.</para><para>Child-care operators are now also really beginning to hurt as a result of dwindling numbers in child-care centres. Many of these centres are the very same centres which, as I said previously, prior to the introduction of the changes contained in the 1996 budget were subject to lengthy waiting lists. Now they have vacancies, and the extent of the vacancies is getting larger. Some centres have already been forced to close, with a number of others predicted to close within the next few months. I have got to say to you that in my own state of Queensland I have had the most desperate phone calls from people in the Sunshine Coast area, where a whole group of centres has got together and begged me to come and talk to them. I said to them that they really needed to talk to the government, but I will not repeat what they said to me when I told them that.</para><para>This government can no longer afford to ignore the damage which has been done to parents who have been forced to give up work or study simply because they can no longer afford the cost of child care. What this government needs to understand is that these families are really hurting. It is shameful to think that a government which so strongly speaks of its deeply held commitment to families can at the same time come up with policies which are making it increasingly difficult for the very families it claims to represent.</para><para>The Democrats fought very hard to prevent many of the changes which were announced in the 1996 budget from coming into effect. We voted against the abolition of operational subsidies for community based long day care 
 centres; the capping of child-care assistance at 50 hours per week per child; the abolition of the additional income allowed for additional dependent children when assessing a family's eligibility for child-care assistance; and freezing of child-care assistance and the child-care cash rebate for two years.</para><para>Unfortunately, the combined vote of the opposition parties was not enough to prevent these changes from coming into effect and these regressive reforms passed the Senate with the support of independent senators. I am sure that the government underestimated the effect these policies would have on Australian families. What is clear now, however, is that these policies are well and truly affecting families. This effect is a very negative one indeed.</para><para>The Democrats will continue to put pressure on the government to reverse its policy decisions in the area of child care. We can only hope, as with the measures the minister decided to reverse earlier in the year, the government will be willing to admit that in a number of these other areas it also has it wrong. The future of child care in this country depends on that change of heart. I think it will be at the government's peril if it chooses to ignore the plight of Australian families who can no longer access the child-care services they need.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>1652</page.no><name role="metadata">Gibbs, Sen Brenda</name><name role="display">Senator GIBBS</name><name.id>6L6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In rising to speak to the Child Care Legislation Amendment Bill, I am reminded of the pledge given by the coalition prior to the last election. The promise was that all parents would have fair and equitable access to affordable, flexible and high quality child-care options regardless of whether they were participating in the paid or unpaid work force.</para></talk.start><para>In listening to government members in the Senate earlier today, including the embarrassing manner in which the Minister representing the Minister for Family Services (Senator Herron) avoided answering questions on this issue, it is quite clear that not only has the government walked away from this commitment but it never really understood what it meant in the first place.</para><para>No one sector of the community highlights the anti-social agenda of the Howard govern 
 ment more so than the child-care sector. The measures contained in this bill—which include a revamp of the payment arrangements for child-care assistance, payment of child-care assistance in arrears, limiting the number of new long day care places and changes to outside school hours care—all have one dramatic consequence: they all limit the work force options available to Australian women.</para><para>As a result of the massive $820 million taken out of the child-care sector over the past two coalition budgets, parents are having to reduce their work hours, leave work altogether or rely on neighbours, extended family or backyard operators for their child's care. It is now estimated Australian families are $25 per child per week worse off under the coalition.</para><para>A recent survey conducted by the Queensland Child Care Coalition revealed that 3,255 children have been removed from 244 services in Queensland in the past year. This is the same survey Minister Herron dismissed in question time today as having no relevance. Other data suggests that somewhere between 200,000 to 300,000 people have been discouraged from seeking employment because they could not find or afford child care. More than two-thirds of these are women.</para><para>Unfortunately, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) does not understand the dynamics of contemporary child-care policy. He is sadly out of touch with the practicalities of the system. Child-care assistance is a social policy measure which allows women to participate in the work force. Unnecessary and ill-conceived changes to its focus are causing widespread confusion and uncertainty for parents with children in care.</para><para>The reality of this bill is that it should never have had to be introduced into this parliament. This legislation is a result of a government which is making up its policy initiatives on the run. Following the passing of the Child Care Payments Act 1997, the government was inundated with complaints and representations from the sector about the impact this legislation would have if it started in April 1998 as planned. In January this year the government announced it had decided to defer the implementation of the new payment arrangements until new smartcard technology 
 is available—hence the need for this amendment bill. But this process would not have occurred if the coalition had consulted with the sector prior to announcing the initial changes.</para><para>As I said in my earlier contribution to the Child Care Payments Bill 1997, the bill introduces a number of new measures which have not been meaningfully considered by stakeholders. The consultation process has been, in a word, deplorable. The bill is a very complex one. While it may make things easier for the government, it certainly does not make things easier for the end users—parents and service providers.</para><para>Until questions arising out of these myriad of issues are resolved, it is farcical to say that there has been proper consultation as it cannot as yet be determined what the impact of some of these changes really means. Recent developments have proven my earlier comments correct. But, far from taking any satisfaction from the government's admission of error, I am saddened for the heartache and uncertainty the coalition has forced upon this sector.</para><para>As a result of this government's incompetence, service providers and parents have had to live with a major cloud over their arrangements for the past 18 months. A competent government would have consulted and negotiated with all stakeholders before announcing major administrative changes. But not this government.</para><para>As we have witnessed in the aged care sector with deferral of the implementation of the extra daily fee on four occasions, the Howard government has an appalling record on consultation. Apart from taking away the work force options of women and highlighting this government's inability to consult, this bill represents a major attack on the out of school hours care program. The Howard government has removed operational subsidies from out of school hours care—like the similar way it removed this assistance from community child-care centres in the 1996 budget. This action will result in the closure of services.</para><para>Just as galling is this government's obvious lack of knowledge about the role of out of school hours care within the child-care sector. 
 Many out of school hours care centres are operated by part-time and volunteer staff in non-permanent premises such as community and school halls. The administrative work is often completed by parents, and the service provides for the constantly shifting requirements of its users. For instance, a service may have a couple of hundred children on their records for 50 or 60 places. The operational subsidy is vital to coordinate such complex and under-resourced enterprises.</para><para>Rather than the operational subsidy going to the service, parents will now be paid child-care assistance, but the out of school hours service will have to calculate the amount each family will have to pay weekly. There is simply not the administrative infrastructure capability in these services to undertake such an assessment. As a consequence, many of these providers will give up and force the families who use the service to make other arrangements. Alternatively, providers will be forced to dramatically reduce overheads and increase their fees. This new administrative arrangement underlines the coalition's inability to understand the various needs of stakeholders within this sector. In this case, it is forcing a tight administrative maze on a part-time service which has been renowned for the flexibility it offers to its user groups.</para><para>But there are other areas of concern in this legislation. It provides a tighter targeting mechanism for eligibility for child-care assistance, which will effectively result in a saving to the government of $33 million in this financial year alone. It involves the cessation of indexing the child-care assistance fee ceiling and the child-care cash rebate ceilings at a saving of $31 million this financial year. The changes to new growth strategies for long day care centres will be a $25 million saving. Reforms in the area of school age care will be a $5 million saving, and paying child-care assistance in arrears will be a saving of $32 million.</para><para>All these changes are on top of the other massive reforms inflicted upon this sector by the Howard government over the past two years. They include removal of operational subsidies worth $100 million over four years from community based child-care centres, 
 reduction of child-care assistance for cut-offs for second and subsequent children and freezing child-care assistance and child-care cash rebate ceilings for two years, which has meant no indexation for the past two years. With all these massive cuts to the sector, it is hard not to argue that the government simply view child care and fee assistance as a luxury. They do not see how the increased financial demand on families of up to $25 per child per week adds a dangerous balancing act to most family budgets.</para><para>A recent discussion paper drafted by the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees' Association highlights just how delicate this balancing act is for most families. It found that family income earners are finding it difficult to make ends meet in a way that enables their family to enjoy a decent standard of living. It found a large number of working poor families in Australia who, in return for active work force participation, are only marginally better off than if they were on social security. Removal or reductions in child-care assistance and increases in provider fees as a result of the loss of operational subsidies will push some families into the working poor category and not only act as a disincentive for both parents to work but also increase the demand on Australia's social security system.</para><para>A further example of the situations that can arise as a result of the coalition's cuts to the sector was documented in today's <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph Mirror</inline>. A mother of two children in child care, who just happens to be a Liberal Party staffer to the New South Wales opposition leader, Mr Collins, has sent a submission to the Senate's inquiry into child-care services detailing how cuts to the sector are costing the government lost tax revenue. Ms Catherine Cusak said she reduced her hours of work from five days per week to three days after her child-care fees rose by $93.55 per week last year. The reduction in her working hours reduced her family's income and saved the government $3,800 per year in child-care subsidies. But, as a result of the change in her work circumstances, Ms Cusak paid $11,000 per year less in income tax and, as no-one has been hired to fill her 
 job for the remaining two days of the week, the government is worse off by $7,200. Regrettably, Ms Cusak and thousands of women like her are also worse off financially and professionally as a consequence of these short-sighted arrangements.</para><para>With well over 850 submissions already received by the Senate inquiry into child-care services, I am certain the frustration of Ms Cusak's circumstances will be borne out many times over from other working mothers and families. There is probably no more important task facing families and the Australian community than to bring up our children in a balanced and decent environment. The child-care policies of the Howard government are exposing families and children to unnecessary risks as parents are being priced out of the sector.</para><para>Parents feel as though they can no longer afford quality care. I believe the representations we are getting from parents and providers in our electorate offices and the large number of submissions already received by the Senate inquiry are only the tip of the iceberg. The coalition attempt to make political mileage out of being pro-family. However, the erosion of the child-care sector is evidence that they are not interested in the concerns of hundreds of thousands of Australian families. It also proves they are not interested in women. The government, with these policies, are trying to force women back into the homes. We are going back 50 years in history to where women stay at home, have babies, cook the meals, do the washing, but do not dare think of ever having a career.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5L6</name.id><name role="metadata">FERRIS</name><name role="display">Senator Ferris</name></talker><para>—Oh, come on, Brenda!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>6L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Gibbs, Sen Brenda</name><name role="display">Senator GIBBS</name></talker><para>—No. With these policies the Howard government is forcing them back.

You have got it so wrong that you are actually legislating to correct what you have already put in place. You have not spoken to the community. You have not spoken to the child-care operators.

I am sure they are not ringing up and saying, `Isn't it exciting. I've had to drop out of the work force. Thank you very much for increasing the cost of child care.' If they are saying that to you, then you are getting some very strange messages. The women of Australia are saying, `What about these Liberal women who are putting up their hands each day with Mr Howard to make child care more expensive, to make it impossible for us 
 to afford the fees, to make it impossible for child-care centres to cope?' Something like 50 community based child-care centres have already closed as a direct result of your policies of removing operational subsidies. In most of those centres on average about 10 women work. You have directly contributed to 500 women being on the unemployment list.</para><para>But, worse than that, there are thousands of families who use child care. As my colleague Senator Gibbs has spelt out so well, in the survey from Queensland alone, thousands of children are no longer in child care. Thousands of women are giving up their working positions and retreating from the work force altogether or going to reduced hours. Today we heard from the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Family Services, Senator Herron, that that is a nonsense, that the ABS data shows there is no retreat of working women from the work force. I do not know whether you should ever doubt statistics, but he certainly has not read the submissions that have come to the Senate inquiry. He certainly has not spoken to the thousands and thousands of people who are writing to us and calling us about it.</para><para>Also in relation to this mean-spirited, miserable government, under your changes now introduced about assisting people with your privatised CES, if women are not on any benefit, they will have to pay to get assistance to look for further work. `Mean-spirited' is hardly the word for you. The women of Australia are saying clearly day by day in ever-increasing numbers and with louder and louder voices, `Mr Howard's government and all those Liberal women, we thank not one jot but indeed we blame. We judge them as not caring about us. It is a clear, coherent program—but not spelt out, like most things—to remove women from the work force.'</para><para>This will do a very interesting thing. At least 200,000 women are now discouraged workers out of the work force. But they are not counted in the unemployment benefit figures, because they have a partner or a husband who is working. They are not counted. They are discouraged workers and they are part of your government's policy to get 
 women out of the work force to close down some of the assistance that has been put in place for women, particularly in the child-care area. Let us wait and see what they say at the next election.</para><para>We do not have to wait as long as that. As Senator Gibbs has urged, we just have to read the submissions coming to the Senate inquiry. I would also like to put on record the points made by Catherine Cusak. This is hardly what you would call a Labor Party stoolie, if I can paraphrase the minister in his answers today. This is a Liberal Party staffer.</para><para>Ms Cusak, a former young Liberal president who works for Opposition Leader Peter Collins, has told the committee the $800 million savings from the child-care cuts have to be weighed against lost taxation revenue from working mothers. She has two children and, as a result of the increased fees—that is, as a direct result of your government's policies in the child-care area—her child-care fees have risen by $93.55 a week. She has had to sit down and make the relevant calculations. She has done so and has reduced her time at work. She no longer works full time and, as a result of her retreat from full-time work, she is paying $11,000 a year less in income tax. The result is that your government is over $7,000 worse off and her own family income is significantly reduced.</para><para>What kinds of policies do you think you are implementing if Liberal women want to say this on the public record? I believe Labor women—any sorts of women, for that matter—are telling the same sort of story. But, for the record, this message has a particular potency. This is hardly a Labor Party stoolie.</para><para>This piece of legislation seeks to implement the decision by deferring implementation of the Child Care Payments Act 1997. It amends the Child Care Act 1972 and the Child Care Rebate Act 1993 to allow the implementation of other decisions taken in the 1997 budget and reflected in the Child Care Payments Act 1997. These are, first of all, a limit on child-care assistance of 20 hours a week for non-work related care; secondly, the introduction of a planning system for long day care places and a limit on the number of new places approved in 1998 and 1999; and, thirdly, the 
 introduction of immunisation as a criterion for eligibility for child-care assistance and the child-care rebate. The bill also facilitates the transfer of the payment of the current child-care assistance program to Centrelink in the interim period pending the commencement of payments under the Child Care Payments Act 1997.</para><para>To pick up some of those points, I have listened to a lot of twaffle in this place, but I heard today some absolute rhubarb which, in other places, would be called, frankly, dishonest—misinformation of the worst sort. You accused the Labor government of never having a planning system for long day care or any of the new places. It is, I suppose, dull and boring to try to argue these issues on facts, but the facts are that you are completely wrong in that misrepresentation.</para><para>The previous government had a planning program in place—and one is still in place—and that planning program covered all community based child-care centres, long day care centres, all family day care and all outside school hours care. Well before we went out of office we had published by region across the country areas of high need to assist private child-care operators to set their child-care centre where there was already a measured need for child care.</para><para>If we are talking about improving planning or trying to bring the private child-care centres more directly into line with that planning, let us say that. But let us not tell gross lies about the failure of a previous Labor government to have any planning system. It had a comprehensive planning system, and that system is indeed to be extended to cover the private centres.</para><para>It is amazing, to my mind, that private centre operators, most of whom would regard themselves as small businesses and hopefully making good decisions about where they would put their child-care centres, raced to put them in places with no regard to the demand for child care in those areas. That is why there is a gross oversupply of child-care places, mainly private, in south-east Queensland and north-east New South Wales: because the centre operators insisted on building them there.</para><para>On one visit to Queensland I found four child-care centres on each of the four corners of an intersection. It reminded me of the days when we could expect a petrol station on each of the four corners—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>6L6</name.id><name role="metadata">GIBBS</name><name role="display">Senator Gibbs</name></talker><para>—Or a pub!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Crowley, Sen Rosemary</name><name role="display">Senator CROWLEY</name></talker><para>—I have never seen four hotels on four corners of an intersection, Senator, but we have certainly seen petrol stations on each of the four corners and we have seen what has happened to them. Over the years there has been a recognition that that is a stupid way to behave, and the petrol stations have seen that they could not all compete.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Child-care centres have taken a long time to make good business decisions about where they put their centres. I hope that, by increasing the planning system to include the privates more directly, we will get more coherence in the planning of child care. But please let us not have this nonsense that there was no planning there before. There was. It covered all the community based, the family day care and the outside school hours care places.</para><para>For that we saw under the previous government there was a significant distribution of child-care places to areas of need. Also true is that the community sector, the public sector, put child care in places that the private operators decided would not be very profitable: in the lower income areas, in rural and remote areas—places where the privates were not prepared to go to. So let us talk about the child-care debate based on facts, not rhubarb.</para><para>You are planning to introduce this planning system. I will be very interested to hear from the minister in the committee stage of this bill exactly how it will happen. It is still very difficult, even in questioning during estimates, to find out precisely what the process is and how it will be put in place. I do believe that will be very important. I also wonder what the effect of all these changes will be. We are already seeing, as I have said, the closure of 50 long day community based child-care centres, and any number of the private child-care operators are now saying they are feeling the pinch to the point of facing the prospect of closure.</para><para>The introduction of immunisation as a criterion for eligibility for child-care assistance and the child-care rebate is of concern. First of all, I would like to know how it will be implemented. Who will decide or on what evidence will families be able to confirm that their children have been immunised? Will immunisation require all possible immunisations?</para><para>I would certainly be appreciative of some detailed explanation of exactly how this will happen. If, for example, a family have not been eligible for maternity assistance and did not have to meet any criteria for evidence of immunisation for that payment and the first time they front the system will be with the prospect of needing child-care assistance, how will this confirmation of immunisation happen? Will they have to take, for example, a stamped or signed book, or something like that, to the director of the child-care centre, or will they indeed have to clear it through Centrelink? If they have passed some immunisation test for the payment of the maternity benefit, will that be sufficient for approval for child-care assistance eligibility?</para><para>I would also like the minister to provide for me information on exactly what immunisations will be required as part of the eligibility. Does it include measles or merely diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough and polio? Does it include any of the hepatitis programs? Does it include mumps? What exactly are you saying are the immunisations that are needed?</para><para>Up to this point I have had some very concerning evidence brought to my attention. In the Centrelink documentation there has been a failure to provide to families information that says that if they are passionately opposed to immunisation or if they have a medical reason for not being able to proceed with immunisation, they are exempt under the requirements of this act and still eligible for child-care assistance.</para><para>I am not clear that Centrelink documentation in the area of child care is at fault here by omission, but it is clear—I understand that the minister's office has advised the department to get it right through Centrelink next time—that full information must be provided to families about the requirements of immuni 
 sation. Centrelink's documentation has been incorrect and at fault by leaving that piece of information out. From reading the documentation, there is clearly a sense of there being a compulsion for families to be immunised. We know that that is not the case after considerable debate in this place.</para><para>Let me make it clear, should anybody want to use these words against me, that I am one of those who supports immunisation. I would like to see families provide the immunisation available for children in this country as much as possible. I am also aware of considerable and serious evidence that there are concerns about immunisation. I am also aware that lots of families worry about it. The legislation we introduced in this place before took account of those concerns. It is a great pity that the Centrelink documentation failed to provide fulsome information in this area. It is almost like coercion by omission—`Let's leave out some of the facts and maybe families won't quite notice it.' That is very disappointing. If you are serious about assisting families, as in the question I raised before about the introduction of planning, let us tell the full truth. Let us assist families by telling them exactly what is the requirement and let us deal with families then, not by some kind of program of obfuscation.</para><para>The other important point that needs to be made in this legislation is that you have done well. You have done very well because you have alienated absolutely everybody in the child-care area—the families, the providers and every sector of child care. They are all absolutely up in arms about what you are planning to do. First you propose to do things by 1 January and then you defer it to April. You are deleting it for 30 months until the smartcard may be available.</para><para>The other important thing that you propose to do is to make the payments for child-care assistance directly to families. Surveys from 1994—I cannot be absolutely clear of the year, but prior to the Howard government coming into office—show that over 66 per cent of parents did not want the payments to them. They would prefer those payments went to the child-care centre so that was one thing they did not have to worry about. I urge the 
 government to rethink that proposal that the payments would go to families. They do not want it. It is only going to cause more agitation for them. I do believe it is just another example of how this government has not been listening.</para><para>There is insecurity, anxiety and confusion in child care now. This is a government that does not listen and does not care. You have your covert agenda to make sure that women are out of the work force and that lots of child-care centres are closed down. You have made sure that an industry that was well established and, indeed had got to the point where you boast what we established—that is, the accreditation program to see quality care in all long day care centres, something we should all be very pleased about—is being wound back in a very sad, unnecessary and destructive way.</para><para>Let us look at another article from the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> of Monday, 30 March 1998. `Forced to pull out of child care' is the heading of an article by Kate Hannon. Evidence from New South Wales, from the Penrith City Council—one of Australia's largest providers of child-care services—has found that low income families, families earning less than $27,000 a year, are hardest hit by child-care fee rises. The article talks about the impact on families of those increased fees. It found that 181 families had withdrawn their children altogether from the long day care and 183 families had cut the number of days their children attend care.</para><para>Centres have been forced to skimp on their spending on food and children's equipment, including toys. They have also cut staff by 10 per cent. Many centres had a smaller staff to children ratio, fewer qualified staff and were unable to give children as much individual attention as in the past. They are concerned about a direct reduction in quality care as a result of this government's policies. It is something to be very concerned about. We fought and struggled to get quality care to give parents an assurance. You have taken it away. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>1658</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am only going to speak on one part of this legislation, but it is an important part 
 to many people. All of those who have been listening closely to this debate would know that my Democrat colleague from Queensland, Senator Woodley, covered all other issues relating to the <inline ref="r436">Child Care Legislation Amendment Bill 1998</inline>  comprehensively and admirably.</para></talk.start><para>As the Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Meg Lees, has stated in the past in relation to the Child Care Payments Act 1997, the Democrats support the general direction taken by the government to offer incentives to encourage parents to give serious consideration to vaccinating their children. We know from research that most parents who fail to vaccinate their children have done so not because they hold strong views against vaccination—although it certainly applies to some—but because they are not aware of the recommended vaccinations for their children or, simply, because they have not yet got around to it. Giving the Australian people an incentive to make sure they do give adequate thought to this issue is an important initiative.</para><para>Tying child-care payments to immunisation addresses this issue and should result in higher levels of vaccination amongst the vast majority of children whose parents do support immunisation. However, whilst supporting the general thrust of this legislation, the Democrats have been concerned to ensure that those parents who have a strong and genuine opposition to vaccination are not denied access to child-care subsidies because of their beliefs. Senator Lees has raised these concerns in relation to the Child Care Payments Act and the government responded to this concern previously by making provision for conscientious objectors in this act.</para><para>These provisions are reflected in this bill that we are debating this evening and include the requirement that parents visit a recognised immunisation provider to discuss with them the benefits and the risks of immunisation. While this may be a sensible requirement in many cases, the Democrats do have concerns that in some specific cases this provision may not be appropriate. For example, I have received—and other Democrat senators, and I imagine many other senators from other parties in this place, have received—many 
 representations from Christian Scientists who believe that this requirement goes against their religious beliefs. Christian Scientists feel that, for them, a visit to the doctor to talk about immunisation is not only against their beliefs but also unnecessary and a waste of time and public money.</para><para>In that circumstance, why should people have to sit around a doctor's surgery to talk about something when they know what they think about it, when it is a matter of faith and belief and not a matter of science or medical opinion? Why should they waste the doctor's time, why should everybody else have to wait longer in the doctor's surgery and why should we drain Medicare funding, et cetera, in that situation with people going through that charade simply to satisfy technical requirements of the act?</para><para>I have had personal representations on this including from people from my own state of Queensland. A letter I received just a week or so ago was from Mr Ronald Walker from the Christian Science Committee on Publication for Queensland, a representative of the Christian Science community in Queensland, specifically drawing my attention to this matter, something I had been aware of in a general sense before but certainly not in relation to the specifics of this issue. It has been of some enlightenment to me to become aware in a bit more detail of the beliefs and concerns of Christian Scientists. Certainly, Mr Walker and other Christian Scientists have indicated that they do wish this matter to be considered and wish that not just Christian Scientists but also the significant group of people that this relates to, who do choose to avail themselves of their civil right to refuse immunisation, due to their own personal beliefs, be properly accommodated in this government's legislation and ongoing policy.</para><para>Recognising the needs of specific groups in the community, whether they be minority groups or otherwise, and trying to ensure that those needs are addressed as part of the broad policy announcements and directions of government that apply to the whole community, is a principle that the Democrats do give a lot of attention to. Christian Scientists operate within a different modality of health 
 based on their religious beliefs. Their representatives, who have written to me and to other Democrat senators and have come to speak to Senator Lees and her staff, who have given a great deal of attention to this issue, have presented a carefully considered position and have done a great deal of research on this topic. In fact, they are probably better informed about immunisation than are most lay people.</para><para>Their objections stem from their religious beliefs rather than from a specific disagreement with the logic or the scientific validity of the medical research which supports universal immunisation. Therefore, no amount of evidence, scientific facts or discussions with the local GP, hospital intern or whomever, will convince them to immunise their children. In that circumstance, it seems unnecessary at a minimum to force people to go through this charade. They can in no way be considered equivalent to those parents who have not immunised their children due to ignorance, inconvenience, neglect or other reasons such as not having got around to it, and they should not be treated in the same way as those people under this legislation if at all possible. The Democrats believe it is possible and we believe that their needs should be addressed.</para><para>The Democrats believe that Christian Scientists have the right to have their specific situation acknowledged and to have more appropriate conditions attached to their application for conscientious objector status, rather than individually having to visit doctors to get certificates. The Democrats will not be moving amendments to this bill on this issue that I have raised in my short contribution this evening because we understand the mechanism is available within the bill as it stands.</para><para>Before we indicate our position on this specific aspect of the legislation, the Democrats do ask the minister, or his representative, in his concluding remarks this evening to give an indication on behalf of the government that they will use the powers vested in them under proposed section 12(h) of this bill to address the concerns that Senator Meg Lees has raised with Minister Wooldridge predominantly, and also with Minister Warwick Smith, the 
 Minister for Family Services, regarding the specific concerns of the Christian Scientists. We believe it is something that can be addressed and we hope the government will give a specific commitment to addressing those concerns in relation to this legislation that have been raised as part of this debate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>1660</page.no><name role="metadata">Denman, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator DENMAN</name><name.id>FY5</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on the <inline ref="r436">Child Care Legislation Amendment Bill 1998</inline> . I must say that I agree with Senator Crowley when she says that this bill is an embarrassment to the government. It is incredible that the Minister for Family Services, Mr Warwick Smith, continues to self-delude on the issues of quality, access and range of choice in the area of child care in this country when he states:</para></talk.start><para>We are concerned about quality child care for Australian families and access in an affordable way for families to ensure that they have a range of choices from family day care to after school hours care, and also from the community care sector and the private care sector.</para><para>What does the minister mean by `access in an affordable way' and `a range of choices' when $820 million has been cut by this government from child care? It is understandable that the minister is concerned about child care because the whole area is in a shambles.</para><para>What the minister means is that most families will pay for access to care regardless, because he knows that the overwhelming number of mums and dads of this country will not, where possible, compromise the care of their child. They will do everything in their power to ensure that their child or children get the best form of care, and they will simply pay the extra.</para><para>Such families who are able will deal with these cuts in the best way that it is possible for them to do so. They will not be happy with the substantial increase of dollars per week per child for community long day care or outside school ours care, the reduction in the child-care cash rebate for families earning more than $70,000 a year, or the restricted access to child-care assistance for non-work related care, but at least they will be able to continue to choose the level and quality of care. They will be able to exercise the so- 
 called range of choice, but it is now a lot more costly to retain that range of choice.</para><para>Now we move to another group of parents, for whom the increased cost of child care has made it unaffordable and for whom a mother, in most cases, is left with only two choices. The range of choice has now shrunk markedly to two options: such families take the risk and either opt for a reduction in quality of care or opt out of the work force and care for their child at home. The first choice is a choice for poorer quality of care; the second is not an exercise of choice but rather of necessity.</para><para>The first option will lead parents to seek those unregulated care providers—be they a friend, a grandparent or a provider who operates outside the system. With regard to the second option—some of my female colleagues have dwelt on this in detail, so I will not—it is a sad scenario to think that this government has caused women in particular, but not solely, to remain at home. For those mothers, or families, to do otherwise would compromise and prejudice the future of their child or children in other ways—the child's future education or, even more drastically, the health of such a child.</para><para>As the shadow minister, the member for Jagajaga, Ms Jenny Macklin, recently stated in the other place, women are becoming discouraged workers. It is estimated that about 200,000 women have been discouraged from seeking work because of the new cost regime of child care. As we know, what this bill does is postpone the date of the effect of changed methods of payment, made by a number of 1997 budget measures, to await the introduction of smart card technology. The timing of this postponement is no accident, with an upcoming election.</para><para>The government debacle regarding child care has not been as great a fiasco as that over aged care. But then it has always been a botched affair from the beginning. We had the initial announcement that parents could expect to be paid child-care assistance by Centrelink. This was to be implemented this year in January. But, subsequently, that was delayed until April this year. In January this year, though, all current arrangements were overturned with the announcement that we 
 need to wait for the introduction of the smartcard, hence this legislation.</para><para>I know from talking with the child-care industry in Tasmania that there was some scepticism over the announcement that the April changes could be efficiently made without there being a waste of money, particularly with the smartcard system being planned maybe for next year. I recall from discussions that there was also concern about exactly how much the subsidy had been reduced per hour for after school hours care and whether the new reduced rate would apply generally or only to new children coming into care.</para><para>Now concern reigns about the administration of the smartcard technology and the manner in which parents will be able to access their credits and whether individual carers will have machines or whether there will be a need for a central pay system. This general uncertainty has had a harmful effect on parents, on the public perception of Centrelink and last but not least on child-care providers, especially for a period that is recognised for the level of basic insecurity that has been experienced by members of the public. The whole confusing administrative environment has led to some extraordinary happenings which in turn, I believe it is fair to say, is leading to Centrelink losing its integrity as an organisation because this government lost any integrity it had in the administration of child care long ago when it failed to consult from the outset.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>1661</page.no><name role="metadata">Herron, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HERRON</name><name.id>VW4</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I feel sorry for anybody who has been listening to this debate, considering the carping criticism that has come from the trio of Labor women on the other side. I want to stand up for the men. We have been given the impression that the only people involved in child care are women. Personally, I am happy to say that my wife and I have more children than the whole trio on the other side put together; we certainly have had more experience than any of the ladies over there. But all we have heard is this carping criticism.</para></talk.start><para>It takes two to tango, and it is a matter of fact that men have an equal role to play in the care of their children—and if they do not take that responsibility, they should. I know that is one of the problems that has occurred in our society—that, in many cases, they have not taken that responsibility.</para><para>We seem to get the impression that child care provided by paid people is the best quality of care. I was distressed to hear Senator Denman say that care at home was poorer quality care. I hope I am not misreporting her, but that is what I heard: that care at home was poorer quality care. I find it unconscionable that such a statement should be made. To regard that quality child care, regardless of age, would be best carried out by professionals disregards the influence of the mother and the father.</para><para>The agenda put forward by the opposition disregards the desire of many mothers to care for their young children at home, if they can afford to do so—and I am sure that Senator Cooney would agree with me in that regard. Certainly, all the surveys that I have seen show that mothers, of preschool children in particular, would prefer to stay at home, if they could afford to do so. And, of course, there is accumulating evidence that early child care, sometimes independent of quality, is associated with risks of undesirable outcomes.</para><para>These amendments are designed to make child-care assistance easier for families. Feedback from the industry indicated that the arrangements envisaged under the Child Care Payments Act 1997 would be difficult for families and services during 1998. With this government being responsive to the needs of parents and service providers, the minister announced on 23 January that the commencement of payments under the Child Care Payments Act 1997 would be deferred, pending the introduction of smartcard technology. So, far be it from us having not listened to anybody, having not spoken to anybody and being out of touch, as was stated by Senator Crowley; that is completely untrue.</para><para>This Child Care Legislation Amendment Bill defers the implementation of the Child Care Payments Act 1997 and maintains the current familiar child-care system. Operators 
 and families are used to this system. While there are a number of changes to the system to be implemented from 27 April 1998, these reflect 1997 budget initiatives, including the 20-hour limit on child-care assistance for non-work related care, the new immunisation requirements and the planning controls for 1998-99. All of these measures were previously part of the Child Care Payments Act 1997 and were passed by the parliament late last year. Nothing of substance has changed.</para><para>Child care is an integral element of the government's strategy to promote the wellbeing of Australian families. The range of child-care reforms that were introduced in the 1996 and 1997 federal budgets focus on providing fair and reasonable access to funded care and address concerns about families' access to quality care, especially in rural and remote areas. The reforms are the result of extensive family research and consultations with both parents and the child-care industry.</para><para>The government is committed to providing support to assist parents to fulfil both their work and family responsibilities. The government maintains its commitment to child care. This year we have allocated $1,200,000 million to child care—an increase of 18 per cent since the last year in office of the former Labor government.</para><para>Much has been said about the impact of the government's change to outside school hours care funding. This change is not contained in this bill but, nevertheless, I would like to respond to some of the statements that have been made about it both in question time this afternoon and this evening.</para><para>The reforms will better target assistance within stand-alone outside school hours care services. Currently, most of the assistance is provided in the form of operational subsidies which allow the fees to be reduced for everybody, regardless of income. Under the new system, those most in need of government assistance will receive the most help—and surely nothing is more equitable than that.</para><para>Also, school children attending stand-alone outside school hours care services currently receive lower levels of assistance than do school children receiving after-school care from centre-based long day care services or 
 family day care schemes—and that is not equitable. So that has been approached by reforms which will make subsidies for schoolchildren more equitable, since they will not depend on where the children receive their care.</para><para>The government has been responsive to concerns raised by outside school hours care services about the administration of a proper child-care assistance system, and it has provided generous assistance to help services through the transition. The new and equitable school age child-care assistance will inject an additional $11 million over four years into school age care.</para><para>The government has already made $12.2 million restructuring assistance available to services to obtain business and marketing advice, purchase equipment or specialised assistance, and undertake minor capital works. Also, the government is providing another $8 million to assist outside school hours care services to make the transition to the new arrangements. Transitional support offered includes initial training and information sessions for all services and individual service-specific support during the transition period.</para><para>The department has set up a dedicated outside school hours care child-care assistance telephone help line and an in-person service visit and support system. The department will also provide transitional child-care assistance implementation grants to help services during the changeover to the new system. These grants will be equivalent to two months of operational subsidy and will assist services setting up accounting procedures, attending training and helping parents during the transition. The government is more than fulfilling its obligation to assist services to adjust.</para><para>Moving back to the bill and the real business of this chamber: care has been taken to ensure that administrative demands on services will be kept to a minimum. For the 20-hour measure, services will ask affected families in receipt of child-care assistance to sign a work test statement indicating that they meet the work study training test.</para><para>The bill and associated disallowable instruments impose the same limit on care, with the 
 same exemptions, as was approved by this chamber in the Child Care Payments Act 1997. Nothing of substance has changed. This bill introduces the immunisation requirement for both child-care assistance and the child-care rebate. These requirements are identical to those contained in the Child Care Payments Act 1997. All of the same exemptions will apply.</para><para>Families who want to claim an exemption will need to consult an immunisation provider. This is considered fair and reasonable. This bill introduces a much needed planning framework. It imposes a 7,000 place per year limit on new long day care places for 1998-99. It introduces procedures to be followed in imposing a sanction on an operator and safeguards in the form of appeals to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. All of this produces the same planned environment envisaged by the Child Care Payments Act 1997.</para><para>In addition, the government has also acknowledged the concerns of Christian Scientists referred to by Senator Bartlett. I would like to give an assurance to the senator and to Christian Scientists that the minister will use the powers vested in him under sections 12H and 39B directing that identified children of Christian Scientists who undertake counselling from a nominated person who is not a medical practitioner be exempted from the requirements to be immunised. This will save Christian Scientists from the requirement to receive information from a medical practitioner while still ensuring that the facts are put before every parent. This is consistent with the principle contained in the immunisation charter signed by the government and 23 medical and community organisations last week respecting people's beliefs and privacy.</para><para>I reject the statements by those opposite in criticism of the government. You would think that we had not taken into account advice that we have received predominantly from parents and from providers. We have taken that advice. I reject the philosophical base that has been put forward from those on the other side. As I have said in my earlier remarks, I commend the bill to the chamber. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para><para>Leave granted; debate adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>INTERNATIONAL MONETARY AGREEMENTS AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>1664</page.no><id.no>r444</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>1664</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 30 March, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vanstone</inline>:</para><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>1664</page.no><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name><name.id>RF4</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This is the <inline ref="r444">International Monetary Agreements Amendment Bill 1998</inline> , and the opposition will be supporting this legislation. I note for the record that the shadow Treasurer, Mr Gareth Evans, in the House of Representatives successfully moved an amendment to this bill. The government accepted that amendment. By its acceptance of the proposals we put in the other place, I think there is now significant bilateral support for this legislation.</para></talk.start><para>The bill is significant because it clearly arises as a direct result of the Asian economic and financial crisis. In short, if it were not for the Asian economic crisis, we would not be debating the bill here in this chamber tonight. The Asian crisis is already having a profound impact on the Australian economy, and it will almost certainly dominate economic developments, both in Australia and internationally, over at least the next year or two. The wider economic, political and social repercussions of this crisis will be felt for many years, not only in the Asian region in general but also in Australia. The bill provides an opportunity for us to debate some of those implications.</para><para>The particular purpose of the bill, however, is to amend the International Monetary Agreements Act 1947 to establish a framework for Australia to provide financial assistance to a country that is undertaking an economic adjustment program with the support of the International Monetary Fund. First, it makes specific—in effect retrospective—provision for appropriations to fulfil Australia's pledges of financial assistance already given to South Korea and Indonesia and made last year. These pledges involve currency swaps or loans of up to $US1 billion for both countries.</para><para>The bill does not specifically refer to the currency swap, also of $US1 billion, that has 
 already been negotiated through the Reserve Bank of Thailand. The bill is also significant because it provides a framework for future Australian financial assistance in support of IMF programs. Indeed, it not only provides a framework for future assistance but also provides what is, in effect, a standing appropriation to enable the government to supply this assistance from the consolidated revenue fund. While it is expected that such assistance will be required only in rare and exceptional circumstances, this legislation could eventually involve very significant future appropriations.</para><para>I would like to make it clear at the outset that the Labor opposition supports this bill, just as we supported the announcement by the government of Australia's participation in the IMF programs for Thailand, Korea and Indonesia. The IMF sponsored adjustment programs of this kind are vital to restore confidence and to restore stability in countries experiencing financial crisis. It is important that Australia participates in these packages when they relate to countries in our region or with which we have strong economic links. We support the government's action in ensuring that Australia is the only country besides Japan to have participated in each of the IMF sponsored financial packages for our Asian neighbours. We agree with the proposal in this bill for an explicit framework for Australian participation in future IMF sponsored adjustment programs with, in effect, a standing appropriation, as I have said, to allow the Treasurer to make loans or currency swaps.</para><para>In this context it is important to note that the bill does not provide for grants but rather for loans that must be repaid in the future. The Treasurer can only agree to provide Australian assistance if at least one other country or international organisation is participating, or has agreed to participate, in the IMF program. In addition, the Treasurer can only agree to provide assistance to a recipient country at the request of the International Monetary Fund itself. The bill also requires that any agreement by the Treasurer on behalf of Australia must allow Australia to demand early repayment in the event of a suspension or premature termination of the fund program. Finally, the bill provides for assistance to the 
 Republic of Korea and the Republic of Indonesia, made under an agreement entered into before the announcement of the act, to be appropriated from the consolidated revenue fund, provided that the conditions of the bill are satisfied.</para><para>I have to say a deficiency in the original bill that came before the House of Representatives is that it did not impose any explicit disclosure or accountability requirements on the Treasurer. While extremely unlikely in practice, in principle the old bill would have allowed the Treasurer to commit very substantial amounts of public money to an IMF program without making any public statement of that assistance. More seriously, the bill would have allowed the Treasurer to commit substantial sums of taxpayers' money to an IMF program without having to justify his decision. The lack of explicit provisions requiring the Treasurer to publicly announce the size of any own loan or currency swap made under the bill and the reasons why such assistance is in Australia's national interest was indeed a very clear shortcoming.</para><para>Accordingly, the Labor opposition in the House moved an amendment to the bill which will require the Treasurer to issue a public statement detailing the terms of any currency swaps or loans to be provided in support of an IMF-sponsored program and to provide reasons why this assistance is in Australia's national interest. I am pleased to say that my advice is that that amendment was accepted. The opposition believes it to be an important one in terms of this government's accountability to the taxpayers of Australia as to what it does with their money.</para><para>There are three important general issues, however, thrown up by this legislation which need to be debated: the nature and course of the Asian economic crisis itself, the role of the International Monetary Fund and the international monetary system in resolving it and the domestic impact in Australia of that crisis. Let me start with the first of those, the Asian economic crisis. There is no doubt that the Asian economic and financial crisis of 1997-98 is an event of profound significance not only for the economic and political development of Asia but also for the evolu 
 tion of the international monetary system. The influential Vice-Minister for International Relations of the Japanese Ministry for Finance, Eisuke Sakakibara, has described the Asian crisis as the first crisis of global capitalism. The Chairman of the US Federal Reserve, Dr Alan Greenspan, has said recently of the Asian crisis:</para><para>The architecture of the international financial system will need to be thoroughly reviewed and altered as necessary to fit the needs of the new global environment.</para><para>Given Australia's close proximity to Asia and our extensive economic links with the region, Australia has a vital national interest in the Asian economic crisis being resolved as rapidly as possible. Over the last eight months Australia has participated in IMF-sponsored economic assistance packages for, as I have said, Thailand, Korea and Indonesia. Australia's participation in these assistance programs has been very much in our national interest. We have had a vital stake in ensuring that our Asian trading partners have the capacity to stabilise their economies as quickly as possible in the face of a massive loss of international investor support. The IMF-sponsored adjustment packages for Thailand, Korea and Indonesia have been designed to stabilise the financial system in each of the countries and to provide foundations for eventual economic recovery. People do differ as to how long it will take. Most seem to suggest between three to five years.</para><para>With the benefit of hindsight, elements of the international response to the Asian crisis, including the adjustment packages proposed by the IMF and supported by Australia, will probably be seen to have been flawed in various ways. Indeed, legitimate concerns are already being raised about aspects of the IMF packages and the way in which they have been implemented, particularly with respect to Indonesia. Nevertheless, as Dr Alan Greenspan has pointed out, governments have had to respond to the Asian crisis within the structures and institutions that are in place today. To have delayed action in search of an ideal international response would have been to invite disaster. When the patient is bleeding to death you do not turn the ambulance away 
 in the hope that a better ambulance will show up in a couple of months time.</para><para>Fortunately, the IMF-sponsored programs have so far generally worked well in stabilising financial conditions in Korea and Thailand, although these economies will continue to experience very difficult economic conditions for some time yet. Developments in Indonesia have, however, been less encouraging. Nevertheless, in the case of Indonesia, participation in the IMF program has provided Australia with some inside leverage to seek appropriate modifications to the economic assistance package to take account of the special circumstances currently prevailing in that country.</para><para>I would also like to say a few words about the role of the IMF and the international monetary system. The opposition would not like our support for this bill to be seen as indicating that we are not alive to the vigorous international debate that is currently occurring about the modus operandi of the IMF and what Dr Alan Greenspan has dubbed the `architecture of the international monetary system'. While it is still early days yet, ad hoc IMF-sponsored assistance packages of the kind envisaged by this bill may be rendered redundant by new forms of international intervention, possibly through expanded IMF resources based on the new arrangements to borrow.</para><para>All of this does, of course, remain speculative. In the meantime, a vigorous debate on the IMF and its methods and the structure of the international monetary system is to be encouraged. However, while this debate is resolved it is important to recognise the need to work within the existing international monetary framework, in which the IMF plays a central role. At present, an IMF-sponsored assistance package is simply the best option for a country facing a collapse in international investor confidence. Our Asian neighbours have not been forced to accept IMF packages; they have turned to the IMF for support. And they have welcomed Australia's participation in these packages.</para><para>The opposition hopes that further loans or currency swaps will not need to be made under the provisions of this bill. However, if 
 the circumstances again arise where Australian participation in an IMF-sponsored economic adjustment program is justified in the national interest, this bill provides a framework for a quick and decisive response. Importantly, the amendments proposed and now adopted will ensure this response occurs within a transparent framework.</para><para>Australia's participation in the IMF packages for Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea has been important. But it would be a grave mistake to see this participation as justifying a complacent domestic response to the Asian economic crisis. It is true that the precise impact of the Asian economic crisis on the Australian economy cannot be easily estimated in advance. There are, indeed, estimates as to its impact ranging from between ½ per cent being shaved off GDP to up to 1½ per cent being shaved off the growth rate for the Australian economy. When you consider that in the March quarter the market sat breathless in anticipation that the figures for growth for this economy would come in at four per cent or more and was disappointed to find that they came in at 3.6 per cent, the loss of ½ or even one or 1½ per cent in the growth figures for this economy would be disastrous for employment, business and consumer confidence. Indeed, it would also suggest in the current climate a devalued Australian dollar with imports being sucked in at a great rate, pressure on our current account; ergo, pressure on Australian interest rates. So it is not a small matter nor is it a matter from which we should in any way shrink.</para><para>In fact, it is no longer justifiable to speak of the impact of the Asian economic crisis in a future tense for it is already clear that the Asian economic crisis is starting to hit the Australian economy. We have seen several effects, the strongest of which have been a collapse in tourist numbers from the Asian countries most affected by the crisis and a dramatic decline in live cattle exports to Asia. We have seen, as well, falling world commodity prices in response to the Asian crisis—and, of course, most of the Australian exports are commodity based—and we have seen a reduced demand for an Australian university education by Asian students. Even 
 the car industry has been affected, with Mitsubishi Australia requiring 3,000 of its factory workers in Adelaide to take annual leave for two weeks next month to reduce the production levels of cars destined for the Asian market.</para><para>No government could ever completely insulate Australia from the Asian economic crisis—that, of course, is true—but we would have been better placed to confront it if economic growth in our own domestic economy were stronger than it is and especially if unemployment were significantly lower than it currently is. The government's rhetoric that it has `fireproofed' the Australian economy from the effects of the Asian crisis betrays a disturbing degree of complacency. This underlying complacency was betrayed by the Treasurer's claim last year that the effect of the Asian crisis on Australia would be `hardly measurable', even as private sector economists were revising their estimates of the impact. The government may claim to have fireproofed the economy but business and consumer confidence in Australia is quite brittle.</para><para>In recent weeks the leading business surveys, including the NAB and ACCI-Westpac ones, have shown a sharp fall in business confidence. Expectations for future exports have fallen particularly dramatically. This pessimism about the economy has spread to consumers with the Westpac-Melbourne Institute survey showing a dramatic 10 per cent fall in consumer confidence in the last month. With Treasury identifying a loss in confidence as a major threat to its growth forecasts, the downturn in confidence in recent months has profound implications for the Australian economy. Just last month, in a Senate estimates hearing, Treasury Deputy Secretary Borthwick conceded that:</para><para>. . . for economists, business confidence is always the uncertainty which often trips us up.</para><para>As I have said, the surveys of business confidence by ACCI-Westpac have shown sharp drops in that business confidence. I hope that these are not severe harbingers of economic misfortune for this economy in the future, but there does need to be a rethinking of government economic strategy to ensure that the 
 levels of business confidence are, in fact, bolstered and that consumer confidence holds up as well.</para><para>I know that in this chamber during question time we often hear the Assistant Treasurer, who now sits opposite me, boast about Australia's economic performance.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="metadata">KEMP</name><name role="display">Senator Kemp</name></talker><para>—Just the facts.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>RF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name></talker><para>—`Just the facts,' you say by way of interjection, Assistant Treasurer. Let me say that those facts, in your words, are often very elastic facts.</para></talk.start></continue><para>But let me come straight to the point: the Australian economy is not growing at the levels that were forecast by your government in your last budget. They did not grow at the levels forecast by your government in its previous budget either. In two successive years you have undershot the levels of growth that you have forecast. We know that, for unemployment in this nation to fall, the Australian economy has to grow by in excess of four per cent. We know it is growing at 3.6 per cent. We know that you aimed for the economy to grow at 3.75 per cent in this budgetary year. In other words, not only did you not budget for unemployment to be reduced; you, in fact, budgeted for unemployment to increase, and your performance thus far through this budgetary year shows that you have succeeded in your goal because even your best bet is being undershot.</para><para>Business and consumer confidence is dependent on a buoyant economy and, with external demand falling because of the Asian currency crisis particularly affecting the countries of South-East Asia, one would hope that domestic economic demand would be improving. The tables on business confidence suggest that that is not, in fact, the case and the forecast for the economy is gloomier, therefore, than predicted. I hope I am wrong about those things. I do not want to see the economy struggle. I do not want to see people unemployed. But I do want to see a change in the urgency the government brings to its economic responsibilities in this country and, within the urgency it brings, for it to give a clear focus to tackling the problem of unemployment. </para><para>Denying young Australians and unemployed Australians opportunities for careers and for a future is not a way to govern the country. The best asset this nation—which is a nation wealthy in physical attributes—has, however, is its people, and providing employment for them is a fundamental obligation of government. By the budgetary settings that you have imposed, you have not aimed to do that. The crisis that this bill refers to undercuts those goals further, and that does require a considerable level of new thinking in the government to start to get the economy moving out of the sluggish levels of performance it is now unfortunately experiencing.</para><para>I conclude—because the light is on and I have only one minute left—by saying we support this bill because we believe that Australia should be a good neighbour in its region. The countries that this bill provides cover for are important trading partners to us. Their economic health reflects on our economic wellbeing as well and we need to help them in their times of crisis. Ours is a country that lives in this region. When the foreign investors depart and return their funds back to the US or European economies, Australia will still be here and, as a neighbour, will be able to take advantage of the future growth rates that these countries will enjoy. That is the very important reason why this bill is supported. I commend it to the Senate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>1668</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Greens (WA) support the underlying aims of this bill, the <inline ref="r444">International Monetary Agreements Amendment Bill 1998</inline> . The objectives of this bill are to increase transparency, parliamentary scrutiny, and provide a framework for any provision of financial assistance to countries under IMF sponsored economic programs. It is perhaps a good aim a little late. Transparency and consistency are worthy goals and ones which the Greens (WA) have advocated in the past. It is clear that the previous ad hoc non-consultative approach was a poor one. The bill retrospectively provides for Australia's appropriations given to South Korea and Indonesia in 1997. It also provides a framework for financial assistance that Australia may pledge in support of IMF programs in the future. 
 Effectively, the bill provides a standing appropriation to permit the government to provide such assistance from the consolidated revenue fund.</para></talk.start><para>The Greens (WA), however, have some major concerns, two in particular. The first relates to the adequacy of the mechanisms to increase transparency and scrutiny. The second relates to the purpose for which the money is lent and the implementation of the purpose by the IMF. The Greens (WA) are concerned that the mechanisms in this bill achieve the goals of transparency and scrutiny much too late. We appreciate that in circumstances of financial crisis it may be necessary to act swiftly. However, there are virtually no checks or criteria before the Treasurer can pledge Australia's financial support to the IMF programs. The only touchstones are, firstly, a request by the IMF, and, secondly, that one other country or organisation is also contributing—a great choice there.</para><para>If the first benchmark is regarded as any kind of safeguard, it must be assumed that the IMF is a competent body with good judgment. This is a highly questionable assumption. Most recently in relation to the Asian crisis, the competency of the IMF has been seriously challenged. Commentators from all political perspectives have said that the IMF have got it wrong and have failed to understand the local intricacies. Initially, it was criticised for its blinkered `if you've seen one economic crisis, you've seen them all' approach. The IMF assumed that old programs it had used in past monetary crises could be recycled. We know the ones: you get into the country, whether it is going well or not going well. The IMF says, `Cut spending, increase exports, deregulate your economy'—the same reply to every country they go into.</para><para>The IMF took this approach despite the fact that these old programs had caused untold damage to citizens in developing countries. They took this approach without even considering that the Asian crisis and the countries involved may be unique and require new and creative solutions. The IMF have also been heavily criticised for unilaterally usurping the sovereignty of recipient nations and imposing harsh and unjust social policies which are 
 resulting in enormous pain for everyday people. Of course, they do this at the time when the countries generally have the least power to argue back.</para><para>The programs and policies advocated by the IMF have gone much further than any mandate the IMF has and diminish the ability of governments to make fundamental decisions about policies in their own nation. The straitjacket of structural reforms and micro management goes way beyond an economic transformation but forces political and social transformation as well. Moreover, as I will elaborate in a moment, the IMF's policies rarely assist the majority of the citizens in recipient countries. If the IMF is blase about the national interest of the recipient country, it would be foolish to assume that the IMF's opinion could be regarded as some kind of safeguard, a sort of `trust us, we're the IMF'.</para><para>The second benchmark, that another nation or organisation is contributing, contains no assurance of anything. The logic is based on a strange notion that if another country has decided that contributing is in their national interest, it may naturally or somehow be in ours. There are no rational criteria, not even a cursory investigation of whether our national interest is promoted or whether the program is economically, morally and environmentally sound.</para><para>The Greens (WA) would like to see the government critically assessing these schemes they are signing us up for. We realise it is not always appropriate to go through a rigorous due diligence report of the pros and cons, but there should be some fundamental criteria the government considers before blithely promising Australia's financial assistance. The bill does require that there be a condition on any appropriation that allows Australia to demand accelerated repayment of the loan in the event that the program is suspended or terminated in advance. The Greens (WA) judge this to be an appropriate condition but do not regard it as a substitute for critical assessment prior to the loan.</para><para>Consequently, the Greens (WA) will be moving an amendment which is in a similar vein to the amendment we moved in relation to the International Monetary Agreement 
 Amendment Bill 1997. The amendment essentially seeks to ensure that the IMF's program that Australia is supporting is consistent with our other international commitments. The amendment seeks to use international instruments and principles to which Australia is committed as benchmarks to judge the program and the appropriation. If you think about it for a minute, here we have Australia signed up to a treaty. It is not unreasonable to suggest, even if it is a country to country treaty or a country to IMF treaty, that the other treaties Australia has signed also are taken into consideration in the way we put this contribution together.</para><para>The amendment injects benchmarks such as non-discrimination, social justice, democratic rights, sovereignty and environmental sustainability into the process. All of the transparency and assessment mechanisms come after the event—when it is all too late. The reporting in the budget, the reference to the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade and the national interest statement suggested by the opposition—all of these are positives for transparency and accountability. But, whatever the result of the scrutiny of the committee or the public, these mechanisms do not enable the money to be retracted or the government to demand accelerated repayment. All I can say is, where was the Labor government last year?</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>RF4</name.id><name role="metadata">COOK</name><name role="display">Senator Cook</name></talker><para>—We were in opposition last year.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>DX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name></talker><para>—Yes. So, if the committee, for instance, discovers that the true effect of the IMF program was to benefit a few transnational companies and relegate the majority within the recipient country to poverty, Australia could not resile from its commitment. It would be locked into supporting an unjust and destructive program.</para></talk.start></continue><para>As I have alluded to before, this amendment is a reflection of the often dismal record of the IMF to truly assist the citizens of recipient countries. This is an ongoing debate since the fund began about who is really getting the benefits of IMF loans. Past and present IMF programs have resulted in lenders continually receiving a stream of money from southern nations, regardless of social and environment 
 al costs. The IMF places emphasis on export incomes rather than domestic production, and focuses on loan repayment rather than social programs. The IMF seems happy to impose rescue packages which cause hardship and internal disruption within countries while setting up a system of financial liberalisation which is likely to result in a phenomenally huge transfer of assets from domestic to foreign owners.</para><para>It seems like they are using the desperation of countries to put forward what is in fact a political choice; because, unlike a number of other people in this chamber, I actually think economics is a political decision. Political economy is not called political economy for no reason. We make political choices, and the choice of political theory is a political choice. In this particular case, it would seem the IMF is imposing their political choices on other countries when they have the least ability to resist.</para><para>The current IMF experience in Indonesia exemplifies the IMF's socially irresponsible method of handling crises. In the face of enormous devaluation of the rupiah, which will cause serious pain, the IMF is twisting the knife deeper and rubbing a truckload of salt into the wound. While the economy is crashing and estimated GDP loss for the year is climbing, the IMF is prescribing even tighter monetary policy and requiring Indonesia to restrict the budget deficit to one per cent of GDP.</para><para>How will Indonesia be able to meet these targets? How about taking up the IMF suggestion of eliminating the food subsidies? What a fabulous idea when Indonesia is faced with a grave food crisis and millions losing their jobs. The IMF clearly does not have the interest of everyday citizens anywhere in its thought processes. The IMF is ripping the food out of people's mouths while ripping any political decision-making power from the government.</para><para>We can see quite clearly what happens when governments are left with this no-win situation. It becomes quite convenient, in a desperation situation, to look at those people in their society who are doing relatively well—in this case, the Chinese merchants. It 
 is quite convenient for the governments of these countries which are put under this kind of pressure to allow that kind of scapegoat mentality to take over. This is certainly what is happening.</para><para>I believe the IMF's actions are completely politically insensitive. The IMF knows that it would never be viable for a government to impose such harsh measures themselves. Why does a short-term financial need give the IMF the right to strip a legitimate government of its ability to make decisions about provisions of services, health policy, wage levels and the like?</para><para>The Thailand experience is also a case which casts doubt on the benevolence of the IMF. On announcement of the rescue package, many analysts pointed to the fact that the beneficiaries were primarily the transnational banks and creditors. The fact that the ordinary Thai's life was not improved one iota was not considered to be of more than marginal importance. This is despite the fact that the debt which resulted in the need for rescue was generated by the consumption of the highest strata of Thai society. But, of course, it is the ordinary citizen who bears the full brunt.</para><para>There are a multitude of examples that question the value of IMF's programs. Australia should be assessing these programs that we are throwing millions of dollars at to ensure that they come up to the social, equitable, democratic and environmental standards that Australia supports. If they do not, Australia should be moving to give notice that this will not be a permanent agreement.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>1670</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator BISHOP</name><name.id>2L6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I wish to make a few comments concerning the International Monetary Agreements Amendment Bill 1998 currently before us. A brief description of the purpose of the bill is to amend the International Monetary Agreements Act 1947 to establish a framework for Australia to provide financial assistance to a country that is undertaking an economic adjustment program with the support of the International Monetary Fund.</para></talk.start><para>This purpose obviously gives rise to a number of issues: firstly, Australia's participation in IMF sponsored economic assistance packages for Thailand, Korea and the Repub 
 lic of Indonesia; secondly, the nature of the financial collapse in Thailand and South Korea; thirdly, the nature of the economic collapse in Indonesia as it develops and gets worse; and, fourthly, the role of the IMF in the circumstances that the above countries find themselves in at the current moment.</para><para>Turning briefly to point one, of Australia's participation in the economic assistance packages for Thailand, Korea and Indonesia, in each case Australia has pledged loans or currency swaps of up to $1 billion. Our participation has been in our national interest, and it is important that that is said and goes on the record. It goes without saying, also, that stability in nations located in our region, in the economies of countries that are or will be major trading nations of this country in the foreseeable future, and in countries that are properly described as fully fledged parliamentary democracies is a good thing and to be encouraged and facilitated at nearly every opportunity.</para><para>It also goes without saying that these countries like Australia which do participate in loans or currency swaps have the ability to seek modification or change to IMF packages because of special circumstances that might apply in countries like Indonesia. Those special circumstances may have more impact on, or be of more concern to, Australia than a country like the United States simply because of their locality in this area and the immediate impact if Indonesia should go into a dire economic recession.</para><para>Issues like drought, starvation, severe social dislocation, rioting, internal upheaval, unemployment and loss of life savings for what is commonly described as the emerging middle classes are all factors on the horizon for the Republic of Indonesia. Their impact could be horrendous both for relevant individuals in those countries and nearby neighbours like Australia. Hence, any opportunity to point out, stress or demonstrate to the United States and to the IMF the possible consequences of inappropriate economic measures is a special circumstance which this country needs to take advantage of. In this context, the intent of the bill is worthy of support.</para><para>The bill provides an explicit framework for Australian participation in future IMF-spon 
 sored economic adjustment programs. The bill essentially provides for five things: firstly, a standing appropriation to allow the Treasurer to make loans or currency swaps to a country that is participating in an IMF-sponsored economic adjustment program; secondly, the Treasurer can only agree to provide Australian assistance if at least one other country or international organisation is also participating in that arrangement; thirdly, the Treasurer can only agree to provide assistance to a recipient country at IMF request; fourthly, any agreement by the Treasurer must allow Australia to demand early repayment in the event of the suspension or premature termination of the fund program; fifthly and finally, the bill provides for ratification taken in respect of assistance offered latterly to South Korea and Indonesia. Having made these rather technical contributions, I want to pass on a few observations on what has become known as the Asian financial crisis and the appropriate role for the IMF to pursue as this crisis develops over time.</para><para>In this context it is proper to acknowledge my reference to three articles.

They are published authors with longstanding interest in developmental economics, Asia and the variants of finance and differing models of capitalism that have developed in the last 50 years, and they are all senior professors at elite universities such as Harvard, MIT and Princeton. </para><para>Wade and Veneroso develop an interesting thesis. They argue that the debt crisis in Asia is now a fully fledged development crisis. 
 They point out that South-East Asia, particularly East Asia, has been a region of great economic success over the last 30 years and that living standards have risen at high levels over many years. They stress that at risk are the living standards and lifestyles of millions of people who, as I said earlier, have entered the middle classes in those countries and obviously would seek to retain that status. They point out that Thailand, South Korea and Indonesia are all heading down the path to significant depression with all the consequences that flow from that. They ask: what are the features of this Asian financial crisis? And they point out that most, if not all, of the countries in East Asia and South-East Asia have a number of features. Obviously all of the features do not apply to all countries but, if you plot them, most of the features apply at this time to most countries.</para><para>Firstly, they say that in nearly all of those countries most debt is private debt and not government debt. Secondly, they say there is low inflation, budget surpluses or very small deficits which have been under control for many years. Thirdly, they say that nearly all of the countries have stable or rising foreign exchange reserves. They point out that the region as a whole has been, and is, growing fast, that it has a quarter of world output, half of world growth in this decade of the 1990s and, in the last seven years, over two-thirds of capital spending around the world. They point out that the IMF solution is relatively simple and is based upon models developed in many countries that needed assistance in recent years—most recently the Mexican crisis in the early 1990s. The solution which the IMF seeks to impose on South Korea, Thailand and Indonesia in the forthcoming months has two threads. The two threads are, firstly, domestic austerity—the aim being to restore the capacity of those countries to repay foreign debt—and, secondly, to seek radical institutional reforms, including further financial liberalisation, essentially freeing up the product, labour and capital markets in each of those countries.</para><para>They then conclude that the crisis that has developed is essentially one of a lack of liquidity—or illiquidity—more than one of 
 insolvency of firms in each of those countries. They say this crisis has occurred because of excessive financial deregulation in allowing banks and firms to borrow abroad without either government control, coordination, supervision or monitoring once those funds have been borrowed. As well as that, they point out laxness or slackness at government level in each of those countries. International banks have largely been unregulated. They have been very happy to provide Asian corporations with large amounts of short-term unhedged dollar loans. The consequences of both of those factors coming together is that, once any company or corporation is pressed to repay loans short term and is unable to do so, others also seek to call in loans and the crisis builds, and builds very quickly.</para><para>So they conclude that the immediate goal is very simple. In terms of the financial markets, provision of capital from international banks and the guarantees from international organisations via the US is simply to restore confidence in international capital markets that existing debts, existing loans and future loans will be repaid as their original terms allowed. They say this requires overcoming collective action problems in which no lender wants to re-finance what others will not and hence suffer a loss. In the short term, they say that demand and liquidity must be increased, not reduced.</para><para>Thurow, in his article, `Asia: the collapse and the cure' makes a number of points about the current problem, likely future problems and what the role of the IMF should be. Thurow argues a number of points. Firstly, he says that the IMF and the major world economies must not allow panic to continue to be almost the sole and dominant theme in financial markets and economic considerations in Asia. Collapses like the current one in Asia are part of the global economy and will continue to be part of economies as domestic economies become internationalised and globalised. He says that a steady response is required, not continued panic that will lead to a continued lack of confidence in the Asian markets and a further run on their currencies.</para><para>Secondly, he says that the primary problem arising from the panic is a lack of liquidity. 
 In such a crisis, normal business practice is forgotten. Short-term loans are not renewed when they normally would be. Suppliers demand up-front cash payment when they would usually wait 90 days. Companies that cannot self-finance themselves maintain repayments out of cashflow and go broke for no good reason.</para><para>Thirdly, he says that the major problem with the IMF approach has been its nation by nation response rather than the required regional response. Its commitment to restoring national austerity is inappropriate when its measures must apply to many countries at one time. The impact of that combined approach is to cut worldwide aggregate demand, as was mentioned in passing by Senator Cook—its effect in a country like Australia. He says in particular that the IMF has not clearly understood the role of increased Chinese exports on the rest of the South-East Asian region.</para><para>Additionally, the IMF has provided a very orthodox approach, as it did with the Mexican crisis. It must be said that, with hindsight, its approach in that crisis was correct. This approach, however, does not recognise that many of the South-East Asian economies have had, do have and will continue to have very high savings levels. For example, South Korea has a 40 per cent national savings rate. Mexico, on the other hand, had appallingly low levels of national savings.</para><para>Fourthly, Thurow stresses that the IMF also needs to recognise that each nation will attempt to solve its problem by increasing exports. The natural result of that will be increased competition, which will lead over time to a devaluation of national currencies which could continue to spiral and create further continuing competitive devaluations. This of course was a major contributor to the Great Depression in the 1930s. He says that the IMF should be the agency through which procedures to certify the accounting of government and large companies are established, speed up the process of the Asian transition to an equity based financial system rather than a debt financing system, and assist Asian nations to develop their growth strategy on a domestic basis.</para><para>He concludes that the IMF must focus on the current crisis and the particular problems it presents rather than simply relying on the old orthodox methods of solving economic problems. Without this type of approach, the Asian crisis will not be resolved and their economies restructured to a satisfactory level.</para><para>Martin Feldstein wrote an article entitled `Refocusing the IMF'. As I said earlier, he is a Professor of Economics at Harvard University, President of the National Bureau of Economic Research and chief adviser to the Department of State in the US. His publication in the <inline font-style="italic">Foreign Affairs Journal</inline> can be interpreted as an emerging different focus within the United States government on the way the crisis in Asia should be handled.</para><para>He argues a number of points. Firstly, the IMF has recently adopted a policy of imposing structural and institutional reforms rather than focusing on balance of payment problems. This has the potential, he says, to create further long-term problems. Secondly, it is important for the IMF to recognise the difference between a lack of liquidity and company insolvency—a recurring theme in all of these articles. This requires two different approaches, certainly in the immediate future. The problem of confusing insolvency with liquidity is that businesses that should be able to finance their debt in the long term end up closing down and making workers redundant because of IMF policies that are inappropriate at that time and for that particular cause. The IMF has gone beyond the key areas of concern, such as large current account deficits. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Debate interrupted.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ADJOURNMENT</title><type>Adjournment</type><page.no>1673</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Patterson)</name></talker><para>—Order!

 of New South Wales, Murray Gleeson, will succeed Sir Gerard Brennan as Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia in May this year. In announcing the appointment, the Prime Minister described Justice Gleeson as a person held in the highest regard for his advocacy skills. The Prime Minister said:</para></talk.start><para>I am sure Mr Justice Gleeson will serve as Chief Justice with great distinction. His experience, skill and superb legal abilities admirably fit him for the task.</para><para>However appropriate these words are, they convey little of Murray Gleeson the man, who has been such a feature of the legal landscape and legal profession in New South Wales for the past 30 years. My own professional contact with Murray began when he was a young and promising barrister lecturing law students at Sydney University law school, me included, on company law that some 20 years later is still in the process of being simplified.</para><para>I had the good fortune to be junior counsel to Murray Gleeson just prior to his appointment as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of New South Wales in an important appellate case, Norwest Beef against Peninsula Navigation Company. In trying to pinpoint the essence of Justice Gleeson's legal brilliance, I believe it is his ability to identify the issues in a case with precision and to develop an attractive legal argument out of the most unpromising case.</para><para>Justice Gleeson's use of metaphor and his ability to excite the interest of the most uninterested judge was legendary. One such case involved a collision between two vessels on Sydney Harbour, where one vessel ran tours and afternoon teas while the other, a trawler and Justice Gleeson's client, was engaged in the more serious business of carrying cargo destined for overseas ports. The three judges of appeal seemed uninterested until Justice Gleeson opened his case. `Your Honours,' he said, `my client's vessel was navigating its way up the harbour when it was run into by a restaurant.' There was instant attention from the bench. He was the master of economical understatement, always accompanied by sardonic wit that fitted him well for his nickname of `Smiler'.</para><para>Murray Gleeson was the ultimate tactician in court. In fact, I am reminded of what his colleague Justice Roddy Meagher QC is reputed to have said of him in the mid-1980s:</para><para>When one visits Gleeson, one passes fishponds wherein piranhas glide between the bones of inefficient solicitors and discarded jurors and arrives eventually at a grey house and ultimately the baleful presence himself.</para><para>Murray Gleeson will be right at home in the High Court, as much of his work at the bar brought him there primarily in the areas of equity, commercial and constitutional law.</para><para>Murray Gleeson was perhaps one of the finest advocates since Sir Garfield Barwick when he made the move from Leader of the Bar in New South Wales to Chief Justice of the Supreme Court in 1988. During a time of great pressure on the courts in New South Wales he has struggled to reconcile the need for change with maintaining the values that have underpinned the administration of justice since the courts' inception. Although it is a futile pastime to try to predict the way in which High Court judges will decide matters, I venture to suggest that Chief Justice Gleeson will continue to find that balance between orthodoxy and pragmatism that has distinguished his work thus far.</para><para>Murray Gleeson is a great believer in the traditional role of the court and has wondered publicly about the High Court's modern reputation for radical decisions. In an article last year he said one reason for this could be the increasing use of litigation to achieve political and social aims and:</para><para>We have long been accustomed to the use of litigation as a weapon in corporate and commercial rivalry, but we are seeing an upsurge in what might be described as the politically and socially aggressive use of litigation.</para><para>Because of his great belief in and commitment to the courts and the judicial system, he is constantly monitoring developments in these areas. In an earlier article he raised the issue in which the increasing demand for the courts to tailor general rules to individual cases might undermine their legitimacy. He pondered that individualised justice could all too easily shade into quasi-legislation.</para><para>No judge has, and no wise judge aspires to, political legitimacy— 
</para><para>he said—</para><para>Judges are unelected and, from most points of view, relatively unaccountable. Their independence and unaccountability are appropriate to the judicial role, but they are inappropriate to a quasi-legislative one.</para><para>He is concerned at the role of the media in the law. In his Earle Page memorial oration at Parliament House last year he reaffirmed the legal values and restated the importance of judicial independence, the separation of powers and the rule of law. But to these principles he added some thoughts on the modern realities, which include the difficulties judges face in administering justice:</para><para>. . . a context of saturation media coverage and highly politicised concern about law and order issues.</para><para>Night after night they—</para><para>the people—</para><para>see on their TV screens victims or relatives of violent crime, telling their stories and being asked whether they are satisfied with the sentences imposed on convicted offenders.</para><para>Talkback radio programs are filled with people expressing feelings of insecurity and demanding ever-increasing severity of penalties.</para><para>To all of this, politicians respond by competing with one another to be seen to be tough on crime.</para><para>As Justice Gleeson pointed out, judges cannot prevent crime; its causes lie in the social and economic conditions of the time.</para><para>Justice Gleeson also has strong views on the adversarial system of justice. Again, in his Earle Page memorial oration he said people tended to overlook the adversarial nature of our whole society.</para><para>Why should conflict and distrust be regarded as the natural order of things—</para><para>he asked—</para><para>It does not assist the people of NSW for the Parliament, the executive and the judiciary to regard each other as adversaries.</para><para>Justice Gleeson will bring to the High Court a distinctive intellect and an intellectual rigour that will see High Court decisions continue to be cited in common law countries. He may also be able to achieve what many have been unable to do successfully in the past: explain to the general public what it is the High Court does and why its role is so important. He 
 went a long way to achieving this in the New South Wales Supreme Court with the appointment of a public information  officer. A similar role for the High Court should not be ruled out.</para><para>The people of Australia will be well served by a Chief Justice of such calibre. I welcome his appointment and congratulate him on it. I also wish Justice Gleeson, his charming wife, Robyn, and their family well for the arduous task that will be ahead of them.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Prime Minister: Declaration of Interest</title><page.no>1675</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>1675</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—John Howard was a director of the Menzies Research Centre from the time he took office as Prime Minister until 15 October 1996, when he surreptitiously resigned.

He retains custody of that document along with those of all other ministers. The Deputy Prime Minister has seen the declaration.</para><para>From this one can draw either of two conclusions: that the Prime Minister failed to declare his directorship in the more detailed form or the Deputy Prime Minister, Tim Fischer, endorsed the Prime Minister's abrogation of his own code of conduct.</para><para>Was it the Secretary to the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, Mr Max Moore-Wilton, who drew this matter to the Prime Minister's attention when he reviewed all the declarations in October 1996? Was he part of the cover-up or was he just embarrassed by the fact that he himself had retained directorships in the Victorian Public Transport Corpo 
 ration and Southern Hydro, positions which attracted fees of some $85,000 per annum?</para><para>The Prime Minister was clearly in breach of his own code of conduct, which states on page 10:</para><para>Ministers are required to resign directorships in public companies . . . </para><para>The Prime Minister says that this matter is trivial because it did not involve any financial return to himself. Tonight on <inline font-style="italic">A Current Affair </inline> he said:</para><para>I wasn't paid anything. I had no personal private interest.</para><para>Let me quote Senator Hill from 4 May 1992, when, in relation to former Senator Richardson, he said:</para><para>It may not be a question of some financial or pecuniary conflict. This is related to registrable interests, not just pecuniary interests. The statement and the standards that the Prime Minister said he stands by require that Ministers disclose other registrable interests so that the public can see that they are not, in dealing with legislation and Cabinet matters, putting themselves in any potential position of conflict.</para><para>I bet Senator Hill is not around at the moment explaining these principles to the Prime Minister. I suspect that he is on the first plane to Paris. So what is good for the Prime Minister apparently was not good for former Senator Richardson.</para><para>Let us look at what John Howard had to say in a question that he asked on 30 April 1992. He said:</para><para>Is it not, therefore, the case that unless the Parliament is satisfactorily assured that Senator Richardson either disclosed his interest as a director of the radio station whenever he participated in Cabinet discussions or decisions on broadcasting matters—and not just those relating to licence fees, but all broadcasting matters—or, alternatively, absented himself from those discussions, he must, in accordance with accepted Cabinet practice, resign from the Ministry and in default you ought to remove him.</para><para>On those grounds, and out of his own mouth, the Prime Minister should resign. In the portfolio budget statements of 1997-98 the following item appears:</para><para>Funding for the Menzies Research Centre and the Herbert Vere Evatt Memorial Foundation. 
</para><para>An amount of $100,000 is allocated to the Menzies Research Centre in each year from 1997 to 2001.

We ask: did John Howard exclude himself when this decision was taken? If not, John Howard, director of the Menzies Research Centre, is present when they make a decision to enrich the foundation to the tune of $400,000 over four years.</para><para>The death sentence which John Howard so gleefully pronounced on former Senator Richardson has come back to haunt him. If in fact the Prime Minister did absent himself, the cabinet note-takers will have noted that. By that very action, the Prime Minister admits a conflict of interest situation and condemns himself for not declaring this directorship in his declaration to the House of Representatives.</para><para>Isn't the timing interesting? The critical cabinet decision is made a mere two weeks before Senator Short hits the fence and before Senator Gibson taps the mat but John Howard, Prime Minister, softly softly, resigns his directorship.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Salinity</title><title>Duck Hunting</title><page.no>1676</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>1676</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise tonight to speak about a very serious environmental problem affecting much of Australia. I refer to the salination of agricultural land. The <inline font-style="italic">Weekend Australian</inline>  magazine of 21 March featured an article by Nicholas Rothwell which I recommend to senators as a very useful on-the-ground account of how European agricultural prac 
 tices, particularly tree clearing and irrigation, have already destroyed so much farmland in Australia. I think we can all say that much of this was done in ignorance, and indeed, on the instruction of government agencies, so it is not a question of attaching blame for past practices.</para></talk.start><para>However, the article points to a paper entitled `The increase of salt in soil and streams following the destruction of the native vegetation' that was presented to the Royal Society of Western Australia, published by them in 1924 and, of course, promptly ignored. Land clearing continued from that time and is still under way today. We are irrigating more pastures and crops than ever before and although there is much good work under way in the landcare movement, the message has not got through, either to many farmers or to the government. This article tell us where the salt comes from. It says:</para><para>Billions of years ago, the rocks that made up Australia lay beneath primeval ocean. Thrust up, they formed the oldest continent, and were swept for hundreds of millennia, by salt-bearing winds.</para><para>Australia's stone base is impregnated with this ancient salt spray. It has always lain there, far beneath the zone of native vegetation—those thick grasses, under-storey shrubs and wide-spaced trees that European settlers first saw and wondered at 200 years ago, and found very like the gracious parklands of a country estate.</para><para>Over the next few decades, the most sustained land-clearance effort in history took place. Trees were ringbarked, dragged, uprooted—perhaps 18 billion of them in the Murray-Darling Basin alone.</para><para>The new plants began using water in new, less efficient ways. Rain poured into the ground and down to the salt-rich water table 20 or 50 meters below. Undetected, relentless, the water began rising 50cm a year or more.</para><para>The water table, across much of the nation's farmland, is within one or two metres of the surface. At dips in the land, along water courses, wherever you see bare soil patches, reeds and rushes, stunted or dying trees or their white trunked skeletons, there you have it evaporating, concentrating; the salt of Gondwana. Dryland salinity.</para><para>The same weekend as that was published I was visiting Terang to witness the opening of the duck shooting season at a place called Lake Murphy. This barbaric practice of duck shooting—now banned, I might say, in Western Australia and New South Wales—is one 
 in which wildlife is killed and injured, and it is done in the name of sport. As usual, numerous protected species were killed and birds of many types were injured.</para><para>One of the brave band of rescuers in a kayak brought in a grey teal duck whilst I was there and I took it up to the vet. It was still alive but one of its eyes had been shot out and it had lead shot lodged in its underside. The vet treated this and the many other injured birds there on that day. There were coots, swans and numerous other water birds.</para><para>I would like to acknowledge tonight the work of the tireless Mr Laurie Levy and many others involved in challenging this practice of shooting ducks. These people rightly argue that this is a dangerous, cruel and totally inappropriate activity which should now be banned. Shooter numbers were down this year, as were the ducks. In fact, the shooters were quite strongly outnumbered by the protesters, police, the state Department of Natural Resources and Environment, the RSPCA and the media. The Democrats hope that this is a dying sport which will now give way to tourism, which can at least celebrate and protect our native water birds.</para><para>As most in the Senate will be aware, Victoria is extremely dry at present and there is very little water around at all. Lake Murphy is called a wetland and, indeed, it did have an expanse of water across its surface. Water was especially diverted for this purpose to fill Lake Murphy so that the duck season could take place. Otherwise, it would have been dry, as in most summers.</para><para>When I think of wetlands, I think of landscape teeming with wildlife and lush vegetation. Lake Murphy, however, is anything but that. Lake Murphy looks like a moonscape. It has become salty and is largely dead. Salt marsh vegetation has emerged around its shores and the lake is dotted with hundreds of silver-grey trunks of dead red river gums. Lake Murphy is surrounded too by farmland—wide brown paddocks grazed to dust and almost completely treeless as far as the eye can see. This is not an unusual sight around the area of Terang, nor in other parts of Victoria. Nicholas Rothwell, in his article, talks to a farmer and pioneer of the landcare 
 movement south-east of Terang at Benalla who says:</para><para>A lot of land should be taken out of agriculture. If not, we'll continue to see the demise of our land and water systems, and of rural communities. I think we have a moral duty as a nation to not stand by and to see the land destroyed. From my point of view, it's a human philosophy thing. If it doesn't matter, nothing matters.</para><para>These, I thought, were very poignant words and a message that must be taken to heart. Nothing should be done by this government to exacerbate this terrible problem. The article quotes another farmer near the Grampians. He says:</para><para>I was only two years old when my family arrived here in 1946. It wasn't then recognised that the water table had risen 15 meters since white invasion and the clearing of the trees and that 10 per cent of the land was affected by salinity. They used to ringbark the trees for 10 pence each in the thirties. The best of them had been cleared earlier by timber millers for use as railway sleepers.</para><para>This farmer has now planted out 12 per cent of his land in trees, 65,000 of them. The salting and erosion have become significantly lower. He says the land is now more productive.

When the newest recruit scrambled on board, Mr Beazley was even more definitive. He said that the Labor Party is doing the fresh thinking, developing the ideas to see Australia into the next millennium. This new recruit, this self-professed serious policy advocate, agreed. In fact, she foreshadowed a major policy rethink for the ALP. So how is this new party that is heavy on policy—the one doing the fresh 
 thinking and preparing for the new millennium—faring?</para></talk.start><para>Australian voters know this party as the one whose policies delivered the $10 billion black hole deficit that we have spent the last 2½ years repairing. But how can we be sure that this party is remaking itself? Where are the policies to prove the new policy ideas, and who has asked the questions in this place to substantiate the ALP's claims to this new policy beginning? Who in the opposition in this chamber has asked the policy questions, and how have the shadow ministers in this place been reflecting this refreshed and refashioned policy, this new Labor?</para><para>A policy stocktake on a sample of shadow ministers is particularly instructive. Senator Peter Cook is the shadow minister for commerce and small business, and he represents the policy of trade, a portfolio he has always considered especially important, and I agree with him. In fact, in opposition he described his policy area as being the key to rebuilding Australia's export culture. So you might ask: where is the evidence of this continuing focus on trade policy in government or even on commerce and small business? The search is on.</para><para>When I completed my policy stocktake of this year's question time last week, I saw that Senator Cook, the shadow minister for commerce and small business, also representing the trade portfolio, had asked just one question in these areas. It was, quite properly, on the Asian financial crisis. But I hasten to add that Senator Cook has also asked 12 other questions: 10 of them muckrakers out of the Labor Party muckraking bucket, nine of them against the Minister for Resources and Energy (Senator Parer), and one wanting money for a project in the electorate of the former Prime Minister, a question he asked from the natural heritage bucket of Labor muck. This is a shadow minister with his portfolio clearly in focus.</para><para>Senator Chris Schacht was an enthusiastic minister for small business, a portfolio he then described as of absolute importance to the community.

 portfolio that he now represents in communications? At the conclusion of my policy stocktake on Friday, I found that Senator Schacht had asked just one question all year on his portfolio area. Now this is a shadow minister with a policy focus.</para><para>The Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Faulkner, was previously minister for the environment, a policy area he described as having very great significance for the future of Australia.

Senator Faulkner's seven questions on the Natural Heritage Trust were nothing more than a cheap opportunity to sledge the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) and the Baillieu family in a desperate attempt to reincarnate the Ros Kelly memorial white board of sports rorts fame. There has not been a single question on the real environment issue—just mud and muck—and there has been no apology to the Baillieu family either.</para><para>In fact, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Hill, who now holds the environment portfolio, and who does a thoroughly competent job at it, would be happy to tell any of you in opposition how he is restoring the environment if only you would ask him just one policy question. But, again, Senator Faulkner has not asked one policy question on his shadow portfolio of public administration and government services. The sharp policy focus continues.</para><para>According to my stocktake, 48 questions out of a total of 74 that have been asked this year have done no more than muckrake—disgraceful sledging and slamming of individuals and their families. Listen to this record: on the issues that concern Australia— 
the real issues, as Mr Beazley describes them—there has been one question on taxation, one question on nursing homes, one question on regional Australia, and one question on trade and exports. It is a disgraceful policy vacuum in the Australian Labor Party.</para><para>There are plenty of policy issues we would be happy to explore in question time—the economy, interest rates, care of the aged, child care, even tax reform. We would be happy to explore reform now under way on the waterfront, which, interestingly enough, Archbishop Tutu opposes, but the Australian Labor Party is still searching for the courage to agree that waterfront reform is one of this country's highest priorities. In fact, I must be truthful and say that there has been a question on waterfront reform: one from a backbencher, Senator Kerry O'Brien. But, just when you think there might be a bit of policy on the way, guess what? The old bucket of Labor muck is at work again. This time the question was directed at a Canberra consultant who had done some work for the government.</para><para>Frontbenchers and shadow ministers have been strangely silent on the waterfront. Mr Beazley's major policy announcement has been to advocate the return of the old silver bodgie himself—R.J. Hawke. Now there is a giant policy leap right back to the seventies. So not much policy development seems to be under way in the Australian Labor Party, and the evidence to support Mr Beazley's changing face is strangely missing. In fact, new Labor under Mr Beazley looks pretty much like old Labor, the government that this country suffered under for 13 years. The Australian Labor Party is where it belongs—over on the opposition benches. Without a policy feather to fly with, that is where it will stay.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Prime Minister: Declaration of Interest</title><page.no>1679</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>1679</page.no><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator ROBERT RAY</name><name.id>UI4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Senator Faulkner tonight outlined what he saw as a conflict of interest by the Prime Minister.

Thank you for that.</para></talk.start></continue><para>But having put in the guidelines on 30 April 1996—which, basically, were just a collation of the previous government handbook and one or two pieces of correspondence—the Prime Minister ever since has failed to observe them. Let us consider the circumstances regarding Senator Short. When issues were raised in this place about conflict of interest concerning Senator Short, the Prime Minister of course vigorously defended him until the smoking gun was found, and then accepted his resignation.</para><para>The Prime Minister also accepted the resignation of Senator Gibson—a fact I still reflect on as not being a justifiable acceptance. When I reflect back on all this and look at the circumstances when Senator Gibson resigned and the subsequent events, I do not think he was required to resign; and I think he was treated very shabbily and badly at the time. When Mr Prosser came up with his difficulties, the Prime Minister held on to him for weeks at a time.</para><para>Time and time again, the Prime Minister has rewritten the guide. But I could not understand why the Prime Minister was not enforcing his guide in the last few weeks. Why didn't he? Suddenly, we find out that the Prime Minister of Australia was a director of a public company from the time he was elected right through until 15 October 1996. By going through the record, we also find out 
 that the definitions of what constitutes a `conflict of interest'—as espoused by Senator Hill, and Mr Howard in 1992—lead one to the conclusion that, if they were to apply the criteria they applied to the Keating government, Mr Howard himself would have to go.</para><para>But I can understand it is possible that the Prime Minister may just have forgotten he was a director of a company. That is a possibility—that he may have forgotten that, in the same way as Senator Richardson may have forgotten  it. But do I point out that, from within six days of Senator Richardson becoming the minister for communications, he had resigned that position without there being any public comment on it at that stage. So, as soon as was possible, former Senator Richardson made arrangements to divest himself of the directorship of a particular radio station.</para><para>But not Mr Howard. He stays as director for six months. Exactly 14 days before he resigns, he chairs a cabinet meeting in Perth that enriches that research centre by $400,000 over the next four years. Mr Howard does not indicate then or now that he absented himself from the room. And you can bet that the cabinet note takers, who take detailed notes, would not have recorded him as being absent from the room. What bigger conflict of interest can you get than being a director of a public company to which cabinet makes a conscious decision to allocate money? What bigger conflict of interest could you get than that?</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>C16</name.id><name role="metadata">HEFFERNAN</name><name role="display">Senator Heffernan</name></talker><para>—The Evatt Foundation.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>UI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator ROBERT RAY</name></talker><para>—Poor old Senator Heffernan in his befuddled way talks about the Evatt Foundation.

How is that not a conflict of interest?</para></talk.start></continue><para>But if you want to have a look at guilt, Senator Heffernan and others, look at the circumstances in which Mr John Howard left the directorship; have a look at the circumstances. He had a press conference on 16 October where he discussed conflict of interest. He had a press conference on 16 October and discusses conflict of interest—but he omits one thing at the press conference. He omits to say that one day before he has deleted a directorship. What a sneaky way of doing it.</para><para>I would have at least a little admiration for a Prime Minister who, on 16 October 1996, had come in and said, `Look, I made a mistake. Unfortunately, I've overlooked a directorship; I've now rectified that.' But he does not do that. He keeps it hidden. No-one knows about it. He gets Tony Staley three days later to officially process his resignation from this particular directorship. No announcement; total concealment. He would have got away with it, but for the cabinet decision 14 days before, when the cabinet of this country granted his particular organisation $400,000 over the next four years—a clear stark conflict of interest.

In NSW it is 5 million, 600,000 in SA, 
 74,000 in Qld and there are no figures for the other states. Two weeks ago I travelled to Wodonga, Albury and up into NSW to Holbrook and surrounding areas. I was shown some of the work of the Landcare movement and some of its failures too.</para><para>Hundreds of thousands of trees in this region are dying. This remnant vegetation is showing the telltale signs of dieback. Dead branches sticking up beyond the straggly foliage. I am told that these trees have only a few years left. The reasons for their dieback are complex. They are attacked by insects because there are not the native birds to keep the insects under control. These trees have been isolated from one another which affects the nesting habits of some of our birds. Miners take hold in such trees and exclude other birds.</para><para>I am told by a biologist that the only way to save these trees is to fence them off, encourage undergrowth of shrubs and to allow seedlings to emerge. Biodiversity comes not from a row of newly planted seedlings or a single ancient tree grazed up to its trunk, but from vegetation which is diverse in species and in age.</para><para>Victoria recently decided to allow large remnant trees to be removed provided they were replaced by 10 new trees. This is an absurd concept. Even if they survive, it will be decades before they could do the work of one large tree.</para><para>I saw streams at Holbrook which would have been dry but for the salt water seeping out into seriously eroded creekbeds. Water courses in this area have still not been fenced off. Where animals are able to graze up to the water's edge, the vegetation can no longer hold the soil. We have known about these principles for decades and yet still waterways are unprotected.</para><para>My reason for raising this issue tonight is to point out again to the Government that we have begun to solve the problem but we are still not doing the most obvious work to stop it getting worse. The Natural Heritage Trust Fund is assisting with a small number of fencing projects but the point is that we now risk doing exactly the same thing on pastoral leases.</para><para>The Native Title Amendment Bill has been criticised by the National Biodiversity Council because it allows the states to by-pass Native Title and allows for the upgrade of pastoral leases. It allows pastoral leases to be upgraded for cotton or rice growing or other crops and this land is, by and large, much more vulnerable than Kerang or Holbrook ever was. This land must be carefully managed and it is the role of the States and the Federal Government to see that this happens.</para><para>This week my office received a copy of a letter to the Minister from Dr Tim Flannery, author of <inline font-style="italic">The Future Eaters, </inline> and whose work Senator Minchin 
 said he admired. Dr Flannery says he shares the concerns of the National Biodiversity Council about changes to land use and the impact this will have on Australia' s biodiversity.</para><para>He says "I am concerned that the Native Title Amendment Bill, in making it easier to expand the range of land uses, will almost inevitably lead to that further degradation. He said to the Minister, "I urge you to carefully consider the implications for Australia's biodiversity that arise from the Native Title Amendment Bill."</para><para>I will of course raise this issue when we again go into committee this week on this legislation but in the meantime, I think it is important that we reflect on the damage already done to our land and take all necessary steps to prevent further damage. Native Title acts effectively as a safeguard against that—another protection against unwise, outmoded farming practices in this country.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><adjournment><adjournmentinfo><time.stamp>22:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>1682</page.no></adjournmentinfo><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senate adjourned at 10.29 p.m.</inline></para></adjournment><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>1682</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tabling</title><page.no>1682</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following government documents were tabled:</para><para>Equal Employment Opportunity (Commonwealth Authorities) Act—Equal employment opportunity program—Australian National Railways Commission (Australian National)—Report for 1996-97.</para><para></para><para>Higher education funding for the 1998-2000 triennium—Report by the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs.</para><para>Telecommunications Act 1991—Australian Competition and Consumer Commission—Telstra carrier charges price control compliance 1996, February 1998.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tabling</title><page.no>1682</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following documents were tabled by the Clerk:</para><para>Australian Bureau of Statistics Act—Proposal No. 3 of 1998.</para><para>Broadcasting Services Act—Broadcasting Services (Events) Notice No. 1 of 1994—Amendments Nos 1-3 of 1998.</para><para>Defence Act—Determinations under section 58B—Defence Determinations 1998/11-1998/13.</para><para>Social Security Act—Child Disability Assessment Determination 1998.</para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>PROCLAMATIONS</title><type>Proclamations</type><page.no>1682</page.no></debateinfo><para>A proclamation by His Excellency the Governor-General was tabled, notifying that he had proclaimed the following provisions of an Act to come into operation on the date specified:</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Family and Other Measures) Act 1997</inline> —Items 1, 2 and 4 of Schedule 16—1 April 1998 (<inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline>  No. S 112, 19 March 1998).</para><para></para></debate></chamber.xscript><answers.to.questions><debate><debateinfo><type>Answers to Questions on Notice</type><title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title><page.no>1683</page.no></debateinfo><para>The following answers to questions were circulated:</para><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Department of Health and Family Services: Programs and Grants</title><page.no>1683</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 798)</subtitle><id.no>798</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>1683</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'Brien</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Family Services, upon notice, on 2 September 1997:</para></talk.start><para>(1) (a) What programs and/or grants administered by the portfolio provide assistance to people living in the following federal electorates: Bass, Denison, Franklin, Lyons and Braddon and (b) what was the level of funding provided through the programs or grants to each electorate for each of the 1994-95, 1995-96, 1996-97 financial years; and (c) what level of funding was budgeted for in each program or grant to each electorate for the 1997-98 financial year.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>1683</page.no><name role="metadata">Herron, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator Herron</name><name.id>VW4</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Minister for Health and Family Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><para>(1) (a) The Department of Health and Family Services produces an annual set of Electorate Profiles which provides an overview of the Department's service delivery activity, for which information is available, in each of the federal electorates.
