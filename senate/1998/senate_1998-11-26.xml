On 12 March 1998 the Senate Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts Legislation Committee presented its report on the National Environment Protection Measures (Implementation) Bill. The proroguing of Parliament on 31 August 1998 resulted in all previous action in relation to this Bill lapsing, with the result that Bill has been re-introduced.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Description</inline></para><para>This Act will fulfil the Commonwealth's obligation to implement NEPMs passed by the National Environment Protection Council to all Commonwealth activities within the States and Territories. This Commonwealth obligation is set out in Schedule 4 of the Intergovernmental Agreement on the Environment 1992 and section 7 of the National Environment Protection Council Act 1994.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Reason for Urgency</inline></para><para>State and Territory Governments have been pressuring the Environment and Heritage Minister to introduce this bill as soon as possible. The Commonwealth is the only jurisdiction not to have introduced legislation required by the National Environment Protection Council Act 1994. This Act requires that each state and territory take steps to secure the passage of legislation made under the aegis of the Act through separate implementation legislation.</para><para>Three National Environment Protection Measures (NEPMs) have now been made. These are the National Pollutant Inventory NEPM, the Ambient Air Quality NEPM and the Movement of Controlled Waste Between States and territories NEPM. It is essential for the bill to be fully operation to allow necessary establishment and finalisation of administrative arrangements within the Commonwealth, and for negotiation with the States and Territories, to permit implementation within the Commonwealth of the three National Environment Protection Measures now made.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Complementary State Legislation</inline></para><para>ACT: The National Environment Protection Council (ACT) Act 1994</para><para>NT: The National Environment Protection Council (NT) Act 1994</para><para>QLD: The National Environment Protection Council (QLD) Act 1994

</para><para>Dear Mr Allen</para><para>I refer to our discussions with you and your colleagues on Thursday, 24 September 1998. At that meeting we, on behalf of the Government, made a number of undertakings regarding consultation and the finalisation of the Government's taxation policy. As agreed, this letter puts those undertakings in writing.</para><para>May we begin by acknowledging the MTAA's constructive approach to our negotiations. In particular, we note that at the meeting the MTAA supported the need for taxation reform and acknowledged the overall benefits of the Government's plan for the Australian community.</para><para>For its part, the Government acknowledged three particular issues raised by the MTAA at the meeting:</para><para>The potential transitional problems faced by the MTAA's members in the lead-up to the abolition of the wholesale sales tax (WST) and the introduction of the goods and services tax (GST). The MTAA are concerned that in the lead-up to the introduction of the GST they will face transitional costs that need to be accounted for in the Government's tax plan.</para><para>In addition, the MTAA stated that under the existing WST they operate under arrangements, agreed with the Taxation Commissioner, that account for the timing of the payment of WST. Under the taxation plan no similar agreement has been proposed for the collection of GST on motor vehicle sales.</para><para>The MTAA are concerned about the impact of GST on the used car market. They have raised concerns about the <inline font-style="italic">margin system</inline>  of taxation being proposed by the Government. They are also concerned about the relative impact of the GST on used car dealerships vis a vis private sales of vehicles.</para><para>In response to these concerns, the Government stated at the meeting that it is prepared to enter into a process of consultation with the MTAA to address these concerns. In doing so the Government stated at the meeting that its objective was to ensure the livelihood of motor vehicle dealers. It would seek to develop a practical transition arrangement that would address the concerns about the crossover from the WST system to the GST system. Further, the Government would seek ways to address the cash flow benefit issue raised by the industry.</para><para>The Government also recognised that the impact of the transition issues would become of immediate importance to the industry as from the re-election of the Government on 3 October. Therefore the issues at hand, including the cash flow issue, will need to be dealt with expeditiously. The Government stated that a meeting between the Treasurer 
 and the MTAA would be held within a fortnight of the election result. The meeting will be preceded by a meeting between the MTAA and Treasury officials.</para><para>With respect to the impact of GST on the used car sector, the Government said it would consider an alternative to applying the <inline font-style="italic">margin system</inline>  to calculate GST due. The Government noted that the Cole Committee report into the 1993 GST proposal of the Coalition recommended that notional input credits be paid on the purchase of a used car from non-registered members of the public (eg private citizens). This is also the system that applies in New Zealand. The Government thinks that this system may have merit and will give favourable consideration to it in the finalisation of the Government's taxation legislation after the election.</para><para>The Government also noted that the MTAA had raised the option of marginally increasing the stamp duty paid on private transactions of used cars as an offset to the fact that registered dealers would have to charge GST while private sellers would not. This matter could be raised by the MTAA with State </para><para></para><para>Governments (who levy the stamp duty). The Federal Government believes one option would be for State Governments to reduce stamp duty on used cars sold by registered dealers.</para><para>The MTAA has also raised a number of other issues with the Government. These include the impact on small service stations of the Government's petroleum industry reforms. The Government will continue its discussions with the MTAA on these matters. However, the Government is prepared to refer the legislation dealing with the repeal of the relevant petroleum legislation to a Senate legislation committee.</para><para>As discussed at the meeting we are quite happy for this letter to be made public and in fact urge you to copy it to all your members.</para><para>Yours sincerely</para><para>PETER REITH</para><para>(Minister for Workplace Relations</para><para>and Small Business)</para><para>JOHN MOORE</para><para>(Minister for Industry, Tourism</para><para>and Science)</para><para></para><table pgwide="1" border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><tgroup><thead><row><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para></para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para></para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para></para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para></para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para></para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para></para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para></para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para></para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para></para></entry></row><row><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>Name</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>Contact</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>Address</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>Salutation</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>Contact

The opposition will not oppose this motion when it comes before the Senate. I do, however, want to place on record some substantive concerns about the way the legislative program is being managed by the government. The government released its program for parliamentary sittings on 16 October. The extra week was described as an `if required' week. The opposition accepts that that is the case. A mere 11 sitting days were placed in the sittings program plus this extra `if required' week.</para></talk.start><para>It was absolutely unrealistic of the government to expect the Senate to process the huge number of bills it wanted the Senate to deal with. Senator Hill, after all, publicly indicated that there was a backlog of some 80 bills that, in his view, needed to be dealt with by Christmas. It was unrealistic to expect that 
 number of bills to be dealt with even in 15 days, let alone 11.</para><para>It is also true to say that the government had an opportunity to include this extra sitting week in the original sittings program. That could have been moved in the motion that went before the chamber two weeks ago. I assumed the Manager of Government Business would tell us that the government was going to assess progress with the legislation program before making a decision whether this extra sitting week was required. There has been a huge dose of lack of realism in relation to this particular matter.</para><para>But there are more substantive issues that I want to concentrate on very briefly. I do hope that the government takes some of these comments seriously and does try to address them. You cannot really expect the chamber—whether it be the opposition, the minor parties or Senator Harradine—to cooperate fully with the government if the government continues to handle its programming in the way it has been. It is becoming absolutely impossible in this chamber to prepare for legislation. Forward legislation programs have gone past being an endangered species now—they are actually extinct.</para><para> All we get these days is a document called a `draft legislation program' for a sitting period which consists of an impossibly inflated wish list of bills. It is distributed within just days of the commencement of the Senate sittings and it does not give senators an opportunity to understand the order in which the government proposes to bring on bills. There is no indication of that in the draft legislation program. So it is of no assistance to the chamber and senators in determining what the priorities are for the examination of bills. It makes it extremely difficult from the opposition's perspective—I do not know about the minor parties and Senator Harradine—as far as its internal processes are concerned in preparing draft submissions for the shadow cabinet, for caucus and so forth.</para><para>I remind senators that we received the draft legislation program for the 1998 autumn sittings, which began on 2 March, on 23 February. That was a list of 98 bills, 10 days in advance of the sittings. We received the 
 draft legislation program for the winter sittings, which began on 12 May, on 4 May. That was a list of 18 bills, minus budget related legislation, just eight days before the commencement of sittings. We received the draft program for the current spring sittings—a list of 27 bills—on 10 November, the same day that the sittings began.</para><para>It is important to remember that this draft program does not even contain or provide an indication of the order in which bills are going to be brought on. For the current sittings we have simply been given a list of 27 bills which are proposed for debate. The earliest indication you get of the proposed order for debate in the chamber is usually on the Friday before a sitting week. I say very seriously to the government and other senators in the chamber that this is increasingly becoming a very serious problem. It is not a surprise in those circumstances that an increasing number of bills are being referred to legislation committees.</para><para>As an opposition, we do need time to examine legislation and, just like the government has, we have internal party processes which we expedite but which are important to the proper functioning of the opposition and I think important to the proper functioning of this place. We are entitled to take legislation through our internal party processes. So the government cannot complain about delays if there is not this level of information, if there are not clear indications, well in advance of parliamentary sittings, of the order in which the government proposes to bring bills on for debate in this place. Let me say again that the opposition has very limited resources to scrutinise legislation. If the government expects and wants the opposition to meet the government's priorities, the government has an obligation and a responsibility to get its act together, work out these priorities and—this is my point—share these priorities with other parties in the chamber. It needs to do it much sooner than is occurring with current practice.</para><para>I want to make this substantive point for the government to consider. I know that the Parliamentary Library is experiencing the same sorts of problems—as you may well know, Madam President, given your responsi 
 bilities—in preparing the <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digests</inline>. The government would know from their many years in opposition that these are an invaluable tool for senators in scrutinising legislation. The Library cannot possibly prepare 27 <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digests</inline> in just a matter of days. They also need assistance in prioritising their work. I think it is in the government's interest, as much as it is in the interest of the opposition, minor parties and Senator Harradine, for that level of assistance to be given. Given that the opposition has these difficulties in keeping up with the legislation program in these circumstances with our resources, I assume that others in the chamber have similar problems, if not more difficulties, in keeping up.</para><para>In the spirit of this contribution, I am not suggesting that when the Labor Party was in government our record on these matters was perfect, but I do draw the government's attention to the fact that we did circulate forward programs that indicated not only the legislation that we were proposing for sittings but also the order in which it was proposed to bring it on for debate in the chamber. I draw the government's attention to the commitment that we gave in 1993 to circulate that sort of program at least four weeks in advance of a sitting period. I can say, as the then Manager of Government Business, that we honoured that commitment for the remainder of the period that we were in government. I think it is a good practice and a useful practice for all senators, including the government, and I urge the government to revive that practice. I also suggest that forward programs which are issued by the government ought to be published on the Internet so that they can be made immediately available to interested parties, whether it be senators, the Parliamentary Library, members of the public or interest groups and the like.</para><para>The opposition will support the motion that will soon be before the chair. We do not understand why the government could not have anticipated this need and made the necessary adjustments previously, but I suspect that is just another example of the problem that we face. It is symptomatic of the fact that there has been an absence of forward planning on behalf of the government. I 
 believe that this is something the government needs to seriously address if we are to improve the approach to handling legislation in this chamber, for which the government has responsibility. If the government expects the cooperation of non-government senators in this chamber for the remainder of this parliament, I ask them to take on board very seriously these issues, particularly the constructive suggestions that I have made today on behalf of the opposition.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>706</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I appreciate the advice the former Manager of Government Business has given us.

I think even Senator Faulkner would recognise that slightly unusual circumstances occur after an election where you do have a whole range of bills, many of which are on the program now, which have got to a certain stage in the Senate before an election but which, because of the prorogation of the parliament, have to go back to the House of Representatives. Even though some people in this place may argue that there is a more efficient route to go, the government has taken the decision that the proper course within our democracy is to see those bills basically start their life again in the House of Representatives and find their way here.</para><para>The reality in relation to this Senate program at the moment is that all of the pieces of legislation that we were dealing with last week, and will deal with this week and next week, were before the previous parliament, with a couple of important exceptions: the  Space Activities Bill 1998 , which I expect we will be getting onto shortly, and the  Wool International Amendment Bill 1998 —and there may be another one that I have missed.

At the time the Telecommunications Act 1997 was introduced it was planned to have similar arrangements in place through the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Bill 1998. Delays in introducing that bill due to the complexity of drafting involved now means that from 1 January 1999 the telecommunications carriers will no longer be under an obligation to satisfy the Environmental Secretary (the Secretary to the Department of Environment and Heritage) about activities they propose to undertake which have an environmental significance. The Commonwealth will have no powers to regulate relevant matters of Commonwealth environmental interest.</para><para>The current bill therefore proposes that the Telecommunications Act 1997 be amended to provide for the environmental impact requirements placed on carriers proposing to install facilities prior to 1 January 1999 to extend beyond that date. The need for the current clause will then be reviewed in the context of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Bill 1998 and related bills.</para><para>1998 BUDGET MEASURES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SOCIAL SECURITY AND VETERANS' ENTITLEMENTS) BILL 1998</para><para>Madam President, this bill gives effect to a number of measures announced in the Government's 1998 Budget that will assist in more effective and efficient social security administration.</para><para>First, more assistance will be provided to self funded retirees through the extension of the seniors health card. This will be achieved by simplifying the application process and by applying more generous income limits. The income test that applies to the seniors health card will, in future, be based on taxable income. Retirees will, in most cases, be able to demonstrate their taxable income by simply providing their latest income tax assessment notice. In addition, the present income levels will be almost doubled, from $21,320 to $40,000 for a single person, and from $35,620 to $67,000 for a couple. It is estimated that 222,000 retirees will benefit from this measure. 
</para><para>Madam President, the sharer's rule relating to rent assistance was introduced in the 1996 Budget in recognition of the fact that people who live in shared or group accommodation derive economies of scale from that arrangement. The rule operates by reducing the maximum rate of rent assistance payable for single people, without dependent children, who share accommodation to two thirds of that payable to non-sharing single people.</para><para>As part of its 1998 Budget, the Government announced that recipients of rent assistance who are lodging in commercial board and lodging type accommodation would be exempted from the operation of the sharer's rule. The exemption recognises that people living in this type of accommodation are in a different situation from those who share accommodation in private residential group houses. This bill gives effect to that announcement and is estimated to benefit 12,000 recipients.</para><para>Madam President, two further measures announced in the 1998 Budget and dealt with in this bill illustrate the Government's recognition of the important role played by foster carers in helping young people.</para><para>From 1 July 1999, a health care card will be issued to the fostered child of carers who receive family allowance at less than the maximum rate in respect of the child, provided that the foster child was eligible for a pensioner concession card or a health care card as a member of their original family. This measure will benefit the carers of approximately 4,400 foster children.</para><para>Further, from 1 September 1999, the 12-month waiting period for parenting payment for single foster carers will be removed, benefiting around 900 single foster carers.</para><para>Madam President, I commend the bill to the Senate.</para><para>Ordered that further consideration of the second reading speech of this bill be adjourned till fourteen days after today, in accordance with standing order 111.</para><para>Ordered that these bills be listed on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline> as separate orders of the day.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>712</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Finance and Public Administration References Committee</title><page.no>712</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Reference</title><page.no>712</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:25:00</time.stamp><page.no>712</page.no><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator ROBERT RAY</name><name.id>UI4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On behalf of Senator Gibbs, I move:</para></talk.start><para>That the following matters be referred to the Finance and Public Administration References Committee for inquiry and report by 31 March 1999:

 let by the Department of Social Security to benchmark and evaluate the government's campaign to promote the new youth allowance. The department of finance reported through their lead brokers in the partial sale of Telstra that they spent a grand total of $460,035, in two bites, to conduct qualitative research into the attitude of shareholders and Telstra staff, amongst others. The original budget for this research was $200,000.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Environment Australia, through a consultant—a former staffer for John Hewson and Andrew Peacock and also a Liberal Party operative, Jane Seaborn—paid Mark Textor, from the Australasian Research Strategies Proprietary Limited, the sum of $7,541 for focus group research regarding the Natural Heritage Trust.</para><para>The Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs allocated $184,850 to a research company for a mixture of quantitative and qualitative research in the preparation of the anti-racism kits for schools. A developmental research concept testing and tracking polling for an information campaign for the Office of the Employment Advocate is budgeted up to $300,000.</para><para>These are just six contracts of the 78 recorded by OGIA. The total expenditure is massive and the government must be forced to give parliament accurate figures as to the total expenditure.</para><para>The extent of the government's reliance on market research techniques is not surprising. They have learned the hard way not to ignore the merits of qualitative research. During their first term, they were twice saved from going ahead with potentially disastrous advertising campaigns because of qualitative research employed to test their effectiveness. In both cases the advertising campaigns were cobbled together by the Liberal Party apparatchiks, whose employment clearly owed more to political debts of gratitude than to any expertise in the field.</para><para>It was revealed in September 1996 that qualitative researchers Elliott and Shanahan had reported to the government that the forthcoming guns buyback campaign, proposed by DDB Needham with the theme of `Bite the bullet', was overwhelmingly rejected 
 by focus group participants. They found that it generated considerable anger, that it would lead to non-compliance, and that it presented a message in a way which suggested that the government was dictatorial—`We are coming to get you.' The researchers found that it was the worst of all proposals.</para><para>However, it did not stop the ministerial council, via a blatant political fix, allocating the contract to DDB Needham as a reward for services rendered by key operatives in the previous federal election campaign. This research resulted in DDB Needham changing strategy. The campaign that finally emerged was dull, ineffective and, basically, a waste of taxpayers' money. But, thanks to market testing, it was at least no longer insulting, offensive and counterproductive.</para><para>In January this year, yet another PR disaster was narrowly averted. The Prime Minister's office, in disarray over native title, proposed to cabinet a massive advertising campaign to push the government's position on the Wik issue. Drafted by self-appointed advertising experts in the Prime Minister's office, the proposed advertisements were, at the last minute, sent for market testing.</para><para>The results of that testing were damning in the extreme. This report showed that, one, the ads tested poorly across all demographics. Secondly, the reaction to the ads ranged from outright disgust to apathy, with respondents commenting that they were alarmist, racist and corrupt. Thirdly, far from reinforcing the desired message, the ads would have actually damaged the government's position.</para><para>Now the government—exposed by the opposition in Senate estimates, ridiculed in the national press and lampooned by its own market research—killed the advertising campaign, thus saving Australian taxpayers $3 million. The government, however, did not escape entirely unscathed from this shabby, amateurish effort. Caught out giving misleading evidence to the estimates committee, exposed as incompetent cowboys, they were nonetheless saved from total humiliation by the appropriate and timely application of market research.</para><para>All this highlights is what the government should already know. There is a place for the 
 use of market research techniques in devising and testing appropriate government promotional campaigns. There is absolutely no place for taxpayer funded market research to be used for purely party political purposes.</para><para>Because market research companies essentially conduct opinion polling and focus group research, the potential for crossover into the party political arena is self-evident. Therefore, when the government funds market research programs, there must be detailed public scrutiny because of the nature of the techniques involved and, especially, the high risk of inappropriate and unethical use.</para><para>It is proper that a number of ethical issues are considered to test the appropriateness of government actions in this area. For the benefit of government senators who seem to be unclear about these issues, I will outline some of the broad and non-controversial matters for consideration in the use of market research by governments.</para><para>Firstly, there is legitimacy. Any research conducted by the government must be designed to meet public policy and not party political objectives.</para><para>There is ownership. When the government commissions research for use in promotional campaigns, the question of who owns the information is critical. Because such research has the potential for political partisanship, it should be either quarantined from ministers' offices or made available for all to see via parliament.</para><para>There are tender processes. As with all external contracts, the tender process must be conducted in a fair and appropriate way with equal consideration given to all tenderers. Given that this area is often subject to contract changes, if there are substantial changes, they should be retendered.</para><para>Then there are the budgetary issues. There are too many examples where a budget has been set and then blown out with no thought of retendering. These budget blow-outs are usually in direct proportion to the political panic at the time.</para><para>The final issue is accountability. Given the sensitivity of government sponsored market research, the process must be transparent and 
 as accountable as possible. All information relating to these projects—that is, the tender process, the departmental briefs, detailed budget information including estimated and actual costs, and the research findings themselves—should be made available at the soonest possible time for parliamentary and wider scrutiny.</para><para>Let us measure off these principles as they apply to the latest government outrage in market research—the tax reform market testing. In this case the research was conducted by Worthington Di Marzio to prepare the government's tax advertising campaign. Leaving aside the outrageous expenditure of taxpayers' funds on a partisan political exercise, the research aspect itself is nothing more than a scandal. The research project went well over budget, and we are still waiting for the Treasurer to provide details of the actual expenditure. At the moment we are working off the estimated cost as presented to the Treasury by Worthington Di Marzio.</para><para>On 3 June this year, the Senate Finance and Public Administration estimates committee was told that the research budget for the tax advertising campaign would be up to $200,000. On the following day, Treasury bragged to the economics estimates committee that they were able to keep the budget to just under $100,000 despite the earlier estimate of 200,000. At no point, despite questioning from the opposition, did Treasury officials provide details of any future expenditure, some of which would be allocated just a few days after the estimates hearings. Further evidence was given that the research would be overwhelmingly qualitative.</para><para>The contracts let out to Worthington Di Marzio were, firstly, research into community views regarding tax reform. The final report was due 3 June 1998, there was a budget of up to $100,000 but Worthington's quote was $93,850. Then we had the amended brief to test advertising concepts and information products with target groups. There was a $16,900 quote from Worthington, let on 18 June. Then we had the research brief for the `concept for tax reform information program'. Worthington's quote was $29,750, let on 17 July. Then in August 1998 there was `bench 
 mark tracking and evaluation results for message delivery and effectiveness evaluation'. Worthington's quote was $221,350, let on 21 July. In addition, Worthington Di Marzio were charging $1,000 per day for each consultant when required in Canberra. This comes to a total cost of $361,850—$161,850 over budget, as outlined at the estimates committee hearings; an 81 per cent blow-out.</para><para>If there were any decency in government life or public life, Worthington Di Marzio's account should be sent not to the Treasury but to `Lightweight' Lynton, c/- Robert Menzies House, Barton, ACT.	You might ask why. We asked this question: was the research purely for public policy reasons or was it research for the Liberal Party of Australia for its upcoming federal election campaign. The documents tabled by the Treasurer clearly show that it was commissioned for partisan political reasons. Worthington Di Marzio were instructed by Treasury to do extensive research on the Australian Labor Party's 1993 campaign commercials.</para><para>In the Wave 2 lines of inquiry document, the moderators were instructed to show the Singleton ads from the 1993 ALP election campaign to test recognition, to test respondents' overall opinion of the campaign, to evaluate which components hit the message home and why, and to ascertain where respondents thought they had failed and why. This section of the report, referring to ALP ads, is entitled `Towards a counter-attack strategy', so there is nothing subtle about this. This is most inappropriate subject for taxpayer funded research that I have ever seen or could possibly imagine.</para><para>Elsewhere in the documents there are several other references to the need to devise responses to potential criticisms of the tax package. In a campaign the government claims is to inform the electorate about a government proposal, how can it be appropriate to engage consultants to research a counter-attack strategy which, by definition, is less about information than about partisan political persuasion?</para><para>The next question that arises is what happened to the research when the election was 
 called. The welter of information collected by Worthington Di Marzio would have been of massive assistance to a political party going to the electorate with tax reform as its key issue. The research provides detailed analysis of voter attitudes to tax reform across all age groups and education and income levels across metropolitan, rural and regional voters by gender.</para><para>This is precisely the kind of data which political parties use to develop campaign strategies, to analyse policy strengths and weaknesses and to mould campaign messages to target a range of groups within the community. It is the very information that political parties pay for themselves—but not the Liberal Party. Why pay for it yourselves when you can get the taxpayer to fund it?</para><para>We know that the research would have dovetailed beautifully with the Liberal Party campaign strategy. After all, the report contained 312 pages of detailed, quantitative data which analyses in great detail public attitudes towards what would become the centrepiece of the Liberal Party campaign in 1998. It includes focus group research testing attitudes towards an opponent's campaign conducted just weeks before the campaign was called.</para><para>We still do not know what happened to the tracking polling. Was it ever done? If so, where is it? Why wasn't it tabled? When did it start? When did it finish? Was any of it done during the official election campaign period? What guarantees can the government give that none of this research found its way into the hands of the Liberal Party organisation? We are entitled to have doubts about these matters because the government will not come clean on the extent and nature of market research done.</para><para>We must give credit to some departments for being transparent and accountable. But this may no longer be the case as OGIA has been shifted from DoFA across to PM&amp;C under the direct control of the Prime Minister's office rather than the department. As the auditor-General said in relation to government advertising, there would be major benefit in a parliamentary inquiry into the use of market research by governments. There can be no more opportune time than now to 
 review the ethical guidelines which cover advertising and market research, given that supervision has been transferred from DoFA to PM&amp;C. Such a committee inquiry could establish both the scope and the cost of market research by government and make recommendations as to appropriate guidelines that would govern the use of such techniques.</para><para>This is a government that has systematically rorted advertising and research. It rorts the selection processes to give jobs to its mates. It rorts the research briefs to acquire taxpayer funded political research. It flagrantly rorts copyright so that the Liberal Party can use government artwork. It covers up by refusing to table all relevant material for parliamentary scrutiny. It covers up by refusing to answer questions on notice. It covers up by rejecting freedom of information requests. It covers up by giving misleading answers at Senate estimates committees.</para><para>Only a full Senate inquiry can get to the bottom of the murky, rorted research activities of this government and make sensible recommendations to ensure cleaner, more accountable and more honest arrangements in future.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>716</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am not going to speak on the substantive motion; I am going to explain why we received a lecture less than half an hour ago from the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate on his advice that the government should inform other senators of what the advance program should be.</para></talk.start><para>At the whips meeting last night at approximately 7 o'clock the opposition whip advised that the motion which is listed at item 6 under discovery of formal business under Senator Gibbs's name would be deferred.

Who is Mark Textor, the Liberal Party pollster who was recruited out of the Northern Territory by Andrew Robb? We know that both his methodology and his analysis are morally bankrupt. He is a push pollster obsessed with negative campaigns based on emotive and racist research findings. He is unprincipled and he is dishonest. In 1990 he participated in a scheme to defraud the taxpayers of the Northern Territory.

Shane Stone, now the Northern Territory's Chief Minister, was the President of the CLP at the time. Mark Textor was employed as a researcher for the CLP and Andrew Coward was the key operative in Chief Minister Perron's office. The same research that cost Northern Territory taxpayers over $35,000—conducted by the same researcher, using the same focus groups, on the same days, in the same locations—was made available to the CLP for a mere $3,700. Every aspect of the research provided to the territory government 
 was also passed on to the CLP, but large sections of the document received by the CLP were never included in the research commissioned and paid for by the Northern Territory government.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The scheme was for the CLP and the Northern Territory government to simultaneously request research from Brian Sweeney and Associates into various governmental and political issues in the Northern Territory. The Chief Minister's office informed public servants of the parameters of the research and who would be conducting it. The public servants were never told that the CLP would piggyback on the government's research, that it would receive all of the findings and more. This is in total breach of copyright.</para><para>The public servants were also never told that taxpayers would bear the full cost of the group discussions, the group moderation expenses and the group recruitment expenses. They were never told that while the Northern Territory government would be billed $4,800 for focus group recruitment alone, the total cost to the CLP for the entire project, using the same focus groups, would be only $3,700. The public servants were never told that only swinging voters would participate in the focus groups. The public servants were never told that every focus group, in every locality, would comprise only white territorians, even though Aboriginals comprise approximately one-third of the territory's population.</para><para>The public servants were never told that the real reason for the research was contained in a memo dated 2 April 1990 and sent under the signature of Mark Textor to key CLP operatives. In that memo, Mark Textor specifically recommends that government and CLP research be run simultaneously. This memo is the genesis of the conspiracy hatched by Textor, Coward, Stone and Klein to falsely bill the territory government for the CLP's campaign research. The public servants were never told any of these things. Nor were they told that Mr Klein would totally breach his signed undertaking to the Secretary of the Chief Minister's department that all copyright would vest with the Northern Territory government. They were never told that all the research would be provided to the CLP. Nor 
 were they told that Mr Ron Klein's letter of 14 June 1990 outlining the subjects to be covered in the research, included an attachment, which no public servant ever saw, which separated the governmental from the political information requirements.</para><para>This letter makes it absolutely clear that it was always intended to illegally bill the Northern Territory government for research that was purely for the political purposes of the CLP, research that was never intended to be made available to government.</para><para>Ron Klein's 12 focus groups resulted in two reports. The first is entitled <inline font-style="italic">A 1990 Insight into the Northern Territory</inline> and was prepared by Ron Klein for the Northern Territory government in July 1990. I shall refer to that as `the government report'. The second report is entitled <inline font-style="italic">A 1990 Insight into Northern Territory Politics</inline> and was prepared by Ron Klein for the confidential attention of Shane Stone and Mark Textor of the Northern Territory CLP in July 1990. I shall refer to that as `the CLP report'.</para><para>The government report is numbered 6706, while the CLP report is numbered 6697. I ask: who from Brian Sweeney and Associates made the decision to use the deceptive device of non-consecutive numbers for these reports? I ask Brian Sweeney and Associates whether its researchers are routinely instructed to provide advice on ways to conceal copyright and billing breaches to clients? Is it standard practice for their researchers to aid and abet the defrauding of taxpayers?</para><para>The government report commences with the quote, `This document reports the findings from 12 group discussions conducted across the Northern Territory between 25 June and 3 July 1990.' The CLP report commences with the quote, `This document reports the findings from 12 group discussions conducted across the Northern Territory between 25 June and 3 July 1990.' This is not surprising. After all, the methodology of each report, contained on pages 7 and 4 respectively, is exactly the same. The group numbers, the locations, the age and gender profiles and the dates are exactly the same. The only difference is that the CLP report contained the observation that the respondents had no involvement or strong 
 affinity with any political party and every respondent in every group was white.</para><para>These two facts were deleted from the report provided to the government. In other words, the government never knew that the focus group samples were unrepresentative. They needed to be unrepresentative to suit the political parameters of the CLP. The government report, costing $35,000, runs to 46 pages. The CLP report, costing $3,700, runs to 65 pages. The CLP report includes page after page of material that they never asked for in their formal brief but, since it had been provided to the territory government, it was passed on to the CLP, in total breach of copyright.</para><para>Page after page of the report matches one another verbatim—the same layout, the same font, the same quotes, the same observations. Both reports contain the same chapter headings. In some cases, political quotes are left out of the government report but blended into the CLP report. Under the heading `The Northern Territory economy and federal funding', on pages 13 and 10 of the reports respectively, the CLP report contains the focus group quote, `It could be doing better if the government (NT) didn't waste so much money'. This quote was deleted from the government report, as were other comments relating to NT government waste.</para><para>Even though the government brief specifically sought information relating to the Sheraton hotels in Darwin, Yulara and Alice Springs, unfavourable political comments on these projects were deleted from the government report. The comments were, however, included in the CLP report. This must constitute, on Mr Klein's part, a massive breach of his legal, ethical and contractual obligations to provide the full findings of the research to this clients—the copyright for which vests with the territory government.</para><para>Time and time again aspects of the report are softened or altered so that the government report, for which taxpayers were billed over $35,000, is a weaker, less precise and less informative document. Time and again, salient observations and quotes are left out. The only conclusion is that the Northern Territory government was provided with a useless 
 document—research without any hard edges—a document which would gather dust.</para><para>The real findings, contained in the CLP report, start on page 44. Remember, the government report ran to only 46 pages. The first of the chapter headings in the CLP report that is not matched in the government report is headed `An introductory comment on the local political arena'. Mr Klein's research told the CLP that there were perceptions of government waste; that the government lacked experience and maturity; that they were helping out their mates—and he wasn't wrong there—and that too many territory contracts were being offered interstate. That, I might say, was from the Melbourne-based Mr Klein. On it goes until page 64—20 pages of political findings. So one-third of the research the government never saw.</para><para>The NT public servants were merely the mugs who provided the taxpayer-funded structure around which the CLP could conduct its real political research. This research then formed the basis of the CLP's election campaign, run by DDB Needham, in October 1990. This is not only dishonest and unethical, it is also corrupt. The operatives involved—Textor, Stone, Klein and Coward—conspired to defraud the taxpayers of the Northern Territory.</para><para>Mark Textor's involvement in territory politics did not end with the Sweeney swindle of 1990. On 14 April 1993, Mark Textor's business—Territory Focus Consulting—entered into a contract with the Northern Territory government to provide research during 1993-94. The business name was registered with the ASC on the same day. In other words, registering the business name was simply a device to enable a paid coalition political operative to be engaged on voter research at taxpayer expense in the run-up to the election. The contract was for 12 months and the fee was $740 per day. The services that Textor was to provide were described, in deliberately vague terms, in two lines in schedule 3 of the contract. I quote:</para><para>The consultant shall provide to the Territory advice on community attitudes towards government programmes and initiatives as required. 
</para><para>It was never intended that Textor would perform anything other than political research for the CLP. By July, Textor was providing advice to the private staff of Chief Minister Perron. In a letter to Andrew Coward, dated 16 July 1993 and marked `private and confidential', Textor, a consultant engaged by the NT government on a $740 a day taxpayer-funded consultancy, provided details of the voter research that he intended to conduct.</para><para>Time and again his research intentions refer to voters. He writes of determining `what factors are most important in influencing voter behaviour'. He advises Coward that `a campaign researcher needs regular voter contact in order to put his or her findings in their proper historical context and to properly interpret subtle changes in attitude'. He writes:</para><para>My groups were intended to be nothing more than a `snap shot' read, or the first of a series of updates of the general political mood of the under 35 target market in the northern suburbs to see what (and if) further research was required and in what directions.</para><para>That goes to the heart of the scam. Textor's work was political. The letter to Coward was faxed from the Liberal Party's national headquarters in Canberra. In further faxes in September 1993, Textor describes the focus groups he is setting up for further research. He describes the processes that will be used to weed out committed voters. The evidence is unambiguous. Textor's research is political. Indeed, he boasts that he has seen `more political focus groups than anyone in Australia over the last two years'. It is totally political. It serves no other purpose than the development of campaign strategies for the CLP. Yet it is paid for by the taxpayers of the Northern Territory.</para><para>The documents that we have in our possession and which are now being tabled, or soon to be tabled, in the Northern Territory parliament show the contempt that Mark Textor has for public accountability and ethical standards. They show that he is both an initiator and an active participant in conspiracies to defraud the taxpayers of the Northern Territory. This man is John Howard's own political pollster. This is a person appointed by the Liberal Party, nationally, to conduct their research.</para><para>Some of these scams were actually conducted by Textor while operating out of the Liberal Party national secretariat and using their equipment. This is a person considered suitable for government research projects for the Commonwealth of Australia. But we say this about Mark Textor. We say that he is a person unfit to receive government work in this country. We say that, in a democracy, political parties must observe some standards in respect of their own advertising and research.	We say that Mark Textor is not fit to be retained as the chief pollster of the Liberal Party and the Prime Minister of Australia.</para><para>We say that Mark Textor conspired with Shane Stone, Ron Klein and Andrew Coward to defraud the taxpayers of the Northern Territory and we say that Mark Textor also conspired to use his business name, Territory Focus Consulting, to further defraud territory taxpayers by conducting political research for the CLP under a bogus government contract. We say that both the Prime Minister and the Liberal Party are tainted by their association with and involvement in dealings with one of the lowest, most unethical, most grubby political operatives Australia has seen.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="metadata">KEMP</name><name role="display">Senator Kemp</name></talker><para>—Madam Acting Deputy President, I take a point of order.

I must admit I was disorderly, to the point of interjecting a little later and saying, `Nobody tells us anything.' There was, I believe, a message left last night on my answer phone from the Manager of Government Business to call him. I received the message this morning but I have not had that call. There has been no discussion between the government and the Greens (WA) in relation to the matter of the sitting weeks.</para></talk.start><para>I wanted to ask basic questions like, `Is this going to be government business only? Will we have a normal sitting period? Can we debate the issues?' The point was to say that the government ought to put some words on the record as to what is happening with their program and why they have made their mind up.</para><para>Now I notice that there was an agreement between the government and the opposition. They made an agreement to swap statements when the formality was going to be pushed through this morning. That arrangement was not passed through to me either. So, if the government wants to progress at this time of the year, I would suggest a better form of communication. Don't just take parties like the Greens for granted. Try to actually discuss with us the reasons for making decisions.</para><para>In fact, we are having difficulty at the moment: we are running out of legislation. I realise, as was hastily mentioned at the whips meeting last night, that there is more legislation coming on as a result of committees that have not finalised their deliberations. I also note that it has been suggested that a bill which was never on the list of 10 November is now coming on—an environmental bill that was not even on the list. The government is going to be ranting and raving at some stage about the recalcitrance of the Senate when there is a major environmental bill which, we are now told, it is hoping to debate before December, before Christmas.</para><para>It has to have it one way or the other. It has to tell us what it is doing. Quite frankly, there are great difficulties. We are supposed to be debating a bill, whenever this debate finishes, when we still have not had the government's amendments. The government did not tell us until the day before yesterday that it was not planning to take anybody else's views into consideration. All the different parties, I can see, are now just circulating amendments; nobody has had a chance to look at them. I think if the government wants cooperation on its program it has got to give cooperation to everybody else. We have just received the amendments from the opposition; the Greens and the Democrats have been working all hours to try to get our amendments together; and the government was sitting on its hands, not giving advice on that particular bill, and we will deal with that more when we get back to the committee stage of the bill.</para><para>Fair is fair in this place. If the government is going to get up and rant and rave about the Senate, then it has to look at not just the management of the program but its own means of communication—what it is doing and when—with ample time for all parties to be adequately covered and for the Senate system—the library system, the legal system and everybody else who needs that time—to be properly prepared. It would have been nice. Now I can see that the deal has been done and finally the vote is going through, but I simply wanted to say that this kind of motion should not have gone through as a formal nod and a wink motion because it 
 needed to be at least explained and put on the public record.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>725</page.no><id.no>s177</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>In Committee</title><page.no>725</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Consideration resumed from 25 November.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline></para><para>The bill.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>725</page.no><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator SCHACHT</name><name.id>4J4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Madam Temporary Chairman, I know that we are waiting for the minister to come.

We are all finding that as we come into the chamber there are amendments which we have only just seen, which have just arrived into our hands. The government may say, and the usual set piece is, `Why weren't people well prepared?' We have been trying very hard over the last week to move as quickly as possible on this bill.</para></talk.start><para>It is one of those bills which is potentially of much greater import than meets the eye initially because we may discover—or find out later on with subsequent bills in the next week or so—that sometimes a bill which seems to be dealing with just one issue may in fact potentially be dealing with other issues in the future. So a lot of work had to be done to find out what the issues were. There did not seem to be time to get the usual assistance 
 that would normally speed things along—like the ability to get a <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest</inline> in time—because of the government's handling of this. Our officers have been trying to gain information from the government about concerns we have had for some time and they were very late in coming back to us. I understand the situation was similar for the Australian Democrats. Getting amendments circulated by today required a great deal of effort.</para><para>In this particular case, all the parties involved have been working their way through this bill. As I mentioned in my speech in the second reading debate, it is very useful to have legislation dealing with space activities because Australia is getting more into those activities and is likely to have some commercial pressure for future activities. However, all of these kinds of activities ought to be carefully considered. If there are military or corporate implications or implications for Australia being a good global citizen then these ought to be carefully considered. We need the opportunity to look at the bill carefully. We also need the opportunity to look at the amendments.</para><para>The last amendments we received in this flurry of activity leading up to the bill being called on again in the committee stage were in fact the government's. So the last group of amendments to be looked at and considered are the government's amendments. It may well be that there has been discussion between the government and the opposition on these issues, but there has been less discussion between the government and parties like the Greens (WA) on these issues. There may even have to be a new running sheet. Senator Schacht has suggested that we go straight to the Democrats amendments and the Green (WA) amendments. That is fine, but where do the government's amendments fit in, and why weren't we given these a little earlier than now?</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>726</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On the same subject of this <inline ref="s177">Space Activities Bill 1998</inline> , I echo some of the comments of Senator Margetts.

The effect of this provision is to specify a liability period which is limited and in particular leaves out the period after the launch and before the re-entry manoeuvre. This is particularly concerning because this creates a scheme which is incomplete.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The amendment that I am proposing on behalf of the Democrats would make the liability period cover the entire time from the launch until the time the object returns to the surface of the earth. This is achieved by changing the definition of the term `liability period', which then flows into the operation of the bill, for example, in clause 62, which provides for damage covered and distinguishes between a launch and a return. The amendment proposes extending the launch period to cover the existing launch period as well as the time the object is in space and until the object begins a planned re-entry or an event which results in re-entry. Where there is no re-entry, such as where the object is sent out of the earth orbit into the furthest regions of space, 
 like the Galileo probes, the launch period will be open-ended.</para><para>Importantly, removing the existing definition avoids unfairness in the application and apportionment of liability. For example, the period of 30 days after a launch appears to be a fairly arbitrary figure. Certainly the minister can feel free to explain the rationale for that figure. I accept the assurances from the minister that damage after this period is improbable. But should we again overlook the risk—this is something I touched on in my speech on the second reading—just because there is a low risk? And, if it is very improbable, then the indemnity will reflect this. Further, the launches are supposed to be low risk, yet there is a distinction between damage within 30 days and another later period after the launch.</para><para>The change to the return provision is also necessary to take account of the chance of an accidental return to earth as a result of an event causing re-entry. Accidents do happen, and this may result in the return of materials to earth. These are events that do happen and, although infrequent, they should be taken into consideration in this legislative scheme. I set out in my speech on the second reading an outline of the number of objects in space and the increasing numbers. The ESA, the European Space Operation Centre, has a debris database of more than 1.7 million elements, and it is adding nearly 30,000 new elements each month. This does not include the tens of thousands of elements less than 10 centimetres wide which can be deadly. For example, a one-millimetre object travelling at 10 kilometres per second will penetrate most satellites and can cause failure of the satellite. These can cause accidents.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>4J4</name.id><name role="metadata">SCHACHT</name><name role="display">Senator Schacht</name></talker><para>—They won't hit someone in Australia.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3I6</name.id><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name></talker><para>—You will have your turn, Senator Schacht. On 24 July 1996 a French military satellite was struck by a piece of space debris from the break-up of an upper stage of an Ariane rocket in November 1986. The debris, travelling at nearly 15 kilometres per second, severed the satellite's gravity gradient boom. This event disabled the satellite and turned it into debris. These 
 fragments are returning, albeit slowly, to earth and, although unlikely to cause damage to the earth's surface because most of it is water or unpopulated, there is always the potential that it can cause damage.</para></talk.start></continue><para>We all remember the 90-tonne Skylab which returned to earth in Senator Margetts's home state of Western Australia in 1979. It would have caused devastation had it struck the east coast. Similarly, a stainless steel container weighing several hundred kilos from the Delta second stage of a US MS-X satellite survived re-entry to land near Georgetown in Texas. Although there have been no recorded fatalities, the potential is there. This is increased with the amount of debris. These are the potential events which are not covered by the present provisions. I think they should be covered.</para><para>Finally, the cost to those launching objects into space will undoubtedly increased. This is a cost which eventually will have to be taken on by somebody. If an accident happens and a third party is affected, this amendment says that they should look to the party responsible for the launch or return. An Australian national should not have to use the common law to enforce their rights because of an omission in this bill. The Commonwealth should not be liable by virtue of its international obligations to foreign nationals. The cost shifting in the present provision is unfair and the Democrats believe that this amendment will reflect this.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>729</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Greens (WA) are certainly prepared to support Senator Stott Despoja's amendment No. 1.

 a matter of testosterone-pushed, big guys toys. We are interested in community concerns. I remind Senator Schacht that he is not the minister. He has the same responsibility as everybody else to look after the concerns of his electorate.</para><para>The second interjection from Senator Schacht was, `They won't hit people in Australia.' He is forgetting the fact that there may well be potential for space junk to create damage elsewhere or in space. If we are getting the benefits and profits of having commercial operations in Australia, then we should also take the responsibility of any problems associated with those commercial operations.</para><para>I do not think it is a good example of how this debate is going to go when puerile comments are made across the chamber, with people doubting that the concerns of the community—and of informed members of the community—ought to be taken into consideration. When in the past I dealt with the issue of shipping liability, I did not get a good responses from the then government, which is now the opposition.</para><para>In my opinion, liability is about taking responsibility for activities that are in your waters or, in this particular case, taking responsibility for the activities in your region from which you are prepared to take profits. If it is considered that, on balance, these space activities are going to be beneficial, then we must also be prepared to accept liability for anything that goes wrong as a result of these activities. These are the real costs of those activities.</para><para>Yesterday, I mentioned the example of the Cassini probe. If any reasonable risk analysis had been done in any way, shape or form by any reputable company throughout the world, the risks of the Cassini probe would have far outweighed any potential benefits, but it was never done. The responsibility for that was never accepted by the United States. The enormous, horrifying, appalling risk was just pushed under the carpet under the guise of secrecy, national security or something else.</para><para>That risk was never accepted by the United States, NASA, or anybody else just for the sake of seeing how far technology could go. 
 It is amazing that 72 kilograms of plutonium could, with impunity, be put at risk and that the lives of so many billions of people throughout the world could be put at risk for the sake of a technological achievement. Would anyone in their wildest imagination have said that this would pass any reasonable risk analysis? The answer is: no, of course it would not.</para><para>Does Australia think this is the kind of thing we should be aspiring to? As we get to some of the later amendments, you will see that this kind of use is not beyond the scope of the legislation as it has been written. It does not preclude military operations, it does not preclude what the space activity is used for, and so we have to deal with the issue of liability.</para><para>We have to deal with the government taking a responsible role in calculating and having some input into whether the liability is reasonable and into who is going to manage that liability—whether the companies involved have the wherewithal to manage the liability for any reasonable risk that they are associated with.</para><para>This is not a laughing matter. It is not a matter of people who want space activities or do not want space activities. It is a matter of taking seriously the responsibility that we are all given as members of parliament and the responsibility which, in this particular case, is being shared by the people who definitely have fewer resources than the government and the opposition to deal with it. We are trying to do that. I support Democrats amendment No. 1.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>730</page.no><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator SCHACHT</name><name.id>4J4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I appreciate that some of my interjections may have been misunderstood by Senator Margetts, but when Senator Stott Despoja gave a technical list of the amount of space junk that was floating around—I am not disputing the list and the material—it did not contain those many thousands of items of less than a very small size that are floating around in space.</para></talk.start><para>My understanding of the physics is that, if very small items the size of a bolt, a nut or a piece of metal fall back into the atmosphere, they burn up because of the speed they are

I want to know whether the government's proposal to provide protection and 
 liability is operating elsewhere in the Western world. If it is similar, then I think that it is reasonable that the government supports it. Minister, is the structure about the liability period in lines 24 to 31 similar to what the United States, Canada and the European countries use in drafting their regulatory regime about liability?  What Senator Stott Despoja is moving is significantly different. Her amendment says:</para></talk.start></continue><para>(a)	 for the launch of a space object—the period beginning when the launch takes place and ending when the return period begins; and</para><para>(b)	 for the return of a space object—the period beginning when the relevant re-entry manoeuvre or other re-entry event begins and ending when the object has come to rest on Earth.</para><para>Minister, if the rocket is launching a satellite that is going to be in orbit around the earth—whether it be low earth orbiting or geostationary or anything else in between—does the Democrat amendment mean that the liability period applies forever and a day until that satellite disappears or burns up? In 30 years time, if it did re-enter the atmosphere and a small part of it came down to earth, does that mean the liability would have to cover the life of that satellite until it either completely burnt up or was removed by some other means in space? If so, is it equivalent to other Western countries with space programs, and do they have similar liability arrangements? If they do not, I would imagine there is going to be a substantial difference in insurance liability costs to meet the demands of Senator Stott Despoja.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>731</page.no><name role="metadata">Minchin, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator MINCHIN</name><name.id>JX4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Industry, Science and Resources</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In putting together this bill, the department has undertaken significant consultation with the space industry in Australia and overseas and has examined all international practice to determine an appropriate regime for Australia.

Having put stuff into space on the basis of making profits—and these are commercial operations to make money—who should accept the liability? I would argue it should be the people who are making money out of it. It might be shared by the people who are using the satellite. I would argue, quite distinctly from Senator Schacht, that that is the real cost of those operations.</para><para>If we do not include that liability, then we have a subsidised cost. If there is no risk whatsoever, then the liability insurance obviously is not going to be particularly high—and that can be argued. If all the technical arguments say that the risks are almost infinitesimal, then the insurance companies will be able to work out those risks themselves. They have to operate in a commercial environment themselves.</para><para>If, however, there are substantial risks—and those risks could be extremely costly at some stage in terms of, for instance, possible pollution of the atmosphere or some other 
 major concern—then they must be built into the cost of the operation. You cannot talk about international competitiveness unless you have built those costs in at some stage; otherwise the global community will be subsidising this operation on the basis of satellite users and launch operators making a profit or getting a benefit.</para><para>If there is a benefit, and if it is a reasonable benefit, then the users and profiteers, the people making the profit—and that is fine—should work out what those real costs are. There is no point in saying, `Well, these costs go so far into the future it is unreasonable to cost them.' It is like someone putting major radioactive waste into the ground—assuming that someone can make a profit by putting it there—and then, after 10 or 20 years, pretending that their responsibility or liability is finished so they plant trees over the top and go away. </para><para>The Greens (WA) have always argued that that should not be the case. There should not be the ability for people to do that with things like nuclear waste. If this is the way the government and the opposition are dealing with the 30-year issue of liability, what on earth could we expect should there ever be the horrifying concept of a major international radioactive waste dump in Australia? I hope it never happens. Can you imagine—if this is the attitude to liability now with a 30-year proposal for putting something into space—that somehow or other, because it is there for so long, the liability for having put it there in the first place should stop?

Clearing of areas in tropical wetlands or otherwise is of concern, as are geotechnical issues and foundations; aesthetics; materials used in the containment of waste and rubbish, radioactive or otherwise; the impact on the coast of any marine facility; and the processes for minimising the impact of construction.</para><para>We should be looking at the impact of the facility; the security of the fuel or the containment processes, the communications systems, transport in and out—roads, airstrips, et cetera—and issues regarding materials being transported; the use of resources by the facility—that is, water and power, especially if they are remote or arid areas; waste project management—that is, domestic or industrial; and basically all the things you would expect to be reviewed in any major project. And we are talking major projects here.</para><para>There are also the impacts specific to the space facility—issues of the types of launcher vehicle, the fuel system, the payloads, and so on. Possibly most important are the proced 
 ures in place to minimise the impact of accidents. The possible impact of a variety of accidents would need thorough examination. In the case of the proposed space probe at Christmas Island, it means looking at the equipment and the technology that is being used and asking for specific information on what that would be. Currently, there is an environmental review process into that, but if such a process  is not made necessary by legislation the community will be left out of that process. The launch pad, following take-off, further into the flight and so on, are other things to be considered.</para><para>I am not just concerned about accidents to do with the launch; I am concerned about other aspects of the facility, for example, an explosion in its fuel store or leaks of toxic materials. Another issue to do with the proposal on Christmas Island is that superheated steam will come from the launch process. It is not an accident; that is what happens. We have to consider the rainforest, important bird species, and so on. All those things have to be taken into consideration. There needs to be a process of examining the environmental impacts on each of these areas in which activity takes place.</para><para>The list of things which make for a thorough environmental impact statement could go on and on, but the most important thing is the process that is set in train to ensure there is full and open consultation with the affected communities—the scientific community and the broader community. It is not just the local people who have specific information on these issues. The way to ensure this is to have a reference to the necessary environmental approvals written into the bill.</para><para>The second part of our amendment deals with Aboriginal approvals. This part of our amendment has been moved for the same reason as the first part: to get specific mention of these things in the act so that nothing can be done to get around the necessity for the rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to be respected. Unfortunately, the record of the government on this is not good. The opposition will remember the debates that have occurred on this. The debacle over the proposal for a space facility at Cape York is 
 a very clear example of the government's record on this issue.	Aboriginal people must have the right to negotiate on any major development on their land, and there is no room for any exemption for space activities.</para><para>One aspect of the current proposals that is of concern is the haste with which the issue is being pursued. Contracts have been entered into and deals done already. If this is the way the industry operates, enormous pressure will be put on Aboriginal communities. These must be taken into account in planning for these projects. If it means the project is held up for awhile, then so be it. The project will be better in the long run if it is done in full consultation with local Aboriginal communities. The project should be required to include consideration of cultural impact as well as environmental impact.</para><para>I do urge support.

That was made in good faith. We did not know that that was illegal until the Wik decision at the end of 1996. From that point on, no leases or licences were issued over pastoral leases—once it became evident that as a matter of common law native title could survive on a pastoral lease.

That is something that we all ought to be concerned about. It is a pity that we cannot exclude it altogether. We have a situation where the minister is making a decision, but if you are sending up highly toxic and in this case radio-toxic materials, in effect you have something that could be as bad or worse than a nuclear weapon and, therefore, it ought to be controlled.

 dangerous materials and obviously dealing with them in the Australian community, or the world community, can create considerable concern. No-one denies that. Certainly, the opposition does not deny it. However, we believe that, on balance, the amendment is unnecessary. In the procedures in the bill itself under the full section—that is, clause 26—concerning the granting of launch permits, 26(3)(e) states:</para></talk.start><para>the minister is satisfied that the probability of the launch or 	 launches, or any connected return, causing substantial harm to public 	 health or public safety or causing substantial damage to property is sufficiently low;</para><para>If the proposal for a rocket launch with a satellite in any form had any of these materials—radioactive materials, et cetera—any minister would have to be extremely derelict in his duty, or basically a certified dill, not to take into account before he or she granted the licence that one of the issues that they would be dealing with and getting advice on was the fact that the satellite at the top of the rocket had some of this material in it and the reason it had it. As the minister has said, there will be more than a lot of publicity at any stage about the announcement. If the minister or the government of the day were willing to approve such a launch and did not properly take into account such issues, I think that public debate would be more than a little robust and I suspect the minister might have a rather short-term life—a life much shorter than radioactive life—in his or her portfolio.</para><para>Again, we in the opposition say, `Let us take the present act on board. We do not want to restrict it unnecessarily. We are going to learn by experience'. If it is shown that many launches regularly take place with satellites or vehicles in them that have this material and there is consistently a debate about it, I think we will have to revist it. However, at the moment what is before us is the possibility of space launches from Australia. Such material may not be in every launch and it may only occur very occasionally.</para><para>On balance, we believe that the act in its present form should be allowed to work, although I do place it on record that this is an area the opposition will follow very closely.

The bill authorises payments for the funding agreed to at the 1998 Premiers Conference of $17.1 billion for the financial year 1998-99. In doing so, the government has continued the Labor practice of indexing the pool of funds on a real per capita basis; that is, increasing population. This is a fair funding formula in the view of the opposition as demand for state services such as health, education, infrastructure and the like is often driven by both inflation and population changes.</para></talk.start><para>The bill also authorises revenue from the safety net arrangements introduced to make up for the state revenue shortfall arising from last year's High Court decision in the Walter Hammond case which invalidated state business franchise fees concerning tobacco and the like as being uncontroversial; that is, $6.5 billion for 1998-99.

It depends whether you think national competition policy is controversial or non-controversial. From the Greens (WA) point of view, right from the beginning we have considered that the whole concept, which was brought in by the Labor Party, was controversial. The purpose of this bill is to amend the states grants acts for the provision of general revenue, including competition payments, payments under the business franchising arrangements and agreed fiscal contributions by state and territory governments to the Commonwealth in 1998-99.</para></talk.start><para>Let me give you some historical context, Mr Acting Deputy President. National competition policy payments initially were essentially a bribe to the states to get them on side without public consultation or widespread debate. When were we asked about this? When the general purpose grants were reduced—and I do not blame the states for being tempted by the allure of increased finances—it meant that national competition policy was adopted without proper consultation or examination, and for the wrong reasons.</para><para>In terms of accountability, national competition policy fundamentally affects all aspects of Australian society and has been introduced and implemented through bureaucratic processes that avoid public accountability, the accountability of the parliament and the Senate. The payments are conditional on satisfactory progress being made by the states and the implementation of the competition policy, but who effectively decides what is satisfactory? In this case it is the National Competition Council, an unelected body that makes recommendations to the government on what money should be allocated.</para><para>There has been no real, proper and open political debate on this issue. National competition policy relies heavily on intergovernmental negotiations in COAG, which are largely remote from open political debate. The competition principles agreement in the Competition Policy Reform Act of 1995 was rolled 
 through in 1995 with almost no debate. I remember it very well. Competition policy has been presented as a given, something not open to negotiation. The reality is that national competition policy is a policy choice. It was a policy choice made by the federal government at the time and it was a choice, albeit under the duress or bribe of increased funding, by the states.</para><para>Before the last Queensland election, most people had been experiencing massive changes in their communities but did not know that competition policy was related to many of these changes. They did not know where to direct their anger or lobbying efforts, and often thought that national competition policy was beyond reach and non-negotiable. In some instances I think the government and perhaps the opposition think that this is true.</para><para>Compare this to the goods and services tax proposal. There has been much debate over this and the government has offered further funds to the states to get them on board on this occasion as well. Everyone knows that they can lobby the government on this issue and that they can have their say and possibly achieve some amendments or changes. We also know that there is massive debate within the media and within the community, and that is important on these major issues.</para><para>The recent Queensland motion on national competition policy exemplifies that at least some states are not happy with the way competition policy implementation is proceeding and possibly indicates that they never really understood what they were signing up for in the first place. Indeed, Mr Borbidge, Leader of the Queensland National Party, actually added weight to the motion calling on both federal and state governments to negotiate changes to the administration of national competition policy to take into greater account the adverse social implications of these policies.</para><para>The major point I would like to make in the context of this bill is that the use of financial penalties to compel state governments to comply with the agreement is undemocratic and should be abandoned. The power of the National Competition Council to make recommendations concerning the payment or 
 withholding of such grants means that an unelected body uses the carrot and stick approach to push along a raft of reforms which are not necessarily in the public interest. At the very least, this process should be paused.</para><para>There is still ambiguity as to whether eligibility for payments depends on the implementation of the competitive reform process, including the public benefit test, or on the adoption of particular reform options with or without a bona fide public benefit test. But the decisions are being made by individuals, in this case the head of the National Competition Council.</para><para>Let us look at the public interest. The public interest test is a concept of public interest which I have been very concerned about since 1995. National competition policy involves an approach to policy which differs in important respects from the standard economic approach. It is focused on the nature of market processes, not equity and efficiency. For example, section 44X(1) of the Competition Policy Reform Act directs the ACCC, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, to take account of `the public interest in having competition in markets'.</para><para>So we have the wonderfully circular logic of competition equals public interest equals competition. When people argue for exemptions, they have to argue on the basis that they are not anticompetitive. So public interest in other issues has to be linked to anticompetitiveness. This absolutely undermines the concept of public interest as a benchmark for when ideal economic assumptions are not satisfied.</para><para>This bill provides for up $217.2 million in competition payments to the states and territories in 1998-99. The National Competition Council has recommended that all states should receive competition payments except New South Wales, which may incur a reduction of $10 million if they fail to reform their domestic rice marketing arrangements. I believe we need to revisit the whole carrot and stick approach of these competition payments to analyse the distortions created by the fear of losing the payments.</para><para>There is no requirement that any so-called reforms have the majority of public support, and that is a fault of this legislation and this process. There is no requirement that the broader policy changes have the majority of public support—indeed, any public support at all. Public opinion is not an issue in the implementation of national competition policy, unlike the way the issue of the GST is being dealt with. There is just a paternalistic approach that says, `We know what's good for you people. Don't question it and don't complain if there are problems, because we will work it out. Besides, if you are complaining, you obviously don't understand.' That seems to be the theme. Even the recent report from the National Competition Council, which recognised the range of concerns and issues, said that what we have to do to address this is to provide more information so that people understand that it is really doing them good.</para><para>Queensland is current negotiating to subsidise a number of water facilities, including dams, to be involved with operations which I believe are largely of a non-commercial nature. I would like the minister to explain whether or not this way of dealing with water resources in Queensland means there will be any problem with obtaining their National Competition Council approved payments. That is a very important question and perhaps the minister could respond to it. It is only New South Wales, according to this, which is getting a deduction for its domestic marketing arrangements. Perhaps the minister can clarify whether there is going to be any holding back of Queensland's National Competition Policy payments as a result of the current processes about to be signed up in relation to subsidies relating to dams. I believe there are a whole lot of dams in Queensland.</para><para>In the opinion of the Greens (WA) there needs to be a major review of the whole nature of national competition policy, the way it was pushed through, the unintended consequences of it—that is the most charitable way I can say it—and its method of implementation. There needs to be a review of the framework and administration of national competition policy, of which payments are a fundamental part.</para><para>I am hoping that all the statements that have been made in recent times, including those in Queensland and those made during the election by Mr Beazley, the Leader of the Opposition, will actually result in some action in dealing with these consequences and the necessity to make changes to deal with them.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>742</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This <inline ref="r624">States Grants (General Purposes) Amendment Bill 1998</inline>  is an annual reminder of the ludicrous state of state-federal relations in this country. Under this bill the Commonwealth will transfer $17.1 billion to the states in general revenue assistance. Combined with special purpose payments and the $6.5 billion in revenue replacement payments collected on behalf of the states, the Commonwealth now provides the majority of running costs of the states. That level of fiscal imbalance between the Commonwealth and the states is obviously excessive and needs to be changed. To the government's credit, I must say, it has tried to address some of those problems in its taxation package, although we do have concerns about the financial robustness of the package. We are concerned that the functions provided by states and local governments are still at risk of getting squeezed.</para></talk.start><para>This is a very important area for the tax inquiry process that the Senate set up just yesterday. However, the Australian Democrats also believe that spending powers ought to be reviewed as well. In some areas, such as health and the TAFE sector, where most of the funding already comes from Canberra and the policy setting is also nationally driven, I think we should ask whether the states should hand their powers over completely, thereby saving them around $8 billion a year.</para><para>The Democrats see merit in a national taxation system rather than breaking it up into nine separate tax systems. But I also recognise that the current system is unsatisfactory. It is unsatisfactory because the states can make cuts and blame Canberra, and of course Canberra so often makes cuts to the states grants knowing that it will be the states that bear the odium, not the Commonwealth. The Hawke-Keating government worked out very early that the states grants were an easy target for cutting spending in what was for Canberra 
 a fairly painless way of extracting a few extra billion dollars. Grants fell in real terms every year from 1984 to 1991, falling from 18 per cent of Commonwealth outlays to just 12.6 per cent. The cuts in grants during the 1980s forced the states to shed around 12,000 jobs. Since then, grants were largely retained on per capita terms.</para><para>Mr Howard, as part of his federalism policy, promised to retain states grants in real per capita terms. That was a promise that his Liberal colleagues Jeff Kennett, Richard Court, Dean Brown, Ray Groom and Bob Borbidge were hoping he would keep. But at the 1996 Premiers Conference they, like the other 18 million Australians, found that what Mr Howard regarded as a promise and a core promise was quite different. The genuine anger at that Premiers Conference, and again last year, exposed the agenda of Mr Howard and Mr Costello. A fiscal contribution of $1.5 billion over three years was agreed upon, and that represents another 10,000-12,000 jobs lost. In 1997 it was TAFE, public housing, local government, public health, rail infrastructure and privatisation receipts that were raided. It is little wonder that the state premiers have so much to complain about with this government.</para><para>This year the issue was health funding, but I want to focus my comments today on one key aspect of the bill: the application of competition policy, particularly in relation to the local government sector. The Australian Democrats' opposition to the national competition policy goes back to and before the passage of the legislation through parliament in 1994. We do of course support the aim of improving the efficiency of Australian industries, utilities and infrastructure provision to reduce the cost to consumers and industry and to provide us with our international competitiveness. The problem, as is so often case, is the implementation. Often the broader effects of micro-economic reform are lost in pursuing economic neo-liberal or economic rationalist agendas. Governments have often become consumed with the figures and have forgotten the human dimension. This has been felt in cities but especially in the bush.</para><para>Where previously government instrumentalities had recognised a social obligation in the operations, this has now become a somewhat awkward extra tacked onto the commercial activities of corporations. The arguments over the cost of the universal service obligation for telecommunications is an excellent case in point. Those in rural and regional areas are particularly vulnerable in those kinds of circumstances. As government institutions have increasingly had to compete with corporations concerned with higher returns for shareholders, they have had to shed large numbers of jobs. One tenet of the theory underpinning competition policy is that more efficient industries will free up funds for more investment and that there will be greater consequent employment—the so-called trickle-down effect. But we see very little evidence of a jobs dividend; the dividends seem to be accruing squarely on the shoulders of the private sector companies rather than to directly productive industry.</para><para>The competition principles agreement talks about public benefits and costs in implementing the national competition policy. It is essential that there is consideration of a broad interpretation of public interest. The Public Interest Advocacy Centre propose that the public interest is more than `the balancing of competing collective interests'. They say :</para><para>. . . the public interest will vary, but will always include some element of social justice, empowerment and participation in decision-making.</para><para>Working for the public interest means challenging the self-defining right of those in positions of power to make decisions on their own behalf or on behalf of narrow constituencies, which will have a negative impact on those at the other end of the power or income spectrum.</para><para>In this connection, the recent resolution adopted by all parties in the Queensland parliament is very significant. They called on governments to take greater account of the social impacts of competition policy and to change the public benefit test so that it would:</para><para>. . . give full weight to issues including jobs and job security, social welfare and equity considerations, health and safety, and regional development as well as the interests of consumers.</para><para>I would add environmental issues to that as well. I foreshadow the Australian Democrats' 
 support for the motion by Senator Margetts in this respect.</para><para>The Australian Democrats will use these tests to closely monitor the implementation of competition policy to ensure that the interests of all Australians, particularly low income families, small businesses and those in regional Australia, are properly addressed. Clearly they have not been thus far.</para><para>The act before us makes available to the states a pool of $217.2 million in payments to promote competition policy. That is a recognition of progress in this area. The Commonwealth will take into account the advice of the National Competition Council as to whether the states have made sufficient progress in implementing the NCP and the principles laid down in the agreements. That was all agreed at COAG and, even though the Democrats believe that competition policy is yet another ideological attack on the public provision of public services, at least both levels of government agreed to it.</para><para>But competition policy has also been inflicted, without agreement and with only the minimum amount of consultation, on the local government sector. Right across Australia, local government is being turned upside down in an effort to come to terms with that. We see local government workers, particularly in my home state of Victoria, losing contracts to private contractors from, in many cases, outside their immediate area. When they lose those contracts, the area loses employment opportunities and money flows out of the community.</para><para>Competition policy reform has, for many rural and regional areas, been a very significant force in centralisation too. Local councils are not able to engage in the `buy local' policies and campaigns they might have had previously because that breaches competition policy. As the regulatory review processes crank up, locally determined by-laws will be reviewed, reducing the options available to communities to determine what they think are appropriate rules on, for instance, town planning and community amenities if the National Competition Council regards them as potentially anticompetitive.</para><para>In Victoria all councils must put to competition virtually all of their services. Forced competition policy was introduced at a time when local government in Victoria had government appointed administrators and it was used to significantly reduce services and conditions of staff. It also turned out to be a very costly policy to implement in terms of administration and very uneven in terms of delivering cost benefits.</para><para>Competition policy will be, and in some states already is, very intrusive into local government democracy and services. Yet, in spite of all that, there is no guarantee that local government will receive any of the payments from the competition policy bonus under this act, because these payments are subject to agreement between just two levels of government and not three, as is so often the case. I think this is a very clear breach of coalition policy before the 1996 election. That policy said:</para><para>A coalition government will build an effective partnership between federal, state and local governments based on frequent and high level consultation.</para><para>The coalition also promised to recognise the important role of local government in its policy. It said it would:</para><para>. . . seek to resolve issues of long-term importance to local government, including the declining share of revenue allocated to local government and the best way local government can participate in the benefits of national competition policy.</para><para>It would also:</para><para>. . . monitor the impact of the Hilmer reforms on rural communities to ensure that they receive their fair share of the benefits.</para><para>Principle 7 of the competition principles agreement signed in 1995 makes it clear that the agreement applies to local government, but it is entirely up to each state government as to how that is achieved. I would argue that, if competition policy is to be seen as a partnership between all levels of government—and it should be—then local government needs to be brought into the loop.</para><para>For the benefit of the Senate, the situation at present is that the Victorian state government has promised to local government a share of the competition payments and that 
 these will be delivered to local government at $50 million over five years. But, of course, this is dependent on assessment in council annual reports, a statement of compliance with the Trade Practices Act, achievement of the compulsory competitive tendering target, methods used to achieve competitive neutrality and undertaking of review of local laws for anticompetitive elements.</para><para>In Western Australia, local government has secured $5 million over three years at this stage. But there is a shining example; the Queensland state government has made an agreement with the local government association up there and it will give over $150 million over a five-year period. I must say that local government in Queensland, in so many respects, seems to be ahead of the game when compared to other states.</para><para>Our policy in this area is very clear. We oppose the use of competition policy to compel local government to tender out its services, as is the case in Victoria. We would also like to see the complete overhaul of our tax system as an opportunity for safeguarding the funding of local government. The financial assistance grants to local government should be restored to real terms per capita levels, as was promised by the federal government back in 1996. We would also generally prefer to untie federal grants to local governments, but encourage Commonwealth-local government agreements for the delivery of national programs and services.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>745</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank the senators for their contributions.

I say for the record that the poem appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> on 20 December 1890, about 108 years ago. The sorts of themes that we talk about now were talked about then. It is unfortunate that the great issues are still to be resolved.</para><para>I suppose, as generations go by, the same questions will arise and the answers will be sought. Whether the problem will be solved is another matter. When we look at Australia, we must look beyond simple economic theory—in particular, simple harsh economic theory. Otherwise Australia will go down the path of Kiley's Run.</para><para>In further consideration of the speech by His Excellency the Governor-General, which was given in this chamber on 10 November 1998, I mention the heading `Jobs and the workplace'. There is a lack of proper research into how the workplace operates. There is a lack of good investigation in Australia into how the workplace runs: whether it is better off when it is unionised or when it is not unionised or whether there is some other position. That is a trend around the world.</para><para>There has been some very interesting work done in the United States of America. I was given an article by Max Ogden, a very emi 
 nent intellect, who works with the Australian Council of Trade Unions. He is a man of great quality. Many a time he has stood with me behind the goalposts when Fitzroy have unfortunately lost more than they have won. But there were great days when we had great encouragement. We stood there for years. Unfortunately, Fitzroy has gone—another sacrifice to forces that operate, not always to the good of the country.</para><para>In any event, he referred me to an article which was published in <inline font-style="italic">Scientific American</inline>, a highly respected journal that deals with issues of science and related issues in America. The work was done by Sandra Black and Lisa Lynch. They put out this working paper No. 6120 for the National Bureau of Economic Research. I have an abstract from it and I think it is worth reading into the record. It says:</para><para>Using data from a unique nationally representative sample of businesses, the Educational Quality of the Workforce National Employers Survey (EQW-NES), matched with the Bureau of the Census' Longitudinal Research Database (LRD), we examine the impact of workplace practices, information technology and human capital investments on productivity. We estimate an augmented Cobb Douglas production function with both cross section and panel data covering the period of 1987-1993 using both within and GMM estimators.</para><para>I will interpolate there. As you can see, some highly technical processes have been gone through, which are set out in the article. I cannot fully appreciate it. Somebody with your great intellect of course could, Mr Acting Deputy President. All I am pointing out now is that this is work done on the basis not of impressions or anecdotal evidence but very scientific processes. The abstract goes on:</para><para>We—</para><para>that is, Sandra Black and Lisa Lynch—</para><para>find that what is associated with higher productivity is not so much whether or not an employer adopts a particular work practice but rather how that work practice is actually implemented within the establishment. We also find that those unionised establishments that have adopted what have been called new or `transformed' industrial relations practices that promote joint decision making coupled with incentive based compensation have higher productivity than any other similar non-union plants, while 
 those businesses that are unionised but maintain more traditional labor management relations have lower productivity. We also find that the higher the average educational level of production workers or the greater the proportion of non-managerial workers who use computers, the higher is plant productivity.</para><para>What they are saying is something that I think my colleague Senator Forshaw, who has vast experience in the union area, would no doubt have known for a long while—that the best way of getting productivity raised is to have high productivity workers in unionised companies. If the union and the company work in a proper relationship, that gives you higher productivity than where you have high productivity workers in non-unionised companies. Of course, where you have the union and the company in conflict, there is not so much productivity at all.</para><para>The point that is being made in this article, and that research shows, is that our national policy ought to encourage people to join unions and to encourage unions and employers to work on the basis of an understanding between them. If we get that going, then productivity is going to be higher.</para><para>We do not get higher productivity by making workers subject to employment where there is no protection. We do not get higher productivity, for example, through Australian workplace agreements. We get higher productivity by having a good, strong, sensible union in a good, strong, sensible company. I close with that. I think that Australia, and the nation as a whole, ought take on board the need for better economic policy and for a stronger union force.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>748</page.no><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name><name.id>656</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—At the outset, I pay tribute to the speech of my eminent friend Senator Cooney, not just because of his eminent status but also because of the content.

The Governor-General, outlining the government's program for the ensuing parliament, at the outset stated:</para><para>Above all, the government is committed to implementing the priorities for its second term on the basis of its unequivocal commitment to the Australian values of decency, openness, tolerance and a fair go for all.</para><para>I have to say that it is my belief—and I believe it is the view of the vast majority of Australians—that this government pays lip-service to those values and to that commitment. Far from being a decent, open, tolerant and fair go government for all Australians, I would submit that their record of two short years in government has demonstrated to be one of indecency, intolerance, hypocrisy, secretiveness and ignorance of history.</para><para>This coalition government obtained a huge majority when it was elected in 1996 at the end of 13 years of Hawke and Keating Labor governments. Yet within a short 2½ years, at the election on 3 October, they suffered the biggest first term reversal in Australian political history. They went from a position of having an overwhelming majority and the confidence of the people expressed in 1996 to a position where they lost 18 seats in the House of Representatives and two Senate seats. Furthermore, one of the six states, Tasmania, no longer has any representatives from the coalition in the House of Representatives.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>9L6</name.id><name role="metadata">MACKAY</name><name role="display">Senator Mackay</name></talker><para>—Hear, hear.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>656</name.id><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name></talker><para>—Hear, hear.

They went very close to tipping you out in 1998, and I am confident that they will finish the job at the next election.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Let us have a look at what actually happened at the election on 3 October. I want to address some remarks to the supposed mandate that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer—the government—claim for their GST.</para><para>The government won the election. They won a majority of seats in the House of Representatives. I acknowledge that. It is a statement of fact. Therefore, they retained government. It is also a fact that they did not get a majority of the votes of the Australian people. Indeed, the Australian Labor Party obtained a majority of the votes on a two-party preferred basis in the House of Representatives. They obtained 51.2 per cent of the votes of the Australian people on a two-party preferred basis—almost four per cent more than the coalition obtained on a two-party preferred basis.</para><para>This is not the first time that it has happened in the history of this country that the party that has won or retained government has not obtained a majority of votes. That is the nature of the way in which the votes have been distributed according to the seats. But it is very important because of some remarks that I will quote from the now Prime Minister that he made some years ago.</para><para>As I said, firstly, in the House of Representatives the majority of people voted against the government and voted for the ALP on a two-party preferred basis. Secondly and most importantly, in the Senate the majority of voters overwhelmingly supported those parties and those candidates that were specifically and implacably opposed to the introduction of a GST, namely the Australian Labor Party, the Greens and the One Nation Party. Over 50 per cent of people voted for those parties or groups who were specifically opposed to the GST in the campaign. The Democrats had a position which was opposed to the government's GST proposal but nevertheless one 
 whereby they were prepared to consider it. If you add in their vote, 55.8 per cent of people voted for parties that rejected the government's proposed GST.</para><para>You can talk all you like about having won a majority of seats and having won government and talk all you like about the supposed mandate theory of politics but the facts of the matter are that there were more people in this country at the last election, just as there were more people in this country in 1993 when the GST was on the agenda that voted against the coalition's proposed GST. They voted against the coalition's proposed tax policy changes. So, when the Prime Minister talks about his mandate and talks about what the people of Australia want, let us remember that the people of Australia, by majority, have voted against a GST.</para><para>I would just like to quote, and I am sure that my friends on this side—and, indeed, members of the government—will recall these words. Those opposite do not like remembering them, but I will quote them again. This is what the now Prime Minister had to say back in 1987, following an election where the then Labor government had proposed the introduction of the Australia card as part of its policy. Whilst we retained government, this is what Mr Howard had to say:</para><para>By any measure of any politician with any experience, the majority of the Australian people have turned against the identity card. If the Prime Minister and government members doubt our assessment of this, if they really believe that the Australian people have bought their argument about people opposing the card being friends of tax dodgers, why do they not put that belief to a test at a referendum and not hide behind the argument that there is some kind of mandate out of the last election? That suggestion is invalid, not only in terms of the number of votes cast but also on the simple proposition that when people vote in an election, they do not vote on only one issue. The mandate theory of politics from the point of view of proper analysis has always been absolutely phoney. The one thing that would not be phoney would be if this government had the guts to submit this proposal to a referendum.</para><para>I would invite the Prime Minister to take up his own words and have the guts to submit the GST proposal to a referendum. It is clear from the last election results, where the GST 
 was a major issue, that a majority of voters rejected the GST, notwithstanding that the government won the election as a result of having a majority of seats.</para><para>This Prime Minister, through the Governor-General's speech, talks about openness and commitments to decency and honesty. Of course, the Prime Minister no longer adheres to his views on the mandate theory that he announced in 1987 and he has not followed really any of his pronouncements at all since then.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZS6</name.id><name role="metadata">QUIRKE</name><name role="display">Senator Quirke</name></talker><para>—He wasn't too keen on them when he was destroying Whitlam.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>656</name.id><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name></talker><para>—Senator Quirke reminds me of that incident, but I also remind this chamber of a promise that he made not so long ago. Again, holding himself out as honest and decent and committed to these noble principles that we all should follow here in this country and particularly here in this parliament, he said he would not accept the vote of Senator Colston. Look how quickly he changed his position on that after the election. Why has he changed his position on that? For one simple reason: it gives him the opportunity to possibly get his GST legislation—which, as I have said, the majority of people in this country have said they do not want—passed by this Senate before the full results of the 1998 election are represented in this chamber after July next year when the government will have two fewer senators than it has today. He has reversed his position on that, but he still claims this is an open, decent, honest and tolerant government.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Let us also look at the way in which the GST was put before the people at the last election. Back in 1993, John Hewson at least had the political honesty and decency to put the proposal before the people well in advance of the election. It was out there and it was debated every day and every night through the media and in this parliament and everywhere else. But what happened on this occasion? Having indicated to the parliament and to the people months beforehand that he was going to bring down a tax package and allow plenty of time for people to debate it and assess it, what happened? The tax package was only released for people to scrutinise 
 after this parliament rose in July. The tax package was released first on 13 August this year. With no opportunity for the parliament to give it any scrutiny, for any of the parliamentary committees to have a look at it or for any proper debate to occur, the Prime Minister, rather than recall parliament, went to his election on 3 October. Just a bare six weeks after this major change in taxation policy in this country was put forward, he called the election.</para><para>During the election campaign the Prime Minister said, `We really haven't got all the detail for you at this stage but let us have the election and after the election we will set up an inquiry of some eminent business people to have a look at it.' We did not have the detail; we did not have the legislation. We particularly did not have, because the government refused to put it before the people—even after it was called for by the Labor Party and others—the Treasury analysis of the GST. When that was released after the election, it demonstrated that the GST was going to have a far worse impact upon pensioners, for instance, than had been acknowledged by the government. This was the GST that John Howard said we would never, ever have—another reversal of his position. Yet he says he runs an open, decent and honest government.</para><para>One of the most extraordinary arguments that has been put forward in order to suggest that the Senate should simply roll over and rubber stamp the GST has been that put forward by the Treasurer. He argued in an article on 11 November that senators who are currently in the Senate, having been elected in 1993—and will be here until July next year—should vote for the GST that was part of the election in 1998. Peter Costello's argument is that, because Paul Keating said in 1993 that if the people voted for John Hewson and his GST then the Labor senators would not stop it becoming law, that promise made by Paul Keating in 1993 should somehow be binding on senators in 1998, after an election has been held whereby a majority of the people voted against a GST.</para><para>The illogicality of the Treasurer's argument is that in 1993, when that promise was made 
 by then Prime Minister Paul Keating, the people rejected the GST and they rejected the coalition. They re-elected the Labor government, with the majority of seats and with the majority of votes. I do not know what has happened to the Treasurer's thinking of late but certainly, if that is the only logic that he can bring to bear and the only argument that he can put forward as to why this Senate should support his GST, then one has to wonder about all of the other arguments that he will be putting forward in support of his tax policy.</para><para>I will now turn to one other issue mentioned in the Governor-General's speech—the proposal to hold a referendum on the issue of a republic. I welcome that, just as I welcomed the fact that the people had the chance to elect delegates to the Constitutional Convention earlier this year and that those delegates then participated in the convention. The overwhelming view of the Australian population then was that they supported Australia having an Australian as their head of state. I have often wondered why it is that in the United Kingdom the House of Commons has greater power, particularly with respect to the position of the monarchy and their constitutional arrangements, than we do in our own country.</para><para>It is a fact in the United Kingdom that the House of Commons, if they so desired, could vote to change their own constitutional arrangements including—dare I say it—the abolition of the monarchy. They had a go at it in about 1630 with Charles I but later they did not think it was such a good idea. But that is certainly the political and constitutional position. I note that only yesterday Her Majesty, in giving the opening speech in the British parliament, indicated that they will be moving to abolish the automatic right of hereditary peers to sit in the House of Lords. I welcome the day when we will become a republic and follow the example of the British House of Commons. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>751</page.no><name role="metadata">Crowley, Sen Rosemary</name><name role="display">Senator CROWLEY</name><name.id>ZF4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Hear, hear, Senator.

You have invited yourself in as not frowning and therefore not aware. Your good colleague knows very well about it. We have had a Senate inquiry into regional unemployment, which meant the members of the committee traversed and travelled very widely across Australia. Unlike lots of committee inquiries, we took the opportunity to go deep into many parts of regional Australia. The story everywhere was the same: the cuts to government services—to social security, to tax offices, to the Public Service, and not only in Canberra but in particular in regional Australia—have had a devastating effect on these small regional communities.</para></talk.start></continue><para>When you add to that the retreat of the banks, the closure of many branch banks, you have a compounding effect. The retreat by government was faster and cut deeper than any previous experience, and that was very devastating. Public sector money was no longer available for spending in the local community. The people who had jobs are no longer participating in community activities, whether that involved the local football club, the netball club, the hospital board or whatever. Communities were suffering dreadfully.</para><para>On top of that came very high unemployment. It was bad, but it got worse, dramatically worse, under the Howard coalition government. Senators opposite can remind us of those figures but they are much worse under the Howard government. In the two and a bit years you have been here you have managed to increase youth unemployment considerably—to well over 30 per cent in most of regional Australia.</para><para>What did you do? You established a thing called Job Network. What a fiasco! What an unmitigated disaster! At its hearings around Australia, the Senate inquiry heard almost no 
 good news about Job Network. A few people said they were coping, a few people said that they were able to manage, but almost invariably those who were coping were those who had FLEX 3 people, the long-term unemployed, on their books, because they were getting an up-front contribution for that. They were able, therefore, to carry the cost of their FLEX 1 and FLEX 2. For everyone else the Job Network was a disaster.</para><para>We all know about Mr Khadar Roude who earned $1 million. He was successful in tendering for $1 million to provide Job Network services in outer Sydney. He turned out not to have a phone, an office, or any facilities at all. He did not last very long in the system.</para><para>Then there was Hospitality Horizons, a firm that won a contract for $15 million. I was particularly interested in that contract because, operating out of Sydney, they had responsibility for delivering a lot of those Job Network provisions to the Northern Spencer Gulf region, previously known as the Iron Triangle. Not one Hospitality Network outreach job service was provided in Whyalla, Port Augusta and Port Pirie, the three cities we visited in this region. We have since discovered that Hospitality Horizons has gone the way of a lot of the things that this government has had its finger in. It has gone to no good and to nowhere.</para><para>The big problem is that the providers who are left in the system are desperately overworked and receiving very small remuneration for their services. They are going to the wall too. The most decent and proper and hardworking of those people and organisations are now closing down in increasingly large numbers.</para><para>Also, many of the employers were vastly annoyed at having to pay up to $250 for assistance and for advertising to get people onto their books where previously the service was provided at no cost at all. In South Australia, some of the employers were furious because it costs $250 per advertisement and in certain parts of South Australia, particularly the Riverland area, much of the work is seasonal. They would be advertising four times a year for the one position, effectively, 
 compared to other people who might advertise once for somebody to hold a job for a year or longer. This is grossly unfair.</para><para>There is a rumour that those people do not have to pay. However, it is terribly interesting to know how many people did have to pay and so decided the Job Network was a useless organisation and they would be no part of it. They went back to putting `Job vacant' signs in their windows, and they went back to advertising in the newspapers. No wonder there are increased job ads for those people who count them as a sign of economic recovery. It is because they are no longer getting jobs through Job Network. It is an unmitigated shambles.</para><para>I come now to the dreadful treatment of the unemployed people for which this system is designed. It is designed to assist them back into the work force. However, at every opportunity the Job Network has made it hard, if not impossible, for such people.</para><para>The first group of people who were upset were those people who were not on any benefit. Suppose somebody, some man or some woman, loses his or her job and they are currently not eligible for any benefit. They are not on single parent benefits, they are not on unemployment benefits, but they have just lost their job, so they go to look for jobs. If they go to the local Job Network, what do they find? They are told, `You are eligible for no assistance at all. We want your name and your number, but we are not going to give you any assistance. You are not on any benefit.' It was very, very unkind and it was very, very inefficient. It was very, very heartless. The unemployed people were the last of your considerations.</para><para>When I continue this contribution in the address-in-reply debate I will pick up your recognition that you know it is hopeless.

Senator O'Chee quite rightly draws attention to the incredible opportunities that confront Australia if we can really take advantage of the information age. There is one thing that ought to be crystal clear and it applies to any sunrise industry, not just this one: the laws of supply and demand operate as iron principles. Clearly, the cheaper the products are the more likely they are to be in demand. The same applies to computer technology. That is why we were particularly concerned to ensure in our fundamental overhaul of the taxation system that a number of items that are currently priced so as to be discouraging for consumers are made much more attractive. You only have to look at computers, printers, keyboards, modems, scanners, digital cameras and a whole range of new age technologies—calculators, telephone answering machines, electric cords, electronic play stations and cartridges and fax machines—to realise that all of these are part and parcel of modern living.

I have to tell the Senate that this is the first time since we have been in government that any senator on that side has asked a question about local government. In fact, the last question asked about local government in this chamber was when Senator Calvert, a former warden of a local authority, asked Senator Bolkus something back in 1995. It shows how interested the Labor Party are in local government. So I am pleased, Senator Mackay, that you have in fact asked this question. I am pleased you have given some recognition to my former council, the Burdekin Shire. I have got to say they are a very good shire. They have gone off a bit since I was on it, I have to tell you, because if I was still on it they would not have asked some of the questions they have asked. They are fairly simple ones.</para></talk.start><para>Local government is keen on the GST and the tax reform agenda of this government. In fact, it is quite significant that at the recent Australian Local Government Association forum a motion was put calling upon local government to oppose the GST. It was put by Peter Woods, a nice fellow but an old leftie who was even expelled from the Labor Party. Do you know what happened to that motion at the local government national conference? It was defeated overwhelmingly. In fact, the couple of people who had the temerity to speak to it were almost booed and hissed off the stage. It shows that local government understands—and I do wish the Democrats would understand this as well—that we do need tax reform in Australia.</para><para>You would be aware from your attendance at that conference, Senator, which I very pleased that you and I were both able to attend and speak at, that local government, once the truth is explained to them, are very happy about the GST. They now understand that they do not pay GST at all. In fact, they get a huge break. Whilst before they did have wholesale sales tax exemption, there were embedded wholesale sales taxes in everything 
 they bought. Treasury has estimated that about $70 million of wholesale sales tax will go as a result of our program, so rates should be cheaper.</para><para>You mentioned councils in Queensland and you mentioned the Burdekin shire council. They use about 400,000 litres of fuel every year, and they are going to have savings of about 25c a litre on most of the fuel they use, because the benefit is for trucks that are over 3.5 tonnes. So there are big savings for the Burdekin council. The Local Government Association of Queensland, which is a very good organisation, have done some work and they have worked out that local authorities in Queensland will save—these are their figures, mind you—some $18 million because of the reduction in the cost of fuel to local authorities. That means big savings for the ratepayers—and big savings for your constituents, Senator. That is why they are very pleased with it.</para><para>You have asked about these regulatory matters.

The government has totally rejected the IMF's recommendation to 
 impose time limits on unemployment benefits. I want to make that absolutely clear from the outset. Australia's approach to welfare is unique in the world. It is a civilised approach—which has largely had bipartisan support over the years—to those who need some form of assistance in our country. However, the government released for the first time last week a public information notice put out by the International Monetary Fund, which is an independent assessment in relation to the Australian economy. The IMF said that its directors welcomed the government's efforts at labour market and social welfare reform. The IMF also said that the directors strongly endorsed the proposed tax reform package.</para></talk.start><para>Under our government, overall unemployment dropped to 7.7 per cent last month—the lowest since 1990 and the recession that we had to have, as we were told by Mr Keating—and our skilled vacancies rose by 1.1 per cent in November, continuing the growth trend over the past two years. Skilled vacancies are 18.8 per cent higher than in November 1997, and are at their highest level since January 1990. The number of long-term unemployed recommenced its downward trend in mid-1998, and women's employment has also risen each month in trend terms for each of the last 17 months since June 1997.</para><para>I believe that Australia and this government have struck a sensible balance in the provision of social support between two fundamentally important objectives: firstly, the maintenance of appropriate labour market incentives; and, secondly, the provision of an effective social safety net which reflects the Australian characteristics of a fair go for all and decency. Those in this place who care about the provision of social services should embrace tax reform, as that is an important way to stop the erosion of the revenue base which provides the funding for the social safety net, as well as the community services which will be provided into the future by both state and federal governments.</para><para>The IMF has also said that the introduction of a broad based tax on goods and services would enhance efficiency while protecting the revenue base from continued erosion. The 
 accompanying reduction in effective marginal income tax rates would improve the incentives for saving and employment. That is what the IMF says. The President of ACOSS, Michael Raper, has said that revenue is the lifeblood of the welfare system in Australia. He also accepts that tax reform is essential for the system's continued maintenance. I agree with Mr Raper, and the Labor opposition should listen very carefully if it wants to have any credibility as a responsible opposition. The IMF endorses our reform package. The government is determined to implement our election promise. I find it incomprehensible that any political party should try to stand in the way of the government implementing its most important election commitment.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Goods and Services Tax: Transport Industry</title><page.no>758</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>758</page.no><name role="metadata">Hogg, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HOGG</name><name.id>7L6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question without notice is to Senator Macdonald, the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government.

So the truck will have 22 per cent going, 10 per cent added on. But, of course, all of these trucks that run out into the country, all of the trucks that get the goods from the country and take them into the ports, are operated as a business. So, under our plan, all business GST inputs will be refunded fully and immediately. I will just explain that again: 22 per cent on trucks goes as the wholesale sales tax goes; 10 per cent is put on as a GST but, because it is a business input, the 10 per cent comes off.

Those of us who live in the bush—and there are many on this side; regrettably, very few on the other side—know what that is about. We talk to truckies and we understand what huge savings people in regional Australia will make. It is a simple factor.

Again, nobody takes into account the fact that nearly 14 per cent of people who go to private hospitals are self-insured, particularly for one-day stays. It has not got through to the Labor Party that this is in fact 
 what occurs in the real world. There is cross-subsidisation between the specialists in the public hospitals and the specialists in the private hospitals. Because nobody on that side has ever worked in this sort of situation, or it is so long ago they do not know what is occurring at the moment, they have no understanding of the health system of this country.

 March. That is shortsighted, it is not going to result in a good conservation outcome, and it is not going to result in the maintenance of forestry jobs based on a sustainable forestry industry—jobs for this generation and jobs for future generations.

On the basis of that performance, he is going to get a whole lot more from this side of politics. I will leave it to others to talk about the issue of the big trucks, the little trucks, the medium sized trucks and the B-doubles. I will talk about the question which I asked in relation to local government. It was pretty specific. This is what local government wants 
 to know: where will the GST apply to local government activities? They do not know. The Local Government Association does not have a clue. Unfortunately, after what has become very apparent today, neither does the minister.</para><para>The minister does not have a clue how the GST will apply to council activities. He was unable to answer one question that we put up in relation to specific activities. He did not have an idea. In fact, what he said, quite frankly, was I thought disgraceful. He said, `They don't pay GST—hang on a second; they do pay it, but then they get it back.' You cannot have it both ways.</para><para>The other thing he said which I thought was very interesting—and we have had this sort of response previously from Senator Kemp—was, `We will look at these matters over the next few months.' This is supposed to be a tax package which was taken to the election, in its entirety, with all the answers. This government said that there was no requirement for consultation, there was no requirement for the sort of Senate select committee that has been set up because the government had all the answers. But now we have ministers from this government saying, `We will look at these sorts of matters over the next few months.' That simply is not good enough.</para><para>The minister's own council, the Burdekin Shire Council, identified 201 out of 402 of their charges—half—on which they did not know whether or not a GST would be applicable. It is not simply the Burdekin shire that is looking for an answer. All of local government—in fact, most of Australia—is anxiously waiting to find out whether or not the GST will apply to the charges which they use every day. The reason this is so important to local government is that they need to advise their ratepayers whether there will be any consequential impact on rates. It is not correct for the minister to say that local government is happy with the GST. They are not happy with the GST.</para><para>When the minister made his fairly misleading comments about what was carried at the Australian Local Government Association meeting, he omitted to say that the reason 
 the motion was withdrawn or lost was that it was not adequate to meet the concerns that local government had with the entirety of this government's tax package. In fact, the motion that they carried referred to the abolition of financial assistance grants. They wanted a guaranteed six per cent share in relation to any GST; they wanted to make sure that a GST applied to the scope of commercial activities; they wanted to have questions answered with regard to community service obligations; they wanted to know whether a GST applied when only a nominal charge was levied. And on it went.</para><para>Local government want to know the answers. It is completely incorrect for the minister to come in here and say that local government support the GST and the tax package, because they do not. I will tell you what: the councillors that do not support it the most are from councils in Victoria. When Jeff Kennett gets his hands on local government, with the abolition of financial assistance grants, God help the councils. And they know that. It is not good enough for the minister to say, `We will look at it over the next few months. I don't have any of the answers.' The bottom line is that this government is supposed to have the answers, and it is absolutely outrageous that he was not able to answer one single question that we raised.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>768</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">Senator FERGUSON</name><name.id>EP5</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I must say that this is about the most pathetic line of questioning from the opposition that I have ever seen in my life.

I preface my remarks by saying that I am still the president of an organisation that is an 
 affiliate of the Road Transport Forum. I have a bit of an interest in and knowledge of the road transport industry. I can say that, from my own knowledge and from information I have received from my colleagues, the view of the Road Transport Forum is far from unanimous in accepting the government's GST package.</para></talk.start><para>I might add that the road transport industry over the last few years has experienced a lot of attention in relation to accidents and safety. One of my concerns in relation to the government's GST package is that, even though there may be pressure placed on the road transport industry to reduce costs to clients or customers, there is no legal device by which we can put pressure on those clients to pass that on to consumers. That is one of the great dangers that we have seen outlined by this GST package. Since the government has been in power, national road funding has been cut by $684 million. However, we are still expecting road transport to run on the bare bones it is running on now.</para><para>What I am concerned about is that there is a lot of hope being pinned on the fact that by the introduction of this package there will be a reduction in costs passed on to consumers. In the end I believe the road transport industry will become the middlemen in this tug of war between producers and retailers and consumers. We already have an instance of the relationship in the deregulation of fuel. At the moment, in the City of Dubbo, Woolworths have been able to supply fuel through their retail outlet. They are able to purchase that bulk fuel 9c a litre cheaper than can any of the franchisees in Dubbo. Yet, they have a marketing strategy of reducing the price to consumers by only 2c a litre below the price at which franchisees make it available to the consumer. There is no device to make Woolworths look at their profits or to pass those reduced prices on to the consumers of a town like Dubbo.</para><para>My concern is that if and when this new tax regime gets under way, we will have a situation where road transport will be further pressured to provide even more efficiencies and cost efficiencies and, at the same time, the government is going to institute a new 
 police force through the ACCC to try to see that those prices are passed on to consumers. It will not be the road transport industry's fault if those reduced prices are not passed on to the consumer. You may well think that, by having the ACCC do that, that will reduce the costs. That will not occur because there is no legal device, as I said earlier, to make the retailers pass those savings on to the consumers.</para><para>What will happen is that we will have so much pressure once again placed on the road transport industry that the only area at the edge and the margins is safety. My concern and, I am sure, the concern of a lot of Australians, particularly a lot of road transport users and workers, is that we will see this occur because of the pressure that will be placed on our people to make these deliveries. The savings will not be passed on to the clients as there is no mechanism whatsoever in any of the government's proposals to ensure that that occurs.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>770</page.no><name role="metadata">Watson, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WATSON</name><name.id>VJ4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The GST will have a big impact in terms of reducing costs to rural and regional Australia.

The mining industry, like some of the transport industries, will no longer pay the hidden wholesale sales tax on so many of its business inputs.

These get added to the costs of the produce from rural and regional Australia, taking it to the ships, taking it overseas, et cetera. So this is good news.</para></talk.start></continue><para>What we have to emphasise, and this is the hard thing, is that transport, mining, rural and regional industries—every business—will be able to claim input tax credits for the whole thing because the wholesale sales tax will go and in its place we will have tax debits and tax credits. If you are in business you get a credit in respect of all your input taxes for that period.</para><para>It is not only the wholesale sales tax that will go; we will see lower costs of fuel and this is going to benefit our state because the fuel costs—the excise costs of the diesel which is used for the trains, the trucks, the ships and so on—will reduce quite considerably. Off-road use of diesel, particularly by the mining industry—and I emphasise that because the mining industry is important for Tasmania, just as it is important for Queensland, Western Australia and the other states—will be one of the big beneficiaries.</para><para>In addition to the GST input tax credit on diesel, real benefits come to on-road businesses using vehicles of over 3.5 tonnes. Heavy trucks of a certain mass load weight and railways will get a GST credit equal to around half the excise paid on the fuel. The impact of that will be a reduction in the effective excise rate from 43c per litre to 18c. If you cannot tell me that is not going to reduce the cost of fuel, perhaps you need to go back to school again.

 also mean lower industry costs. That is certainly good news.

Senator Ferguson referred to the line of questioning today by our side in respect of big trucks. That was the issue: it was about big trucks—not little trucks, but big trucks. It was about the road transport industry.</para></talk.start><para>It should be no surprise to Senator Ferguson or anyone else on his side of the chamber that we took the issue up. Yesterday, in response to a question from Senator Ferguson—a dorothy dixer—Senator Ian Macdonald tumbled into the road transport area and started to tell us about big trucks. And that is all we heard about—big trucks. But what did we find out? Nothing.</para><para>We were told in yesterday's answer that there was going to be a 22½ per cent reduction. In my question today I asked about this 22½ per cent reduction, and Senator Macdonald, without batting an eyelid, moved into 22 per cent mode. The fact is that when answering the question yesterday—the dorothy dixer—it was 22½ per cent. If you look at the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> it will show 22 per cent, but if you listen to the tape and look at the pink you will find that it was 22½ per cent. So, obviously, half a per cent disappeared in the correction process.</para><para>It is legitimate for us to ask a question about the savings. One only has to look at the government's own documents. Today I also asked the government about the savings as per their own document. Page 169 of their tax package contains a table headed `Cost effects (by industry) of indirect tax reform'. In category 61.01, Road transport, the cost to the operator is down by 6.7 per cent. I do not know if that is an accurate figure. One can only assume that there will be cost reductions based on the tyres, the tarpaulins, the ropes, 
 the chassis and everything else. But page 172 of the <inline font-style="italic">Taxpack</inline> contains a table headed `Price effects (by industry) of indirect tax reform'. Price effect is the price to the consumer. Under this heading, the same item—61.01 `Road transport'—shows an increase of 2.6 per cent.</para><para>When I asked the minister today to explain the difference, the minister had no idea. He could not even grapple with it. We ended up going down the road of a champagne luncheon or something like that. What did we want from the minister? We wanted a clear, concise answer as to why the difference. We wanted to know whether the savings would be passed on. We were told the savings would be passed on. But—and this was raised by Senator Hutchins who spoke before me—there is no guarantee at all that the savings will be passed on. The minister did imply that the savings would be passed on. But when he was asked latterly, by me, about whether or not there would be a 22 per cent reduction in the cost of the big trucks, we found there was no guarantee at all. The minister was not able to give a guarantee.</para><para>This was supposed to be an issue of no interest. The government could not see why it was of interest to us today although it was of interest to them yesterday as a dorothy dixer. Yesterday it was an issue with a real place in the sun. The government—as demonstrated by the minister—do not understand what they are talking about. Obviously, they do not understand what the impact will be, particularly in rural and regional Australia.</para><para>According to their own documents, there is going to be a price impact on the consumer out there in rural and regional Australia. That is because it is these big trucks which take the building materials, the food, the clothing, the produce, the livestock, the grain, the feed and the agricultural needs into rural Australia. And in decentralised states like mine, it will undoubtedly have a real impact indeed. So the minister really botched it. He did not understand what the question was about and it is a shame that he did not stick around to participate in this debate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>771</page.no><name role="metadata">Calvert, Sen Paul</name><name role="display">Senator CALVERT</name><name.id>5F4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I do not rise very often to speak

Tourism in Tasmania is booming at the moment. Your state colleague Jim Bacon has forecast that tourism is going to be the big winner in Tasmania.

</para><para>Getting a world heritage listing is like getting a Nobel prize for the environment. It is only given in some cases to the places on our planet with the most outstanding cultural and natural values. It is a tribute to Australia that we have a disproportionately high number of places of world heritage value—13, in fact. This should not be taken lightly. These places must be treated and managed in a way that does justice to the very special places that they are.</para><para>I am very sad to report that this government is unfit to manage world heritage. This government has no idea of the value of world heritage and little understanding of or interest in maintaining their outstanding characteristics. The government tries to tell us that they are doing good things for world heritage and that they are only allowing things to happen inside the borders that will not destroy or threaten world heritage values.</para><para>The Democrats know that this is rubbish. The majority of the people of Australia know that this is rubbish and want the Jabiluka mine stopped. And now the highest international umpire of world heritage has been given a report by their investigating team saying that the government's spin is implausible. What is the response of the government when faced unequivocally with their evidence? The Minister for the Environment and Heritage wants to grab the ball and go home.</para><para>According to the minister, the report is biased. This is surprising because the field mission was in fact informed by the very people the coalition government suggested. It was Senator Hill who wrote to the Academy of Sciences and the Academy of Humanities and asked them to make a submission on the Jabiluka mine and they said that, in their opinions, the mine was wrong and that it would wreck the values of the area. And now they are supposed to be biased. It is clearly the case that the government does not like the responses. The only thing that they can try to do is build up a case that everybody else in the world except the coalition government and the uranium company is wrong.</para><para>There comes a time when even the most stubborn people must admit that they are wrong. I suggest that that time has come for 
 this government. The minister must pull out of this mess now and proclaim Kakadu world heritage area and use that as the lever to stop this mine.</para><para>It is not just Kakadu that is in deep trouble because of this coalition government. It must be clear to UNESCO by now that Australia is not protecting the areas it has listed. The feeling coming back from UNESCO is a complete exasperation with our government's attitude. There are, of course, other uranium mining leases in Kakadu ticking away like time bombs.</para><para>The Great Barrier Reef is a vast area and no-one expects economic activity there to stop. However, the Bjelke-Petersen spectre of oil drilling still occasionally rears its head. A massive open-cut shale oil mining industry is about to take off on the coast of Queensland, with a mine and a processing plant coming into operation this week just north of Gladstone. At Gladstone and alongside the Whitsundays, huge shale oil deposits and mining tenements reach down into the intertidal zone well within the world heritage property. Propped up by public subsidies, this is a massive growth industry whose greenhouse gas emissions and potential to damage world heritage values have so far been totally ignored by the federal minister for the environment.</para><para>There are the significant impacts of the Port Hinchinbrook development and the run-off of acid sulfate material on the edge of the Great Barrier Reef. Nearly the entire reef is open to heavy trawling, with by-catch devices to protect turtles and other marine life still not mandatory. Reef areas are supposedly protected but they are still subject to trawling.</para><para>Significantly, today the National Greenhouse Strategy is released, in the same week as the international experts are saying that global warming is causing massive coral bleaching and coral die-off worldwide. I think this is particularly ironic for Australia, which has repeatedly upset international attempts to come to a unified position on climate change. The Western Australian government wants to excise 3,000 hectares of world heritage property at Shark Bay. This is the home of the famous Monkey Mia dolphins. Shark Bay 
 is a stunning natural area which will pull in more tourist dollars as its popularity grows. But, inexplicably, it faces the proposed expansion of a salt mine into the world heritage area—as if salt was not a commodity available elsewhere. Oil exploration licences cover a very significant proportion of land and water, and there are mooted proposals to develop a very large mineral sands operation.</para><para>In Queensland also, the Cape York nomination process goes on and off the agenda with every change of government. In Tasmania, forests along the buffer of the south-west world heritage area are being cleared for logging, and the coalition government refuses to nominate the Tarkine area. In Victoria, the magnificent East Gippsland forests, which are highly likely to pass the world heritage test should any government be wise enough to nominate them, are being pulped and exported to create milling jobs overseas. Overall core budget money for world heritage has declined significantly, despite Minister Hill using Natural Heritage Trust Fund money to mask this.</para><para>The final insult is that taxpayers are paying to destroy or damage our world heritage. Subsidies given to loggers and miners are very high: more than $200 million in the case of shale oil mining and tens of millions in the case of forests. When the full economic arguments are presented, conservation and sympathetic use of world heritage areas would, I expect, come out way in front. This coalition government is destroying a number of our precious world heritage areas, and the Democrats submit it is a national and international disgrace.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>774</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Environment and Heritage</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Rarely have I heard so many falsehoods, inaccuracies and prejudices in such a short contribution.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>AW5</name.id><name role="metadata">CARR</name><name role="display">Senator Carr</name></talker><para>—You were on the phone.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>BH4</name.id><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name></talker><para>—I can talk on the phone and listen to a speech in here at the same time, Senator. It is a skill you learn with time.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I thought what I should do in my short time is to address briefly the report that has been put down by the UNESCO mission to Aus 
 tralia on Kakadu. This was a mission that was sent out to look at the effect of the Jabiluka mine on the world heritage values of Kakadu. It was sent out basically at the request of protesters, principally those who protest against uranium mining per se but also, no doubt, some who have concern about mining in an area in a region that clearly has very important natural and cultural values. That is what the key to this is all about, because the easiest thing to do when faced with such a challenge as to whether an alternative use threatens particular environmental or cultural values is to say that it should not go ahead, to in effect answer no. The much harder task is to do a thorough analysis and make a fair and objective judgment on the facts.</para><para>We were faced with a situation here where there is an existing mine, the Ranger mine, in the vicinity of the world heritage area. It has existed for 18 years. It is an open-cut mine supervised by the Supervising Scientist on behalf of the Commonwealth government and the Australian people. Basically, it has been found that it is operated in that very fragile region without any environmental damage whatsoever. The second prospect that we were faced with is the Jabiluka prospect, which has been around for a long time. It was specifically excluded from the world heritage area and from the park also, because it was a mining lease upon which a uranium mine was intended to take place. Not only was Jabiluka not included within the world heritage area but, at the time of the creation of the world heritage area, the Aboriginal people, the traditional owners, had given their consent for a mine at Jabiluka.</para><para>We assessed that mining prospect with the challenge of determining whether it could be conducted in a way that was safe for both environmental and cultural purposes. We did that last year through an assessment of the mine itself, an assessment that involved periods of public consultation and analysis of public submissions. It was a very comprehensive process. We found that, subject to 77 conditions that were imposed, the mine could proceed without any threat to environmental values, consistent with the experience of the Ranger mine.</para><para>This year we addressed what was, in some ways, a greater challenge—whether milling and disposal of waste could take place at the Jabiluka site, again without threat to environmental or cultural values. The preferred option was that it take place in the existing Ranger plant so it would add no significant extra challenge. If we erred in relation to addressing that task, we erred on the side of caution. Although the mining company suggested the use of new technology—which was cementing the waste into specifically created disposal pits—my department's view and some of the scientific observations were that there was some risk associated, based on both the new technologies and the geomorphology of the site.</para><para>We erred on the side of caution by rejecting the mining company's preferred option, which I have just described, and said that we would only consent to the milling and disposal if the waste was disposed back into the regional mine void—in other words, put back from whence it originally came, where there is no doubt at all that it would be no threat to the environment or other values, basically forever at that depth. It is a very stable natural system, and I do not think anyone suggested that there could be any leakage of any waste element in the future. We chose the most cautious of all options.</para><para>The advice that I had was that, on choosing that option, we could be absolutely confident that there would not be a detrimental consequence to the environment. After the assessment process this year—and bear in mind that this is the latest of a series of assessment processes over the year in relation to Jabiluka—we also reached that conclusion. This does not satisfy those who are opposed to uranium mining and it does not satisfy some who are opposed to uranium mining in that region. They have been agitating for the world heritage organisation to play a part and, ultimately, a mission was sent to look at this issue. That is what has been addressed in the last few days.</para><para>To say the least, we were disappointed by that mission, basically because it came to the following conclusion:</para><para>The mission seriously questions the compatibility of mining, and particularly uranium mining and milling, in such close proximity to a World Heritage property.</para><para>On the basis of that, it said that the mine should not go ahead. It totally ignored the fact that there has been an existing mine there for 18 years and that it has been demonstrated that, important though the natural values are in the region, they can be properly preserved while mining takes place. Ultimately, the mining site will be rehabilitated and all that has come from it is the advantages of wealth—money to the Aboriginal community. </para><para>It is worth noting in passing that over $2 million will go to indigenous interests from Jabiluka. A  substantial amount of money—over $48 million—has gone to indigenous interests from Ranger, with jobs and all the other benefits that come from a prospect such as this. Jabiluka is big money. There is no doubt about that. It is a $14 billion resource, ultimately for the betterment of all Australians. Having said that, however, no matter what the money is, no matter what the material benefits are, if we believed that there was any threat to the environment or cultural values from it, then we would not have given it our consent.</para><para>Without developing a case to oppose the mine, the inquiry simply found that it should not go ahead because it is hard to imagine that it could be compatible with those values. It ducked the difficult issue—the three years of detailed analysis that we undertook to test whether mining could be compatible with those other important values. The mission simply dropped in for four days in Kakadu, talked to some interests, and determined that it was incompatible and should not go ahead. That sort of shallow evaluation is what we particularly criticise. There will be major consequences from such a superficial evaluation, which we could not but help think, on the basis of looking at this document objectively, amounts to prejudice more than anything else.</para><para>Apart from that, they talked about the scientific uncertainties. What were the scientific uncertainties? That was a submission 
 from four scientists from the ANU who did not want the mine to go ahead. That is four scientists as against all the in-depth scientific evaluation that has gone through the assessment processes, and also the 18 years of scientific supervision of Ranger.</para><para>The next factor they got onto was a concern about the cultural issues in relation to the indigenous people. The indigenous people in the region are divided on this issue. I table a letter from Jonathan Neidjie—the son of Kakadu Bill, a legend in the region—who speaks on behalf of the indigenous people as a whole and asks me and the Australian parliament, `Why is it taking so long to get this mining venture under way in order that we can get the material and other benefits from it? Why are we being prejudiced by one small group of Aborigines—traditional owners in relation to this site, but only a part of the total indigenous community that has a right to have a say in the development of this prospect?' <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>776</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I must say at the outset that that was a very disappointing intervention by the minister. It is disappointing because, once again, we have the minister trying to gloss over the truth. Once again we have the minister getting stuck into the UNESCO committee and, once again, we have the minister not being prepared to address point by point the concerns.</para></talk.start><para>We are not talking about just any matter here at all. We are talking about a matter that is of immense national importance to Australia. It is a matter which has and will affect our international standing. I have to say that after 2½ years of lobbying for Senator Hill to become foreign minister, I think the Prime Minister has made the right choice. Senator Hill, you are no diplomat. We have seen that in the last 24 hours from the way you have handled this committee. Your behaviour has affected our international standing, and it will continue to do so. It also affects our national priorities. Internationally, it will affect how we are treated and how we are respected. At every meeting an Australian minister goes to until this matter is cleared up, the issue of Kakadu will be raised. If Kakadu is not 
 placed on the endangered list, this is an issue we will not be able to avoid in our international relations.</para><para>Nationally, both economically and socially, we have to get this right. When you are talking about world heritage property areas, when you are talking about an area such as Kakadu, you have to recognise that this is one of the chief tourist magnets in Australia. If you jeopardise that, those jobs you are talking about in respect of uranium mining will be insignificant compared with the number of jobs we will lose in the tourist industry and related areas.</para><para>This is not the only area that Senator Allison referred to in her urgency motion. She talked about the way this government handles our world heritage areas. It is no secret that the World Heritage Committee does have concerns, not just in relation to Jabiluka but also with the way we are proceeding with the Great Barrier Reef, Shark Bay, the Tasmanian wilderness world heritage areas, and so on. This is a government that is not meeting its national responsibilities or its international commitments, and the world community is starting to look at us.</para><para>I must say that nowhere is this behaviour more demonstrated than in respect of the proposal for Jabiluka. We have had over the last almost 24 hours now a bizarre attack on UNESCO and on internationally respected personalities by a minister who has, over the last 12 months in respect of this issue, shown a mixture of, I must say—and I say so in sorrow—recklessness and ineptness.</para><para>This issue of protecting Kakadu is of importance to all Australians. Poll after poll shows that some 70 per cent or more of Australians are concerned that we do protect this area. Seventy per cent or more are concerned that mining does not go ahead in Jabiluka. With that backdrop, it is quite amazing for the minister not to go through the adequate processes and not to go through a full defence of his position; rather, he has chosen to go through an attack on the other side. He said, `It was a hard decision for the government to make, but we erred on the side of caution.'</para><para>This is a government that had a report from Environment Australia, the minister's own department, which was quite damning in the way it criticised quite a number of aspects of the proposal. It is a report that identifies some 77 conditions, most of which have been watered down by the minister, and particularly by other ministers in the government. It is a report that makes very clear the view of his department. On page 125 it says:</para><para>There remains potential for significant adverse impacts upon World Heritage and National Estate values, especially indigenous values . . . </para><para>This is what the minister's own department said. How do the government respond to that? How do they respond to concerns from their department? They responded in a quite cursory way. You would have thought, listening to the minister on television again today, that this would be a minister showing enormous care to make sure that habitat, environment and cultural values are being protected.</para><para>The report of his own department on page 54 quite clearly says that they did a flora and fauna ecological assessment, but they did it in a way which did not please the minister's own department. This is a government acting contrary to its own department's advice. Environment Australia says, quite rightly and not with any sense of hysteria, on page 54 of its report to the minister:</para><para>Environment Australia does not consider that the flora survey conducted by helicopter for the draft environmental impact statement (D 6-39) constitutes an appropriate study of vegetation potentially affected by the project.</para><para>So careful are they that in terms of a critical aspect of this proposal, of the critical implications of it, of checking out the impact on fauna, flora and ecology, they do a study, and they do it by helicopter! Come on, Senator Hill, you do not expect us to believe your glib rhetoric when your own department exposes a lack of caution, care and concern in respect of this!</para><para>The story so far is that we have had a committee come to Australia. We know that UNESCO's World Heritage Bureau is meeting in Kyoto in Japan this Friday and probably next week. We do know that the UNESCO mission came here. Before they came here we 
 had the minister saying they were welcome to come here, that we wanted them here, that they will give us a chance to show off our assets, and that we are very proud of our management of world heritage in Australia. He went on to say further that the World Heritage Bureau has in fact commended Australia on its standards in protecting world heritage and that that was not surprising because we are up to the world's best standards. He was prepared to invoke them in support. But by the time they got here on 30 October, when he got a sense that the tide was running against him, this minister who wanted the bureau here said, `Oh, well, we've said that we believe that the mission is unnecessary.' Senator Hill, you did not believe that the mission was unnecessary at the start. It is only when you got wind of their concerns that you did not want them here. And it has only been in the last 24 hours since you have had access to a report that is quite damning in its nature that you have decided that you would not address the report, and you personally attacked members of the commission.</para><para>I have to put on the record that, in its report, the mission said:</para><para>The Mission noted the serious concerns and preoccupations expressed by some of Australia's most eminent scientists as to unacceptably high degree of scientific uncertainties relating to the Jabiluka mine design, tailings disposal and possible impacts on the catchment ecosystems.</para><para>The mission shares these concerns and therefore recommends application of the Precautionary Principle which requires that mining operations at Jabiluka be ceased.</para><para>It is a very clear statement, and the implications are very clear. Of some 552 world heritage sites listed on the World Heritage list, Kakadu may very well become only the 26th to be listed as `in danger'—and this in Australia, a developed nation with the economic resources to protect its World Heritage assets. If Kakadu is listed, then it will become a major and severe embarrassment to Australia.</para><para>I have to say once again that the minister's behaviour in the last 24 hours of attacking the committee in the sense of trying to intimidate the committee will do nothing but backfire. 
 The minister has maintained his cool for the last couple of years, but he has lost it on this issue. When you personally attack people of the status of Mr Francioni, the only reaction in the world community will be for them to wonder what sort of hick mentality is dominating this government and this parliament.</para><para>The approach of the minister and the government is of concern. The minister raises a couple of points, but consistently, over the course of this process, there has been a systematic attempt by this government to keep vital and critical information away from the public—not only away from the Australian public, but also from this international commission that was in Australia.</para><para>In this place we have tried to get released and to have produced all the relevant documentation in the lead-up to the approval. We know that the approval was made in haste before an election to placate rich and powerful industry friends. We know that. We know that there are major inadequacies in the process that the minister embarked upon.</para><para>If the minister has nothing to fear in this respect, he should come into this place and table the documents. As I said, two weeks ago we tried to force disclosure in this place, but the government, together with their newfound lackey, Senator Colston, resisted that attempt.</para><para>Senator Hill, if you believe in what you say, if your case can stand up, come in here and table the documents and let us see how it stands up after that. I have to say that every document that has been leaked against the government on this particular matter shows—in document after document in sequence—that this is a government that has not met its responsibilities in terms of the environment.</para><para>The attack on the UNESCO body is extraordinary and bizarre. It ignores the fact that the mission to Australia was the highest level ever UNESCO mission to this country. In fact, it was the highest level UNESCO mission to anywhere in the world in terms of the expertise and seniority of its membership, so do not try and vilify the chairman by calling him just `a mere lawyer'. That was a strange comment to come from this government, which has so many `mere lawyers' on 
 their front bench, not only in this place but in the House of Representatives.</para><para>Do not try to belittle this committee, its status and reputation; recognise that this is one of the highest status committees of UNESCO to come here, and one of the most respected in terms of expertise and seniority of membership. In fact, it comprised representatives of the eminent US advisory bodies IUCN, ICOMOS, the World Heritage Bureau and the World Heritage Committee.</para><para>Also, do not try to misrepresent the facts by saying the numbers on the committee were against protection on environmental grounds. The only two people on this committee who stuck with the government, the only two people on this committee of seven who did not advocate listing, were the two scientists hand-picked by the minister. Every other impartial member of this committee has gone against Senator Hill and the government. I think his performance on television last night, trying to manipulate the media into believing that the numbers were in fact stacked against the proposition that the mine should not go ahead on environmental grounds, was a misleading one.</para><para>Let us face it: we have a government here that does not really care about international responsibilities. We have a government here which, in every case when the previous Labor government tried to protect property—whether it was the Franklin, Uluru, the Great Barrier Reef and so on—always resisted the use of national powers to protect those areas. It is a government that does not believe in the utilisation of those powers. It is no surprise that in this particular instance we have a government not prepared to meet its responsibilities.</para><para>So what does Senator Hill say now? He has had the committee here: this process has been going for some time. He himself published the report. Now he says, `I want another six months; the Kyoto conference should not be ready to consider this because we have not had a chance to put Australia's case to the committee.' You have wined and dined the committee, Senator Hill. You had them within your care and responsibility for some time. It 
 is only when they disagreed with you that relations blew up.</para><para>To now come out, at this last moment, and say, `We want six more months', should be seen by Australians and the international community as Senator Hill trying to buy time to lock up the process. He wants to be able to come in here in six months time and say, `It's too late; the mine has gone ahead.' Once again, that really is a failure of responsibility by the minister.</para><para>This is a minister who did not fight Senator Parer in the early processes but who now wants to be in a position to lock up the mine and lock international and national concern out of it. I remind the minister again that over 70 per cent of Australians want to protect Kakadu from this particular mine.</para><para>The other line he runs is, `We've had another mine. We've had Ranger there for 18 years, and there have been no environmental impacts of concern in respect to or arising out of Ranger.' It has to be said that it is not only the view of the opposition, but also the view of eminent independent scientists, as well as the view of the minister's own department, that we are talking about two different propositions altogether here.</para><para>Let us place on record that there have been problems with Ranger in terms of the release of waters and so on, and let us also put on record, from a document which the minister did not want to publish, what his department thinks in respect to Ranger and Jabiru. On page 128 of Environment Australia's assessment report, the department says:</para><para>More importantly, however, is that there are a number of significant differences between the two projects.</para><para>That is from the minister's own department. And the advice of scientists is the same.</para><para>When you look at the advice of scientists like Dr Bob Wasson with respect to the Jabiluka mine, you find that they are talking about a mine which, in many respects, because of the physical configuration of the site, has enormous problems. It is a mine—particularly because of its proximity to important waterways—which has important problems that we need to take into account. 
 For instance, it should be placed on the record that the Australian Academy of Science has nominated a group of prestigious scientists, led by Professor Bob Wasson, to present concerns to the inspection team.</para><para>What did the Wasson report put to the inspection team? It noted:</para><para>. . . the design of bunds and all other structures to contain tailings, water and other wastes at both Jabiluka and Ranger is based upon principles that are grossly inadequate. We simply do not know if the designed structures can withstand the major rainfall events of the future so the integrity of Kakadu National Park cannot be guaranteed with any probability.</para><para>Let me repeat that: their view is that the integrity of Kakadu National Park cannot be guaranteed with any probability. The report is also highly critical of the waste management strategies and water analysis associated with the Jabiluka EIS. It states:</para><para>The EIS consultants have underestimated the extreme rainfall and overestimated evaporation at the mine site and take no account of climate change.</para><para>We are talking here of eminent Australian scientists. They are not just concerned about the two factors they mention; they are concerned that the assessment process for this mine has some fundamental flaws.</para><para>Firstly, there was a desperate and hasty decision to permit the proponent to meet the requirements of tailings disposal by returning 100 per cent of tailings to the pit. There is enormous concern about that. Secondly, there is enormous concern that the original advice of Environment Australia to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage was not made public for many weeks; in fact, it was made public only after the visit by the mission. Thirdly, there is concern that the project should not have been commenced in the construction stage prior to the completion of the PER.</para><para>The minister's own department is saying, `Look, this mine is too critical to allow it to go ahead unless conditions are met. But this government is giving approval for the mine to go ahead even before the preconditions laid down by the minister's own department were met. The minister comes in here and says, `We decided 77 conditions would have to 
 apply to the mine.' What he did not say in his glib disregard for the truth is that his department put down 77 conditions and that those conditions were watered down substantially by his colleagues in cabinet—by Senator Parer. For instance, one of the conditions is that the Office of the Supervising Scientist be in control of supervision in the area and should have responsibility for the crucial aspects of the management of the mine. That condition has been watered down to read that ERA has a responsibility as far as is practicable to meet environmental concerns.</para><para>We have here advice from a government department saying that there has got to be strict regulation, but the government is saying, `Oh, well. Self-regulation is good enough.' Self-regulation is not good enough in this area because the implications of damage to Kakadu, both nationally and internationally, are enormous. It is not good enough for the minister to come in here and glibly make references to those 77 conditions when he knows that the conditions set by the government are nothing like the conditions laid down by his own department.</para><para>I have not even got to cultural values.	We are talking about Jabiluka, we are talking about Kakadu—an area which was inscribed on the world heritage list as:</para><para>. . . representing a masterpiece of human creative genius and for being `directly or tangibly associated with ideas or the beliefs with artistic or literary works of outstanding universal significance.'</para><para>The Australian Academy of Humanities notes:</para><para>The Jabiluka area is archaeologically rich. There are over 100 rock art sites within the lease. A site known as Malakunanja 11 is one of the most significant rock art sites in Australia and may be more than 50,000 years old.</para><para>What did the government do to monitor and make sure that they had got a full appraisal before they went ahead and gave a licence? They checked out the area by helicopter.</para><para>Senator Hill has not met his national responsibilities as environment minister on this particular issue for quite some time. In the last 24 hours he has lost the plot, he has lost his cool. As a consequence, he has ensured that this particular area of Kakadu will be on the endangered list. If that happens, then this 
 government will stand condemned for not meeting its responsibilities.</para><para>It is the responsibility of the Senate to pursue this matter. I give notice now that the best and most immediate way we can pursue it is to bring Senator Hill to task and make him produce documentation which is quite critical. That documentation has to be tabled. The opposition will keep pursuing that. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>781</page.no><name role="metadata">Tambling, Sen Grant</name><name role="display">Senator TAMBLING</name><name.id>6E4</name.id><electorate>NT</electorate><party>CLP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The motion before us today is that, in the opinion of the Senate, the following matter is a matter of urgency:</para></talk.start><para>The failure of the government to properly manage its world heritage areas.</para><para>Not surprisingly, that is the motion presented by the Australian Democrats on this occasion. I would contrast it very starkly with a motion that is today before the Northern Territory parliament which is so vitally affected by this issue, whether it is Kakadu or Jabiluka. The motion that will be passed in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly today reads:</para><para>That this assembly reaffirms our commitment and support for uranium mining in the Northern Territory and the continuing development of the Jabiluka Mine.</para><para>That motion will be passed, and I will be very surprised if it is not passed without the support of the Labor Party in the Northern Territory. So there is a conflict between the comments just made by Senator Bolkus and the actions that are so very important to the people of the Northern Territory, both in the wider community and specifically in the Aboriginal community.</para><para>It is also important to look at the report that has been highlighted by Senator Allison—the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation report on this particular issue. As Senator Bolkus said, it has an important membership—seven members, including two Australians. The most important part of the report is annex 1—signed by Professor Jon Altman of the Australian National University in Canberra—which has been developed jointly with the other Australian on the team, Dr Roy Green. In his letter 
 to Professor Francesco Francioni, Chairperson of the World Heritage Committee, Professor Altman highlighted the total dysfunctionality of the complete report. I draw the detail of that letter to the attention of everyone. There are two full pages that go into specific details.</para><para>I emphasise that Professor Altman has in the past carried out work for the Northern Land Council, the Central Land Council and the Australian Labor Party. He is certainly no stooge of this Commonwealth government or the Northern Territory government. I will quote from what he says in that letter:</para><para>We remain disappointed, however that our views on a number of major issues have been disregarded without an attempt to mediate our differences on whether the final report should have a no-mining statement.</para><para>He further says:</para><para>Recommendation 1: There was no recommendation from the majority calling for immediate halting of the Jabiluka mine.</para><para>He also says:</para><para>Recommendation 2: The treatment of scientific issues is selective, accepting evidence to support the position not to countenance Jabiluka and disregarding all other evidence, including the world-class work carried out at Ranger. We are concerned at the dismissal, without discussion or argument, of credible scientific evidence put forward by scientists with two decades experience in the region.</para><para>Very obviously this UNESCO report is pre-written by a fundamentalist green team with no regard to local evidence, to evidence properly presented or to local knowledge. It is prepared, I would say, by impractical, interfering, international busybodies—sticking their noses into other areas.</para><para>The economic benefits of Jabiluka include a capital investment of $70 million just to develop the mine. The earnings from Jabiluka and Ranger are estimated at more than $12 billion in revenue over the next 25 years; 87 per cent of this revenue, or almost $10.5 billion will remain in Australia. There will be a $6.2 billion increase in GDP. Jabiluka will increase Australia's wealth by $3.8 billion over the anticipated 28-year life of the mine.</para><para>In the area of employment, there will be over 160 jobs in the construction phase. When the new mine becomes fully operational, 110 
 new permanent jobs will be available. Both Ranger and Jabiluka will generate 1,500 indirect jobs.</para><para>The Aboriginal benefits include $210 million in royalties over the anticipated 28-year life of Jabiluka for the Aboriginal community. To date, Aboriginal landowners have received a total of $48.2 million in royalties, up-front payments and rent from Ranger. An additional $87 million in royalties has been distributed through Commonwealth agencies among Aboriginal communities across the Northern Territory.</para><para>What else should we have regard to? We as a Senate should have regard to the <inline font-style="italic">Kakadu regional social impact statement</inline>, which was prepared, properly discussed and debated at various places. That report is now being implemented under the proper and appropriate chairmanship of former senator Bob Collins, who has a job looking after interests in that area. That report says at page 9:</para><para>Traditional ownership is not a static construct and such issues can be, and are, fiercely contested in a region like Kakadu that has been depopulated and repopulated.</para><para>It also says:</para><para>There is no ready means to return to some pristine pre-uranium mining, pre-national park regional state that is independent of government.</para><para>I also turn to a report of a committee that you chaired, Mr Acting Deputy President Chapman, the report of the Senate Select Committee on Uranium Mining and Milling that was tabled in this place in May 1997. This is the document we should be debating—not some document prepared by a mob of international tourists who flitted into the place with preconceived concepts and did not spend the time that your committee did, Mr Acting Deputy President. That important report is totally owned by and signed off by Senator Mark Bishop and Senator Margaret Reynolds of the Labor Party. I quote from it:</para><para>The hazards of mining and milling uranium, if those activities are properly regulated and controlled, are not such as to justify a decision not to develop Australian uranium mines.</para><para>The Senate select committee found that the principal findings of the Ranger uranium environmental inquiry, the Fox report, re 
 mained valid as the foundation for policy on mining of uranium. I quote from page 35 of that report:</para><para>The ERA mine at Ranger is widely regarded as the most regulated mine in the world. This observation is especially true of supervision and monitoring of Ranger's impacts on the environment.</para><para>Sure, there is an impact of uranium mining on Aboriginal communities but employment is important. It certainly is one of the impacts. There are also issues relating to parks and tourism. Also, the draft environmental impact statement indicates the number of people who are looking at this area.</para><para>The Territory ALP's position on uranium has been well documented. Senator Bob Collins is on the record in this place as having recognised the reality of uranium mining in the Territory. Mr Jonathan Nadji in a letter to Senator Hill has expressed his extreme disappointment.</para><para>This whole issue of Aboriginal consent is vital. In 1982 and 1991 the people approved it. The next generation have now walked away from that. We cannot have this sort of inconsistent decision making. It is time the Mirrar people took seriously their obligation to use uranium resources to contribute to their own economic and social welfare—and also recognised their privileged right to contribute to other Aboriginal needs and to the wider Northern Territory community. It was their elder statesmen and generation, the parents and grandparents of Yvonne Margarula, who made these decisions, and the cultural values are not just a moving feast to be played with by the Democrats and the Labor Party. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>782</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I agree with Senator Allison that the government has failed to manage its World Heritage areas properly, to manage the heirlooms and icons of this nation—the creme de la creme of the natural and cultural areas that this nation, together with the rest of the world, has placed on the World Heritage list, not only for the celebration of the world communities in our time but for the celebration of all future generations. That is so often forgotten in a close-up knockabout debate about such 
 things as mining when it is undertaken in the way that the government has done.</para></talk.start><para>What is really at the centre of this debate this afternoon is the reprehensible behaviour of the minister `for the environment'. That is his title, in this government. Never before in all the history of people occupying that office has any minister not only disregarded his responsibility but time and time again gone against that responsibility to argue against the interests of the environment that he is supposed to be serving. That is why I would agree with the honourable Leader of the Opposition, Mr Kim Beazley, when he said in public that this is the worst performing environment minister this country has ever seen. The litany is very long. It goes through greenhouse gases to the protection of World Heritage properties to the awesome destruction by the logging industry which he has been the purveyor of in his years as minister.</para><para>The current situation in New South Wales, where hundreds of thousands of high conservation value forests are going to be fed to the chainsaws by the Carr government, is compounded when you hear this minister for the environment stand in this chamber this afternoon and say, `That is not enough. I would feed more into the chainsaws.' I have here photographs of the trip the minister for the environment referred to, when he went to the Tasmanian World Heritage area vicinity after assuming the mantle of minister. Here he is, standing in a clear-felled area of World Heritage value forests—although they are not within the World Heritage area—looking at what is going on around him. Since he has been to those forests, he has personally sounded the death knell for the destruction of the very forests he was looking at, World Heritage value forests. Once again he has done this against the advice of his own department and against the advice of world authorities on those forests.</para><para>When it comes to Kakadu, the best he and Senator Tambling can do this afternoon is try to emphasise the difference of opinion that can be found within the indigenous community in this country, which is no less valid, I guess, than the difference of opinion that can be found within the wider community. Sena 
 tor Tambling began his contribution by referring to a motion which is naturally, by force of numbers, going to be passed in the Northern Territory assembly today. He said that this is where the real opinion should be. I submit that he is wrong. If he wants to bring it down to the fine point, the real arbiters of this decision ought to be the traditional owners, the Mirrar people, who are rock solid 100 per cent against this destructive mine being built in the Jabiluka valley under the auspices of this minister for the environment, who goes against the very name of his ministry.</para><para>Those people are now being represented at this all-important World Heritage committee meeting in Kyoto. I do not know what the outcome of that will be but I do know this: this minister will be leading a political onslaught against the top environmental and World Heritage advice in the world which says that this mine, quite clearly, is a danger to the cultural and natural values of that magnificent Jabiluka valley. What a disgrace this minister is. What a disgrace this government is. What a reprehensible way to be letting down the environmental values which his office ought to be upholding, which this government ought to be upholding, not only on behalf of the Mirrar people and this nation but on behalf of the whole planet and all future generations.

I think this motion completely misrepresents the government's position on this matter and the general issue of World Heritage listing. The real central issue of this is whether the indigenous people of the area have really suffered any loss or have gained any benefit from uranium mining at Ranger and the proposed mine at Jabiluka. Let us have a look at that. First of all, uranium mining in the Kakadu region has provided substantial benefits to Aboriginal people in the area for more than 18 years.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>1M6</name.id><name role="metadata">ALLISON</name><name role="display">Senator Allison</name></talker><para>—Ninety per cent of children in Jabiluka have scabies.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>4L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Eggleston, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">Senator EGGLESTON</name></talker><para>—I doubt very much whether that is anything to do with 
 uranium mining. It is more a public health issue. While you may seek to tie scabies and all sorts of other things into the possible undesirable side-effects of uranium mining, I do not think that would really stand up to any sort of serious examination.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The government has sought to maximise opportunities for traditional owners and other people in the Kakadu region in relation to mining in Jabiluka through a sound statutory network which provides mechanisms for representation, statutory royalty equivalents and negotiated benefits. Since the Ranger mine began back in 1981, a total of $48.2 million in benefits have flowed to the traditional owners. That is a lot of money and it has been of great benefit to that Aboriginal group.</para><para>The money that has gone through to the Aboriginal community has been made up of $1.3 million in up-front payments, $3.4 million from rental payments and $43.5 million in royalty equivalent payments. That, as I said, has amounted to $48.2 million. The proposed Jabiluka mine, which has not yet commenced operation, has already generated $3.7 million in benefits for Aboriginal people under the 1982 Pancontinental agreement.</para><para>These include $1 million in July 1982 distributed by the Northern Land Council. The Djabulukgu Association, which I think is the local Aboriginal group, received 80 per cent of that while the Gagudju Association received 10 per cent and the Kunwinjku Trading Association, which is now known as the Narbalek Traditional Owners Aboriginal Corporation, got 10 per cent. Eight hundred thousand dollars, comprising four annual payments of $200,000, went to the Northern Land Council for its administrative costs. Senator Allison, I think even you would agree that is a useful benefit to the entire Aboriginal community of the Northern Territory. A total of $1.2 million on commencement of construction is to be distributed by the Northern Land Council in the same proportions as in 1982. These funds are all held by the Northern Land Council.</para><para>Under the 1998 deed poll, there is $0.1 million on commencement of construction for NLC administrative costs; $0.25 million on 
 commencement of construction for a women's resource centre is to be distributed at the direction of the Bininj Working Committee; $0.315 million on commencement of construction will be used for social impact monitoring; and $0.7 million on commencement of construction will be used for the control of alcohol.</para><para>Alcohol, drugs and glue sniffing are the serious problems which the Aboriginal communities in the north of Australia face. If Aboriginal communities can receive royalties from mining and minerals, which are under the ground already and over which they have walked for millions of years without any adverse effect, then I am all in favour of this for the benefit that it brings. These figures do not include various ad hoc payments to Aboriginal interests. Over its life, the Jabiluka mine will provide a further $210 million to Aboriginal interests. It is expected that these funds will be used to complement government programs and provide additional benefits in the areas of housing, community based education, cultural heritage and land management programs, development of a regional Aboriginal languages interpreting service—<inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>	 Question put:</para><para>	 That the motion (<inline font-weight="bold">Senator Allison's</inline> ) be agreed to.</para></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>16:35:00</time.stamp><para>The Senate divided.	</para></division.header><para>(The President—Senator the Hon.

Collectively, they have just announced profits of $5.6 billion for this year. Over the 1990s, a period with low inflation and modest economic growth, these four banks have increased their profits by almost 440 per cent. The profit of these banks has increased by almost 440 per cent over the 1990s. To put this in perspective, the big bank profits have grown 3½ times faster than the economy as a whole. No other industry, no other sector, has been able to do as well or even come close to the banks 
 in the last 10 years. This has been driven largely by the retail side of their activities.</para><para>Each bank is currently earning a 20 per cent-plus return on its capital for its shareholders. It is unheard of to have a sustained 20 per cent on retail. Mums and dads, ordinary Australians, have seen their banks charging them and closing their branches. It is in the retail area that the banks have been really making their profits. A 20 per cent return on shareholders' funds in low inflationary times is a historic sustained high for banks. These levels have come from massive increases in the volume of home lending, despite the margins having fallen from mortgage originators providing direct competition. I will return to this point later because it is very important.</para><para>The banks have also been able to achieve this level of returns on their retail sector. The accounts of the banks published in the last few weeks have made this clear. In 1997, the big four banks earned $3.2 billion more from fees and charges than at the start of the decade. That was a massive increase in their non-traditional income. The big four, before abnormals, increased their profits this year by seven per cent. The NAB in particular increased its profits by 13 per cent.</para><para>What lies ahead for the sector? One analyst was quoted in the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review </inline>recently as saying that margin pressures are abating and the threat of mortgage originators has been contained. This should send a shiver down the spine of all Australians. Banks are starting to say, `We've got the mortgage originators, Aussie Home Loans and all the people like that covered now. It has been a bit of a bulge, but we have got them covered.' This is very worrying. APRA, the new regulator for banks, has warned that banks' overall margins are going to be squeezed as the Asian crisis works its way through the economy, meaning reduced profits. So APRA is warning that the economic circumstances mean banks are not going to be able to grow in the way they have.</para><para>Others are not so pessimistic, however. There are people in the markets who are forecasting average earnings per share growth of 10 per cent for banks, despite the contrac 
 tion in the Australian economy—on the government's own forecasts, on the market's forecasts—dropping down to anywhere between two and 2½ per cent. What we are going to see is the economy starting to slow down. That is universally agreed. There is debate about how much. But what we are going to see is banks still maintaining, on average, across all their sectors—not just their retail sector—a level of 10 per cent.</para><para>Cost cutting has been a part of the equation, but some believe that there is not much fat left. How in the absence of the easy cost cutting will banks keep delivering to their shareholders who have been enjoying a five-year bull-run of almost constantly rising share prices?	A recent report by Rahoul Chowdry from Price Waterhouse Coopers pointed out that about $1.3 billion from banks' interest income has gone, because of the home loan originators. One point three billion has gone from banks' margins—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">CAMPBELL</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Campbell</name></talker><para>—Who wrote that speech?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name></talker><para>—Are you allowed to speak in this debate?

They are gouging their customers, their retail customers, their mums and dads, bigger and better than anybody else. But they are not alone. The Commonwealth reported a 23.7 per cent, or 
 $361 million increase in its fees. Westpac had an increase of a mere 15.2 per cent, equating to $264 million. That is what banks have been doing over the last 12 months with fees and charges and the benefits they are getting. What has the NAB to say in the light of this? Mr Hadyn Park, their spokesperson, said there was no link between the bank's profits and branch closures. He said increases in fees were unavoidable as lending margins were squeezed by low interest rates and free services could no longer be subsidised by interest earnings. Compare this with the comments of Mr Hockey, the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation, in the other place on 24 November 1998—earlier this week. He said:</para><para>There is a simple choice here: do you want lower interest rates, do you want competition in the provision of financial services—</para><para>It is funny but I always thought interest rates were driven by inflationary expectations and other factors. The margins are meant to be driven by competition. Mr Hockey went on to say:</para><para>The trade-off has been that people are starting to pay for some of the services that they are demanding of the bank—</para><para>That is right—demanding of the bank. Pensioners are demanding to be able to walk into their bank and take their money out using a teller, and now they are being forced to pay. It is an absolutely unbelievable statement by the minister.	 But I guess the ultimate insult in the minister's speech came at the end, and this sums up the government's view. The minister, Mr Hockey, said:</para><para>. . . we have the opportunity to get the full benefit of user pays.</para><para>The full benefit! I am not sure how much more of the full benefit battling Australians can afford to get under this government. The government has recently introduced the brave new world of Wallis, something which the opposition supported in principle, as Senator Campbell knows, but we did raise some concerns over some of the issues in this area. Senator Campbell and I both spoke on it at the time the bill was being debated.

If it's going to be part of the social welfare fabric of this country then it has to be recognised as (such).</para><para>Earlier, Mr Wallis told journalists that cross-subsidisation would disappear as other areas of banking became more competitive, delivering overwhelming consumer benefits. He said:</para><para>The overriding consideration (of the inquiry) is clearly to deliver the consumer a better deal.</para><para>So Mr Wallis, the Wallis inquiry and the report that he brings down, say that the overriding consideration of the inquiry is to deliver the consumer a better deal. What was the view of Mr Costello when he introduced the government's response to the Wallis report on 2 September 1997? He said:</para><para>The measures I have announced today will facilitate greater choice and competition in financial services. They will encourage more rapid innovation, providing wider access and enhanced levels of service. Australia will have a world class regulatory structure that ensures the highest standards of prudence and safety and consumer protection. Regulation will be more efficient, with greater consistency and less overlap. More openly contested markets will drive lower industry costs and prices.</para><para>To drive lower industry costs and prices is the aim. That is what this government says it wants to come out of its regulation and what it wants to achieve for ordinary Australians. Mr Costello was asked a question on 20 June 1996. He replied:</para><para>May I say in relation to fees as well, this government takes the view that red-hot competition is the best way of having continual surveillance of financial institutions on each other in relation to fees, just as it is the first and best port of call in relation to interest rates.</para><para>Red-hot competition.

 worry about that. What has been the result of this red-hot competition? The National Bank has led the changes, increasing its minimum balance applicable to fee-free transaction accounts from $500 to $1,000. The bank has also introduced a charge for customers failing to pay minimum monthly balance on credit cards within 30 days of the due date.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The ANZ Banking Corporation will raise its monthly account keeping fees from $4 to $6, introduce a $15 charge on lost cards and raise the cost of stopping cheques from $7.50 to $15. It has also introduced a $6 monthly fee on pensioner deeming accounts for balances below $500, all to come into effect on 18 January.</para><para>Westpac raised its annual fee on selected credit cards from $18 to $24 and is introducing a fee for overseas foreign currency purchases or cash advances by credit card, effective from 1 January. St George has already implemented similar types of things. From 1 December, as we saw last week, the cost of over the counter withdrawals at a Commonwealth Bank branch will go up from $1.50 to $2 and a fee on a cash withdrawal from an automatic teller machine, an ATM, will jump from 45c to 60c. But red-hot competition will have further benefits for battlers. Industry experts are predicting the changes by the Commonwealth Bank last week will trigger a new round of fees and charges, increasing over the next six months.</para><para>A recent study by Marketfaxts of transaction account charges reveals that almost all fees levied by the major banks increased, and in some cases doubled, in the past year. Is it any wonder that the recently established Financial Services Consumer Policy Centre will investigate anti-competitive and unfair fees and charges, in particular the question of whether there is any collusion on fees. How much more of the benefits of red-hot competition can battlers take under this government? I would like to now turn to the issue of branch closures and the impact on the community. Banks are more than just a financial institution, they form the core of a community, particularly rural communities. Many small shopping centres depend on the proximity of a bank. It is obvious that you shop where you 
 bank. If you close the bank, the shoppers will move and your shopping centres are going to die.</para><para>A recent study by the University of Queensland concluded that when the last branch in an area is closed, 90 per cent of respondents are more pessimistic about the future of their community and 39 per cent say they would like to leave the town as well. That is the direct impact. This has been recognised by ANZ recently which announced they have allocated $10 million to support community banking initiatives in both rural and metropolitan areas. This has been partly in response to the outcry and partially due to Bendigo Bank's establishment of community branches and its criticism of the behaviour of the big four. The jury is out on ANZ but it is a welcome move and I wish them success.</para><para>A recent survey of Sydney's branch network revealed some startling findings. More than 100 Sydney suburbs or localities have been left with reduced services or no branch. In the past three years—since the end of 1995—138 branches have closed in Sydney.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>O15</name.id><name role="metadata">TIERNEY</name><name role="display">Senator Tierney</name></talker><para>—Tell us about the 1,600 branches under Labor.

Where have you been, and where are you going to vote today, Senator O'Chee? One Nation has put you out of a job because you have allowed this to happen over the last three years. You have run, you have hidden and you have paid the price. Banks must recognise that they have an obligation to their customers to provide accessible services. 
 Pushing some customers who are the most vulnerable in our community into electronic banking, either by removing face-to-face access or making it so expensive that you cannot afford to use it, is unacceptable. Some may say a $2 over-the-counter fee is trifling. When you realise that two over-the-counter transactions will wipe out the GST compensation that this government plans to give pensioners after it introduces the GST you begin to realise the unfairness of this behaviour.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Then there is the attitude that Mr David Murray, the head of CBA, demonstrated so clearly at an American Chamber of Commerce lunch in Sydney a few weeks ago when he made his now famous quote:</para><para>Instead of politically inspired letters that I get for closing a couple of branches, the people of Australia should be sending telegrams of congratulations to each of the major banks, and some of the others as well.</para><para>This is from the bank which has closed 223 branches—just a few, he said—in the last three years and which voted just recently to give Mr Murray $15 million worth of options as part of his remuneration. As we all know, Mr Murray was forced onto national TV and had to apologise.</para><para>I would like to return to the question of margins and interest rates. This is a critical area if a judgment is to be made about the banks and this government. This is the key decision. Much has been made about lower interest rates by the `big four' and the government, including the Treasurer, the Prime Minister, Senator Tierney and Senator O'Chee. They say the customers are the beneficiaries of lower interest rates.</para><para>In the early 1990s there were many complaints about the great spread of rates—the level of real, as opposed to nominal, rates. The banks had made some disastrous loans to entrepreneurs in the 1980s—don't forget that. They lost the money. What did they do to fix it? They repaired their losses over time by maintaining some of the highest spreads of rates in the world for many years. Remember that? Do you remember the big differences—the comparisons made with banks around the world? We were the worst.</para><para>You could argue that ordinary Australians were picking up the tab for the banks' poor lending practices to shonky entrepreneurs. This was the beginning of the anti-bank sentiment. You can pick it up from back then. It could be argued, if you wanted to be sympathetic to banks, that they made some massive losses and they had no choice—the parlous state of the balance sheets required some action.</para><para>Today we have a very different world. Despite claims by the `big four', I say to them and to the government that you cannot hide behind this low interest rate argument. The London <inline font-style="italic">Economist</inline> has exposed the real story. The spread—that is, the difference between the lending and borrowing rates in Australia as measured by the prime overdraft rate and the 90-day bank bill rate—is still the highest in the world for the 15 OECD countries that they surveyed. That is right—it is still the highest. This proves the lie. This is damning evidence. The falling margins allowing cross-subsidies is the argument for increasing fees, but the spread is still the greatest.</para><para>The banks point to the low interest rates and say, `Look, we're not making the money we used to,' but they are still trying to deceive ordinary Australians. It is not the five per cent or the six per cent rate that matters; it is the spread between what they are paying on the money that they are lending out and the money that they are receiving. It is the spread that matters. The government is facilitating this argument by allowing the banks to gouge huge fees while claiming they cannot afford to cross-subsidise. It is not the level of the interest rate that matters; it is the spread.</para><para>This is the sort of deceit that causes the ALP to demand formal monitoring of bank fees and charges and to seek to have the ACCC conduct this monitoring and, if necessary, full price surveillance. Policies that seek to force the poor, the old and the disadvantaged out of banks is un-Australian. It is the behaviour that evokes sympathy for calls for banking licences to be made conditional on the provision of appropriate transaction accounts for all Australians.</para><para>There has been much speculation in the markets following Don Argus's comments about the bank mergers. As Professor Tom Valentine and John Phillips, the former Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank, agreed recently, the prime motivation for many takeovers was the megalomania of chief executives—bigger bank, greater status, bigger pay. That is from very senior individuals who have worked in the banking sector. That is not from some socialist left or Far Left Trotskyite; it is from Professor Valentine and a former Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank.</para><para>Mergers are being driven purely and simply by the megalomania of chief executives and their egos. The NABs `national champion' line is a joke. Merge all four and you may get an internationally competitive bank, but allow two to merge and you will have no choice but to allow the other two to merge. Then what happens? Neither would actually make the top 20 of world banks and neither would fit the category of the national champion. So what is left? If this is the rationale, you are still short of your target. Do you allow the remaining two to merge? <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>790</page.no><name role="metadata">Tierney, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator TIERNEY</name><name.id>O15</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The ALP has an absolute, colossal hide—moving a motion like this. What it completely overlooks is the ALP's appalling record on monitoring the evolution of the banking system. Senator Conroy, your ALP government was asleep for 13 years on this issue. What you have also completely overlooked in your contribution today is the transformation in banking created by modern telecommunications technology.</para></talk.start><para>We are in the midst of a banking revolution. The way we bank has changed incredibly rapidly, thanks to the technological advancements of the last few years. Today we can bank over the phone; today we can bank on the Internet. These changes are proceeding at an incredibly rapid pace and are going to make life easier for all of us. But, as we change, there is a transition period to be worked through. In the last few days we have heard about banks raising certain fees, and we understand why this has upset many people in 
 Australia. Even the banks understand that they have upset their customers.</para><para>Westpac's short form annual report for 1998, which I received today, says, `Because of the way banks are changing and charging for their services, perceptions of banks have not always been positive.' People's perceptions about banks are not always positive. We all hate standing in lines; we all hate paying bank charges. But we all tend to love the 24-hour access to our money that ATMs provide on virtually every street corner. We all love being able to buy our groceries with electronic transfer through the EFTPOS transaction points. We love being able to withdraw money at service stations and to conduct our banking over the phone 24 hours a day. We love being able to shop around at the different banks for better deals, and that bank lenders and advisers will visit us now in our homes at our convenience. This is a massive change from banking practice 20 years ago. What we love most of all—and this is a point that Senator Conroy tried to hide—is the fact that interest rates are now down around five and six per cent—levels we have not seen in this country since the 1950s.</para><para>The banking industry is changing at an incredibly rapid pace and that is the change we are dealing with here today. According to the 1997 financial system inquiry report, people are also changing very much the way in which they bank and this has put pressure on the banks. The inquiry found that as more and more customers maintain transaction accounts with only working balances, net interest income declines forcing the institutions to rely more heavily on fee income. In the past banks covered these costs through higher interest rates on loans and lower interest rates on savings. Yet their real costs come from people's active transactions accounts and it is on these accounts that they have begun to levy charges. They are spreading their costs more fairly.</para><para>The Commonwealth Bank, whose announcement of fee increases sparked this debate, is the perfect example. The other side is complaining that the Commonwealth Bank is increasing fees on their costly services but they conveniently ignore the fact that they 
 have announced a drop in fees on EFTPOS transactions in supermarkets, shops and service stations. Over the last few years we have had a vast network of cash points created by the EFTPOS system—electronic funds transfer at point of sale—right across the country in service stations, supermarkets and other places, creating an enormous increase in convenience, particularly as shops are now staying open for much longer hours.</para><para>This and phone banking are the way of the future. Now people can bank anywhere in Australia at the cost of a local call. They can pick up their phone and do their banking any time, day or night. When I rang the National Bank this morning I was told that this banking incurs no extra fees or charges. Already 30 per cent of Australians over 18 use phone banking. The banking industry is changing with this technology. Even as we speak, banking from your home or work through the Internet is becoming more and more common.</para><para>The biggest and the best change to banking in recent years though has been the huge drop in housing interest rates. We all remember what happened with interest rates under the Labor government. That is another point that Senator Conroy was not to keen to dwell on. Who remembers the 17 per cent interest rates and the crushing burden this placed on individual families and businesses? Who remembers that at that time the banks were struggling to survive? They were writing off billions of dollars in bad debts caused by the high interest rate policies that were forced on this country by inappropriate economic policies designed by Paul Keating, the Prime Minister at that time.</para><para>Since the coalition has come to power interest rates have fallen. They have fallen now from the high under Paul Keating of 17 per cent down to around 6.7 per cent. With competition banks are offering many home buyers rates even less than this. The Labor Party gets up here today and talks about this government monitoring bank fees. Under us housing interest rates are up to 10 per cent lower than what they were when you were in power. What did you do about monitoring bank fees in those 13 years you were in power? Four days before the 1996 federal 
 election you said that you were going to write to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and request that the commission formally monitor fees and charges on bank retail transaction accounts. Before anything came out of that, you lost government. So your record in 13 years on monitoring bank fees was zilch. You did set up an inquiry about four years before you left government, but that just went around in circles. By the time you had finally lost government nothing had come of that process at all. You were the Rip Van Winkles of monitoring in relation to the banking industry. So again I repeat that you have a colossal hide getting up here today and moving a motion like this.</para><para>Let us look at another area under the coalition government. Senator Conroy talks about bank closures. He very conveniently talks about bank closures in the last three years. He does not compare that with bank closures over Labor's term in government. He also overlooks two other points: the number of bank agencies has increased in recent years and the access to facilities through Australia Post, such as giroPost, which gives people banking access where there are post offices, has also increased dramatically over that time. This is in stark contrast to what happened under Labor. Between 1991 and 1996, 1,600 bank branches and agencies closed their doors. This has affected some rural communities very harshly. In contrast to this the coalition is committed to ensuring that rural Australians have access to this very basic provision. For this reason this government has been proactive in this area—unlike the Rip Van Winkles opposite for 13 years.</para><para>With our policy at the last election we have created a program of rural transaction centres. Under this program there will be $70 million over the next five years to establish over 500 rural transaction centres. The great thing about the centres is that they are focused on smaller towns. If you go to the bigger centres in Australia such as Dubbo, Bathurst, Wagga and those sorts of places, you will find you have got a reasonable spread of banking facilities. Where there is a great lack of these facilities in Australia is in the towns of between 500 people and 3,000 people. They 
 have always struggled to have adequate facilities.</para><para>We are now moving towards a better system for people in these communities. Banks have indeed closed some major branches, but the program of transaction centres will open banking facilities in these towns. It will provide not only banking facilities but a wide range of other facilities. There will be fax and phone services at these centres. There will be postal services, personal banking and limited business transactions, automatic tellers and Medicare Easyclaim. These facilities have not been in these towns before. So, instead of a retreat of services from the bush, this initiative of this government, the Rural Transaction Centre program, will actually advance more centres into the bush.</para><para>In addition, if we have a look at what has happened with the rural banking agencies, we find that that is also an improving trend. In 1995 there were 2,500 rural banking agencies; in 1998 there are 3,000. It has actually gone up by 500. On top of this there are the giroPost facilities that have been a recent phenomenon in Australia through Australia Post. There are now 2,720 of these. So, through what has happened with giroPost, through what has happened in expansion of agencies and through what we are going to do in rural transaction centres, there is an increase in banking services now and there will be more into the future. We are moving into the 21st century with the program that we have set in place to support banking facilities, particularly in the bush. And the banking industry is moving with us. What is important is that people are not left behind. The coalition's policies are making sure that this does not happen. We are making sure that the 21st century will start with low interest rates and banking that will be available to all Australians through the wonders of modern telecommunications technology.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>792</page.no><name role="metadata">Hogg, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HOGG</name><name.id>7L6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I heard what Senator Tierney had to say on this matter and I do not believe that the government are moving towards a better system.

 done—to charge its customers $2 to withdraw money from over the counter.</para></talk.start><para>The <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline> is just one of the papers that reported this. It drew people's attention to the fact that the charge for withdrawing over the counter goes from $1.50 to $2. In my terms, that is a 33⅓ per cent increase, and that is a massive increase when you consider the inflation we are currently faced with—low inflation which this government wants to brag about. And here we have a bank raising its charges by 33⅓ per cent purely and simply because the customer wants to deal with a real person on the other side of the counter. What the Commonwealth Bank is doing there is really a disincentive to employment and a disincentive for people to go and deal with their fellow human beings.</para><para>The <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline> article about the new charges says that the fee for ATM withdrawals with the same bank, the Commonwealth Bank, will go from 15c to 60c. That is a 300 per cent increase in the ATM charge from 1 December. One should note that that again is well in advance of the rate of inflation. On the other side of the ledger, though, they tell us that the EFTPOS charge will go from 45c down to 40c, a decrease of a mere 11 per cent. If you look at the strategy that is being used by the banks, you can clearly see that it is anti-employment, it is anti-job and it is anti-people. There is a clear disincentive to use the over-the-counter system where people are employed. What we see the banks doing is anti-employment, anti-people and anti-jobs.</para><para>It is interesting to look further at what the banks are really doing. In the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> of 12 November this year there is a big headline `$5.5 billion profit but big four on the nose'. There is no wonder why. The average person in the community sees this headline and they understand clearly why the banks are on the nose: $5.5 billion profit. The article in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> points out that the banks' result of $5.5 billion was saved by the fact that the banks had a big jump in their non-traditional income areas such as fees and charges. That was the thing that saved their combined profit and kept it at the $5.5 billion mark. The article goes on to say that the only reason the result was not 
 higher than last year's $5.6 billion was that the banks were spending `hundreds of millions of dollars on restructuring their organisations'. That is nothing more than a euphemism for cutting jobs and cutting branches, and that is precisely what the article goes on to point out.</para><para>The <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> article says that during the past year the banks cut 6,000 jobs, despite several acquisitions. It says:</para><para>ANZ has led the way in cutting its workforce—by close to 5,000 people.</para><para>This, of course, is in an environment where we have unemployment as one of the worst cancers that our society can know. So what we have is a deliberate strategy on the part of the banks to be anti-employment, to get rid of and shed as many people as they can to take away the human face of banking.</para><para>It is interesting to look at a simple article with a simple headline in the <inline font-style="italic">Courier-Mail</inline> of 17 November. The headline says `$1m bonus for NAB razor man'. It is worth while reading this into the record. It says:</para><para>National Australia Bank's national managing director Don Argus scored a $1 million bonus last year as he culled more than 1200 jobs, shut 78 branches and increased bank fees.</para><para>What a tribute. `Disgrace' is the only word that can be used for that. That was his reward, and that is the reality of the real commercial world. Banks are not about customer service; they are not about giving a benefit to the customer.</para><para>It is interesting to look back in time at my own state. An article appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Courier-Mail</inline> of Saturday, 1 June 1996. The article talked about bank branch closures in regional Queensland. It said:</para><para>The National Australia Bank will close branches in Surat, Jandowae, Kalbar, Bollon, Goombungee and Leyburn in the grain belt of the Darling Downs and Western Darling Downs.</para><para>This was the heart of National Party territory. Then—surprise, surprise—the then National Party minister responsible for rural communities, Di McCauley, was quoted as describing the NAB's move as `a kick in the teeth for the communities'. Mrs McCauley said that rural bank closures had become a worrying trend and she questioned the banks' decisions 
 to put profit over service. That is the issue: profit over service. That is the only language that the banks know. McCauley, a National Party member and minister in the Queensland conservative government, went on to say:</para><para>Both the Government and the private sector have a responsibility to provide and maintain services to rural communities.</para><para>Rural communities have supported banks for many years during the good times and it is essential the banks reciprocate that support during the tough times.</para><para>Clearly, there was outrage within the ranks of the National Party when it was in government in Queensland at the move to close a number of banks on the Darling Downs.</para><para>It is also interesting that Wambo Shire Mayor, Robert Sparkes, a well-known member of the National Party in Queensland, said that his council had attempted to keep the bank in town by offering to transfer all its business to the branch. The article in the <inline font-style="italic">Courier-Mail</inline> said:</para><para>Sir Robert said the offer was rejected and the bank which has been in the town almost since the turn of the century would go.</para><para>He said the closure was part of a trend which would destroy Queensland's small towns.</para><para>Coming from Sir Robert Sparkes, that is very strong language indeed, and it shows the callousness of the banks' approach to rural and regional areas. The article continues with a quote from the Warroo Shire Council chief executive officer, Vaughan Becker, who said that the closure of the Surat branch would drain finance out of the community into neighbouring Roma. He said:</para><para>The council pays wages into a bank, Social Security does the same so when people go and get their cash in the nearest bank which is Roma, they will spend it there . . . </para><para>Those were prophetic words because, in a more recent article on page 12 of the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Mail</inline>  of 25 October this year, the headline said `Fanning the fury'. The article is on the closure of banks in rural and regional areas. It refers to the closure of the Westpac branch at Dimbulah, which is 90 kilometres west of Cairns. The article reports:</para><para>. . . shopowners' profits plummeted as residents, forced to make the 90km round trip to the nearest 
 bank in Mareeba, took their daily business with them.</para><para>One of the major consequences of the desertion of the rural and regional areas by Australia's banks is that small business is suffering badly.</para><para>It was interesting to hear my colleague Senator Conroy refer to a statement by Mr Murray that people should send telegrams of congratulation rather than protest on bank closures. The article in the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Mail</inline> refers specifically to the town of Mount Morgan where the Commonwealth Bank closed its branch. The article says:</para><para>On Friday, the Commonwealth closed its Mt Morgan branch.</para><para>Mr Murray's comments serve only to inflame the anger in rural Australia where the big four banks have close numerous branches in recent years sparking criticism they are bent on increasing profits at the expense of service and social obligations.</para><para>In fact, Reserve Bank figures reveal more than 506 bank branches closed in Australia in the 12 months to June 30.</para><para>That highlights what this issue is going to come to. It came to a head with the voting patterns in the recent federal election. Surprise, surprise—piggybacking on people's disenchantment with the federal government and its inability to protect the interests of people in rural communities, One Nation scored 18.83 per cent. Reality translates into electoral results.</para><para>In the same booth at Mount Morgan, the National Party could only score 20 per cent of the vote—and that is in a seat it holds. Across the state in rural and regional Queensland in the latest federal election, the National Party lost a senator to One Nation because of disenchantment with this government. The disenchantment is obvious in the following seats when you look at the percentage of votes for One Nation: Leichhardt, 13.89 per cent; Hinkler, 18.99 per cent; Maranoa, 22.4 per cent; Kennedy, 18.84 per cent; Capricornia, 13.9 per cent; and Wide Bay 26.33 per cent. The closure of bank branches is one of the major issues that fuels the disenchantment of the voters with the current government. Across the state, the Liberal Party got 30.86 per cent of the vote, down 
 8.43 per cent, and the National Party got 9.99 per cent, down 5.93 per cent, while One Nation scored 14.35 per cent.</para><para>Those figures highlight, in my view, the difficulties that this government has with issues like bank closures and the handling of bank charges. These matters sting the people who live in rural and regional areas and make them feel isolated and deserted. They feel no-one is concerned enough to take an interest in them at all.</para><para>Looking briefly at the closure of banks, I want to mention an analysis by the Centre for Australian Financial Institutions of just some of the problems faced by smaller regional and rural communities. It examines problems such as cheque handling and finds that there is no facility for small businesses to put their deposits in the bank on a daily basis, so their deposits are delayed. This is a cost in itself. It affects the cash flow of those businesses. If one looks at the issue of change—coinage—it finds that many small businesses find themselves stuck with high denomination notes and a lack of coinage. As a result, they have to take steps to have higher floats, which means greater security risks. Ultimately, that is an impost on small business and a burden that they have to carry.</para><para>The other issue I want to briefly address is credit, by retailers and the like, in the absence of banks. Their absence means that business is carrying a credit risk and also carrying a debt which is unserviced until the consumer pays—presumably at the end of the month, or whenever it might be. 	At the end of the day, wherever banks disappear in rural and regional areas—and there are no banks in many of these places now—it becomes an impost on the small business community.</para><para>Banks have abrogated their social and community responsibility. One must not be too amused at the fact that Westpac circulated to members in this Senate a copy—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>4J4</name.id><name role="metadata">SCHACHT</name><name role="display">Senator Schacht</name></talker><para>—Did you get one too?

It is their most recent report. It is very glossy and very expensive—but what does this report spend 
 its time addressing? It spends its time addressing issues such as these: `Why shouldn't there be a bank branch in every town', then `But aren't all banks the same', `Why are bank fees going up', `Who says banks have a social responsibility' and `Is making money good for the bank?' No-one is denying that organisations such as banks need to make a profit. But, as I said in the first instance, the four major banks made $5.5 billion—not to be sneezed at—and most of that is made on the backs of battlers and on the backs of the poor.</para></talk.start></continue><para>What we have had circulated by Westpac today could only be described at best as an embarrassment to both Westpac and the government—because neither of them is prepared to address the issues. Neither of them is prepared to take on a social and community responsibility. Senator Tierney referred to rural transaction centres: these are very nice, but people want proper financial services in the rural and regional areas; they do not want to talk to machines. They do not want to press buttons over telephones for telephone banking. They do not want to be forced into those means of transaction; they want to talk with people. It is when they talk with people that they can get some good common sense—hopefully—so that, the end of the day, they can feel as if they are still a part of the human race.</para><para>This Westpac report does not serve as anything other than an embarrassment to that organisation and to the government. They are trying to explain away their antisocial behaviour while the government sits limply opposite and allows it to happen. The government has borne the consequences.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Government senators interjecting</inline>—</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>7L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Hogg, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HOGG</name></talker><para>—Well, you have lost a senator.

The fact is that One Nation went out there and ran the campaign—and they ran it 
 strongly—based on the fact that the government is seen to be inactive in this area. The government needs to show more concern for rural and regional Australia. It needs to show it, particularly, for pensioners, small business people, local councils and schoolchildren. School banking is being completely disrupted by the withdrawal of banks from these rural and regional communities. The government needs to jettison its wrongly held belief that the competitive market will provide cheaper, more effective services to the consumer—as the Assistant Treasurer said yesterday in response to a question. There is no doubt that the government is out of step and out of touch with reality. There is nothing to prove that the competitive market will provide cheaper and more effective services.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Look at the situation in Dimbulah, in Surat, Jandowae, Goombundgeee and a number of other places—nothing is making their lives any better. There is no more effective service for those people and there is certainly nothing to guarantee that it is cheaper. All we see are these people being cut off from mainstream society. They are told they can go to GiroPost. They are told they can go to transaction centres. But, at the end of the day, they will make their decision at the ballot box. The government must take cognisance of this, for if they do not, then they will suffer the ongoing fate that awaits anyone who ignores the people. They started out by saying that they were going to be a government to govern for everyone. I think they have failed miserably on that account. Of course, this is only one major area where that is the case.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>795</page.no><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name><name.id>LI4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I have heard some interesting speeches in my time in here—</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>VW4</name.id><name role="metadata">HERRON</name><name role="display">Senator Herron</name></talker><para>—That wasn't one of them.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>LI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name></talker><para>—Thank you, Senator. The crocodile tears that the Labor Party are now crying are absolutely typical of the hypocrisy of people on the other side. Instead of heeding Mark Latham's advice and developing real policies for the future, Labor has come in here once again with a cynical, populist smear to attempt to gain points with 
 the electorate. I do not think they have learnt anything from the last election. The Australian public saw through Labor—a policy free zone. Sorry, I should not say that; that is misrepresenting the situation. What policies they had they have just about jettisoned since the election.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The community did not fall for the cynical ploys that passed for tax reform. All they could do with the ramshackle wholesale sales tax was to put a tax on caviar and take it off orange juice. This was a sales tax system under which frozen yoghurt was tax free but frozen yoghurt that tasted like ice-cream was taxable. One of the other classic ones was where you had strawberry Quik attracting a wholesale sales tax but chocolate Quik not attracting a wholesale sales tax. That is the sort of policy that Labor went to the last election with. All they were going to do to reform the mess in the taxation system was to put tax on caviar and take it off orange juice.</para><para>The other thing they were going to do was to extend the capital gains tax to items that people had previously purchased. I think that was Jenny Macklin's idea. Two days after the election, Mr Beazley jettisoned that bit of their policy. So the policy that they did have is in tatters. The opposition will win nothing from the cynical motion put forward today by Senator Conroy. You cannot keep treating the Australian people with contempt. If you do, you will be warming those opposition benches for a very long time.</para><para>Mr Hockey put it very well in the other place on 24 November when he gave us a bit of a history lesson on this issue of banks and bank closures. Between 1991 and 1996, over 1,600 bank branches and agencies were closed. Where were you all then? What were honourable senators on the other side doing about bank closures then?</para><para>You would think that Australia had begun on the day after the election in March 1996. You would think that nothing had happened beforehand and that Labor had not done anything to create the problems that existed. There is evidence that 1,600 bank branches were closing, with nobody expressing concern—except the member for Dickson, Ms Kernot, before she deserted the Democrats. 
 When she was Senator Kernot, she asked a question in the Senate of Senator Cook, and Mr Hockey referred to this on 24 November. He said:</para><para>In the Senate on 31 May 1995, Senator Peter Cook was asked the following question without notice: `. . . what measures will the government take to ensure that banks fulfil their community service obligations by reforming practices your government—' that is, the Labor government—`has been carping about for five years, inquiring into for five years and also doing nothing about for five years?'</para><para>That was a now Labor member accusing the then Labor government of knowing nothing about banking for five years. Mr Hockey went on:</para><para>On 11 July 1995, the then Treasurer, Mr Ralph Willis, put out a press release with the following statement: `The Government agrees . . . on the need to supply better information to consumers so they can make the right choices about banking products that suit them. To spur this process, I will direct the new Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to formally monitor and regularly report on the financial services industry in relation to retail transaction accounts for a period of three years.' That was 11 July 1995. Nothing happened in the rest of July. Nothing happened in August. Nothing happened in September, October, November, December, January and February until we got to 26 February—four days before the federal election. Four days before the federal election, Ralph Willis put out another press release: `Labor to monitor fees and charges on retail transaction accounts'.</para><para>I found this speech quite interesting reading. I had forgotten this had happened. Mr Hockey continued:</para><para>It states: `A Labor Government will write to the Chairperson—' they are going to write to the chairperson—`of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission . . . requesting the Commission to formally monitor fees and charges on bank retail transaction accounts.'</para><para>Mr Hockey was saying that, after 13 years, the Labor Party were going to do something about monitoring bank fees. They had 13 years to do something about it, but they did nothing. They come in here and have the gall to be critical of the coalition, yet they did nothing about it when they identified it as an issue.</para><para>We recognised that there had been a problem associated with the closures of banks. Instead of just saying we were going to write 
 to a committee, we actually are doing something about it, as my colleague Senator Tierney said. We are introducing rural transaction centres—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>4J4</name.id><name role="metadata">SCHACHT</name><name role="display">Senator Schacht</name></talker><para>—Paid for by selling Telstra.

Senator Schacht is shouting from the other side of the chamber, `What are you going to do about it if you don't sell the next tranche of Telstra?' Senator, we can say to the people of Australia that we have a program and we have a policy to help people in rural Australia.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The Labor Party cannot accept that we won the election and they are going to oppose everything we do. Out in the community people say to me, `How come the Democrats, Senator Harradine, the Independents and the Greens seem to have so much say in the Senate these days?' How come they have so much say? Because the Labor Party opposes every single thing—just about, although there was an exception yesterday on the migration bill. They oppose most of the major issues. They write themselves out of the equation and, by writing themselves out of the equation, they give the Democrats and the Independents all the say in the world.</para><para>On major issues we used to say, `The world's going to fall in. The sky's going to fall in. It's going to be terrible. But you won the election. Let the people judge you on your performance.' We did not give the minority parties the same authority. We were much more cooperative. But if you want to go on like that we will go out to the people and say, `If you don't get your transaction centres, that 
 is because Labor has failed to accept that we won the election and will not let us implement our policies.' The answer to the question that Senator Schacht asked is: `If you don't get your transaction centres, blame the Labor Party.' There is the answer, Senator Schacht. I will keep telling the people in rural Australia that, and so will all my colleagues.</para><para>I also say to you that, when we were doing consultations around Australia for the International Year of Older Persons, older people indicated to us that banking was a concern. We heard that from a number of people. When Warwick Smith was minister he announced in the 1998-99 federal budget that there would be $13.4 million over four years for business and community partnership initiatives. The first initiative that was announced for that partnership money was a banking partnership between banks and community groups to help older Australians keep abreast of rapidly changing electronic banking and shopping.</para><para>As Senator Cooney said while he was speaking, we may as well go back to pedal radios. Senator Hogg wants to take us back to the age of the dinosaurs—back to the Dark Ages. Older people are capable of learning new skills. They have demonstrated that to us. They did not say to us, `We don't want it.' They said, `We want safer ATMs, we want to know how to use them and we want assistance.' They were not being dinosaurs like Senator Hogg. They are saying, `We can adapt and we can learn if we are taught how to do it.' So the banking partnership has been set up. I commend the Australian Bankers Association for their commitment and involvement in this project to assist older Australians learn how to use electronic banking and ATMs. They will address issues such as the size of the pad, the size of the screen and whether or not there is light on it, and all the other things that might make it more difficult for an older person to use electronic banking.</para><para>For Senator Hogg to assume that everyone has to go back to the Dark Ages is a very negative approach. I think it is a much more positive approach to say: `Yes, we'll work with you.' Older people have indicated that 
 that is what they are prepared to do. This project brings together the Bankers Association and a number of important interest groups to represent the interests of older people. They will work in conjunction with the government, the banks and older people to address some of those concerns.</para><para>Instead of sitting and carping as Labor did for 13 years, we have taken a positive approach. We have developed the concept of transaction centres. We have been working in partnership with the Australian Bankers Association to address problems—they have acknowledged there are problems. This is a much more positive, constructive approach than the negative, carping approach of the opposition. The reason we are sitting on this side and Labor is sitting on the other side is that the Australian people recognise that what they want is people who have answers and are going to do things rather than talk about it and set up yet another committee or write to another chairperson.</para><para>I want to remind honourable senators that with the introduction of a GST—again, Labor sits over there and says, `Oh, we don't want to accept that you won the election and we're not going to let you implement your policies'—under the government's tax reform proposals financial services are input taxed. This means that there is no tax on outputs but the supplier cannot claim input tax credits. The financial service and the fee for the financial service are not subject to GST.</para><para>The abolition of wholesale sales tax and other taxes and reductions in excise mean that input costs to banks are expected to fall by approximately $670 million. When a financial institution provides a service such as investment advice or insurance for which there is a readily identifiable separate fee that will be subject to GST. Bank customers will be winners from tax reform. They will no longer have to pay $2.4 billion worth of taxes on bank accounts. When you add up your taxation at the end of the year, when you add up all the FIDs and BADs you pay, you will realise how much difference that will make to the expense of running a bank account. Labor's policy is for customers to keep 
 paying $2.4 billion worth of taxes on bank accounts—ours is not.</para><para>The opposition comes in here and cries crocodile tears about banks closing when 1,600 bank branches closed in the last half of the Labor government. They did nothing. They talked about it and they talked about it until four days before the election when they issued a press release saying they were going to do something about it. No wonder the public are cynical about them. They sit here saying, `Oh, it's terrible.' They beat their breasts about there being charges and problems with the banks when they are pushing and supporting a policy that will mean that customers have to keep paying $2.4 billion worth of tax on bank accounts. I think that demonstrates the hypocrisy of the Labor Party. The fact is that they are a policy free zone. Labor needs policies. It is rare that I agree wholeheartedly with Lindsay Tanner, but he said, and I agree with him:</para><para>History shows that the Labor Party needs to do two things to win government. One is to reform itself and the other is to build the new agenda.</para><para>We have seen nothing on the part of the Labor Party to suggest anything about policies. All I can suggest is that the Labor Party develops a more constructive approach, a more constructive attitude and some real policies.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>798</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I was glad to hear Senator Patterson draw the attention of the chamber to the policy record of the Australian Democrats on the issue of banking services and, in particular, our concern about banking fees.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>LI4</name.id><name role="metadata">PATTERSON</name><name role="display">Senator Patterson</name></talker><para>—You are acknowledging the late Senator Kernot.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3I6</name.id><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name></talker><para>—I acknowledge that one of our members may have left, but the policy remains the same.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The issue of access to banking services is one which has received a great deal of attention, specifically over the past few years, definitely in the last few days, and rightly so. Over the past five years, bank fees and charges have increased, thousands of jobs 
 have been cut within the sector, branches have been closed and bank profits have absolutely soared.</para><para>The Australian Democrats have long subjected banks and the financial services sector to close scrutiny and have applied equally close scrutiny to relevant government policies. Unfortunately, the history of policy development in this area is littered with initiatives which have favoured banks and shareholders over customers, and the developments of the last week in particular can be attributed in many ways to the current government's enthusiasm for competition as a panacea for service deficiencies.</para><para>In September 1997, the Treasurer, Mr Peter Costello, announced financial deregulation reforms which would, as he put it, `deliver billions of dollars of benefits for Australian business and consumers.' Of course, such statements in the context of financial sector reform are not new and, in making such expansive claims, the Treasurer echoed the sentiments of at least one of his predecessors, Mr Paul Keating, from the deregulation heydays of the 1980s.</para><para>The reforms of September 1997 sought to bring about greater competition within the banking sector by allowing building societies, credit unions, insurance companies, finance companies and superannuation funds to compete with banks. However, as the Australian Democrats said at the time, there are grave concerns in relation to the ability of smaller organisations to compete against the enormous market share of the big four banks.</para><para>I reiterate some of those concerns today. A survey published in the March 1998 issue of <inline font-style="italic">Choice</inline> magazine found a number of highly disturbing trends in bank operations. Included in the survey were comments from a range of  customers clearly disappointed with what they perceived as declining levels of services and access. For example, one person stated:</para><para>I was happy with the personalised service that I received at my branch. Then they cut staff and I became just another number. Things that were done in hours now take days.</para><para>Another stated:</para><para>People shouldn't be penalised for using over-the-counter services, Not all of us are comfortable with new technology.</para><para>Another said:</para><para>It's time the banks were regulated again. It seems it's only since they were deregulated that they have become such bully boys.</para><para>And another said:</para><para>It's frustrating to hear about the major banks making huge profits, and then to be charged a fee for transactions.</para><para>Since deregulation, rather than making banking cheaper and generally better for all, I see a system where the rich do well and those with middle to lower incomes finance this in costs and fees.</para><para>When people were asked why they banked where they did, the results demonstrated why competition is an insufficient regulator of the banking industry. Forty-two per cent of those surveyed said they banked with a particular institution because they had always banked there. And 27 per cent of people banked with the institution where they had their home loan.</para><para>These figures clearly show that an overwhelming majority of people do not choose their financial institution on the basis of satisfaction, but often because it is easier to remain where they are. Less than one-quarter of those surveyed had changed institutions for their main transaction account in the past five years, despite recording declining satisfaction.</para><para>While consumers may be suffering from reduced access through branch closures, staff reductions and increased cost of services, the banks are certainly prospering. Over the past five years, bank profits have ballooned. In 1993, Westpac announced a profit of $39 million—a growth pattern replicated by the three other large banking institutions. This increased steadily to a profit of $1.29 billion in 1997. The big four banks reported profits over that five-year period of nearly $22 billion. These staggering profits were not achieved through traditional banking services such as home loans—which have become less profitable through competition and reduced interest rates—but through increased fees and charges and staffing cuts.</para><para>The consequences have clearly been the prioritisation of shareholders over services and 
 employment. The Democrats find this outcome unacceptable and indicative of a need for greater regulation of the sector, as competition is simply not bringing about the results promised by government last year. But we are not the only ones: 80 per cent of respondents to the <inline font-style="italic">Choice</inline> magazine survey believe that the government should play a more active role in monitoring bank charges.</para><para>I note that the Australian banking sector compares poorly with overseas sectors. In Britain, most banks do not charge fees unless the account is overdrawn. Yet this government continues to allow banks—and I acknowledge the comments of Senator Patterson that it is not just this government but the former government as well—to continue practices which reduce access and increase unemployment.</para><para>While the government may claim that low interest rates are evidence of its performance in this respect, the fact is that low interest rates have had the effect of reducing the profitability of the lending side of banking activities. But rather than absorb this lessened profitability, the banks are looking to customers to make up their profits—and that is usually through increased fees and charges.</para><para>It is exactly this kind of activity which the Democrats argue requires greater regulation, and Australian consumers are clearly looking to the government to do this. Every time people go to the bank, to the supermarket, to pay an instalment on their home loan, or to an ATM, the often excessive fees remind them of the failure of the government's `red-hot' competition policy to protect them from bank profiteering. Of course, not only has the failure to adequately regulate banking activity resulted in increased costs to consumers; it has also resulted in massive job shedding in the sector. I note that since 1990 more than over 58,000 jobs have been lost.</para><para>The Democrats support the general business motion before the chamber today, moved by Senator Conroy. We support part (a) which refers to:</para><para>the Federal Government's callous disregard and total lack of interest in ensuring that the community has access to both affordable and accessible banking services, as evidenced by the fact that 
 under the Howard government over 484 bank branches were closed in 1997-98</para><para>We support condemnation of job losses. I am keen to give a member of the government time to respond. I see Senator Payne looking keen to attack this issue. We do not have much time, however. Part (b), the failure of the government to formally monitor bank fees, is something we condemn. We have grave concerns with that aspect. But with regard to the second part of part (b), `rule out a goods and services tax being applied to bank service charges', I put this question to members on the opposite side: has the government clearly ruled out a goods and services tax being applied to bank service charges?</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>4J4</name.id><name role="metadata">SCHACHT</name><name role="display">Senator Schacht</name></talker><para>—You are going to take it out to 6 p.m., and then it will be stumps.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3I6</name.id><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name></talker><para>—Senator Schacht, I am quite happy to allow time for a member of the government to answer my question which is: has the government ruled out a goods and services tax being applied to bank service charges?</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>4J4</name.id><name role="metadata">SCHACHT</name><name role="display">Senator Schacht</name></talker><para>—No, they haven't.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3I6</name.id><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name></talker><para>—I want to hear that from the government because there has been some suggestion that they are prepared to rule that out.

In that case, independent of Senator Patterson's comments, the Democrats have often scrutinised government policy on this matter and have certainly drawn attention to the issue of job losses in the sector. Indeed, I asked the Assistant Treasurer two questions this week about the issue of bank fees and competition. I was keen to find out what criteria were considered appropriate for the banking sector to meet before competition was believed to be considered appropriate so 
 that mergers could take place. The Prime Minister has said that no more mergers should necessarily be agreed to unless a level of competition that is adequate has been reached. But we are still not quite sure of the detailed criteria to which the Prime Minister was referring when he made his statement the night before last. So I am still very keen to have that detailed criteria clarified by the government—what constitutes appropriate or adequate competition—before mergers are allowed to proceed.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I really believe we have a do-nothing Treasurer on this issue. We have heard the other Assistant Treasurer, Mr Joe Hockey—again I note that the web site still has not specified what his duties are—give a spirited defence of the banking sector. I thought it would be very interesting to see whether or not his views and those of Senator Rod Kemp—the Treasurer's right-hand man, as I like to think of him—were the same. But we were unable to get an exact answer to that question from Senator Kemp. He was not sure what competition was appropriate. We were not sure whether he agreed with Mr Joseph Hockey and his comments in the House.</para><para>Certainly I disagree that those people who dare to speak up and challenge the notion that increased banking fees, reduced services, staffing cuts and other job losses are necessarily subsidising an old banking system. In fact those people are just ensuring that customers have their rights respected and have access to banking services in all areas—not just in urban areas but also in remote and regional areas—and that people do not have to face prohibitive fees and charges in order to use those basic banking services.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator McKiernan)</name></talker><para>—Senator Schacht, in calling you I remind you that there are fewer than four minutes left in this debate.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>LI4</name.id><name role="metadata">PATTERSON</name><name role="display">Senator Patterson</name></talker><para>—He is getting succinct.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>2M6</name.id><name role="metadata">COONAN</name><name role="display">Senator Coonan</name></talker><para>—And to the point.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>801</page.no><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator SCHACHT</name><name.id>4J4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Absolutely, and to the point.

 Senator Stott Despoja that this government should answer the simple question: will the GST apply to loan application fees, loan establishment fees, mortgage insurance fees and real estate valuation fees? It was an answer that the Treasurer could not give yesterday in the House of Representatives, so that is going to be a major issue; they obviously cannot work it out. If the GST does apply, it will be an additional impost on all Australians in the banking system and will, I suspect, further encourage the banks to close their retail outlets around Australia.</para></talk.start><para>In Australia at the moment we have the banks arguing that they should be allowed to merge. We have the NAB making it quite clear that they want to take over the ANZ bank. I saw only two days ago that they have called on the services of Mr Michael Kroger, a former President of the Liberal Party in Victoria, to be an adviser. He is to be paid a success fee, apparently, if the merger goes through. What is Mr Kroger's skill in being employed by the NAB? He has only one: he apparently is a close friend of Mr Costello, the Treasurer.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZS6</name.id><name role="metadata">QUIRKE</name><name role="display">Senator Quirke</name></talker><para>—Has he got any friends?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>4J4</name.id><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator SCHACHT</name></talker><para>—That is the one we do know he has, Senator Quirke. We do know that Mr Kroger was instrumental in getting Mr Costello his preselection when the Liberal Party dumped Roger Shipton as the member for Higgins in 1990 at a time when Mr Kroger was getting rid of all the small `l' Liberals in the Victorian Liberal Party. We know that only 18 months ago Mr Kroger was on a success fee from Mr Packer to get the cross-media ownership rules changed. I said in the Senate at that time that I had been given information that the success fee was $7 million. So you can imagine what the success fee would be if he was able to get Mr Costello to change his mind and allow these two very large banks to merge. It would run into tens of millions of dollars, not $7 million.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Of course Mr Kroger, who runs this merchant bank called J T Campbell, as I understand is the name of it, which does not seem to be a genuine merchant bank. It is about making political deals—providing 
 services to the Liberal Party and its allies to achieve political deals. This is the way you do business in the Liberal Party and Mr Kroger has hung his shingle out accordingly. That is why there is great cynicism among the Australian public about the role of banks and the Liberal Party in Australia. The ordinary people of Australia know that when the banks are allowed to merge, if Mr Costello agrees to Mr Kroger's blandishments, it will be the ordinary Australians who lose services through the further closure of regional banks and retail banking services around Australia.</para><para>Debate interrupted.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator McKiernan)</name></talker><para>—Order!

These documents deal with one of those areas of law that encompass some of the most tragic incidents that occur in the community; that is, in the area of family relationships as between spouses, as between parents and children. It is an area where there have been very tragic incidents taking place over the years and where such incidents will take place in years 
 to come because it is an area that you can never get right. You have a breakup of an intimate relationship and you have children subject to awful pressure. These problems are society's problems and society has set up the Family Court to accommodate them.</para></talk.start><para>I notice in today's <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> that Evan Whitton, who writes much about the law and raises great issues that ought be discussed more than they are—I think the issues of how the law confronts people in society and how society accommodates its relationships through the courts are matters of great moment and should be discussed more often than they are, particular in this place—says there is a need to change the law, and there is a need for that to happen. The Family Court is one area where change could occur, and the Chief Justice of that court and his fellow judges are very intent on that happening.</para><para>One way the court can change would be to have available to it means other than simply adjudication to settle problems that come before it. For example, mediation is an instrument that the court looks to as a means of resolving these great personal issues which come before the court. It is a pity therefore that the court does not get the support it should from government. There should be two things done. First of all, there should be encouragement for the court to take mediation within its jurisdiction, in preference to mediation being done outside the court. There is no doubt that there are some great people doing great work outside the court in the area of mediation but, fundamentally, the best work is going to be done within the court because that is where the authority is. People come and see the court as a place where there is authority to decide the disputes that lay between the them. Governments should finance and give resources to the courts in greater amounts than presently is the case.</para><para>Secondly, the government, particularly the Attorney, should encourage the court to undertake this process of mediation, it being one of a number of means that might otherwise be available. Counsel settles most of the cases; the court adjudicates on others. Mediation ought to be another way of doing it. If the court were able to pursue the course that 
 it wants, a lot of the problems that we have with families breaking up—and I notice document 1 talks a lot about parental child abduction—would be solved.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>803</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Chee, Sen Bill</name><name role="display">Senator O'CHEE</name><name.id>EU4</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—There is a fair degree of wisdom in some of the things that Senator Cooney has just said. He is in fact a very distinguished chairman of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee and is also a very experienced member of the bar. But I think sometimes we overlook part of the problem and that is we try to fix people's matrimonial difficulties after they become almost irretrievable. I think much more effort needs to be put into ensuring that people go into marriage understanding that it is a commitment. They also have to be supported through the marriage before they get to a situation where you have to call in a mediator in the court. Everybody is going to have arguments in their marriages, some more than others. We need to have a system in place that prevents the breakdown because, once the relationship has broken down, it is very difficult to retrieve the situation.</para></talk.start><para>I think all honourable senators would know, from their own experience, the experience of having constituents come to them, that once you get to the point where people are in court, the attitude is not one of compromise, it is one of vindictiveness and bitterness and frequently, tragically, it is one in which the children of the marriage are used as negotiating pawns or victory tokens in the vindictive battle between husband and wife. Not always do the parents understand that they are using the children as negotiating pawns or victory tokens but, in fact, subconsciously that is what is happening.</para><para>Yes, we have to work very hard on repairing family breakdowns, because the cost of family breakdowns is great, but we also have to work very hard at ensuring that we prevent those family difficulties becoming irretrievable breakdowns because that substantially reduces the cost. Let me explain what I mean by that. First of all, if we prevent a marriage becoming irretrievably broken, we reduce all of the court costs to which these reports and Senator Cooney in his learned contribution 
 have referred. If people patch up their marital difficulties before they get to court, none of these expenses are incurred. That is a big saving of their money and the government's money.</para><para>Secondly, there is a huge social cost from not sorting out marital problems. Senator Cooney might correct me if I am wrong, but evidence was presented to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee several years ago that in 60 per cent of cases of divorce with children, the parent who has care of the children moves more than 600 kilometres from the matrimonial home within the first six months. Living in Cairns, I frequently see cases where people have moved to Cairns to get away from their partner because Cairns is as far as you can reasonably go along the bitumen. I know many people who will go from Perth to Cairns, because Cairns is the furthest city from Perth, to get away from their former spouse and to take the children with them.</para><para>What is the social cost if that continues to occur? First of all, there is a social cost because people's lives are scarred. I am not talking about the parents; I am talking about the children. These people's lives are scarred. To make it worse, it is a statistical fact that a child is more likely to be abused by a step-parent than by their own parent. It is a tragic thing and that is no aspersion on many good step-parents, but it is a statistical fact. Secondly, the incidence of crime amongst children from broken families is tragically higher. If this country is to eliminate those costs and those difficulties, we have to work at repairing marital difficulties before they become breakdowns, because in that way the long-term benefit to Australia is quite enormous.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>803</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para></talk.start><para>Leave granted; debate adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Wool International</title><page.no>803</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 12 November, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sandy Macdonald</inline>:</para><para>That the Senate take note of the document.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>803</page.no><name role="metadata">Crane, Sen Winston</name><name role="display">Senator CRANE</name><name.id>UW4</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I believe this annual report will be the 
 last report of Wool International, although obviously there will be one dealing with the remainder of this year. Rather than looking at the unfortunate circumstances that have occurred in recent times and the disrepute that Wool International has fallen into, I want to take a broader look at what has occurred since 1990, when the wool industry was confronted with a 4.8 million bale stockpile and a $2.8 billion debt. We must recognise that it has been no mean achievement since then to reduce that stockpile to 1.1 million bales and to reduce the debt to about $230 million, which is where it stands today.</para></talk.start><para>We must also recognise the incredible contribution that has been made by the growers in the industry itself in picking up the mistakes that were made during the previous 10 years, particularly the late 1980s when the reserve price ran amuck. In fact, it went very close to destroying what is generally recognised as the founding industry and one of the most important industries in this country. It is still one of the most important industries in this country. It contributes close to $4 billion of export income a year, despite the difficulties. It is an industry which I am confident will grow back.</para><para>I want to get a theme through the events of this period, if only it can be seen as a lesson. We started off with the debt reduction scheme. That worked relatively well for about 18 months. It then fell foul because of certain circumstances. The industry took 18 months while it argued about what to do next, taking millions of dollars out of growers' pockets. We then had the Garnaut report. We switched from the debt reduction scheme to the fixed schedule. Once again, from 1993 onwards that worked reasonably well for about 18 months before falling into disrepair because it was no longer suitable.</para><para>The industry then argued for another 18 months until we came into government. In 1996 we went to the flexible schedule. Once again, that worked well until December 1997 when things changed. We had the Asian meltdown. Again, the industry got itself into a terrible bind, arguing about what to do next rather than putting its own prejudices aside and dealing with the particular issue, and that 
 was the loss, once again, of an enormous amount of dollars and cents out of growers' pockets. I make the point that, up until this government implemented its first freeze, there had been a bipartisan approach in this parliament to dealing with the issues and the industry.</para><para>When it became obvious we had to have a freeze, for whatever inexplicable reason, the Labor Party took a different course and opposed that. In that process I believe they have delayed unnecessarily the process of adjustment that was required at this time. From December 1997 through to August we saw wool go into free fall. We saw it drop some 160c. We saw $200 million wiped off the value of the stockpile. We saw over $100 million wiped off the value of the growers' stockpile. None of this would have happened if we had had strong leadership in the wool industry and people who had the leadership ability to show some flexibility and deal with the problem when it arose. It should have been very obvious to people involved in the industry that with the Asian meltdown if you take one hundred million kilos out of the marketplace there is going to be price damage and unnecessary oversupply of wool. Virtual mayhem was created in people's homes in terms of the reductions in their income.</para><para>The basic message I want to give is that the next part of the process—the freeze, the legislation we have coming up shortly in this place, privatising the wool industry and putting it on a true commercial basis—must happen quickly. It must not be delayed in this place. People cannot treat wool growers as pawns any longer. I declare an interest in this, which I should have done at the start, as a wool grower. I am sick and tired of being played for a dummy by the leadership aspirants in our industry who have chosen to put their own personal gains in front of the gains and rights of individual growers. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>804</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I was not intending to speak on this matter, particularly as a debate on the bill the government has before the Senate is imminent and, indeed, there is a legislation committee inquiry on this matter commencing at 8

But I do say that we are quite well aware that the then minister responsible for this area, Mr Anderson, when the matter went to cabinet did not propose the course of action the government is now taking. He proposed other measures, not the freeze which is the subject of this legislation. As I said before, we saw the almost unprecedented event of a National Party minister, for what is a National Party constituency predominantly—and certainly a rural constituency in New South Wales and Victoria, and I would have thought in Queensland—go to the cabinet with a proposal not for a freeze but for other measures and have his position overturned, and a position proposed by Liberal Party members of the coalition for a freeze succeed.</para><para>That situation is almost unprecedented in relation to this type of legislation. But the question of what should happen to this legislation is in the hands of the Senate now and the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee will conduct a hearing tomorrow and will hear the views of industry participants and representatives. I know from having looked at submissions which are before that inquiry that there is far from unanimity on the question of whether there should be a freeze or not.</para><para>I can say that the Tasmanian Farmers and Graziers, the organisation that represents I believe 80 per cent or more of wool growers in my state, have presented a submission in which they are very clearly opposed to this legislation. So for Senator Crane to attempt in some way to represent the Labor Party on this issue as being unrepresentative or as taking a position which is somehow detrimental to the industry because we do not agree with the government is a position I reject. Having said 
 that, I understand from comments Senator Woodley has made that it is likely that the Democrats will support the government in this legislation.

It is for government and parliament to set policy and it is for administrators to make decisions about particular matters.

She is a woman of quite outstanding ability and of great disposition.</para><para>I note too that Deirdre FitzGerald has ceased to be the senior member in Melbourne. I notice that she was appointed from 22 February 1989 to 31 March 1997 and from 16 April 1997 to 31 December 1997. She is another woman of quite outstanding ability. I should perhaps indicate something of a remote interest in this. Many years ago, she was a partner of my wife. I think that, way back when they started, they were the only women partners of a firm situated in the city of Melbourne. It is good to see that she has gone to this tribunal and done great work on it.</para><para>I will return to the main theme that I want to take up in this speech. When we are reviewing decisions of government, it is important to remember what is appropriate for judicial review. Decisions made in respect of particular people should be very much subject to judicial review. Policy, of course, should not; it is for politicians to make policy. It would be a shame to see the judicial review system, as it has been set up over the years in this parliament and in state parliaments, disappear or be prejudiced to the point where people are not getting the sort of justice they are entitled to.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>806</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para></talk.start><para>Leave granted; debate adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation</title><page.no>806</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 12 November, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bartlett</inline>:</para><para>That the Senate take note of the document.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>806</page.no><name role="metadata">Crane, Sen Winston</name><name role="display">Senator CRANE</name><name.id>UW4</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Once again, I declare an interest in this as a member of a family partnership growing wool. The report relates to the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation, otherwise known as AWRP and the development, in recent times, of the Woolmark company, which had its origins in the International Wool Secretariat.</para></talk.start><para>This coming Monday—I will not dwell on it—we have what will be, I believe, a very important annual general meeting of wool growers in Goulburn to deal with the functions and operations of AWRP. Whatever comes out of that meeting—whether or not the no-confidence motion is carried and whether the accounts are received—I believe that we will see the beginning of very major changes in the way wool research, development, promotion and marketing is carried out in this country.</para><para>There is a mood, if I can put it that way, in the bush where growers, who have put some $8.5 billion over the last 20 years into research, promotion, marketing and development, are saying that they have had enough of funding that operation when they do not seem to be getting the results they should be getting out of it. I believe that we will see very quickly this organisation run to a totally commercial operation. I believe that we will see it move to becoming a corporate company where directors will be elected by the growers or shareholders who provide the money. They will have to contest elections on an annual or three-year basis, depending on the structure that comes out of it.</para><para>As a senator from Western Australia in particular—but I think I can also speak for those across Australia—the sooner that happens to the structure and all the funding becomes contestable and accountability is treated as though that operation were a normal corporation or company, the better. Bearing in mind that this year is a difficult year—wool prices have been down; there has been much less money available and AWRP has had to dig into reserves—AWRP will still have a budget well in excess of $100 million, which is much greater than the cotton industry, which is run on much more commercial lines.</para><para>The wool industry at this time, and the aspect of it that I have referred to, faces what I would call a commercial revolution. Growers will demand that each dollar and cent they put in be totally accountable. The spending of that money will become contestable. They will get private operators into the promotion field. They will spread their arms wider in terms of the dollars they spend on research and development. They will develop a focus that looks very carefully at the organisation if they are going to continue to have four per cent or thereabouts of their proceeds taken out of their cheques before they get them. They want to see results. They want to see dollars and cents back in their pockets. They want to see the industry start to grow again. They want to rebuild their farming structures. They want to deal with the infrastructure on their properties. They want to make sure that those people who have served the industry well for a long time are not forgotten. Those people who seem to have been forgotten—particularly by some people on the opposite side of the chamber—are the shearers, rouseabouts, wool classers and transport operators. I have listened to much of the debate on this. I have not once heard the spokespeople who represent the Labor opposition talk about the people who service the industry. They are the most valuable asset we have in the wool industry. They make it tick. Look at the figures for the multiplier effect on employment. There is no industry in Australia that generates employment like the wool industry. We must make sure that what occurs after Monday results in a much stronger, more focused market, research and promotion effort. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para><para>Leave granted; debate adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Australian War Memorial</title><page.no>807</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 12 November, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Chee</inline>:</para><para>That the Senate take note of the document.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>807</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This report is a very instructive one, as with many of the other documents here. It is probably worth pointing out, by way of introduction, the purpose and mission of the 
 Australian War Memorial. Its purpose, as stated in the report, is to commemorate the sacrifice of those Australians who have died in war. Its mission is to assist Australians to remember, interpret and understand the Australian experience of war and its enduring impact on Australian society. Whatever philosophy and approach one takes to defence issues and to issues of armed conflict, I think that purpose and that mission are very laudable.</para></talk.start><para>The War Memorial performs a very important and significant service to the Australian community, and I believe it performs it very well. Some of the details in the report highlight the number of people that are involved on a daily basis with the activities of the Australian War Memorial. According to the report, the current staff totals 220-odd people and overall operating expenses in the last year were about $24.5 million. It is interesting in looking at some aspects of the report to see the huge range of activities that the War Memorial facilitates or sponsors. It is obviously well known in terms of the building itself and the various displays and information within it, but there has been quite a huge number of publications, papers and presentations at conferences, seminars and lectures that have been facilitated by the War Memorial for a wide range of people on an enormous number of topics.</para><para>There have also been a large number of gallery talks in the War Memorial throughout the course of the year from many people with actual experiences of war, giving details of the impact of war on people, on families and on whole societies and nations. Many scholarships and fellowships are provided by the War Memorial for various activities, whether it is purely historical documentation of people's experiences or whether it is technical stuff, such as one item here, to do with preventing the deterioration of rubber and rubber like products and materials and generally preserving items. As a memorial, it is also a place that is visited many times by people from overseas, dignitaries and official parties from overseas, and obviously it provides a quick, readily accessible but very comprehensive window to people from overseas about the Australian perspective on war.</para><para>I would like to mention briefly one issue in relation to the War Memorial which has had a little bit of coverage in the last week or two, which is whether or not the War Memorial should be involved in recognising and commemorating the wars or conflicts within Australia between the original inhabitants of this country and the invaders. I should say that there are other words that people might like to choose that are less confronting, but certainly people from Europe and other areas came in and clearly took that land away from the original inhabitants. On many occasions during that period that resulted in armed conflict and resistance, and obviously death, suffering and hardship as a result.</para><para>It is widely recognised that those conflicts have not had a lot of attention in our concept of our history, and it is an interesting and important issue as to how that might be built into the ongoing framework of the Australian War Memorial. I do not pass an opinion one way or the other on it other than to say that it is important that these conflicts are recognised and it would be worthwhile for the War Memorial to turn its attention to it. Coming back to its original purpose of commemorating the sacrifice of those Australians who have died in war and in armed conflict, it does seem to me that it is an important topic that the War Memorial and the people involved in it, who clearly take their responsibilities seriously, would do well to give some thought to.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>808</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Chee, Sen Bill</name><name role="display">Senator O'CHEE</name><name.id>EU4</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I will declare an interest, which is that I, like a number of other members of this chamber and also the other place, have been a contributor to the War Memorial in the past, and I expect I shall be so in the future. I know that there are many honourable senators, like Senator Hogg, I suspect, who are in that capacity. He is not the only one on the other side; I know that there are many supporters of the War Memorial on both sides of the chamber.</para></talk.start><para>There are many things that the War Memorial staff do which go unnoticed. We notice the exhibits, we notice the tanks, we notice the planes and we notice the cenotaph. But what is often unnoticed is the immense 
 care and attention given by staff of the Australian War Memorial to the needs and wishes of visiting veterans. Recently I had the great honour to accompany a group of veterans from an organisation with which I am associated, the Australian-Chinese Ex-services National Reunion, to the War Memorial to lay a wreath in respect of their former comrades. We were met by the Director of the War Memorial and a number of members of the staff. There was a wreath which was attended to by a member of the staff, who was the bearer of the wreath. There were members of staff assigned to be at the War Memorial to care for the veterans and their families, to attend to any requests that they had and to stand as an escort for those veterans until such time as they left the memorial.</para><para>I think this is a very fine thing that the Australian War Memorial does. It extends to our veterans the sort of respect which they deserve but which they would probably not ask for themselves. It is a fact that this respect is given without asking, which shows that the staff of the War Memorial treat their role as more than a job—in fact consider themselves, I would suspect, as the sacred guardians of the memories of the thousands of Australians whose lives have been lost in conflicts throughout the years. I do believe that we should remember the wars, we should remember and preserve the artefacts and the records, we should continue the research work, but we should not forget the role which is played by the staff of the Australian War Memorial in attending to our veterans when they visit, because it is a very important part of ensuring that we do not forget.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>808</page.no><name role="metadata">Hogg, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HOGG</name><name.id>7L6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I concur with the comments of Senator Bartlett and Senator O'Chee on the Australian War Memorial. It is unfortunate that so many reports tabled in this place fly through without being given much care or attention. Since I have been here, I have tried to speak on this particular report on each occasion. The War Memorial is a significant place for Australians, and it is a significant place in this capital. There is no doubt that the work of the War Memorial is not given by many people the recognition it deserves. I hope this shrine does not lose its significance as time goes by.</para></talk.start><para>To pick up a point made by Senator O'Chee, flicking through the report I noted on page 30 a photograph of a group of voluntary guides celebrating Volunteers Week at the memorial. That picture alone says a lot about the dedication, time, effort and energy which is put in by a number of voluntary guides who take their work at the memorial very seriously and who are very well received by the public.</para><para>In the director's corporate overview on pages 4 and 5, Steve Gower gives a succinct but clear view of the work undertaken over the last 12 months, and of the work which will take place in the future. He refers to the fact that the largest and most complex activity during the year was undoubtedly the refurbishment of the memorial's galleries. One of the features of the War Memorial at this stage is that it is undergoing a great deal of refurbishment. This will benefit the younger generations well into the future.</para><para>The director also refers to the restoration of the main building and to the first stage of the development of the memorial sculpture garden, which was completed during the year. He draws attention to a couple of significant events. The first was the central feature of the Merchant Navy memorial—the Dennis Adams sculpture called `Survivors'. It is fitting that members of the Merchant Navy have now been acknowledged for their role in the various wars that we have been involved in.</para><para>Another initiative is the establishment of a servicewomen's memorial, which will be incorporated into the next stage of the garden's development. The role that women played in wartime is sometimes overlooked. The women who served this country so admirably will now get proper recognition. I also note that another group which has sometimes felt left out—the British Commonwealth occupation force in Japan—is also going to be recognised for its service to the nation. That group has also felt isolated on some occasions.</para><para>One of the most pleasing aspects of Steve Gower's report is that, as he says, it was a successful year for the travelling exhibition program which is run by the War Memorial. The map on page 37 of the report shows that 
 the travelling exhibition went far and wide throughout Australia. This can only serve our nation well. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para><para>Leave granted; debate adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Australian Industrial Relations Commission and Australian Industrial Registry</title><page.no>809</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 12 November 1998, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hogg</inline>:</para><para>That the Senate take note of the reports.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>809</page.no><name role="metadata">Hogg, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HOGG</name><name.id>7L6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Document No. 11 is the reports for 1997-98 of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and the Australian Industrial Registry. I want to go through the significant part of the report which is on the termination of employment matters. Clearly, there is still a heavy workload for the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and the registry. That, of itself, is good. But on the issue of termination of employment, the report is quite specific. It tells us very clearly of the large number of people who felt disadvantaged by the termination of their employment and who have sought redress through the processes available through the commission.</para></talk.start><para>Interestingly, the bulk of the applications—61 per cent—were made in Victoria. In New South Wales, there were 1,291; the Northern Territory, 260; Queensland, 644; South Australia, 284; Tasmania, 112; Western Australia, 287; and the Australian Capital Territory, 253. It is interesting to note also that there were a number of appeals against decisions of the commission on the matter of jurisdiction—10 upheld; 23 dismissed. Whilst there were 33 cases in total, nearly one-third of those based on a jurisdictional argument were able to be brought forward before the tribunal.</para><para>On the matter of merit, six were upheld as opposed to 20 being dismissed. One appeal under `Other', which concerns costs, and one concerned with remedy, were both dismissed. It is interesting though that there is still a need for people to seek redress where they feel they have been wrongly done by in their dismissal. Table 5 gives us a fairly reasonable picture of why these cases were either settled 
 or withdrawn—or whatever may well have happened to them.</para><para>Of the 7,341 cases totally finalised, 4,094 were settled by conciliation. That shows that in over 50 per cent of the cases conciliation, which should underpin the industrial relations system, worked. Whilst there may well have been a substantial disagreement which caused termination—the outcome is not evident there—at least they were able to resolve the problems.</para><para>A total of 1,257 cases were withdrawn, settled or otherwise discontinued. Only 231 were dismissed at a preliminary stage on the threshold jurisdiction grounds, including `out of time'. One could not, by any stretch of the imagination, imply from what one sees in this report that these matters taken by the complainants were in any way trivial. There were a number, of course, that were unable to be settled by conciliation, and they totalled 1,731.</para><para>There are further charts throughout the document which, again, give a better insight as to what happened to those cases. For example, there were 619 substantive arbitrations, which represented 27.8 per cent of the cases. When one considers the number of dismissals that took place, that is a relatively low frequency. It shows that the protection afforded by the act is undoubtedly accessed and is warranted in this day and age. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>810</page.no><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name><name.id>SF4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to address the same report from the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, a body which, along with its predecessors, has been a central part of business life, industrial life and working life in Australia for almost all of the history since Federation, and it is important that this body be maintained. I say that not only because of the great history and the great tradition that the body has and the great work it presently does but because of some research that has come out of America. I mentioned this earlier in the day. It is research that I have been referred to by Max Ogden, an eminent member of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. He referred me to an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Scientific American</inline> , a very eminent and respected 
 magazine from the United States which deals with research in the area of unions and enterprises. It is important because not enough research is done in this area. This research shows some very interesting things.</para></talk.start><para>The opening paragraph of the article, which was in the August 1998 edition of <inline font-style="italic">Scientific American</inline>, states:</para><para>After nearly a century of union management warfare in the U.S., a series of nationwide surveys showing that union shops dominate the ranks of the country's most productive workplaces may come as a surprise. In fact, according to Lisa M. Lynch of Tufts University and Sandra Black of the New York Federal Reserve, economic Darwinism—the survival of the fittest championed by generations of hard-nosed tycoons—may be doing what legions of organizers could not: putting an end to autocratic bosses and regimented workplaces.</para><para>This research shows that the most productive workers are those who are highly motivated, who are in a good relationship with the employer and who are unionised. They are more productive than people in a similar position but who are not unionised.</para><para>The relevance of all of that to this annual report is that, if the idea is to encourage good relationships between employer and employee, that is best done—in the sense of being most productive—if done through the unions.

 about the corrupt research practices of the Country Liberal Party and the defrauding of Northern Territory taxpayers. The Senate was told that the CLP deliberately misled the Northern Territory Public Service into funding political research under the guidance of the Prime Minister's pollster, Mark Textor, and the current Chief Minister, Shane Stone.</para></talk.start><para>I have looked closely at the two reports of the corrupt research by Brian Sweeney and Associates, and I want to highlight the disturbing racial aspects of the methodology and findings. These documents reveal a willingness, even an eagerness, to pit black and white Territorians against each other for political gain—to appeal to the very worst aspects of human nature. The first and most damning fact, the focus group research carried out by Brian Sweeney and Associates and paid for by the Territory government, involved only white participants. A full one-third of the Territory's population was excluded from the survey, surely rendering its conclusions meaningless from the government's standpoint.</para><para>According to its title, the report was to be an `Insight into the Northern Territory'—but the findings are based on a survey sample which is chronically unrepresentative. Why then would Mark Textor see fit to exclude the Aboriginal population from the focus groups? The answer is simple: they did not fit the target market. Why would he want to include Aboriginals when they rarely vote CLP and their very presence may have inhibited the ability of his moderators to elicit the types of responses he wanted on the question of race?</para><para>Aboriginal issues and the attitudes of the selected `white Territorians' to them appear time and time again through the research report prepared by Ron Klein of Brian Sweeney and Associates. He offers the explanation that, while it was never his intention to focus so extensively on race matters:</para><para>Aboriginals emerged in the course of the conversation as a very big issue indeed.</para><para>It just sort of happened. How disingenuous is that? This is patent nonsense. For a start, focus groups are not therapy sessions, where participants are given the chance to pontificate on matters of their choice. Moderators 
 are trained to ensure that discussions stay within the ambit of the brief and they would never allow such a wide-ranging diversion.</para><para>We also know that Mr Klein's defence of the Aboriginal component of his research—`it was an accident'—can be proven to be false by a letter from Mark Textor to Andrew Coward three years after the research was completed. In this letter to Andrew Coward, Mark Textor advised him on approaches to future research, as follows:</para><para>If your interest is to have a Klein style `fresh', `new' view of the political landscape, I would remind you that Klein told us `nothing new' but, for example, put the Aboriginal Issue in its `Two sets of laws' context . . . that sort of finding is a natural outcome of the qualitative research method (where feeling and language is explored in depth).</para><para>This tells us three things. Firstly, the material on Aboriginal matters was the direct result of a deliberate line of questioning from the moderator, Klein. Secondly, this methodology was of the sort designed to elicit in-depth emotional responses on race—designed, as Mark Textor explains in the 1993 letter to Coward, to add `flavour' to a political strategy. Thirdly and most revealingly, this letter establishes the connection between the 1994 push polling question and the 1990 research. The notorious `two sets of laws' question resulted directly from this unethically obtained research. And Mark Textor is the common factor.</para><para>The report from Brian Sweeney and Associates places a political interpretation on the research findings, which speaks for itself. Consider these words, found on page 33 of the CLP version of the report:</para><para>The extent to which the Aboriginal issue is capable of evoking anger should not be underestimated.</para><para>If there is any doubt about the vile intent that lies behind those words, it is rammed home unequivocally when Klein later states:</para><para>The Aboriginal issue . . . shows the potential to be a major election issue. Handled correctly, we feel the Aboriginal issue could ensure the return of the CLP.</para><para>If in politics the price of success is the exploitation of prejudice, then surely that price is too high.</para><para>We know, beyond any doubt, that not only was the research in 1990 illegally obtained by the Country Liberal Party but also it was specifically designed to develop a negative race campaign.	We know that methodology was employed to elicit emotive responses on race to assist the CLP in maximising their capacity to exploit the issue. We know that, in the eyes of the operatives involved, resentment, intolerance and prejudice is campaign artillery to be ruthlessly exploited in the pursuit of power.

In doing so, they excluded the Aboriginal population, preferring instead to limit their research to white swinging voters who would best respond to the race card. They interpreted antagonism toward the Aboriginal community as political manna from heaven and they saw it as the way to election victory.</para><para>Our Prime Minister is proud to proclaim his belief that the things that unite us are more enduring than the things that divide us, yet his pollsters and apparatchiks develop campaigns which seek to inflame and exploit division.

During the RFA review period, some 30,000 submissions were received by the government from concerned Western Australians, and it is to be hoped their concerns will be addressed in the final RFA document. Of those received, an estimated 25,000 submissions directly opposed the logging of the remaining 10 percent of WA's old-growth forests.</para><para>In the Western Australian state parliament, the Standing Committee on Ecologically Sustainable Development inquired into the management of, and planning for, the use of state forests in Western Australia. This cross party committee unanimously agreed—that is an important point to note: unanimously 
 agreed—that the Regional Forest Agreement has fallen far short of its intended purpose. There are major discrepancies over the criteria on which the RFA is based. This in turn renders all projections and plans of dubious value. To quote the committee's report:</para><para>A pre-requisite for arriving at good solutions about forest use and management, is that figures about existing areas of forest, production forest and reserve forest are available and are accurately and objectively compiled.</para><para>This has not been done. The correct data has not been included, which means that the Regional Forest Agreement for Western Australia as proposed is currently based on flawed information. If you add to this the Court government's plan to sign the final agreement without Environmental Protection Authority assessment and with no further public scrutiny, you have a situation of grave concern to me and to hundreds of thousands of Western Australians.</para><para>As I speak, a small group of committed conservationists are standing firm in the forests of Wattle Block, near Northcliffe in the south-west of Western Australia—an area listed on the Commonwealth Register of the National Estate. We may see photographs or television footage of these protesters, some with dreadlocks or bare feet, hoisting themselves up into the treetops or chaining themselves to forest machinery, and we may decide we have little in common with these people. But what we must realise is that for every protester in the forest there are thousands and thousands—in fact, hundreds of thousands—of others from what is called `mainstream Australia'—doctors, schoolteachers, lawyers, academics, public servants, truck drivers, scientists, secretaries and gravediggers—mainstream Australians who want the clear-felling of old-growth forests to stop.</para><para>You may wonder why I have used the term `hundreds of thousands are opposed'. A survey by AMR Quantum Harris Research conducted earlier this year shows that 87 per cent of Western Australians do not want the timber industry to clear-fell old-growth forests. Eighty-three per cent are opposed to old-growth forests being used for woodchips. That amounts to hundreds of thousands of Western Australians.</para><para>Time is running out for our old-growth forests. Every day, hectare upon hectare of jarrah, karri, marri and she-oak trees, many hundreds of years old, are being clear-felled in the south-west of Western Australia.</para><para>The Western Australian government must take the utmost care when signing the proposed regional forest agreement. This agreement will determine the future of what little old-growth forest we now have left in Western Australia. Future generations will either applaud them—or despise them—for their actions over the RFA.</para><para>On 25 May this year, I rose in this House to speak about a logging coupe known as Dombakup 24. D24 consists of less than 200 hectares of karri, jarrah, she-oak and tingle wood situated some 11 kilometres west of the Northcliffe township in the south-west of our state, and surrounded by private landowners. I remind you that 200 hectares of old-growth forest like that take hundreds of years to grow and would take two weeks to clear-fell.</para><para>I am pleased to advise the Senate of a positive outcome for Dombakup 24. Early in 1998, the Department of Conservation and Land Management—whom I have often described as `Genghis CALM' because they are both pillagers and conservers—had earmarked Dombakup 24 for clear-felling but, on 4 August 1998, CALM announced an indefinite moratorium on logging this forest because of its significance to the Aboriginal people.</para><para>Unfortunately, CALM had constructed 8½ kilometres of log road through Dombakup 24 before completing the necessary roading checklist. Had that been done, CALM would have discovered the existence of significant Aboriginal places within the forest of Dombakup 24. CALM only needed to contact the Manjimup Aboriginal Corporation to have been told of the significance of that forest to Aboriginal people.</para><para>To its credit, CALM acted swiftly when it finally acknowledged the seriousness of its mistake and authorised an archaeological study to be undertaken in the D24 region. That study—by Dortch, Gardos and O'Reilly from the Centre for Archaeology at the University of Western Australia—was conse 
 quently completed and the report was released.</para><para>I take this opportunity to applaud CALM for declaring a moratorium on logging at Dombakup 24, but this moratorium should be upgraded from indefinite to permanent. For those 200 hectares, it is a little bit like being on death row. They can at some stage be logged by CALM. I remind the Senate that the Western Australian government have put CALM in the extraordinary situation of being reliant on clear-felling and woodchipping for income for their current expenditure. The result is a massive conflict of interest. The Dortch archaeological report clearly states:</para><para>The entire area of Dombakup 24 is highly likely to contain many undisturbed archaeological sites and is archaeologically significant because:</para><para>1. It contains the only archaeological sites so far located in Karri tall open forest,</para><para>2. These sites are probably the last undisturbed sites associated with Aboriginal exploitation of the Northcliffe Silcrete Quarry, which is an important site in south-western Australia.</para><para>The report went on:</para><para>Our findings also suggest that the existence of other Aboriginal sites in Karri and other forests is a reasonable proposition.</para><para>The events surrounding Dombakup 24 highlight a serious anomaly between the mining and timber industries. Before being granted a mining licence, all prospectors—be they large multinationals or fossickers with metal detectors—are advised that they must comply with the provisions of the Aboriginal Heritage Act before proceeding with excavation of any kind. Those provisions include a search for areas of Aboriginal significance. According to the WA Department of Minerals and Energy:</para><para>Damage to a site under the Aboriginal Heritage Act 1990 carries a penalty of up to $10,000 and two years imprisonment.</para><para>That is pretty substantial, and the mining industry takes note of it. The fact that CALM, on the other hand, a government agency, undertook to construct log roads right through an area of major significance without having done a search—under their own criteria—of the most basic kind is a matter of serious concern. It must never happen again. If the mining industry can conform to strict guidelines set by the Aboriginal Heritage Act, then 
 so too should CALM and the timber industry. I encourage this Senate to not be sanguine about this RFA process, despite its complexity and the politics that surround it, and really to start to adopt it with the same passion and understanding with which we have adopted other preservation campaigns.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>HMAS Hobart</title><page.no>815</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>815</page.no><name role="metadata">Watson, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WATSON</name><name.id>VJ4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Tonight I wish to bring to the Senate's attention a matter of some significance to my state of Tasmania. It is a project to bring HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Hobart</inline>  back to the home port of Hobart. As you well know, Mr Acting Deputy President Sherry, the Royal Australian Navy plan to decommission HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Hobart</inline>  in the year 2000. A specially convened committee of the Naval Association of Australia, Tasmania Section, aim to bring HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Hobart</inline>  from her home port of Sydney, after her decommissioning.</para></talk.start><para>The committee plans to acquire the HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Hobart</inline> and to set up a naval museum and permanent display of HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Hobart</inline> in the port of Hobart. The committee has a strong interest in preserving Tasmania's naval heritage—indeed it is a rich heritage, Tasmania being an island state—particularly with the declining Royal Australian Navy presence in Hobart.</para><para>Apart from the ship being a memorial and museum, the committee envisages the ship as an important tourist facility along the lines of HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Castlemaine</inline> at Williamstown in Victoria, HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Diamantina</inline> in Brisbane, and HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Vampire</inline> at Darling Harbour in Sydney.</para><para>It could also be used, if need be, for overnight accommodation, cocktail parties, meetings of specialist small groups. It could be used as a Naval Reserve cadet facility. The options for the siting of the ship vary from tying up alongside, to placing it in a concrete cradle. A concrete cradle is the preferred option.</para><para>The committee hopes that HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Hobart</inline> can be located at one of the wharves in Sullivans Cove or, possibly, near the botanical gardens. The preferred site is at Ross Bay on the Derwent River, just along from the exist 
 ing Naval Reserve cadet facilities and close to the old HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Huon</inline> naval depot. The ship would be maintained and run by Naval Association volunteers. Planning is certainly in the early stages, but the project involves significant cost implications and will require meticulous long-term planning to succeed. We all wish the project well.</para><para>The committee is now seeking public and corporate sponsorship—as well as the cooperation of federal and state politicians and the Hobart City Council. Already, considerable support has been received from the Tasmanian state government and opposition, the Hobart City Council, Tasmanian senators—both Liberal and Labor—Tasmanian members of the House of Representatives, the Hobart Ports Corporation, Admiral Don Chalmers, Chief of Navy, Admiral Mike Hudson, National President of the Naval Association of Australia, the HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Hobart</inline> Association, the Returned Services League of Australia Inc., Tasmanian Branch, and the Navy League of Australia, Tasmanian Division.</para><para>HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Hobart</inline> is a Charles F. Adams class guided missile destroyer, built by the Defoe Shipbuilding Co. in Michigan in the United States. She is an interesting vessel. She was launched on 9 January 1964 and commissioned on 18 December 1965. In the year of decommissioning—year 2000—she will have been in service for Australia for 35 years.</para><para>She has a displacement of 4,500 tons, a length of 437 feet and a beam of 47 feet. She has a speed in excess of 30 knots with a complement of 20 officers and 313 sailors. Her armament includes two 5-inch automatic rapid fire guns, antiaircraft guided missiles, anti-submarine missiles and antisubmarine homing torpedoes.</para><para>HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Hobart</inline> was the first Australian destroyer to be sent to Vietnam, leaving Sydney on 7 March 1967 for attachment to the US Seventh Fleet and returning home for the final time on 11 October 1968. In her first deployment to Vietnam, HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Hobart</inline> steamed 52,529 miles and came under enemy fire on nine occasions. She fired something like 9,204 rounds at 1,050 targets while in Vietnamese waters. In her second deployment, HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Hobart</inline> steamed some 44,579 miles and came under fire on three occasions.</para><para>Guided missile destroyer ships <inline font-style="italic">Perth</inline>, <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Hobart</inline> have been so successful that they have continued to be useful well beyond their normal life expectation. They have all been extensively modernised over the years. The primary objective in disposing of any public asset is to maximise the return to the Commonwealth. The Minister for Defence in the first Howard government, the Hon. Ian McLachlan, promised, however, to assess any proposal where it can be demonstrated that substantial benefits will accrue to a local economy by re-utilising an obsolete platform.</para><para>Since we are being broadcast, I will take this occasion to pass on to Mr Ian McLachlan, the former Minister for Defence, my sincere sympathy in the recent passing of his father, a distinguished South Australian.</para><para>Precedents have been set for the gifting of ships to other states, and the government must give very serious consideration to the gifting of HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Hobart</inline> to Tasmania. As this class of ship was phased out by the United States navy some years ago, continuing support is difficult and, therefore, removal of some systems and equipment will be required for ongoing support of HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Hobart</inline>'s sister ship, HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane</inline>. The committee does, nevertheless, retain the hope that the ship will be as near as possible to her present condition on decommissioning.</para><para>The project's goal is significant to the whole of Tasmania—it is certainly advantageous to the city of Hobart—and presents a perfect opportunity to capture significant naval heritage whilst providing a unique state headquarters for the Naval Association in Tasmania.</para><para>I therefore take the opportunity afforded by this adjournment debate to urge the new Minister for Defence, the Hon. John Moore, to give favourable consideration to locating the HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Hobart</inline> in the port of Hobart after her decommissioning in the year 2000.

At 
 the time of his death, Derek was about a month short of his 79th birthday. The incident brought to an end the life of a remarkable man.</para></talk.start><para>Mr Acting Deputy President, may I send my sympathy to Cynthia, his partner, and his four daughters Diana, Philippa, Biddy and Kim. Derek was born in England on 19 September 1919. In the mid-1930s, when 17 years of age, he came to Australia and began working as a jackaroo. When the Second World War broke out, he enlisted in the Australian Army. He did his duty as a soldier in Palestine, North Africa, India and, later on, the Kokoda Trail. While in New Guinea, he was seriously wounded and thereby affected for the rest of his days. This did not stop his full engagement in life, as all those who knew him can attest.</para><para>Derek was a tall man and confident in his stature. Because of his big feet which were attached to a pair of very long legs, he was called `Boots' by all those who knew him well.</para><para>A number of his former military comrades attended his funeral and held the customary ceremony at the conclusion of the main service. When Derek left the army in 1946, he joined the Australian Labor Party. In 1949 he left the ALP and joined the Communist Party. This was when the government of the day sent troops into the coal mines. Fortunately, his departure was not a permanent one and he returned to the true faith. He went back to England for some years and worked in England for the ALP while living there. He then returned to Western Australia where he was highly active in the party and served on its state executive. He made many friends there. Senator Evans and Senator McKiernan knew him in the state they both represent so well.</para><para>Seven years ago, Derek came to Melbourne to be with Cynthia Mountstephen who was recovering from an operation. She was a longstanding family friend. They both resided at the Old Colonist in North Fitzroy at the time of his death. I would like to quote some words from Cynthia which she spoke after Derek's death. She said:</para><para>He was the most loving and generous man, so full of kindness to everybody. I would describe him as charmingly eccentric. I know it sounds ridiculous, because he was nearly 79 and I'm 82, but we had a wonderfully romantic relationship. 
</para><para>While in Melbourne, Derek did an amazing amount of voluntary work. When he died he was the President of the Immigration and Ethnic Affairs Policy Committee of the ALP and I often spoke with him in that context. I had many a discussion with Derek. He came up in conversations I had with others. His reputation was high. He was a selfless man, of joyful disposition, keen to work to the limits of his injured body and dedicated to the causes he espoused.</para><para>Derek served Australia in peace and in war, not for reward and status, but because it was in his nature to do so. He is typical of many people who see the interests of others as of fundamental importance and who seek to further them regardless of personal benefit. Their membership of political parties like the ALP gives those parties the best of their spirit and culture. They are the sorts of people who make up the fabric of a good society. Derek was amongst the best of them.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><adjournment><adjournmentinfo><time.stamp>19:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>817</page.no></adjournmentinfo><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senate adjourned at 7.32 p.m.</inline></para></adjournment><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>817</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tabling</title><page.no>817</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following documents were tabled by the Clerk:</para><para>Civil Aviation Act—Civil Aviation Regulations—Civil Aviation Orders—Exemption No. CASA 42/1998.</para><para>Superannuation Guarantee Determination SGD 98/2.</para><para>Taxation Determination—</para><para>	 TD 93/223 (Addendum).</para><para>	 TD 98/26.</para><para>Taxation Ruling—</para><para>	 SST 14.</para><para>	 TR 98/17.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Unproclaimed Legislation</title><page.no>817</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following document was tabled pursuant to standing order 139(2):</para><para>Unproclaimed legislation—Document providing details of all provisions of Acts which come into effect on proclamation and which have not been proclaimed, including statements of reasons for their non-proclamation and information relating to the timetable for their operation, as at 23 October 1998.
