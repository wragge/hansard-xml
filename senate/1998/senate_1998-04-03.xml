The doyen of parliamentary broadcasters died on Tuesday at the age of 71. Many of us were not in the Senate while Kevin was a broadcaster, but I cannot imagine that there is anyone who had not heard his broadcasts and effectively knew him. He really was a pioneer of ABC radio, starting his career in Adelaide at the age of 21 where he worked for a time before going to Darwin. His friends at the time were a bit dismayed at him being sent to Darwin. They probably did not know much about it. They used to send food parcels to him in Darwin to make sure that he survived. Food was one of the things that Kevin really enjoyed.</para></talk.start><para> Darwin was a real challenge for a young broadcaster. Many of the items they took were landlined from the south or the south-east. Frequently that failed, so the broadcaster was left to his own devices to fill in the hours on radio, which he did. He became a much loved character in Darwin. He was the principal broadcaster for the 1956 Olympic Games and, subsequent to that, became principal sports broadcaster in Sydney for the ABC. He came to Canberra in 1957 and for 29 years was involved with the parliamentary broadcasts and on the ABC. Every night he had a different flower in his lapel on the ABC television news. He had a magnificent voice, the voice one associates with ABC radio: meticulous pronunciation and command of grammar—and he did it so well.</para><para> For those of us who knew him about the parliament, we were sad when he retired after 29 years here, but he stayed on for a period doing the work on a part-time basis. I cannot quite remember when he retired, but it is a couple of years ago or so I think since he was doing some of the parliamentary broadcasts. 
 He certainly was a character in radio and he was a character around Parliament House.</para><para>I mourn his passing. I am sure all senators mourn his passing. He was MC at the wedding of our Deputy Usher of the Black Rod, Andrea Griffiths, as she was a friend from university days with one of his daughters. There will be many people in Canberra and around Australia who will have their favourite Kevin Chapman stories to tell.</para><para>He had been in hospital having a knee reconstruction. As he was being discharged from hospital, he had a massive heart attack and died there. He was a man who enjoyed life. As I said, he enjoyed food. He enjoyed wine. I think he would be happy for me to say that he was a happy punter and he certainly enjoyed going to the races. I will miss him. For myself and for the Senate, I will convey condolences to his family.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>UNKNOWN</name.id><name role="metadata">Honourable senators</name><name role="display">Honourable senators</name></talker><para>—Hear, hear!</para></talk.start></interjection></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ORDER OF BUSINESS</title><type>Business</type><page.no>1955</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Days and Hours of Meeting and Routine of Business</title><page.no>1955</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Campbell</inline>)—by leave—agreed to:</para><para>That the order of the Senate of 26 March 1998, relating to the hours of meeting and routine of business for today, be varied to provide that the sitting of the Senate be suspended from 12.15 p.m. till 1 p.m.</para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>NOTICES OF MOTION</title><type>Notices</type><page.no>1955</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Regulations and Ordinances Committee</title><page.no>1955</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>1955</page.no><name role="metadata">Calvert, Sen Paul</name><name role="display">Senator CALVERT</name><name.id>5F4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On behalf of Senator O'Chee, pursuant to notice given at the last day of sitting on behalf of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee, I now withdraw business of the Senate notice of motion No. 2 standing in his name for six sitting days after today for the disallowance of the Therapeutic Goods Regulations (Amendment), as contained in Statutory Rules 1997 No. 401.</para></talk.start></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL 1997 [No. 2]</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>1956</page.no><id.no>r455</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>1956</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 2 April, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ian Campbell</inline>:</para><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para><para>upon which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolkus</inline>  had moved by way of amendment:</para><para>At the end of the motion, add "but the Senate notes that:</para><para>(a)	 The High Court of Australia in its 1992 <inline font-style="italic">Mabo</inline>  decision, found that a system of native title to land emerging from the traditions, laws and customs of indigenous Australians pre-existed the legal system that has been implemented in the time since European settlement, and further found that native title has survived despite later grants of interests in some places, and is merged within our common law;</para><para>(b)	 the <inline font-style="italic">Native Title Act 1993</inline>  was the first attempt to manage native title claims emerging from the High Court finding, and was inevitably destined to be amended in the light of practical experience and further Court decisions;</para><para>(c)	 in taking office in 1996, the Government accepted the responsibility of integrating the concept, expression and exercise of native title into the social and legal framework of this nation, a responsibility that was initially taken up in 1993 by the Keating Labor government;</para><para>(d)	 the <inline font-style="italic">Wik</inline>  decision of the High Court in 1996 was an inevitable and desirable part of a process whereby an emerging body of case law gave better definition to a legal concept, and deserved a prudent and measured legislative response from the Government;</para><para>(e)	 the response of the Coalition in government mirrored its response when in opposition in 1993, in that it chose a divisive, negative and politically opportunistic approach to an issue of historic importance;</para><para>(f)	 the Government, in seeking to amend the 1993 Act, has been driven by a desire to appease sectional interests opposed to the concept of native title, rather than any aim of finding a workable model acceptable to all stakeholders;</para><para>(g)	 the Prime Minister's self-styled "Compact with the miners and pastoralists" is a betrayal of the compact with the Australian people that is intrinsic to his office;

I also note the comments from the other side and appreciate the cooperation of the opposition in facilitating the second reading debate.</para></talk.start></continue><para> It is now almost six years since the High Court's Mabo decision, but native title remains a difficult issue for Australians. It is a common law property right based on the traditional laws and customs of Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders. It is complex, involving the interaction of a common law right, whose actual content, location and holders are still generally unknown, with Australia's statutory land law and management systems. It also evokes considerable passion. Native title is clearly an issue which requires of this parliament an approach based on fairness, balance and certainty. The government believes that this bill is a fair, balanced, equitable and practical response to the issues which have emerged since 1993.</para><para>The debate has progressed considerably since the 10-point plan was formulated now almost 12 months ago. It is now generally conceded that there are substantial deficiencies in the current act—principally that the current act was not designed to deal with native title which coexists with other rights and interests on the same land. Four years experience has shown us that some procedures in the current act are constitutionally questionable and that others work inappropriately and inefficiently, if at all. Four years after the act came into effect, there are still only two determinations of native title on the Australian mainland. The Native Title Act is not working for the benefit of Aboriginal people, and it must be fixed now.</para><para>It is also now more widely conceded that the  Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 [No. 2]  does not override or overturn the decisions of the High Court in Mabo and Wik. The government has always rejected these suggestions and the recent Larrakia decision of the Federal Court supports the government's position. The act, as amended by the bill, will recognise and protect native title in Australia, including coexisting native title on pastoral lease land. But the bill provides, as the court held in Wik, that the lessee's rights do prevail.</para><para>There is also greater recognition that ongoing uncertainty about native title is damaging our social and economic life. The situation should be resolved by clear, precise legisla 
 tion. This bill provides the way forward. It builds on the common law but adds a much greater level of certainty and predictability for native title holders, pastoralists, miners and governments.</para><para>The opposition voted for the bill as amended by the Senate last year and has indicated that it thought that outcome an acceptable one. If this continues to be its position, then many of the issues which were so hotly debated in this chamber at the end of 1997 need not be revisited. Over 900 amendments were proposed in the Senate debate last time this bill was considered and 217 were passed by the Senate. The bill now before the Senate incorporates 107 of these and, on fair and objective considerations, these amendments represent genuine improvement to the bill.</para><para>Over recent weeks, the government has invested significant efforts in talking to various parties in an attempt to reduce the remaining areas of disagreement as much as possible. We have done so in the hope that this time consideration can be much more focused and, hopefully, more productive. The government will be moving amendments reflecting the outcome of those discussions, in many cases to clarify the intention and operation of the bill's provisions, and to promote a sensible, workable outcome because, whatever emerges from this chamber, it should mean solutions, not more problems.</para><para>There are four principal areas of disagreement between the government and the Senate: the registration test, the right to negotiate, the Racial Discrimination Act and the sunset clause. It is essential that the Native Title Act contain a registration test of sufficient rigour to ensure that only bona fide, legitimate claims are registered and have access to the right to negotiate process.</para><para>Multiple, overlapping, competing claims covering vast areas of Australia, many claiming exclusive possession where there are other interests in the land, are dividing Aboriginal communities and causing racial tension in many parts of Australia. We cannot accept the Senate's watering down of the test, but we have proposed amendments which clarify its operation in a way that should be acceptable to the Senate.</para><para>The bill maintains the right to negotiate for mining and some compulsory acquisitions in areas where native title may be a high level right approaching ownership of the land; that is, our bill maintains the right to negotiate on some 39 per cent of Australia. But the right to negotiate is operating as a significant impediment to development. To apply this complex, legalistic, drawn-out process on up to 79 per cent of Australia for all exploration and mining, as suggested by some of our opponents, will have potentially disastrous social and economic consequences. The government does not believe that the full right to negotiate is appropriate or fair where native title can only consist of much more limited rights and, in particular, where native title can only be a coexisting right. In such cases, state and territory governments should be able to put in place alternative processes which provide native title holders with the same procedural rights as other title holders.</para><para>Our opponents are deliberately creating the impression that if native title holders do not have the full right to negotiate then under the government's bill they get nothing and their native title rights are rendered useless. That, of course, is completely false. The proposal that the right to negotiate not apply on pastoral lease land and in towns and cities has no effect on the ability of native title holders to claim their native title rights in relation to these areas, and to exercise their rights to the fullest extent possible.</para><para>The proposed application of the right to negotiate will simply mean that, for future economic development on that land, native title holders will have exactly the same procedural rights as the pastoral lessee with whom they share the land, or a freeholder; that is, native title holders would have the same procedural rights as others and often the same rights as those who hold the highest form of interest in land known to the common law—freehold. In the government's view, this is a just and truly non-discriminatory position.</para><para>The bill will introduce a much greater level of certainty and predictability to native title issues. We believe that this will deliver greater benefits to native title holders and other interests. The government is not pre 
 pared to jeopardise these benefits by incorporating amendments which are clearly inappropriate, uncertain or ambiguous. This is why we cannot accept the Senate's amendment subjecting the Native Title Act to the Racial Discrimination Act.</para><para>The government is not neglecting its national and international obligations to prevent racial discrimination, including through the Native Title Act. But the provision passed by the Senate last year is ambiguous and uncertain, and its effects are unclear. Further, the non-government parties do not appear to even agree on what the Senate amendment actually means. On one view, it is simply an interpretive provision. If this is the intention, then there is no reason to amend the current provisions regarding the Racial Discrimination Act. On another view, the amendment may allow actions to be attacked in court, notwithstanding complete compliance with the Native Title Act. No responsible government could accept this risk. It was not acceptable to the Labor government in 1993 and it remains unacceptable now. The Senate has an obligation to make clear, precise laws, especially in this area where certainty and predictability are so much needed.</para><para>Finally, the government cannot accept the Senate's removal of the sunset clause. In the four years since the Native Title Act came into operation, there have been over 700 claims lodged, covering over 50 per cent of Australia. The government—and I believe the people of Australia—regard it as eminently reasonable and fair to propose that any further claims made under the Native Title Act should be lodged within the next six years.</para><para>All the government is saying is that native title claimants who believe they have a reasonable claim should lodge it within the next six years if they wish to take advantage of the benefits of the Native Title Act. Once registered, the claim will remain on the register until there is a final determination. This is an eminently fair and reasonable proposal, particularly given that there is no sunset applying to ordinary common law claims.</para><para>Given opposition remarks on this issue, I would like to specifically address the matter 
 of the requirements of the constitution's section 57. If the Senate fails to pass this bill—or passes it with amendments to which the House of Representatives will not agree—then the bill will comply with the requirements of section 57, which is available to resolve disagreements between the houses. The requirements of section 57 are clear and precise. These requirements have been met.</para><para>The original bill was passed by the House in 1997. The Senate made significant amendments when it considered it last year. The House of Representatives stated in the clearest possible terms on 6 December 1997 that it disagreed with many of those amendments. Three months elapsed since the House indicated that disagreement and laid the bill aside. The bill was then reintroduced into the House. It was in the form of the original proposed law, with some of the amendments made by the Senate in 1997, as clearly permitted by section 57. It has passed the House of Representatives unamended. It is now before us.</para><para>The government does not seek a double dissolution and joint sitting in relation to this bill. We continue to hope that it will prove to be unnecessary. But, if the continued opposition obstruction of this bill makes a double dissolution necessary, the preconditions will have been met.</para><para>I note that the opposition continues to argue that the bill is unconstitutional, notwithstanding the resounding defeat of their arguments on the Hindmarsh Island Bridge Act in the High Court yesterday. They were wrong about that act, as they are wrong about this bill. A significant majority of the court held in Kartinyeri that a law passed under the races power can be amended under that power, or that the races power allows detrimental as well as beneficial laws, or both. The decision supports the government's position, all the more so because the Native Title Act, as amended by this bill, will continue to be beneficial to native title holders.</para><para>The bill preserves and respects the common law of native title, in line with the High Court's Mabo and Wik decisions. It recognises and protects native title so that it can still be claimed, in line with Wik, over 79 per cent of Australia. Unlike the current act, it specifi 
 cally recognises and protects potentially coexisting native title on pastoral lease land—over 40 per cent of Australia's land area. It ensures that native title cannot be extinguished by a government grant of additional primary production rights to a leaseholder. The bill retains the right to negotiate for land that has never been alienated and where native title may be equivalent to full ownership. It provides native title claimants with the same procedural rights as the lessee for mining on pastoral leases. It guarantees registered claimants' existing access to pastoral lease land, pending a native title determination. It provides a clearer claims process and deals with the overlapping and multiple claims that are dividing indigenous communities. It recognises and strengthens the role of native title representative bodies to facilitate the recognition and protection of native title. And the bill enables the legally certain agreements that are essential for coexistence.</para><para>On other constitutional issues raised in relation to this bill, it should be noted that it provides significant notification and compensation rights, in some cases greater than those contained in Labor's 1993 act. Further, it meets the requirements of the constitution for just terms for any acquisition of property. The government is confident of the constitutionality of the bill, and we have released expert legal advice supporting that view. If the opposition is so confident of its arguments about the constitutionality of our legislation, then it should do what it did with the Hindmarsh Island legislation: let this bill pass the parliament and ask the High Court to rule on the matter. That will avoid a double dissolution election on this issue and allow judicial consideration of the opposition's objections. I should add that this morning the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has announced, in furtherance of our view, that the federal government would be prepared to fund the challenge to this legislation to allow the High Court to rule finally on the matter.</para><para>This bill restores certainty to Australia's land management system in a manner which is fair, balanced and in the overall national interest. It recognises and protects native title in Australia, including native title on pastoral 
 lease land. It balances the aspirations of Aboriginal Australians with the interests of others in the community. It recognises the legitimate needs of elected local and state governments, and farmers, pastoral lessees and miners for certainty in land management. It is based on a recognition that a positive environment for our mining and pastoral industries is essential for the economic wellbeing of all Australians and, most particularly, Aboriginal Australians. Most importantly, the bill will deliver a more certain and secure foundation for the recognition of native title in Australia.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>1960</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I do not intend to speak again on the amendment other than to indicate that, in discussions with some of the other players in the Senate, I have deemed it appropriate that we try to amend the amendment in three or four minor ways.

There are also minor changes to the Social Security Act 1991 and the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. A range of matters is encompassed within the bill, and some of the changes to the health insurance legislation are substantial. The primary aim of the legislation is to regulate insurance products, particularly those that threaten the community rating basis of private health insurance.</para></talk.start><para>The opposition is generally supportive of the provisions in the bill. However, there is one particular matter that we are opposed to—and an amendment in my name has been circulated—and that is schedule 2 of the bill. I will deal with that in more detail a little later, but schedule 2 of the bill is that section which would remove the guaranteed 35-day provision for payment of acute care rates for patients in private hospitals.</para><para>As I said, the opposition is generally supportive of the bill. For instance, the provisions which relate to the simplification of the billing system and the establishment of agreements between hospitals, practitioners and health insurers, which will provide greater information to patients and doctors about extra expenses, are matters that we are supportive of. We are hopeful that the legislation will work particularly to minimise gaps. We also note that underpinning the legislation is a commitment to ensuring that the professionalism of doctors is respected. In this regard, I just mention in passing the model at Melbourne Hospital.</para><para>The bill also renames the Private Health Insurance Commissioner, who is henceforth to be called the Private Health Ombudsman—or maybe that should be `Ombudsperson'. In any event, we support that provision within the bill, as long as that office will make regular reports and the office has the opportunity to highlight issues of concern within the public domain.</para><para>On a number of occasions, we have seen situations where, with the establishment of an ombudsman's office, whilst intended to have independence and be there as a public watchdog, quite often, particularly when they focus on matters of public concern, they suffer the brunt of government or the bureaucracy in seeking to limit their effectiveness. As I said, we are supportive of the establishment of the office but we put the government on notice that we will be watching very closely to ensure that the office has, and is able to exercise freely, impartially and independently, the powers that it is given.</para><para>As I said at the outset, the main area of concern for the opposition in this bill is the clauses which relate to the removal of what is known as the 35-day rule in private hospitals. I refer to the document produced by the Information and Research Service of the Parliamentary Library and I will outline in the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> and for the benefit of the public and senators just what the current position is. The document on the bill states:</para><para>Benefits may be paid under the <inline font-style="italic">Health Insurance Act 1973</inline>  at an acute care rate and also at a lower rate to a nursing home type patient . . . occupying 
 a hospital bed. The Act presently defines a nursing home type patient as `including a hospital patient who has been in care for a continuous period exceeding 35 days but does not include a patient that has been issued with either a 3A determination or a 3B certificate' . . . </para><para>A 3B certificate is a certificate issued by a medical practitioner certifying that the patient requires acute care.</para><para>That is the current position. The documents continues:</para><para>The Bill proposes that the present definition of a nursing home type patient be repealed and replaced with a new definition, under which `a nursing home patient is a patient in a hospital who is included in a class of person identified by the Minister by written notice but does not include a patient that has been issued with either a 3A determination or a 3B certificate.</para><para>The Act presently requires that benefits be paid at an acute care rate for the first 35 days of a patient's hospitalisation regardless of whether acute care is actually provided. Measures in this Bill propose that this provision be removed and replaced with a regulation `that provides for determination of benefits to nursing home type patients at an appropriate level and structure (including that acute care benefits are paid when acute care is provided)'.</para><para>To summarise that, this bill removes the current requirement that the benefits be paid at the acute care rate for the first 35 days of a patient's hospitalisation in a private hospital, regardless whether acute care is provided or not. In other words, currently the level of care may be more akin to the care provided in a nursing home situation, but for the first 35 days of that patient's stay in the private hospital acute care benefits are applied.</para><para>We believe this provision has worked well as it ensures, firstly, no detriment to the patient and, secondly, appropriate funding for the hospital through the Medicare system. We are very concerned that removing this current guarantee will severely affect patients. For instance, having been hit as hard as they have been by this government over the last 12 months or more, particularly in respect of the changes to the nursing home arrangements and then further changes late last year when the government recognised that its proposals were simply not going to work, we now have a situation where elderly people particularly could be admitted to a private hospital and, 
 because they are classified to receive a level of care more appropriate to a nursing home, even though they are not in a nursing home, may end up having to pay the difference between the charges of the hospital and the level of benefit paid for the stay in hospital.</para><para>The ultimate winners from this proposal are the health insurance funds. It seems that this government is bending over backwards to assist the private health insurance funds at the expense in some cases of patients such as the ones that I am referring to. We do not believe that this measure is fair or equitable for the patients concerned. As I said, the problem with this section of the bill is that it will result in elderly people being forced to have out-of-pocket expenses because they cannot get entry into a nursing home at that particular time or they are on a waiting list and also because they cannot be covered for the full cost of care in the private hospital for those 35 days if this provision is removed.</para><para>We understand that the health funds really do not want to pay acute care rates for patients who normally would be in need of nursing home care but who are admitted to, and staying in, a hospital. The health funds, naturally, argue that the difference between the nursing home subsidy and the acute care rate, which can be substantial, should not be subsidised by the health funds. Whilst that argument is understandable from the perspective of the private health funds, as I said, the real outcome of changing or removing the current guarantee will impact most severely upon the patients.</para><para>For instance, under this provision a person admitted to a private hospital for specific medical reasons—they may have had a heart attack or a stroke—may within a week or two be reclassified as being non-acute. In that case, because the level of benefit payable drops—in some cases by as much as $400 a day—that patient may ultimately have to foot the difference. The government says that this affects only nursing home type patients, but we are concerned—and concerns have been expressed by such groups as those involved in schizophrenia awareness—about the impact of this upon persons with severe physical or intellectual disabilities.</para><para>Yesterday the Prime Minister announced a package whereby the government would fund to the order of $270 million improvements particularly for carers, persons looking after older people or disabled people within the home. As we have pointed out, this injection of funds is really just putting back into the system money that had been taken out previously. We regard it as somewhat hypocritical that, on one hand, the government is making a major play about the injection of some $270 million into the system and yet, on the other hand, it is seeking to remove a provision which could substantially impact upon the very people that the government claims it is concerned about.</para><para>We have seen over the past 12 months or even longer that the attitude of this government is to make the elderly pay more and pay more often simply to get appropriate nursing home care. The provision to remove the 35-day guarantee is of the same vain. Once again it strikes at the very people least able to cope.</para><para>We are concerned that the age care assessment team could determine that a person needs a hospital bed and that subsequently that person could need to be moved to a nursing home but because of the delays and the procedures for reclassifying that person as a nursing home patient while still in the hospital our estimate is that out-of-pocket expenses for such a person could amount to many thousands of dollars before they actually get admitted to the nursing home. On the top of other charges that have been introduced by this government that is very substantial.</para><para>We ask the government to reconsider its position on this provision and support our proposal to remove schedule 2 from the bill. That would, in turn, maintain the position as it currently is. That is the major and critical issue that we believe needs to be amended in this bill. As I said at the outset, we support the remaining provisions of the bill.</para><para>I finish on the note that we continue to express our grave concern at this government's attitude to the most important issues of health care, the maintenance of Medicare and the adequate provision of nursing home accommodation, which our elderly citizens are entitled to. They should not be financially 
 burdened in the way that this government is seeking to do. In the committee stage I will move the amendment that has been circulated in my name.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>1965</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak to the Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997 on behalf of the Australian Democrats, and particularly the Leader of the Democrats, Senator Meg Lees, who, as honourable senators would no doubt be aware, has been active in the health area for many years on behalf of the Democrats and would normally be the person addressing this bill. The bill, as has been outlined by previous speakers, makes some long overdue changes to a range of areas in the health system, particularly private health insurance and the private health sector. The Democrats have been concerned for many years about the inefficiency of the private health sector and, in particular, the out-of-pocket expenses associated with private health care.</para></talk.start><para>Back in 1995 the Democrats moved amendments, jointly with the government of the day, to the Health Legislation (Private Health Insurance Reform) Amendment Bill 1994 ensuring that hospitals and doctors were required to inform contributors of out-of-pocket expenses. For many years, the Democrats have recognised that out-of-pocket expenses create a major barrier to people taking out private health insurance and cause significant uncertainty and stress to consumers. On that occasion, the Democrats stated their concern that this amendment did not go far enough in removing out-of-pocket expenses altogether. However, it is gratifying to see that finally the government is today moving down that track.</para><para>I should make the point that the government's first responsibility is to manage the public health system. This government has proved inadequate to this task. The public health system is clearly in crisis. Hospital waiting lists are out of control. We are hearing new reports every day of the increasing numbers of unnecessary deaths caused through the underfunding and mismanagement of the public hospital system. The Democrats believe the government would be better 
 served by dealing with the public health crisis rather than by putting more time, energy and money into propping up the ailing private sector.</para><para>On behalf of the Democrats, I would also like to take the opportunity while we are speaking on legislation in this area to call for a health audit to sort out the crisis that this government has caused in public health and to have an informed public debate about what Australians want from their public health services. This bill makes amendments in a number of areas, most of which the Democrats support.</para><para>Our main concerns are with schedule 2 of the bill. The Democrats are very concerned that schedule 2 could lead to an inequitable financial burden being placed on older people who require nursing home care. Whilst the Democrats support the principle that care not received should not be paid for, we also recognise that the overhead and infrastructure costs in many hospitals are such that it is impossible to provide even basic care for the same cost as a nursing home. The Democrats believe that hospitals should be compensated adequately for the care they provide, but it is even more important to ensure that in the tussles between health funds and private hospitals about who pays for what that consumers are not the ones who lose out.</para><para>The Democrats are not confident that schedule 2 will address the costing issue, and we have significant concerns about its impact on consumers. There are a number of issues to be worked out in relation to this schedule, and to date the government has not convinced the Democrats that it has the solution. I also believe that the government has to bear a large amount of the responsibility here. Do not forget that this schedule deals with nursing home type patients, older people who, by definition, should be in a nursing home. A nursing home will provide the level of care that these people need in an appropriate environment. They do not need to be in hospital, and they should not be kept in hospital except as a short-term measure while a suitable nursing home bed is found.</para><para>However, as we all know, this government has a dismal record in the provision of nurs 
 ing home care and has failed older Australians in this regard. The government's first priority should be to fund suitable nursing home beds for older people who need them, not to relegate these people to hospitals and then worry about who is paying for this care.</para><para>Whilst schedule 2 will be dealt with further in the committee stage of the debate, I am happy to outline in my second reading contribution the Democrats' specific concerns with it. They include: the amount of benefit paid by a health fund once a person has been classified as a nursing home type patient, what protocols will be put in place to ensure that these older people and/or their carers are informed of the assessment and of any financial impact it may have on them, the specific ramifications for people in rural areas and others where there is a severe shortage of nursing home beds available and what provisions there are to ensure that the maximum level of copayment that will be required by an older person once they have been classified as a nursing home type patient is the same regardless of whether they are in a nursing home or a hospital. Older people should not be penalised because the government has failed to provide sufficient nursing home type accommodation.</para><para>We are also concerned that there needs to be a clear provision that an assessment will not result in a retrospective imposition of costs and a guarantee that the application of this schedule will not result in older people being forced to leave hospitals once they have been classified as nursing home type patients because the hospital can no longer afford to keep them. That is a reasonably long list of concerns and, I believe, fairly significant issues that need to be addressed. As these issues have not been resolved by the government, the Democrats will be voting to remove schedule 2 from this bill. But, as I said earlier in my contribution, we are happy to support all the other aspects of this particular piece of legislation.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>1966</page.no><name role="metadata">Crowley, Sen Rosemary</name><name role="display">Senator CROWLEY</name><name.id>ZF4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on the <inline ref="r395">Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997</inline> . My colleague Senator Forshaw has taken us through the principal intentions of the bill—to 
 amend the National Health Act and the Health Insurance Act and to change the Social Security Act and the Veterans' Entitlements Act. The bill will do a number of things. I would certainly like to talk about the proposal to remove the requirement that the payment of benefits to private hospitals be at an acute care rate for the first 35 days of the patient's stay, regardless of whether acute care is provided. That is a very disappointing proposed change. On the one hand you can see an argument for it being reasonable and all of those sorts of things, but at the moment we have an arrangement in place that has worked pretty well for many people. It was put in place after considerable discussion and deliberation.</para></talk.start><para>We all know that many people who find themselves in hospital have a need to move on to a nursing home bed and they are not going to find that bed easily. There is always a wait of a couple of weeks to try to match the patient to the bed, particularly in terms of locality. There may be a bed in a rural area, but that is of no use to a person in an urban area. In particular, there may be a shortage of beds in a rural area to which people living in and around that area would want to have access. Over times past, the arrangement of the 35 days has meant that there has been some flexibility in trying to deal with people with that need in a fairly humane and caring way.</para><para>It is a bit hard to know why there is this proposed change. It says to me two things—it is some kind of money saver and it is part of a mean-spirited approach to optimal health care. Minister, could you tell us the reason for intending to put this in place, particularly what savings are expected, who will benefit from those savings and what kind of counter argument you have for the many people who have written to me complaining about this proposed change? I would like you in your response to make clear the arguments for why there is any need to change.</para><para>The other point that caught my eye when looking through the proposals for this bill is the extension of the waiting period for benefits for obstetrics from nine months to 12 months. There are some very interesting 
 expressions for people who anticipate that they will need obstetric care—cream skimmers; duck in, get your private health insurance for when you need it and duck out. They are one group of people who want private health insurance when for the large part of their lives they do not need it. Many expectant mothers anticipating the need for assistance at the birth of their baby have made the choice that they would like the support and backup of private health insurance. They do not want it for anything else in their lives, but they do want it for obstetric care.</para><para>Extending the waiting period illustrates exactly the challenge we have in private health insurance. Private health insurance has become an absolute dead package. It has long since passed its use-by date. People are leaving it in droves. The cost is going through the roof, and people are saying, `How can we make private health insurance more attractive?' Here is a small group of people who are indicating that they do find private health insurance attractive; that is to say, they like the comfort or the assurance of private health insurance for the period of pregnancy, childbirth and shortly thereafter.</para><para>I find it interesting that nobody in the private health insurance industry has approached the minister with an alternative proposal on how to market private health insurance to this specific group of people. Over the years, there has always been an indication of a large sympathy for parents having private cover for childbirth. There are, of course, an increasing number of people who find our major women's and children's public hospitals more than sufficient to the task—particularly, too, as most of the private specialists would be the people they would meet in the public hospital sector. It would be interesting if, for once, somebody in this area proposed a change in the way private health insurance is packaged, proposed or marketed, instead of the old, `Let us just extend the waiting time.' It is really in the nature of punitive—that is, `If you are going to take our benefits, then you're going to have to pay to get in and you're going to have to stay a long enough time.'</para><para>I do believe it is important to start challenging private health insurance to be much more aware of what the community needs and not necessarily proceed the way it is proposed in some parts of this bill. I certainly think it is clear evidence that private health insurance is past its use-by date. It is a very bad package indeed. I made some comments about this in previous speeches and I am very prepared to make them again.</para><para>The central objective of this bill is to make private health insurance more attractive to consumers to make it  better value for money. Try telling that to the families of Australia who have been leaving private health insurance in droves. Senator Herron is in the chamber and I note that, by way of passing comment the other day, he did correct his outrageous claim that it was under the Labor government that private health insurance premiums rose 100 per cent.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>VW4</name.id><name role="metadata">HERRON</name><name role="display">Senator Herron</name></talker><para>—One hundred and forty-four per cent.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Crowley, Sen Rosemary</name><name role="display">Senator CROWLEY</name></talker><para>—That is very interesting because you came in and said it was not that and you were quite wrong. Senator Herron, I do urge you to be accurate because, if you have to come in here and correct it a number of times, it is not helpful to the debate. What you and I should be able to agree about is that the cost of private health insurance now means that it is well beyond the affordability for most families. It is not at all assisted by your government's decision to offer $600 million a year by way of rebate. That has done nothing to stem the flow from private health insurance. One of the things that it has been associated with—and one might even be inclined to argue causal of—has been the dramatic increase in the price of private health insurance. It is just not possible for families who are doing it tough to find up to $40 a week for family cover for private health insurance. They are not going to do it, and they certainly will not do it when, down the road, there is a public hospital that covers all their needs at no further cost to them.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The way people are dealing with this is that they have realised that under Medicare they are protected from health bills. Under private health insurance, it is the only way you will 
 get a health bill. The community are not nongs. They know that. As I explained here the other day, I had the pleasure of listening to Access Economics take us through some of the economics of health insurance and health policy at an AMA dinner in Parliament House a couple of weeks ago. The little scale was very nice. If you are an average citizen in this country, you pay your tax, you pay your Medicare levy and, if you choose nothing further, that is it—you can go to the public hospital system, you can see your doctor and so on. If you actually buy private insurance, you pay your taxes, you pay your Medicare levy, you pay your private health insurance premium and then, after you return from hospital, you pay your bills on top of that. It is just madness. Nobody—but nobody—would persist with that kind of scheme. What are people offered by way of encouragement to stay with private health insurance? You will get the doctor of your choice and you may have to spend less time on a waiting list to get access for elective surgery in hospital.</para><para>Most people recognise that, in all of our public hospitals, the standard of medical care is very high. They do not have to worry that they will be getting second-rate treatment. Indeed, our public hospitals are standard centres of good health care and most people are beginning to recognise—as I have just said, too, about obstetrics—that, very often, exactly the same specialist would provide the care for them in the public area as they would be able to choose under private health insurance. Nobody is going to suggest that public hospital care is a second-class rating. Indeed, if you are needing emergency care, intensive care or resuscitation after a heart attack, if you break a bone or a leg or if you have an accident of that sort, you invariably go to our large public hospitals and that is where the care is provided. So people know that they are covered.</para><para>People have not forgotten that, after seven years of Mr Fraser's Liberal government and five different health plans, two million Australians had no protection against health costs at all. Two million Australians had no insurance. Under Medicare, everyone does. Senator Herron, you know that, before the last elec 
 tion, you promised everybody that you would protect Medicare because, I would have to say, even you finally got the message that the community likes Medicare.</para><para>Medicare gives the community exactly what they want—that is, protection from big bills. The real problem in the health area is that, when you are sick, you have got enough to worry about. If it is a child, parents fret, and they will continue to fret until that little one has recovered or at least a program for management of the illness is under way. If you have got elderly relatives who are sick or if you yourself are sick, you know that your main focus of worry is on their health or your own health. Will I get better? Will the pain go away? When can I walk again? The last thing you want loaded on top of that worry about your own health or the health of your relatives is the worry about whether you can afford to pay for care. Medicare took that worry away. Private health insurance has been trying to keep a piece of the action and it has been losing badly. The premiums have been going through the roof, and the government's $600 million per year to provide rebate and assistance has been completely lost in the first round of increases in the cost of those premiums.</para><para>The main argument that people use to maintain private health insurance is waiting lists. I think it is very important to place on the record, once again, the facts about waiting lists. You know, Senator Herron, in other areas you have been challenging me to look up answers to questions. I have, indeed. What is more, I have looked at your questions and some of the things you have said. If push comes to shove, I will bring them all here, but I do not want to waste people's time on that.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>VW4</name.id><name role="metadata">HERRON</name><name role="display">Senator Herron</name></talker><para>—You are now, Rosemary.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Crowley, Sen Rosemary</name><name role="display">Senator CROWLEY</name></talker><para>—Excuse me, Senator Herron. What we have said all along is that the most important thing is not the numbers on waiting lists, which are very doubtful figures anyhow, but the time that people have to wait. You know—and I can get you the quotes—when you have actually said that, Senator Herron. It is very important. If we had one million people on a waiting list and each one had to wait for only a week, there 
 would be no problem. Our concern is that 10 people might have to wait two years. That is the important thing; not the number on the waiting list but the time people on the waiting list have to wait.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I have sought an answer from the federal health department. I have asked them, for example, how many persons are waiting for surgery in South Australian public hospitals on 1 November 1997, 1996, 1995 and 1994. The answer from the department reads:</para><para>The Commonwealth does not hold this data. However, it should be noted that waiting lists are a poor indicator of hospital and health system performance which do not necessarily provide an accurate indication of the problems relating to access to elective surgery. Many hospital admissions, including elective admissions, occur without the patient ever being on a waiting list.</para><para>It goes on to say:</para><para>It is more appropriate to focus on admitting people to hospital within clinically appropriate times than on the number of people waiting at any point in time.</para><para>It cannot be said enough: the data about waiting lists is very rubbery indeed. I have heard your side of parliament in the last couple of weeks tell me that there are 50,000 on waiting lists, 100,000 on waiting lists and a good middle of the road figure of about 70,000 on waiting lists. We do not know. The Commonwealth can ring the states and ask: what are your latest figures on the number of people waiting? But they should give that away. As I remember, Senator Herron, the number of times you accused us of scaremongering about waiting lists can be exactly matched—indeed I would say exceeded—by the scare campaign run by you when you had the better reason for running a scare campaign about waiting lists.</para><para>I think it is long since past the time when we should have some reasonable discussion about health in this country. We should reasonably talk about points that you have raised on occasions and of course pick up on points that others of us have raised for years before. You know, Senator Herron, that on the whole I agree that you are pretty reasonable about this, except when you forget to answer questions. The point is that there are many people who are living longer in this 
 country and are more likely to need surgical procedures.</para><para>There are many more procedures available to people. New technology means that we can now do many more procedures. Many more people are having day surgery, so the number of operations in hospital is dramatically increasing. Nobody in this country wants either the Labor Party or the Liberal Party, whichever is in government, to stand up and say, `We can't afford to help you.' What we might have to say is: it is going to take time to help you. But the costs of these new procedures are significantly increasing and they are very important.</para><para>One area that I think highlights this is the management of eyes. People who have corneal blindness or who have other needs for eye surgery, instead of having a one hour or three hour eye operation, can now have a procedure that will take less than half an hour sometimes but certainly less than an hour. Many more people are appearing for assistance with their eye operations. It certainly means a dramatic difference in the quality of life for people who can have their sight restored.</para><para>It also means increased costs to the taxpayers. It is about time we ask the taxpayers: are you prepared to support the costs? At the moment people are saying to us that they are not prepared to pay the horrifically expensive private health insurance, particularly when so many of them expect that they will never use it. It has passed its use-by date, Senator Herron. It is no help.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Calvert)</name></talker><para>—We do know that Senator Herron is here but there is also a chair here and I ask you to address your remarks through the chair.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Crowley, Sen Rosemary</name><name role="display">Senator CROWLEY</name></talker><para>—Mr Acting Deputy President, I hate to think you were overlooked. I beg your pardon and thank you for that assistance. I was making the point that I think it is important that we have some facts about this matter. One of the areas that has offended me is listening to some of the monumental misrepresentations, which is a euphemism for the word `lie', coming from some people on the other side. For example, 
 they have said that nothing under the Labor government was done to address the waiting list difficulties. The waiting list difficulties were addressed by the Labor government on a number of occasions.</para></talk.start></continue><para>One particular occasion was when former Minister Blewett provided $40 million to be matched by the states and dramatically reduced the waiting lists. Waiting lists were reduced for eye patients, particularly pensioner patients, in the Illawarra region in New South Wales. The private doctors and specialists agreed with the government that they would operate on all the pensioners and run down the numbers on that waiting list; not so much to reduce the numbers on the waiting list but to reduce the number of people who were waiting to be able to see properly and therefore get on with their lives in a much better way.</para><para>I have to say to my eternal shame that the doctors in South Australia refused to cooperate with the state and Commonwealth government and the private hospitals. They flatly refused to operate on Medicare patients in private hospitals. That, I think, is one of the real sticking points. We really have to address the main issue here. If there are empty or unused beds in private hospitals, why is it that Medicare patients are not able to access those beds? Why is it that privately insured patients have full access to our public hospitals, no questions asked. We want no hierarchy of patients according to how much they can pay. And, as I think everybody on this side would agree, that is absolutely right.</para><para>It is time the Liberal government set out to achieve justice in health care so that everybody has access, not just those who can afford it. It is also time you took a look at assisting patients instead of worrying them into further illness with the increased costs. For elderly patients in particular, the decision about section 2, the 35-day acute bed changes, is just a prime example of the mean spiritedness of this government.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>1970</page.no><name role="metadata">Herron, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HERRON</name><name.id>VW4</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—That was all very interesting, but it had nothing to do with the <inline ref="r457">Health Legislation Amendment (Health Care 
 Agreements) Bill 1998</inline>  before the chamber. But I can understand Senator Crowley. It was the first time I had heard her speak in two years. She has had a blow of the pipes this morning and feels good about it. I welcome that, because it demonstrates yet again that she is locked in the past. As a matter of fact, my spirit soared when I heard Senator Forshaw because I thought at last, as the current phrase goes, that the tectonic plates might have shifted in the Labor Party in relation to health care. Then I heard Senator Crowley, and I regret to say that we are back where we were before.</para></talk.start><para>I would suggest that Senator Crowley contact Mr Mark Latham and Mr Lindsay Tanner, who at least have some idea of shifting from the past. We have heard that terrible diatribe which I heard from Senator Crowley for the last eight years. She is locked in the past. It is time she started reading and, more importantly, started going out into the industry to see what is going on in the hospital system of this country, because it has changed. Senator Forshaw is aware of that. I am aware of that because of what he had to say. At least he stuck to the bill.</para><para>I hope Graham Richardson, the former Minister for Health in the Labor government, hears this debate. I well recall him when he was health minister trying to persuade then Prime Minister Keating of the essence of what Senator Forshaw was saying that there is a place for private health insurance. It is well on the record that Prime Minister Keating did not have private health insurance because he said that he had paid his Medicate levy and that he was entitled to go into the public hospitals. Of course he never did that. He went to private hospitals.</para><para>He did what is occurring out there in the real market, and that is that about 14 per cent of people in the leading private hospital in Brisbane pay for their own care. They are self-insured. They actually go privately. So to equate the level of private health insurance to what is actually occurring out in the marketplace in private hospitals is irrelevant. It has been static for about 13 years in Queensland. Between 29 per cent and 30 per cent of people have retained private insurance, and 
 that includes a lot of pensioners because they want freedom of choice of doctor and freedom of choice of hospital.</para><para> Poor old Senator Crowley is locked in the past. Talk about being palely eolithic or concerned about the ideology of the last hundred years of the Labor Party. She has not shifted. She is still on about the necessity of maintaining the public hospital system. We agree with that in the sense that there is a desperate need to get it back to where it was when the Labor Party came into power and intentionally set out to destroy private health insurance, particularly by removing the bed day subsidy. It is on the record, no matter how much she talks about it, that when the Labor Party came to power 68 per cent of the population were insured. When they went out it was down to about 36 per cent because of their deliberate policy to try to destroy it.</para><para>Before getting off the subject of Senator Crowley, I should mention that she asked why these things were happening under this government. For heaven's sake, we have been in government for two years. The Labor government was there for 13 years. It is going to take us more than two years to fix things up, as we have had to do in so many areas.</para><para>Senator Crowley talked about private cover for childbirth. This bill does cover that aspect. What we are trying to do is stop the hit-and-run people. One of the problems with rising health insurance is that a lot of people, which is reasonable under their circumstances, come in for a short time and then get out. They are taking more money out of the system than they are putting into it. One of the other problems is that the majority of people who are insured are in the older age group and they are taking more out of the system than they are putting into it.</para><para>Young people are leaving it in droves because, as they can see, it is probably better not to privately insure. In fact, for childbirth, if you are fit and well and want to have your baby—and the number of babies being delivered has diminished—it is probably financially better to be privately insured, to go and have your baby, pay for it and then get out, because you are not likely to have to access the private hospital after that.</para><para> The problem, I explain to Senator Crowley, is community rating. Both parties and everybody agree that community rating should continue: that all the money goes into a bucket irrespective of age and then you take it out of the bucket. If money is not being put in the bucket by young people, of course the money in the bucket is going to run out. That is why private health insurance rates have increased: the rates had to go up because they are non-profit.</para><para> In relation to the bill, the 35-day rule—and that is the only bone of contention because I know the Labor Party supports this legislation—in practical terms just does not work. What happens in real life is that when a person is over 35 days the doctor has a form shoved under his nose which says, `Can you justify this patient staying in an acute hospital?' and the doctor says yes. So it is just removing an unnecessary bureaucratic requirement for the patient to continue. It does affect a handful of people who are in private hospitals when they are really nursing home patients.</para><para>We have recognised that Senator Lees—I yet again note this on the record; I have done so on previous occasions—does have a good knowledge of health care. All the time that I have been in the Senate she has taken a keen interest in it and is across the issues. I want to thank her for that. But, to answer the Australian Democrats' concerns, if people may be affected by this, and we believe only a handful would be, then we are happy to have that looked at as a disallowable instrument. The Democrats should note that the course of action the government is pursuing is supported by the Council of the Aged, the relevant consumer group, the Australian Health Insurance Association and the Australian Private Hospitals Association. We think that should satisfy the concern of the Democrats.</para><para>We are not supporting Senator Forshaw's amendment because of that. As I say, it is an unnecessary bureaucratic intrusion. It did not work anyway, because ultimately the people that are in health care—the nurses and the doctors—are more concerned about the 
 patients than they are about the bureaucrats. It was an ineffective mechanism in any case.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para><para>Bill read a second time.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>In Committee</title><page.no>1972</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The bill.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>—I understand schedule 2 is to be opposed and that it will be put separately.

It is a position that we still maintain. There are some pretty deep-seated problems in the validation process 
 proposed by the government. We recognise that there is an issue here that needs to be resolved.</para></talk.start><para>There is an issue relating to the intermediate period acts, acts which may be potentially invalid or are invalid for a number of reasons. The basic reason is irresponsibility by state governments who either acted in disregard of the law—particularly after the unsuccessful High Court challenge in the case of Western Australia v. The Commonwealth—and ignored the fact that there was a responsibility on them to pursue a section 29 process or believed that native title was extinguished by historic pastoral leases. But, even for those who did take that view, that could not have been a position maintained after the Wanyi case. Some took the risk and, as a consequence, they should not be protected for that. No other individual would be.</para><para>In all the circumstances, there are problems that have evolved not just for pastoralists but also for indigenous Australians. Labor took the view, which was different from that of the Greens and the Democrats on the one hand and the government on the other, that though there should be a validation regime it should be a regime that in no way goes as far as the government's. The government's regime, for us, was an excessive reaction to the Wik decision. It did not factor in in a balanced way the rights of indigenous Australians. The victims here are the native title holders. And there are also others who acted in good faith, reliant, for instance, on the state governments. They are two aspects of the problem.</para><para>The government's plan was to validate all intermediate period acts—those between 1 January 1994 and 23 December 1996—which had occurred over freehold or leasehold land or on land on which a public work was constructed. We have problems with that. The definition goes well beyond any intermediate period act on pastoral land and well beyond the issues in doubt—the issue that was ultimately resolved in Wik.</para><para>Secondly, the government's proposal goes to any lease other than a mining lease, not just pastoral leases. The definition of `public work', as we explained last time, is too broad and goes too far. Basically, we see the 
 government's proposal as validating the knowingly unlawful acts of state and territory governments. That, of course, is both excessive and reprehensible.</para><para>A pertinent question in this respect is: at the end of the day who pays for the government's excesses in this area? Aboriginals lose, the government goes too far, but it is the Australian taxpayer who will be paying the billions of dollars for gratuitous and excessive validation and extinguishment through that.</para><para>The opposition takes the view that there needs to be certainty, but in achieving that certainty there needs to be fairness, balance, compensation and a role for indigenous Australians. Basically, the regime that we proposed was that it be limited to pastoral leases; that it not be on public work land; that the act in the intermediate period could be validated but that proper procedures would be needed; that there must be notification; that notice must have been given to the relevant representative body within four months of the commencement of the process; that the notice has to be sufficiently detailed; and, not only that, that the non-extinguishment principle has to apply. Compensation is also quite critical.</para><para>One of the issues the government will have to contend with if this bill goes through unamended is the just terms provisions of the constitution. The procedural requirements thereto have not been met by the government and should stay alive as a legitimate legal issue to be pursued in the High Court by indigenous Australians. Not only was it important to have this process in the legislation but validation by agreement was also quite critical to the armoury that we put up at the time. One really only has to look at the process that has been engaged in in recent days by the Central Land Council and the Northern Land Council in respect of the Alice Springs to Darwin railway line in the Northern Territory to see that when people have to sit down and talk to other, when people do come to an issue with a bona fide objective, you can get a very successful outcome. That is what has happened in respect of that railway line through the mechanism of the agreement process.</para><para>As I say, we are committed to that course but, as I said in the second reading debate, we are not going to laboriously go through every amendment we moved last time. Our second reading amendment expressed our continuing commitment to an alternative course to validation to that of the government.</para><para>In respect to this re-run of the debate, we are concerned to move a number of amendments, and they go particularly to the entitlement for compensation. Our amendment to section 22D, amendment No. 13, was not accepted by the Senate in December 1997, but we raise it again today because we think, in the context of the government proposals, it is important to focus again on the necessity for the Senate to deliberate on a system of compensation, particularly a fast-track process for providing compensation for native title—a fast-track process which would work to the convenience of not just native title claimants but also other stakeholders in the process.</para><para>The compensation process that we put up requires native title holders to lodge a compensation application in the Federal Court and establish a prima facie case. We allow also for the Commonwealth to be able to apply to and satisfy the court that native title did not exist at the time that the intermediate period act occurred. Essentially, it is the same amendment we put up last time, but it is one that we think is important for a number of reasons, including fairness and constitutionality.</para><para>Our amendment to section 22F, the validation of state and territory acts provision by the government, in essence is a consequential amendment to our amendment 13 and requires state and territory validation regimes to incorporate similar fast-track compensation.	At this stage, in respect to the government's amendments to section 232B and 232C, our advice is that they are in any event beneficial and we will be supporting those.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>1974</page.no><name role="metadata">Woodley, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WOODLEY</name><name.id>HX5</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I need some direction and I may need, by leave, to move something different from that which we are debating at the moment.

Let us say that the committee agrees that where we arrived at last time is a starting point for the further deliberations this time.

Senator Woodley, you can get up and formally move all the amendments moved by the opposition parties that you say were carried last time. You have not yet explained them. I could very easily say to you, `Can you explain amendment after amendment?' It may be necessary to do that, because the record that I have from last time 
 in respect to the validation regime is that the only successful amendment was one Democrat-Green amendment which expressed the view that the non-extinguishment principle applied to the acts referred to in subsection (9). That is a commitment which we still have. And it was an amendment which was also moved by Senator Harradine at the time.</para></talk.start><para>Apart from government amendments that got up last time, the other successful amendments that I have a record of in respect to the validation regime were Harradine amendments (2), (3) and (4), which go to confirmation of suspension of native title, as opposed to partial or extinguishment.</para><para>I think it needs to be clarified whether we are to pursue all the amendments that were moved last time as opposed to those that were carried last time. We were told that was not going to happen. We were told you were to move the amendments that were successful last time. I might have it wrong, but I think it important at this particular stage to identify, because we have not had an explanation of the amendments, that there is a bit of confusion. As I said, the record shows something different to what you are proposing to move now. The record shows that, despite all the argument and debate and powers of persuasion we had last time, we were not successful in all that many areas in respect of validation.</para><para>Senator Margetts and Senator Brown, if you want to sit there and sledge the opposition for the next three or four days, it will make you feel good, but the record will show that your attacks will only have sustenance if you actually get up and tell us what you are concerned about in respect, for instance, to these amendments. Senator Brown, it is very easy to get up here, as you have done for the last few minutes, and attack the Labor Party for doing this, that and the other, knowing full well that we have been in an intensive consultation process with stakeholders, especially those who missed out on meaningful consultation with the government. We have laboriously gone through word after word after word, which is something I must say to you, Senator Brown, that you have not done.</para><para>We are in the business of protecting the rights that were obtained in the last debate; 
 we are also in the business of trying to build on those rights. The amount of work that people have put into finding ways through, into finding ways of tightening up, into finding ways of improvement and into persuading the government that there are measures that they could pick up has just been enormous. People have been working until two, three and four o'clock this morning trying to get the words right. I think your dismissal of that sort of effort as a sell-out is something which really does you no benefit at all.</para><para>Let us get to the debate. If you are going to move amendments, explain them properly. I think Senator Woodley has kicked off with one area where there are a few problems in terms of revisiting all the amendments but, if we are going to revisit amendments—as you say you are doing—that got up last time, let us do that so we can get through it. I am still keen to ensure that the amendment that provided for the non-extinguishment principle to apply will again get up. I am still committed to ensuring that the other amendments in respect of validation which were moved by Senator Harradine that got up will again get up. I am also committed to ensuring that a fast-track compensation regime gets up as well.

 that.' It seems that the Labor Party does not like the idea.</para></talk.start><para>There is a pretty simple mechanism here, and it is very clear to all what we are doing. We are saying, `Let's bring us up to 4 December and work from there.' By the way, Madam Chair, the government has already included 110 of the 237 successful amendments from last time, so all Senator Woodley is doing is saying, `Let's have the other 127, not just allow the government to pick some, which it does not find too difficult to do because they are not going to help indigenous people too much. Let us move all 237 and start from there.' 	The government can go halfway; let the committee go the full way and, from that point, we will be able to make further amendments, which Senator Harradine and the opposition assure us are going to improve the legislation—I expect that that is meant to mean improve it for indigenous people. This is a wise mechanism. It gives us a clear starting point for the beginning of what is going to be a long committee stage. I thank Senator Woodley for bringing it forward. It is a good one. I would expect that leave will at least be granted for the motion to be put to the committee.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>1978</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I think it is necessary for me to make a comment on the questions that were asked of me as to why the Greens did not support the opposition's second reading amendment.

 is why I was not prepared to put the Greens' name to that second reading amendment.</para><para>I am not here to make the Labor Party feel comfortable with the decision it took last year not to support the bill.

These are not nearly good enough as far as I am concerned. The amendments that we are putting are not even close; however, if anybody suggests that people are holding the line, these amendments are the starting point from which we should be attempting to improve the basic human rights that we are dealing with here. The further diminishment, the reduction, of the loss is necessary. We are not talking about gains; we are talking about desperately trying to reduce the loss that exists and is exemplified by even that series of amendments, because we know that most of the reasonable amendments that the Senate put to the government at the end of last year were rejected.

I expect that they believe the whole thing is unworkable even though there is clear evidence in states like Western Australia that the state government and friends and family of the state government are assisting to try to make native title as unworkable as possible.

All I am saying to you is that we have gone through thoroughly those matters against the principles on which—</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>DX5</name.id><name role="metadata">MARGETTS</name><name role="display">Senator Margetts</name></talker><para>—Who is `we', Brian?

The government has seen fit to put 110 of last year's amendments into the legislation. Sena 
 tor Harradine and the opposition say that that is okay. The Democrats and Greens want the 127 amendments put in as a starting point too, and Senator Harradine, the opposition and the government apparently do not want that. I will tell you why they do not want that. They do not want that because those 127 other amendments are the ones which have some advantage to the indigenous people and which make the majority of senators participating in the committee stage feel a darned sight more uncomfortable.</para></talk.start><para>The procedure is a good one. It says, let us start from 4 December last year with, not the half the government wants, but the whole lot as voted for by the majority of the Senate. What could be simpler than that? This is not a pig in a poke as Senator Harradine said; it is a poke at the pig. It is a poke at the swine that this legislation is, not only as far as the indigenous people of this country are concerned, but also as far as the future of this country is concerned if it wants to be one country and not a divided country because its indigenous people have been sold out.</para><para>I hope leave will be given. I hope there will be support to be even-handed, at the outset, so that not just the government gets its way, but the committee stands behind the votes it took in December last year and makes amendments from there on. Senator Harradine has the wit and wisdom to be able to do that with great ease, as have the rest of us. It is not beyond the committee to do that. It will not be difficult. It will expedite, it will shorten, the deliberations of this committee if we do not have to go through all those amendments seriatim again.</para><para>Senator Bolkus said that Senator Harradine has three amendments coming up which cover part of this. We will not have to deal with them. They will have been dealt with. It is only where the committee wants to depart from 4 December last year that we will have to debate the matter in committee. It is a good move, Senator Woodley.

Senator Harradine, as I mentioned earlier in the debate, has a number of amendments which go to the question of extinguishment. He supports, as 
 we do, the concept of suspension as opposed to extinguishment, and we will be supporting the Harradine amendments.

Some of what I say is in support of the Democrats-Greens amendments. I will also be speaking to the government amendments and, as Senator Bolkus pointed out, the other amendments which we will deal with. Senator Bolkus may be able to explain to us—it would be useful to know—whether or not Labor has actually narrowed the gap between the indigenous working group's position, what I believe to be the Democrats-Green position and the position of the government.</para></talk.start><para>I made a long speech last time about validation and the problem we have with it. We believe there is no way that you can have a principle in law which says that, having made a bad law or having done things which are illegal, somehow or other you can go back and make those illegal acts legal again. It just seems to us to be a proposition that cannot be countenanced.</para><para>I accused the Labor Party last time of having an eye to the Queensland election. I am not convinced that that is not still the motivation for the position that has been taken. That worries me significantly. I ask: what is the justification for doing this in defiance of the High Court Wik decision? The excuse which is used by the government, which I have to say I have heard from some in the Labor Party, is that in 1993 there was legal advice floating around that native title would be extinguished on those leases as if, in any other legal case—sex discrimination, industrial relations; take your pick—it would be okay to say, `We're going to legislate in direct contradiction of the High Court because the High Court's decision is not the same as some earlier legal advice.'</para><para>When you look at it that way, you can see that it is wrong, unfair and, worst of all, racially discriminatory because it would not happen with any other High Court decision. The government's proposed validation of 
 these intermediate leases has, in part, the support of the Labor Party. I hear what is being said, that there are different positions on this, but I need some more explanation, particularly from the Labor Party, about the effect of their position. I cannot see that it is very different from the government position. I am sure Senator Harradine will give us the benefit of an explanation of his amendments, because he always explains fully what he is doing. Even when I disagree with him, at least I understand what he is about.</para><para>I point out again that those unlawful leases that we are now seeking to validate were issued mostly by the Labor Party in Queensland—about 1,500 out of the 2,000 were issued in the intermediate period between 1994 and 1996. These titles were issued by the Goss government without going through the process of the Native Title Act. It really gets to me that there was a process given to them by the federal Labor government that they could have used, but they said, `We know better.' If you remember, when the 1993 legislation was passed, Mr Goss did not exactly rush down to Canberra, hug the federal Labor Party and say, `Thank you for doing it.' In fact, he said some things that were quite the opposite. I really am still left with the feeling that this is to do with an election in Queensland. I will not predict the outcome of the election. That might not be a good thing to do.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>EU4</name.id><name role="metadata">O'CHEE</name><name role="display">Senator O'Chee</name></talker><para>—You won't win.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>HX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Woodley, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WOODLEY</name></talker><para>—I am not saying who might win, Senator O'Chee. I presume that the federal Labor Party does not want to upset the applecart by going against something that the Queensland Labor Party did in government. We do not know where Mr Beattie stands on the discriminatory validation of pastoral leases where native title may exist because he has not told us. It is important that we put these facts on the record. If Senator Bolkus has a reply, I will listen carefully. Again, as with Senator Harradine, Senator Bolkus usually explains his position very well.</para></talk.start></continue><para>These are the problems, and this is the sad history that we are dealing with in Queensland. The history of Queensland is not a 
 happy one when it comes to protection of native title rights or protection of Aboriginal people. I read some of the history into the record. It does not matter how far back you go or how recent is the history you examine. The record of both Labor and coalition governments in Queensland is really quite appalling in this respect. That is very sad.</para><para>My friend Senator Boswell interjected the other day, `We shouldn't go back in history.' I say to Senator Boswell in case he is listening—and I will repeat it when he comes in—history is very important. Are we going to say that the history of the abuse of Aboriginal people in Queensland is not important, but the history, for instance, of the Anzacs—going back to 1915—is, or that the history of the Vietnam veterans is not important; that we should discount that because it is something that happened 30 years ago? History is very important. I am afraid that history reflects a very sad story.</para><para>Former Queensland Premier Wayne Goss has come a long way in recent days in embracing native title. I am very pleased about that. But, when the Mabo legislation was introduced in 1993, he was less than complimentary about that legislation. I can give you some examples. Mr Goss said on ABC radio on 23 July 1993 that uncertainty over an earlier native title claim by the Wik people over the land near Weipa in Far North Queensland had to be removed to secure Comalco's mining project. Mr Goss said:</para><para>That uncertainty is of concern, and we believe that the company, the State Government and the Federal Government are going to have to co-operate to remove it.</para><para>There is not a lot of support for co-existence or recognition of Aboriginal rights there. It is really saying, `Get out of the way, native title holders. Comalco's coming through.' I could provide a lot of quotes about this whole issue. The problem has been that even Labor governments, particularly in Queensland, have not used the Native Title Act 1993. They have ignored the processes. They have got themselves and this parliament into the situation of now having to decide whether it will make legal acts which were quite illegal at the time. I will leave it there and, if there is another 
 contribution I can make a little further in the debate, I will do so.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>1994</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—A question was directed to me by Senator Woodley. The question was whether the opposition felt that the government amendments were more beneficial than the position that left the Senate last year. As I explained earlier on, and probably I need to explain it a little more elaborately, we have a definition of the category of intermediate period acts—category A ones and category B ones. Category A ones are handled by section 232B and category B ones are handled by section 232C.</para></talk.start><para>The amendment that the government has moved relates to the definitions of category A and category B. With respect to both, the amendment replaces subsection (8)(b) which went through the Senate last year, which we were not able to amend. It does so by excluding a wider range of land held for the benefit of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people from category A intermediate period acts and it excludes a broader range of grants to ATSI people from the extinguishing effects of category B intermediate period acts.</para><para>So basically what we have here is a wider range of land being excluded from the extinguishment regime. As a consequence, it is more beneficial than the provision that got through last year. I also place on record that it is not the desired outcome that we fought for last year and that we would still want and that we would look at in government. It is much too broad, but it goes some way towards the national indigenous working group position, it goes some way towards the position we moved last year and it moves from the position that passed through the Senate last year. We do see it as beneficial and for that reason we are supporting the amendments.</para><para>Amendments agreed to.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN (Senator Chapman)</name></talker><para>—The question is that schedule 1, item 39, stand as printed.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>1994</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We have dealt with some of the issues, and validation has been mentioned 
 already. It is a particularly onerous thing for people from states like Western Australia and, as Senator Woodley has suggested, from Queensland, where you clearly see that the governments involved have been involved with taking part in acts that can only be described as being designed to remove the rights of indigenous Australians.</para></talk.start><para>We have situations in Western Australia where land sales took place in areas which were clearly subject to native title claims. Information was sent to prospective buyers saying, `Don't worry, the Western Australian government will guarantee you against native title claim.' How could they have done that legally? Perhaps they knew that if push came to shove, someone would validate those acts.</para><para>How can we sit down and watch whilst very large parcels of land—during the course of this debate I am hoping to present the actual amounts in states like Western Australia—actually being transferred between states in an ongoing process of removing rights for indigenous Australians? We would prefer to see this entire section removed from the bill, and that is certainly what I will be seeking to move. They give indigenous people the right to choose whether they wish to enjoy their rights to negotiate with regard to these illegal, often mining, projects.</para><para>There are very large issues of basic justice. There are very important issues as to what happens at the end of this legislation if there are still teeny-weeny elements of rights left in this bill that the government has not seen and stomped on in the process. What signal does that send to governments at the end of this legislation? I would argue that the signal it sends is, `If you find any piece of land that somebody else wants and does not want to participate in any reasonable process of native title, go ahead and do what you want. Transfer the land in an illegal way and the federal government, with the assistance of the opposition perhaps, may assist you in validating whatever it is you have done which you should not have done.' None of the assurances that this government gives are worth anything whilst we clearly have rewarded those people who have flouted the law.</para><para>If this was a social security applicant who had filled out a form wrongly, we would be down on them like a ton of bricks. We are not talking about $10 or a week's social security benefit; we are talking about people's lives and the meaning of many people's culture. We have said to state governments, `This is all right, you can do it in the past. We will give a tick for doing what you have done in the past. What's more, you will be able to do it in the future. We will come back in the parliament at a later date and we will validate that too.' I do not think it is good enough. I think it is necessary for people to take responsibility for what they have done. Therefore, we oppose the schedule.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>1995</page.no><name role="metadata">Woodley, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WOODLEY</name><name.id>HX5</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to support Margetts in what she said and try to make an appeal to everybody to understand the importance of opposing this particular piece of legislation. I want to turn to legal advice because a lot of legal advice has apparently been flying around, but we have not seen much of it, except for Senator Harradine. He made his legal advisers available to us. We were very grateful for that. We were able to get from his legal advisers a very clear indication of the reasons and the legal basis for the amendments that he is moving.</para></talk.start><para> But in terms of the government and the opposition, that has certainly been a problem for us. The Senate would know that we quite vigorously pursued the government to try to get some key pieces of legal advice on the constitutionality of their bill. I grant that the minister and the government gave me an explanation in a letter, but they did ignore a resolution of this Senate and did not fulfil that direction from the Senate. That is a black mark against them.</para><para>I must say that we are also not sure about some of the legal advice that the Labor Party has received, except what we can read in newspapers. I noticed in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> last Tuesday week that Mr Alec Shand QC said that the bill was racially discriminatory in many areas, including validating past unlawful acts of the Queensland and West Australian governments which deemed the extinguishment of native title on thousands of leases. We know that the ALP has had legal 
 advice from a top QC saying that the validation of intermediate period acts is racially discriminatory. We really need to know how it is they can therefore support racially discriminatory legislation. The amendment we have moved on behalf of the Greens and the Democrats is an amendment that is supported by the National Indigenous Working Group. You can understand the fog we are in, at least in terms of the legal advice to the government and to the Labor Party.</para><para>It seems that Mr Shand's advice went to the matter of the government bill, yet on Wednesday of last week Mr Beazley was quoted as saying on ABC radio:</para><para>We have advice that what we are putting forward is 100 per cent kosher as far as the constitution is concerned, which differentiates our amendments dramatically from the government bill as</para><para>it now stands.</para><para>Mr Shand's advice contradicts that. We do not know what the advice is that the opposition is depending on. If we did know, then perhaps we would be a lot more confident in voting one way or the other. The ALP says that the legislation is 100 per cent kosher. However, Mr Beazley's words create a false impression for me. That is why I am still asking whether or not we could have some indication of what that legal advice was.</para><para>I want to make a final point. The Howard government and the National Farmers Federation have been travelling all over the country claiming that they have to extinguish native title on pastoral leases to help farmers. The Democrats asked some questions about that claim. We asked the Queensland government how many pastoral had been issued in the state since the Native Title Act was passed in 1994. We wanted to know how many farmers' leases were potentially invalid. The answer was not one. That is what the Queensland government told us. Not one pastoral lease has been issued in Queensland in the intermediate period between the Native Title Act 1994 and the Wik decision in 1996, or at least that is the advice to us.</para><para> The validation issue is one area where I still believe that Labor and the government are almost as one. We have to ask: who is being protected here? The other part of our 
 question to the Queensland government was: how many mining titles have been issued in the intermediate period? The answer was 2,163 mining tenements were issued in that time. The figures give the lie to the government's claim that their validation plans are about helping pastoralists. It seems to me that they are perhaps about helping somebody else.</para><para> A speech the Prime Minister gave some time ago on a Sunday night conspicuously referred to farmers throughout. There was only one mention of the mining and resources industry, but the speech constantly referred to farmers, the concerns of farmers, the need for guarantees for farmers and how sad it would be if Australia did not have a rural sector. I have to wonder if the Prime Minister was playing down the fact that mining companies are the ones who stand to gain most from his extinguishment plans. That is the problem. If we are not helping miners, are we so concerned that it is struggling Aussie battlers like Rio Tinto, BHP and Western Mining we are helping? That is what the Howard government wants to do. I wish the Labor Party would not help them do it.</para><para>The Democrats have nothing against the mining sector per se, but I do get disturbed when people like Queensland Premier Rob Borbidge say that Aboriginal people are greedy because they are asking for some control over their land near the site of the Ernest Henry mine, for example, when these figures show that successive state and federal governments have bent over backwards to give the green light to mining, even if it means unnecessary extinguishment of native title. I support strongly the Greens-Democrat amendment moved by Senator Margetts. We oppose this item because we believe it is racially discriminatory. It certainly ought to be opposed.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>1996</page.no><name role="metadata">Minchin, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator MINCHIN</name><name.id>JX4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State;Minister Assisting the Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to respond quickly to a couple of points without debating all these sections. There are just a couple of things that should be said on the record. In terms of the constitutionality of the validation regime, the Native Title Act 
 itself contains a much wider and much broader validation regime than this one which effectively validated everything that occurred before 1 January 1994. That, of course, has been upheld by the High Court as a valid constitutional instrument. Ours is a more limited validation regime and, consistent with the High Court's decision in the native title case in 1995, would be constitutional.</para></talk.start><para>In terms of the assertion of illegality, it was presumed by the previous government—and by all state governments therefore—that, according to the judgment of Chief Justice Brennan, the lead judge in Mabo, the grant of a leasehold estate had extinguished native title, and governments quite properly acted on that basis. That presumption was overturned 4-3 in Wik. As a result, we have had to deal with the consequences of what happened between 1 January 1994 and 23 December 1996, based on reasonable presumptions. In that time there were 22,830 titles issued around Australia—some 19,742 were mining and 3,088 were other land titles.</para><para>I just want to pick up quickly what Senator Woodley said. This overwhelmingly does quite openly deal with the validation of mining leases, quite properly and in good faith issued during that period, which do create jobs and wealth—and for Aboriginal people in many respects. The assertion was made that the mining industry gains from the federal government's extinguishment plans. Could I please urge you to deal with the facts of this bill, so that when you speak on it you speak with the knowledge of what we are dealing with.</para><para>Mining is a category C intermediate period act which does not extinguish. So, when the mining lease is validated, the bill provides that it is according to the non-extinguishment principle and it does not extinguish the native title. There is full compensation for any impairment of the native title, but the title is not extinguished. We are talking about the validation of a title issued which, as I say, relates to investments made, jobs created and wealth generated. But please remember that we are talking primarily in relation to validation of titles about mining leases, and they do not extinguish.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>1997</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I find Senator Minchin quite remarkable. He is able to stand up and say that there was a whole stack of illegal, as it turned out, appropriations of properties as far as indigenous people's rights are concerned but that it was good for them—it was good for the indigenous people because mines produce jobs—and, with a wave of the hand, he explains the inexcusable. Senator Margetts is absolutely correct: what this is saying, if the government gets away with it, is that you can validate illegal acts which were to the detriment of the indigenous people of this country and which foreclose on their ability to have valid claims made on their own land—those acts having been made between 1994 and 1996—and you can do it in the future. That is exactly what this says.</para></talk.start><para>If you are looking from the point of view of the indigenous community, it is retrospective legislation to validate wrongful actions. Of course, that is what rarely happens in this place. You look from the point of view of the miners and you look from the point of view of the people who have got tenements and so on—without any discussions with the indigenous people—and you say, `It was good for them; it must be good for the indigenous people.' That is patently illogical—it is not so. You have to leave that to the indigenous people to judge at least.</para><para>When it comes to Senator Woodley's assertion that this is racially discriminatory, it does point to the need for a very tough insertion of a caveat into this legislation to make sure that the Racial Discrimination Act is predominant over the legislation. In 1972, at the height of the furore over the flooding of Lake Pedder in Tasmania, conservationists approached the then Attorney-General, Merv Everett, for a fiat to take action against the government because it was illegally flooding the Lake Pedder national park. The Attorney-General sought advice and found that that was the case. The Premier, Eric Reece, would not have it and the Attorney-General resigned. The Premier then turned down the fiat that the conservationists should have had and restored the Attorney-General to his post. In the meantime, he brought in retrospective legisla 
 tion to validate the illegal act of the Reece government of Tasmania in flooding the Lake Pedder national park.</para><para>I understand at the moment that Marie Tehan, the minister for the environment—or, at least, that is one of her labels—in Victoria is considering bringing in retrospective legislation to validate the illegal logging of the Goolengook heritage river zone in East Gippsland, which took place after the RFA, the regional forest agreement, was signed between Prime Minister Howard, who is equally complicit in this matter, and Premier Kennett in February last year. So it is bringing in retrospective legislation to make the illegal legal.</para><para>In both those instances, heinous as they might be, the whole of the community lost. But in this instance it is the indigenous community who loses. They selectively lose out. That is racial discrimination, and that is where Senator Woodley and Senator Margetts are absolutely right. First of all, it points to the need for this committee not to allow the government to get away with this but to support this Democrat-Greens amendment. It underscores the need in the next section of the committee's deliberations to ensure that we do get a watertight caveat on this legislation that the indigenous people of this country cannot be discriminated against by this sort of provision in this legislation, which otherwise stands as racially discriminatory legislation—as Senator Bolkus described it last night. That is what it is. That is as plain as day.</para><para>I totally support this amendment. I, of course, hope that the opposition and Senator Harradine will do likewise, although I would hold out little hope for the government to come up with a change of heart which will ensure that such racial discrimination is not implanted in this legislation.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>1997</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to ask the minister a question because, during his response, he gleefully threw over to the Senate that states like Western Australia and Queensland could not have known, therefore setting them in the role of innocent parties.

That matter was not determined until the Wik case. The Western Australian case was about the proposed Western Australian legislation by which they were creating statutory native title. Once they lost that case, they decided, of their own volition, to be ultra cautious. But based on Chief Justice Brennan's lead judgment in Mabo, the position of the Keating Labor government, the clear statements in the Native Title Act, the accepted wisdom of the land as to where native title applied and, indeed, statements by people like Noel Pearson who made it clear that they would not be making any claims over pastoral leases, it was reasonable for state governments to act on the presumption that native title had been extinguished by pastoral leases.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>1998</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Perhaps the minister could remind the committee when the Wik case began.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>1998</page.no><name role="metadata">Minchin, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator MINCHIN</name><name.id>JX4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State;Minister Assisting the Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Wik case was determined on 23 December 1996.

Of course, the presumptions about Chief Justice Brennan, and therefore the majority in 
 Mabo, were found to be reasonable because of the position Chief Justice Brennan took in the Wik case where he and two other judges did find that a pastoral lease does completely extinguish native title, therefore upholding the reasonableness of those who took their lead from Chief Justice Brennan, including the whole of the Keating Labor government which clearly assumed that native title had been extinguished by the grant of a pastoral lease.</para></talk.start><para>We now know, by the 4-3 judgment, that that was not correct and we now have to correct the situation as to titles issued in good faith from the time of the Native Title Act coming into effect and the Wik decision.

In fact, he confirms the contention that the Democrats and I presume Senator Margetts were making. I do not know about the situation in Western Australia but I certainly know about the situation in Queensland, and the Wik people had already begun a very serious court case on this whole issue. It was quite clear to the Queensland government that that was a case which impinged directly on the whole question of whether or not native title could coexist on pastoral leases. In a very cavalier way, they decided that they would not take the precautionary principle into account which would have been, `Therefore, we will use the Native Title Act 1993 so that we do not act in illegal way.' They said, `No, we're not going to bother. We'll trust to Brennan,' or whatever advice they might have had, and I am not sure that they were quite so clear in terms of Justice Brennan's comments. But they knew, against whatever Justice Brennan might have said, that there was the Wik case already before the High Court prior to the actions that they took.</para></talk.start><para>It would seem to me that it was a very cavalier act on the part of the Queensland government, in particular, to have proceeded without using the means that they had. They could have proceeded and acted totally legally 
 if they had used, I think, section 29 of the Native Title Act, and there would not have been this problem. Should we reward that kind of attitude which says, `Here we have a perfectly legal way of doing something, but we're not going to use that. We're going to go down this road because we really don't care,'? I do not think anyone should be excused from that kind of attitude, which has been taken by Queensland governments for at least the last 100 years when it comes to native title. We simply cannot reward that kind of attitude by then going back and saying, `Fellas, you made a mistake, but don't worry about it. We'll fix it up.

I do want to raise this question of the legal advice that people are getting. I am not in a position to, nor should I, I believe, seek the legal advice that various individual senators or parties are given in respect of the various clauses, or indeed in respect of the amendments that are before us. So far as I am concerned, I feel that the buck stops here in the parliament and the responsibility is on the shoulders of each and every one of us. It may well be that legal advice is sometimes given that one should support certain amendments or move further amendments, but the ultimate decision as to whether one does that is surely the responsibility of the individual senator or the party concerned. Nevertheless, we are charged with the duty of having our minds informed on what are often very technical and complex issues. Everybody agrees that this legislation has that aspect.</para></talk.start><para>For my part, I am most grateful for the assistance that has been given to me in a legal sense and the legal advice that has been provided to me by John McCarthy QC and 
 Jeff Kildea. They in fact were the counsel for the first successful native title claim on the mainland, for the Dunghutti people in the famous Crescent Head case. John McCarthy has been a Sydney QC for 10 years, and Jeff Kildea has had extensive practice in land and environmental law and has written on these particular subjects. I just wanted to make it clear to the committee that, whilst I am happy to have those counsel, who have given generously of their time, give advice to others around here, they are fairly well flat out at the present moment acting on my instructions, which are fairly narrow instructions, as to what might eventuate, hopefully, next week.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>2000</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><para>(174)	 Schedule 1, item 39, page 134 (lines 21 to 29), omit paragraph (b), substitute:</para><para>	 (b)	 the act did not consist of the making, amendment or repeal of legislation; and</para><para>(175)	 Schedule 1, item 39, page 135 (lines 8 to 16), omit paragraphs (e) and (f), substitute:</para><para>	 (e)	 before the act was done, a past act took place consisting of the grant of a pastoral lease that was not the subject of an express reservation permitting access to Aboriginal peoples or Torres Strait Islanders, and when the act was done the lease was in effect and either:</para><para>		 (i)	 the lease was granted before 1 January 1994 and was in force on 1 January 1994; or</para><para>		 (ii)	 the lease was granted on or after 1 January 1994 and the grant was a past act because of subsection 228(3) or (9); and</para><para>	 (f)	 the act:</para><para>		 (i)	 was a pastoral activity; or</para><para>		 (ii)	 was any other act that is a Gazetted act (see section 22AA) and that did not:</para><para></para><para>	 (A)	 interfere with the community life of the persons who are the holders (disregarding any trust created under Division 6 of Part 2) of native title in relation to the land or waters concerned; or</para><para>			 (B)	 interfere with areas or sites of particular significance, in accordance with their traditions, to the holders (disregarding any trust created under Division 6 of Part 2) of native title in relation to the land or waters concerned; or

What we are now talking about is a model for a compromise, and it is an extraordinarily generous compromise at that. The compromise comes from the position of the National Indigenous Working Group.</para><para>When we dealt with this in 1997 I mentioned that I did not think that this compromise was anyone's preferred option. We have just presented to the Senate the Greens (WA) preferred option. What we are dealing with here is a provision which validates pastoral activities as defined and activities associated with existing lease purposes. All grants and acts that it is believed may require validation can be done in one of two ways. Firstly, by an agreements process where the government gives notice of the act it says should be validated. There would be a six-months negotiating period to obtain validation by agreement and if there is no agreement, a decision is made by the National Native Title Tribunal.</para><para>Secondly, minor impact acts or acts that would have been subject to the expedited procedure are validated upon gazettal of the particular act if they do not interfere with community life of native title holders, interfere with sites of significance or cause major disturbance on pastoral leasehold which is not the subject of a reservation or access for indigenous people.</para><para>If you think about it, what would people be saying if they did not support this? They are saying that if you have acts in this process that we have debated already—that is, the validation of acts which, firstly, interfere with community life of native title holders or, secondly, interfere with sites of significance or, thirdly, cause a major disturbance—why on earth would we not be allowing this process of agreement and validation which involves indigenous people to take place?</para><para>We are dealing here with amendment Nos 174 and 175. Amendment 174 removes from the definition of intermediate period acts under section 232A legislation which itself creates a freehold estate, lease, licence or 
 reservation of land for a purpose. Amendment No. 175 limits intermediate period act under section 232A to acts which take place on pastoral leasehold without a reservation of access for indigenous people and which are associated with pastoral activity or do not interfere with the community life of native title holders, do not interfere with sites of significance and do not cause major disturbance. I think that that is reasonable. As I say, it is extraordinary generous.</para><para>Amendment No. 176 is a consequential amendment removing the definitions of the various categories of intermediate period acts. I realise that we will be voting on the separately.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>2001</page.no><name role="metadata">Woodley, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WOODLEY</name><name.id>HX5</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This is an eminently sensible compromise.

What you have in this area of debate is government, as has been rightly said, taking property rights of one sort or another, and doing so in an attempt to validate what we have always maintained to be an excessive overreach of interests. It is important in these circumstances to ensure that, where indigenous Australians have their property taken away—as any white person in this community would expect and demand—they have a right to compensation. </para><para>We are talking here about a system of fast track acquisition, so to speak, retrospective acquisition. The only way that one can, in all sense of fairness and equity, respond to that is to ensure that the compensation paid to the people whose interests have been taken away is also provided by way of a fast track approach.</para><para>As I said earlier, this amendment was moved in December 1997. It gives native title holders, who are the big losers in the government's validation process, a fast track process for compensation for native title—rather than stakeholders being put to the expense of long, drawn-out legal proceedings and state governments being put to expense.</para><para>We are proposing a compensation regime which will provide a fair balance, a fast track compensation payment, but also will ensure that there must be a prima facie case established in the first instance and that there is a pressure valve which allows the Commonwealth to argue before a court that native title did not exist at the time the intermediate period act occurred. I think fairness demands this; but I would argue that constitutional certainty would demand it as well.</para><para>So amendments 13 and N1 come together. They do provide for this fast track compensation regime. I think it is the least the parliament can do to ensure some fairness in this system.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>2002</page.no><name role="metadata">Minchin, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator MINCHIN</name><name.id>JX4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State;Minister Assisting the Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The government does not support these amendments. We do have some concerns about what is being proposed here. Essentially, as I understand it, it ultimately provides that compensation has to be paid if the application for compensation appears to satisfy the requirements of part of our registration test for native title claim and there is enough evidence that prima facie native title exists or, but for the validation of the intermediate period act, would exist.</para></talk.start><para>So it is, effectively, in our view, a reversal of the onus of proof as to whether native title exists, remembering that, by and large, we are talking about pastoral leases where—remember—the High Court said that it is not 
 necessarily the case that no title has been extinguished, it may well have been extinguished, but that is a matter for determination. According to the legislation under which the lease is issued and the terms of the lease, there is still no declared or determined native title on any pastoral lease in Australia—not even in the Wik case. So the whole question of what, if any, native title does exist on a pastoral lease still remains for considerable judicial determination.</para><para>So we are not in a position to accept this compensation regime on this basis. In terms of the technicalities, it is my advice that there are clearly some drafting anomalies in what is proposed that could lead to considerable confusion. And, as I say, we do think that it is an unwise path to go down to suggest that the onus of proof be reversed. We still think the onus rests with native title claimants to establish their native title rights and interests.</para><para>We do understand and sympathise with the proposition that there be a faster mechanism by which compensation can be determined. We are proposing that the whole mechanism for dealing with native title claimants be speeded up and dealt with more efficiently and all claims, including compensation, referred to mediation. We are providing a later amendment to allow the Federal Court to determine a claim for compensation by the registrar for smaller claims. So, in the light of that, and in the light of anomalies which I will not go into in any detail unless I am asked to, and because of the government's policy position in relation to the question of proof of native title, we do not support these amendments.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>2002</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The logic just displayed by the minister is mind-boggling.

We are dealing now with Greens (WA)-Democrat amendments 8 to 11.</para><para>The Greens (WA)-Democrat amendment 8 provides a mechanism for governments to validate certain intermediate period acts by agreement. That is in addition to section 22A. It would have been activated by the government giving notice to the representative body within three months of the commencement of the new provision. It involves negotiations for up to six months—not a great ask we believe—from the date of commencement of the section.</para><para>It gives the government an incentive to move promptly to identify relevant acts and seek validation by agreement. It provides a gazettal process for any validation of intermediate period acts. Provisions are also made for the challenge of gazettal where there is doubt about whether the act in question falls within the definition of intermediate period acts. That is new section 22A.</para><para>Our amendment 9 replaces the government's complex scheme based on the current 
 past act categories with a simple provision which states that the non-extinguishment principle applies to any validated intermediate period act. Of course, we are all looking for clarity in this process. Amendment 10A is a consequential amendment. Amendment 11 is a provision to ensure the Commonwealth must top-up state and territory compensation for the validation of intermediate period acts if it is less than just terms. If by this action the Commonwealth is allowing this to happen, then it is not unreasonable to suggest that the Commonwealth should cough up some funds to enable this to happen.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>—Senator Margetts, you may wish to have amendments 8 to 10 and amendment 11 voted on separately.

It has been argued on a number of occasions—it has certainly been 
 argued by the Labor Party—that we can have a really rotten bill but, as long as we slap almost any kind of Racial Discrimination Act amendment on it, it will somehow make it okay—somehow or other the High Court will make the ethical or moral decisions which this chamber seems unable to make.</para></talk.start><para>I do not believe that. I believe that we have the responsibility to be making legislation which stands on its own merits and which contains the political decisions which incorporate the ethical and moral arguments. However, it is the belief of the Greens (WA) that this piece of legislation is one of the most discriminatory pieces of legislation that the country has had to deal with. We are dealing with a situation which seems to hark back to a time, first of all, when the constitution was put together, when people had no idea that indigenous Australians had the right to be treated as human beings like everybody else.</para><para>The National Indigenous Working Group believes that, despite the government's initial undertaking to respect the principles of the Racial Discrimination Act 1976 in drafting its amendments, many of its proposed amendments are inconsistent with the Racial Discrimination Act; that is, they extinguish or impair the native title rights of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander peoples while leaving intact the property rights of people of other races. That came out under Mabo No. 1 judgment.</para><para>This applies particularly to validation of intermediate period acts, the confirmation of extinguishing tenures, the provisions which would allow the compulsory acquisition of coexisting native title to provide an upgrade of tenure for the pastoralists, and also to aspects of the proposed permissible future acts regime which cover primary production activities, management of water and airspace, renewals and the use of reserve land, and some provisions relating to statutory access.</para><para>Inconsistency with the Racial Discrimination Act will not make these provisions invalid per se because, being a later specific enactment, the government's amendment bill will operate as an implied repeal of the Racial Discrimination Act to the extent of any inconsistency. To reverse this situation the 
 amendment bill must contain a provision which explicitly states that the parliament's intention is that the Racial Discrimination Act is to prevail if there is an inconsistency with the Racial Discrimination Act. In effect, this means that the provisions which appear to be racially discriminatory will be valid only if the amendments are a special measure; that is, that they are of benefit.</para><para>We dealt with these issues in 1997 but we were in, as we are now but perhaps even more so at the time, a pressure cooker situation. The advice we received from Professor Tony Blackshield is as follows:</para><para>When the Native Title Amendment Bill was before the Senate in 1997, a number of draft amendments were proposed which might have had the effect of preserving the operation of the Racial Discrimination Act more effectively than the original s 7(1) had done.</para><para>That is, section 7(1) in the act. It continues:</para><para>However, the amendment which gained favour was . . . </para><para>7(1) This Act is intended to be read and construed subject to the provisions of the <inline font-style="italic">Racial Discrimination Act of 1975</inline> .</para><para>Rhetorically this is even more modest than the original unsuccessful version ("Nothing in this act affects. . . "). Leaving aside rhetorical impressions, the actual effect of the new version seems only to state more clearly what the High Court footnote . . . suggested as the effect of the original version: that is, as an aid to statutory interpretation, the Courts are being instructed that, in case of ambiguity in any of the provisions of the <inline font-style="italic">Native Title Act</inline>  as amended, that interpretation should be chosen which would be more consonant with the protection extended by the <inline font-style="italic">RDA</inline> . In short, while this amendment might make more explicit the effect which the Court has already ascribed to the existing s 7(1), it would not add to that effect in any way.</para><para>That may mean that the section already in the act might be just as, and potentially even more, effective than adding an ineffective Racial Discrimination Act amendment. The quote continues:</para><para>The objective which was sought by Aboriginal negotiators in 1993—an assurance that no provisions of the <inline font-style="italic">Native Title Act</inline>  should detract from, or operate inconsistently with, the protections extended by the <inline font-style="italic">RDA</inline> —may be so at odds with normal canons of statutory interpretation that no form of drafting would be effectual to achieve such an outcome. But a more ambitious version moved by Senator Margetts appeared to have more hope 
 of success. That version would have sought added security by including relevant provisions both in the Native Title Amendment Bill and in the <inline font-style="italic">RDA</inline>  itself. In the amendment bill, a new subclause 4(1) would provide:</para><para>4(1) To avoid doubt, it is expressly declared to be the intention of the Parliament that, if <inline font-style="italic">any provision</inline>  of the <inline font-style="italic">Native Title Amendment Act 1997</inline>  would in its tenor <inline font-style="italic">or operation</inline>  be inconsistent with the provisions of the <inline font-style="italic">Racial Discrimination Act 1975</inline> , the latter provision shall prevail and the former provision shall to the extent of the inconsistency be of no operative effect. [Emphasis added]</para><para>This formulation is expressed to operate severally on "any provision" of the amendment bill which gives rise to an inconsistency, and the reference to "tenor <inline font-style="italic">or operation</inline> " directs attention beyond a mere question of statutory interpretation to an assessment of the practical effect of the relevant provision. The test of "inconsistency", and the consequences expressed to follow from it, attract the language of s 109 of the Constitution. That provision, of course, is concerned with inconsistency between a Commonwealth law and a State law and is thus not directly relevant here except by way of analogy. But the analogy is a useful one, first, because it evokes a well-established test which the courts are accustomed to applying; and, second, because it refers to a situation in which the accepted analysis is that <inline font-style="italic">both</inline>  of the two competing laws are validly enacted, the problem then being that only one of them can <inline font-style="italic">operate</inline> .</para><para>It should be noted that the formulation applies only to provisions of the Native Title Amendment Bill. To the extent that such a provision, if enacted, were effective in attaining its object, the overriding effect thus attributed to the <inline font-style="italic">RDA</inline>  would avail only against the new provisions introduced by the Amendment Bill, not against the original provisions of the <inline font-style="italic">Native Title Act 1993</inline> .</para><para>Second, and perhaps to greater effect, Senator Margetts also proposed a complementary amendment to the <inline font-style="italic">RDA</inline>  itself, by the insertion of a new s 6B:</para><para>6B(1) To avoid any doubt, it is expressly declared to be the intention of Parliament that the provisions of this act Are to prevail over any provision of the <inline font-style="italic">Native Title Amendment Act 1997</inline>  which would in its tenor or operation be inconsistent with this Act.</para><para>(2) Nothing in the <inline font-style="italic">Native Title Amendment Act 1997</inline>  is to be taken to authorise any conduct, whether legislative, executive or judicial, that is inconsistent with the provisions or operation of this Act.</para><para>Again, the proposed s 6B(1) would apply to "any provision" of the Native Title Amendment Bill, so 
 that each provision would have to be scrutinised separately to determine whether or not it was consistent with the <inline font-style="italic">RDA</inline> ; and in that determination the focus would be on "the tenor <inline font-style="italic">or operation</inline> " of each such provision. The proposed subsection (2) would ensure that the protection of the <inline font-style="italic">RDA</inline>  availed not only against those amendments to the <inline font-style="italic">Native Title Act</inline>  which operate by their own direct legislative force, but also to those which permit or authorise subsequent legislative or executive action which might adversely discriminate against native title holders or claimants. The inclusion of these safeguards in the<inline font-style="italic"> RDA</inline>  itself, and not merely in the Native Title Act Amendment Bill, would recognise the crucial issue is the effect to be accorded to the <inline font-style="italic">RDA</inline> . Moreover, the fact that the <inline font-style="italic">RDA</inline>  provisions were cognate with, and simultaneous with, the amendments to the <inline font-style="italic">Native Title Act</inline> , would exclude the usual tendency to resolve such problems by giving priority to whichever enactment is later in time.</para><para>I apologise for the length of my quote, but it is important that it be on the record. Professor Blackshield is indicating that we are trying to have a Racial Discrimination Act amendment which works. That at least is the tenor of what the ALP were saying at the time. They have put a lot of faith in the Racial Discrimination Act at various times and amendments relating to the Racial Discrimination Act.</para><para>I will be unkind enough to remind honourable senators that in the debate on the Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill the Racial Discrimination Act was the only saviour. That is, instead of making an ethical decision, we were left with only a Racial Discrimination Act amendment. The amendment per se did not save the bill. Even more importantly, it did not save the people, the Ngarrindjeri women. The amendment did not replace an ethical consideration.</para><para>However, we are attempting to provide a Racial Discrimination Act amendment which will have some effect in preventing this act being used in a discriminatory way. I would love to have recorded the amount of times the minister and the Prime Minister have said that this bill is not discriminatory. They say, `We will argue in the High Court, but, anyway, it is good for Aboriginal people.' That being the case, they should support our amendment. There is no argument to suggest that they should not support the amendment. They themselves say that their bill is not discrimi 
 natory. Therefore, having an amendment which actually requires that the bill not be so is the very least that we should expect.

I said in my speech during the second reading debate that Aboriginal people would never treat the European settlers of this country as we treated them, because Aboriginal people are not savages. That is the point I want to make.</para><para>The amendment being moved jointly by the Australian Democrats and Greens (WA) indicates, for us on this side of the chamber at least, that we do know how Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are treated in this country at times. We would not want it for ourselves; we would not want to be treated like that. We certainly do not want our children to be treated like that, and we are not prepared to accept that kind of treatment for anyone else either. Not only should the Racial Discrimination Act apply to this legislation, it is the view of the Australian Democrats that racial discrimination should be a constitutional prohibition. The question remains: why is the coalition government of this country not prepared to make the same commitment and support this amendment?</para><para>The Australian Democrats do not accept the view of our long time friend Father Frank Brennan that the RDA clause is a legal 
 minefield. The Racial Discrimination Act is one of the few pieces of legislation in this country that one can say is based on an international concept of morality. My colleague Senator Bourne elucidated this point very well during the second reading debate. That morality dictates that all persons are created equally; that they have inalienable rights; and that they should be able to live their lives free from arbitrary interference, discrimination, vilification and violence. All honourable senators may very well agree with the sentiment I have just expressed. It would be shameful if anything else were the case.</para><para>During my time in the Senate, I have always believed that this is the place to give effect to our moral convictions. The challenge, therefore, is that we should state clearly and unambiguously our position on racial discrimination against our indigenous people. It is not open to compromise. You cannot have a halfway measure; either you believe in discrimination or you do not. I put it on the record that the Australian Democrats do not believe in discrimination, and we will manifest that belief in our vote on this amendment by attempting to ensure that the principle that I have just spoken of is represented in the strongest possible terms. Last time this amendment was debated, it was moved by the Democrats, Greens and ALP and it was supported by Senator Harradine after the luncheon adjournment.

It is quite clear that the only outcome from the High Court this week is enormously uncertain as to whether parliament does have the power to legislate in a manner detrimental to a particular race in Australia. That High Court decision makes it important for us to take a stand. It is a real, sad reflection on Australia that neither the highest court in the country nor the government of the country is prepared to rule a very clear and distinct line against racial discrimination by way of legislation in our society.</para></talk.start><para>We would have thought, given the diverse nature of our society, given the need for reconciliation with indigenous Australians, given the need for us as a multicultural society to behave in a way fair and equal to all and given the way that we need to develop ourselves and how we are seen overseas, that the ultimate benchmark of our behaviour would have been that we act in a non-racially discriminate way with each other and with the rest of the world. But there is no preparedness by the government to take such a position.</para><para>I think in those circumstances it is important for us to ensure that the benchmark of this legislation is provided by this particular clause. We do so not just in the interests of fairness but also in the interests of certainty. We would not be here had it not been for the Racial Discrimination Act 1975. We would 
 not have had behind us a body of some 20 years of laws which had been developed by the courts to ensure the non-discriminatory principle can apply with respect to native title.</para><para>The Koowarta case, for instance, was the precursor to Mabo. It was a case which arose in the late 1970s, where Joh Bjelke-Petersen, the then Premier of Queensland, refused to grant ministerial consent to John Koowarta and his group to purchase a pastoral lease on Cape York. The reason he gave was that Aborigines already have too much land. Isn't that an argument we have heard in recent months?</para><para>The proposed purchase was a commercial transaction entered into with a willing vendor of a cattle station. Koowarta then took his complaint under the Racial Discrimination Act to the enforcement authorities. What did the then Premier of Queensland do? He issued proceedings in the High Court arguing that the Racial Discrimination Act was unconstitutional and not a valid law of the Commonwealth. In the High Court case, the act was upheld under the external affairs power and the Premier of Queensland was held liable for his refusal to approve the transfer of the pastoral lease.</para><para>The act was important. As I say, it led to a lot of the argument in the Mabo No. 1 case in the High Court of Australia in 1985, a case which gave us, at the end of the day, Mabo No. 2, which gave us native title. It was a case which dealt with the law that was passed by the state of Queensland in 1985 which expressly and retrospectively abolished the rights of Torres Strait Islanders which were the subject of a pending claim in the High Court in the Mabo case. That law expressly provided that those rights were extinguished as from the moment of the extension of sovereignty of the Crown to the Torres Strait Islanders without compensation for all time and for all purposes.</para><para>If that Queensland law had taken effect, the Mabo case would then have been at an end. The High Court held that section 10 of the RDA operated so as to ensure that the plaintiffs in that case could not be deprived of their property rights by such a state law, a law which was purporting to extinguish their 
 property rights in a way in which the property rights of persons of other races were not being extinguished or impaired. That is a short history of how we are here. The RDA has been important in the development of native title. I do not think we should leave this debate, to which we could not have come without the RDA, without the RDA being protected.</para><para> The important thing in this respect is to look at what we are seeking to invoke by the provisions we are talking about. What we are seeking to invoke are pretty benchmark provisions in the Race Discrimination Act as picked up from the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. We are talking about a provision which says that racial discrimination is to be unlawful. We are talking about a provision which provides for rights to equality before the law—section 10 of the RDA, and section 9 being the one that provides racial discrimination to be unlawful. We are talking about provisions that say it is unlawful for a person to do any act involving a distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on race, colour, descent, national ethnic origin and so on. I would have thought that that benchmark would have been quite critical to any civilised government's and parliament's appreciation and deliberation on issues such as this.</para><para> It is to be noted that the form of section 10, the right to equality before the law, is not a form that is designed to render any law invalid, whether it be Commonwealth or state law. What it does do is to ensure that rights are conferred on persons who have been discriminated against on the grounds of race, colour or national ethnic origin. The provision ensures that they have the same rights as others. It does not confer special rights, but it does have an effect on other laws. It is important that this benchmark be somehow provided in this legislation. In that context, I think it is important for us to recognise that the RDA does allow for the concept of a special measure. To have full implementation of the RDA, we also need to ensure that the special measure capacity of the RDA is also encompassed by the provision that we have before us today.</para><para>I said at the start that we need this provision for fairness, but we also need it for certainty. The likelihood of this act being found constitutionally valid will be significantly improved if the act remains a special measure, then the detrimental provisions are unlikely to be separately assessed. That is provided for in the Race Discrimination Act. It is provided for in the international covenant. That mechanism is the mechanism that the Senate decided upon after lunch the last time we deliberated on these issues.</para><para> I say it again: the likelihood will be enhanced, it will be significantly improved, because of the capacity for the act to be read as a special measure. Far from creating chaos, the amendment is significantly likely to reduce the chances of the act being struck down in full or even in part, and hence it will reduce uncertainty. It is important to appreciate that the amendments will not result in all the discriminatory aspects of the act being read down in some way. If section 10 cannot operate to allow Aboriginal people to enjoy equal rights, then a detrimental aspect will be read in context and the law will survive if the court is satisfied that the package as a whole could be read as a special measure.</para><para> That is an important thing to put on the record here. It is a point that was made by Senator Harradine after lunch last time and emphasised by him. It is a point that was raised in the debate on the last occasion we had this debate. For fairness, it is important; for certainty, it is important. I must say that, when we vote on this legislation this afternoon, let us keep in mind that the government has also expressed support for these principles. The government's stated policy prior to the election was to ensure that the Native Title Amendment Bill would comply with the RDA. The Prime Minister promised us that his legislation would so comply. On 5 March, in his first press conference, he said that the changes to the Native Title Act would have to be made in a way that does not violate the principles of race discrimination. In parliament he reiterated that.</para><para> We do have concerns with this legislation. We have concerns with the confirmation aspect of it. We have concerns with the 
 upgrading of rights. We have concerns with the validation of Crown granted titles at the expense of native title. We have concerns with the winding back of the freehold test and so on. It is for this reason that I will move an amendment in the same form as the one moved last time.</para><para>As I say, we have had a debate on this before. The 1993 act gave birth to section 7(1), a section which was developed with indigenous people at the time. The decision of WA and the Commonwealth in 1995 has cast doubt on the application of 7(1). So it is important for us to re-emphasise our commitment and, in doing so, not just re-emphasise our commitment to fairness but also to overcome the uncertainty created by WA and the Commonwealth. Workability is an important aspect of our objectives to pursue this particular amendment.</para><para> Just to summarise, our amendment to section 7 is to ensure that the principles of the RDA of 1975 and Australia's international treaty obligations under the convention on the  elimination of racial discrimination are respected and observed in relation to the provisions of the act to ensure the principles of the RDA apply to the administration of all government native title regimes and as an aid to the construction of the terms of the act. It is a resubmission of 7(1), but we do have a further amendment which contains a footnote which, in many ways, is a valuable addition to the section that was passed in this place last December.</para><para>The footnote acts as an aid to interpretation and it indicates that parliament's intention is that the provisions of the RDA will apply to the performance and functions and exercise of powers conferred by the Native Title Act. The important aspect, of course, is that that explicitly refers to functions and powers performed particularly by state and territory authorities. We think it is important that that be clarified by way of a footnote and we also embolden the provision of 7(1) with a footnote. With respect to the interpretation of other sections in the NTA, the note is clear that any ambiguity will be resolved in favour of the RDA—that ambiguity to which 7(1) attaches.</para><para>So, in a sense, we are revisiting the debate that we had last December. There has been a lot of discussion and debate in the interim period as to the effect of the clause. On the one hand, we have Father Brennan saying that it is going to cause problems and, on the other, we have Tony Blackshield saying that it will not be effective. We believe that the formula we came upon last December will provide not just a benchmark for fairness but will also provide a mechanism for certainty, and it is one that should be supported today.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN (Senator Watson)</name></talker><para>—Senator Bolkus, we presume that, following the vote in relation to the Greens' two amendments, you will then move your amendment referred to as RN42 on 941.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>XE4</name.id><name role="metadata">BOLKUS</name><name role="display">Senator Bolkus</name></talker><para>—That is right.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>—Thank you, Senator Bolkus.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>2013</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—If there is one thing that strikes fear into John Howard's heart, it is this amendment. I will tell you why: John Howard's 10-point plan is baldfaced racism and it is intended to cut the indigenous people of this country out of their rights. He says so in so many words when he comes out repeatedly, as he does, to oppose the Racial Discrimination Act having aegis over his 10-point plan. It is as plain as day that the Prime Minister is saying, `I cannot allow my 10-point plan to be put to the test because it will be found to be racially discriminatory,'—and it is.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Margetts has brought forward a watertight caveat on this native title legislation to make sure that no wishy-washiness is going to allow racial discrimination to seep through in the application of this act, so that it is not racially discriminatory. She has read out Professor Blackshield's opinion. It is very clear. The weak provision that got through last time, which we were told would do the job, in fact does not. If there needs to be any back-up to what Senator Margetts has said, given the clear legal opinion that that is what is required if we are to ensure this bill does not pass from this place with the taint of racial discrimination and the inherent ability to discriminate against indigenous people in 
 this country, then we will pass that amendment.</para><para>But there is a back-up which I will be bringing forward. The back-up is the very same amendment that this chamber with support from everybody—no dissent—passed in 1996 to ensure that the then social security legislation amendment bill was not discriminatory. It is in exactly the same words, and the question will have to be put—if Senator Margetts's best option does not get up—how the chamber, on that one occasion, can say, `Let's all agree to have this provision put into one piece of legislation to make sure Australians are not discriminated against,' but, when it comes to native title, can say, `We can't have it.'</para><para>That will point out a duplicity and a double standard if that happens. I will be expecting those who do not intend to support Senator Margetts's amendment or my amendment to get on their feet in here to explain the double standards: why what is good for the Australian community in social security legislation to make sure we do not discriminate is not good enough when it comes to the indigenous people of this country. I can tell you why it will not be, if that is the case: it will be because we will be making a racist decision.</para><para>Extraordinarily enough, the Prime Minister flagged his concern on 3AW today that the Senate does not get away with removing racism from his 10-point plan. The Prime Minister put forward a proposition that if the opposition and the minor parties vote for the bill unamended—that is, do not put in a provision to have the Racial Discrimination Act prevail:</para><para>We will fully pay for the constitutional challenge against the validity of the bill.</para><para>`We will fund it,' he said—half a million dollars to the Senate if it backs down on its amendments and does what he wants, and discriminates. I hope the Prime Minister on the weekend reads page 102 of Senate <inline font-style="italic">Standing Orders</inline> , which says:</para><para>A person shall not . . . offer or promise . . . any inducement or benefit of any kind, or by other improper means, influence a senator in the senator's conduct— 
</para><para>The Prime Minister can go one better than influencing a senator; he can influence the whole Senate—he can move to buy off the Senate—in his attempt to ensure that we give the stamp of approval to racial discrimination in this legislation. How low can you go? What a standard for the Prime Minister of this country to set! He should be sent to the privileges committee for an assessment of his behaviour, and if he had specifically named somebody as the target of his inducement he would be going, I can assure you. But, of course, he is in the position to try every manoeuvre he can to buy off the opposition—Senator Harradine, Senator Colston, the Democrats and the Greens. He has said a new low standard in trying to do just that. He has had to go public in his efforts to influence the Senate into siding with him in discriminating against the indigenous people of this country. We, for one, in this little corner of the house are not going to have a bar of it.</para><para>If the Prime Minister is going to be fair and not discriminate, he will fund anybody's application to the High Court—regardless of what comes out of this place—when they go to challenge this legislation afterwards. Don't put a caveat on it, John Howard. Don't say, `If you don't fiddle with my bill, if you don't make it non-discriminatory, I will fund a challenge to the High Court.' The Prime Minister has made that promise. Let him promise it to anybody who wants to take it to the High Court. I can assure him that the indigenous people will be taking up that promise if he cares to extend it to them. But I suppose he will not, because he has two standards: one for the indigenous people of this country and one for the rest of us. That is what this piece of legislation is about.</para><para>There it is. We have to make sure that in this important part of committee deliberation we do not allow loopholes and that we back the amendment brought forward by Senator Margetts to insist that the indigenous people of this country have the protection of the Racial Discrimination Act in the application of this so-called 10-point plan—this 10-point plunder—of the Prime Minister's when legislation gets through this place in one form or another.</para><para>The test is on Senator Harradine and the Labor Party very much here. As I say, if they do not want to support Senator Margetts's Rolls Royce, as she calls it, legislation, if they want to have the Minimoke alternative, let them please stand up and say why. If you go down to the next level of strength of application of non-discrimination, for goodness sake get up and say how on social security legislation applying to all Australians you can put in an amendment and then fail to now support exactly the same amendment regarding the indigenous people of this country.</para><para>The Senate here is on trial. We will all get up and say, `There is nothing more repugnant than discrimination against anybody, let alone the original Australians', but history will record this as a clear-minded act of discrimination against those very people, the indigenes of this country, if we fail to support this amendment that Senator Margetts has put forward.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>2014</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—When Senator Bolkus responded to the Greens-Democrat proposal for a workable Racial Discrimination Act amendment, he did it by revisiting what we now refer to as the compromise Racial Discrimination Act amendment of 1987. I listened quite carefully to Senator Bolkus's response today, and the question that occurred to me was to ask myself: who was Senator Bolkus directing his arguments to; who was he trying to convince? I believe that the arguments in relation to this amendment probably change depending on who the audience is. I guess that if Senator Bolkus or other people were talking to a group of indigenous people they would say, `Look, no matter what happens in the bill, there is an RDA amendment. And that will be okay. That will enable the worst aspects of the bill to be challenged in the High Court.'</para></talk.start><para>Yet, as I say, I listened carefully to the argument, and I could not see that Senator Bolkus was arguing cogently that the Racial Discrimination amendment would in fact enable Australia to meet its treaty obligations.

 argue about the `workability' of the compromise `compromise' amendment.</para><para>I believe that Senator Bolkus was trying his best to argue—and he did, I believe, argue quite well—that the amendment which was passed last year has almost no effect. I believe him in that instance. I do not see why the government is not convinced. I think they are. I think there is a lot of bluff and bluster here, because they probably realise this for themselves and they have just as many legal opinions. It might be that there might be some skerrick of some aspects of the bill which do not escape, but in fact the compromise `compromise' amendment—the one we were pushed to support in the heat of the moment if you like, at the end of 1997—does not do the job. I think that is exactly what Senator Bolkus was saying. To a certain extent, it is what Senator Harradine's legal advice is saying, and it is the same advice, to a large extent, that Professor Blackshield is giving.

I ask you to look at my record—and not just my record in parliament, because one of the major reasons I got involved in politics was in regard to race discrimination. I argued and fought battles as a lawyer before being in politics, and I have fought on this principle ever since.

It is for that reason that I argued that the special measure provision has an important role in the assessment 
 of this legislation but it also has an important role if we were to honestly and broadly implement the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act. Senator Margetts, as I say, it has been the spirit of the day—I seem to be fair game for the debate and I will probably continue to be until we finish some time next week or next month or whatever.

My decision was that you were specifically directing them to those people who you thought might want to change their vote, to convince the government and Senator Harradine that these amendments in fact do not make much difference, that is, that they are mainly geared to increasing the `workability' but that they do not actually have much teeth or do not carry any specific guarantees in relation to the bill per se in the High Court.

Today the Prime Minister did make an offer to the Senate to fund a challenge to the High Court if this legislation were to be put through without amendment. What I would like to know from the government is whether that offer stands if the legislation is amended so that it is made non-racially discriminatory. Does it inherently mean that the government is going to fund a challenge to the High Court by the indigenous people which follows the passage of this legislation through the parliament?</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>2016</page.no><name role="metadata">Minchin, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator MINCHIN</name><name.id>JX4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State;Minister Assisting the Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The government has stated, both in my terms and the Prime Minister's terms, the view that, if the opposition parties are so convinced of their view that there is anything unconstitutional about the bill, they should allow the bill to pass in the form presented to this chamber by the government and have it challenged in the High Court. What the Prime Minister has said today is not an offer to the Senate but a commitment that, if the bill is passed in the form presented to the parliament by the government, then, on the presumption that it will indeed be challenged, which many Aboriginal leaders have said they will do, the government has made a commitment that it is prepared to fund such a challenge in order to ensure that the High Court can act as the arbiter as to whether or not this bill does infringe any provisions of the constitution.</para></talk.start><para>It is a quite sensible and proper course of action, one which I would have thought those who seem sure that there is something constitutionally doubtful about this and who do not which wish to see Australia have a double dissolution election over this legislation would find attractive.

So we are now here debating the Wik 10-point plan as your government's response to that High Court decision, which we would claim in fact contradicts that High Court decision. I know you disagree with that. The reason why we could never accept the Prime Minister's offer is that it is contradictory. If he will not accept the decision of the High Court in Wik and seeks by his 10-point plan to water it down considerably, what is the point of being here debating this legislation this afternoon, if in fact he is now somehow or other saying, `Well, let's try the High Court again'?</para></talk.start><para>Aboriginal people are not footballs to be kicked from one High Court decision to another.

It is frustrating to conduct this debate on such mythical premises. The statement that the government does not accept the Wik High Court decision is quite extraordinary in the light of the obvious fact that on our side of politics there was a debate about whether or not to accept the Wik High Court decision, with the farming industry of Australia saying, `The government should give us what Paul Keating promised, that is, what we all thought we had: exclusive possession on pastoral leases.'</para></talk.start><para>This whole bill is premised on the basis that the government made a clear decision that it was not going to do that, that it was not going to except the Keating government decision; it was going to accept the Wik High Court 
 decision. In fact, as has been stated repeatedly, the legislation gives more protection to native title than does the common law. As a matter of common law, the High Court in the Wik decision said that native title is not necessarily extinguished by a pastoral lease. It may well be; you have to look at the lease and the legislation under which it was granted to see if any native title has survived. But, of course, the High Court said as a matter of common law that sovereign parliaments have the authority to completely extinguish native title by issuing contrary grants.</para><para>This act says no, that native title is recognised on pastoral leases and provides huge constraints on what would otherwise be the freedom of state parliaments as observed by the High Court. I do not mind debating all of this but let us debate it on the facts and not some nonsensical suggestion that we do not accept the Wik High Court decision. Remember, that was a decision about the common law. We are talking about the proposition put by some that the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 breaches the races power of the constitution. Aboriginal leaders have said that they will challenge this legislation as being in breach of this races power. We are saying that we do not think it does because it is beneficial but if you wish to have it tested, pass it and let the High Court decide.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>2017</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—What has happened to the `bucketfuls of extinguishment' that the Deputy Prime Minister described this legislation as entailing?

What is happening in this legislation—we will be getting to it on Monday or Tuesday—is that all other rights are going to be given to developers and taken away from the indigenous people.

 indigenous people are going to have no negotiating rights.</para></talk.start><para>But I want to come back to the Prime Minister's very generous offer this morning to fund a full High Court determination of the validity of this legislation. The minister, Senator Minchin, has said, `That will be done for the indigenous people only if we don't amend the legislation.' I want to clear this up. Is the government saying that it will fund a challenge from the indigenous people of Australia provided the Senate does not amend the legislation? If it comes to that, is the Prime Minister asking senators on this side to go and meet with the indigenous people and say, `Please, let us drop all the amendments?' I cannot read it any other way. Either the Prime Minister is going to fund a challenge from the indigenous people regardless of what this Senate does or he is asking for us to influence the indigenous people or vice versa to retract amendments put before this place. That is an inducement if I ever saw one. It is improper conduct. The Prime Minister ought to be ashamed of himself. He is trying to coerce or induce senators and the indigenous people to fall back into line with this racially discriminatory legislation.</para><para>All I need to hear, and I am sure all the indigenous people of this country, moreover, want to hear, is that the Prime Minister is true to his offer to them regardless of what happens in this place. Otherwise you are putting them on the rack. You are saying to the indigenous people, `We will fund a piece of legislation but if those people in the Senate put amendments in our legislation we will not.

What sort of behaviour is that from our nation's leader? Pretty low. The Prime Minister ought to have thought about what he was doing before he went on 3AW. But I do not think he has the capacity to.

I believe that still has not been decided and, in recent times, the High Court have never ruled on that.

It was talked about a few years ago; the Labor Party talked about it a few years ago.

In fact, ATSIC will be paying for it out of ATSIC. As we all know, the minister and the government do not have the power to direct ATSIC as to how it spends its funds.

Unless the government gave it an increase in appropriation, I guess that something else would have to miss out, as it often does in the necessity so often for ATSIC to be able to fight for its basic legal rights.</para><para>Also, I would offer quickly that, if the government truly wants certainty in the constitution, what we do have to have is constitutional change. With the race power in the constitution, and the amendments to the race power in the constitution, it is my belief 
 that the people of Australia did not mean that we or governments should or could use it to the detriment of a race of people. It seems to me that we are going to have this argument again and again in this place, until we put it to the Australian people that there be a change to the constitution to make it beyond doubt that the race power is there for the benefit of any race of people.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>2019</page.no><name role="metadata">Minchin, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator MINCHIN</name><name.id>JX4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State;Minister Assisting the Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I just indicate for the record that the government opposes the amendments moved by the other parties on this issue for the reasons stated the last time we debated and stated publicly time and again.

It is not an opportunity that comes to all parliamentarians. Only two parliamentarians each year have this very special opportunity. It was quite unique and it was a privilege to have been able to participate in the work of the Australian mission in New York and to have been brought into the work of the United Nations from the end of September-October to December.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I want to detail some of the recommendations that I have made as a result of my experience at the United Nations. My report covers recommendations; the role of a parliamentary adviser; the key issues of the 52nd General Assembly, which for me were UN reform, Iraq, the third committee and the sixth committee; conferences and meetings; Australia's human rights policy; women's rights; and follow-up projects for 1998. In attending so many sessions and in observing the work of the mission, I found that it was possible, when I came back, to review and assess those areas where I thought in future we could build on Senator Patterson's and my experience and indeed on the experience of those members of parliament who have been 
 attending the General Assembly since the mid-1960s.</para><para>First of all, it is a practice that should continue. It is a wonderful opportunity for this parliament to be kept in touch with the work of the United Nations. But there are areas where we could perhaps update and change some of the practices that would better benefit and assist Australia in terms of how we are perceived within the United Nations itself. I would like to read my recommendations, or as many of them as I can with this opportunity. First of all, in relation to the role of parliamentary advisers to the Australian mission to the United Nations, I state:</para><para>The role of parliamentary advisers needs to be more clearly defined to maximise personal professional development, the opportunity to provide practical support to the Australian Mission and an ongoing commitment to the work of the United Nations.</para><para>I think that ongoing commitment is very important. I also state:</para><para>The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade should consider developing a set of guidelines, including practical administrative arrangements, to assist parliamentary advisers prepare for this transfer of duty.</para><para>The issue of electorate staff being able to travel at private expense to be involved in the work of the delegation should be fully considered and officially clarified to assist the work of future parliamentary advisers.</para><para>When you are participating in this delegation, you have to do both your work from Australia and your work from the United Nations. I did not have any staff with me. But I commend my colleague Senator Patterson, who made special arrangements and assisted with the funding of electorate staff. I think that is highly commendable. It did enable her, I am sure, to better keep across some of her responsibilities than in my case, where I always seemed to be rushing to complete work that had to be done to send back to Australia. In relation to the Australian mission to the United Nations—as you would understand, Madam President, this is a perennial recommendation—I state:</para><para>The staffing and resource levels of the Australian Mission should be increased to maximise the participation of Australia in all areas of the United Nations.  
</para><para>I commend the role of the ambassador, our first woman ambassador, Penny Wensley, who is absolutely dedicated. She has so much energy that it is very hard to keep up with her in all that she does at the United Nations—not just with being involved in committees and the General Assembly, but also in discussing issues with all her colleagues. But there were times when I wished she had more resources, including staffing, to keep that momentum going. It is always a difficulty whenever resources are mentioned. All governments have good reasons for not funding at certain levels. But I do think it is an issue that should always be being reviewed. The United Nations is where Australia is showcasing its view of the world in so many areas, and we need the resources and the staffing to do that for maximum benefit.</para><para>I have also raised an issue that I think is perhaps the only controversial issue in my recommendations, and I want to explain it. I have said:</para><para>There could be greater appreciation of the professionalism of overseas-based Australian officers involved in day-to-day negotiations, thus limiting some of the protracted New York-Canberra-New York communication, which can be both inefficient and out of step with the climate of opinion within the United Nations.</para><para>I want to emphasise that I am not referring to the foreign minister here, because obviously the foreign minister has the absolute right, indeed responsibility, to be in touch on a daily basis. But at the bureaucratic level I did get the impression at times that there was a little too much dabbling from Canberra. Where we were in New York the staff were fully across the issues, fully across the nuances of the debate, and it was very time consuming to have phone calls, faxes and e-mails disrupting the flow of debate and negotiations. I am not a professional in terms of the officer level, but I did feel that we need to ensure that there is a good brief—which there is—of the broad issues and the general line of government policy and then leave it to the professionals and of course the minister's office.</para><para>In the few minutes remaining I want to run through the last item—though there are a few 
 more recommendations: Australia's role at the United Nations. I think we need to develop:</para><para>. . . a forward plan of those priority areas where the Australian Government can take a leadership role and offer relevant expertise.</para><para>I think that we could be doing more in that area. I think priority should be given to developing a register of suitable candidates for nomination to be available for appointment to various United Nations committees, particularly giving attention to women and men from a variety of professional backgrounds with community based experience. Finally:</para><para>The Australian Government should develop a comprehensive strategy to raise the profile of Australia within the United Nations building to include art exhibitions, a food and wine festival, cultural performances, Australian craft availability—</para><para>in the gift shop, for instance, there was nothing from Australia—</para><para>. . . Such a strategy should ideally culminate in special 1999 events to preview Australia prior to the Olympic Games.</para><para>In conclusion, could I again praise Ambassador Penny Wensley and her staff for the role they fulfil. It was a unique opportunity. Senator Patterson and I are very grateful to have been the lucky ones selected on this occasion.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Abortion</title><page.no>2022</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>2022</page.no><name role="metadata">McKiernan, Sen James</name><name role="display">Senator McKIERNAN</name><name.id>1I4</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I have in the past stood in this place and been critical of an adversary of mine, one Mr Richard Egan from Western Australia.

It talks about the Western Australian parliament yesterday and the previous day passing bills in both houses—legislation which will give Western Australia, as is reported in the newspaper:</para><para>. . . the nation's most liberal abortion laws—giving women access to abortion on demand—after two historic votes in State Parliament yesterday.</para><para>After sitting all night, the Legislative Council voted 22 to 11 about 5.30am to repeal the criminal law on abortion.</para><para>About 10.35am, after an exhausting debate in a sitting lasting nearly 24 hours, the Legislative Assembly voted 31 to 19 to pass the Government-sponsored abortion reform Bill to make abortion legal when a woman gives informed consent.</para><para>For many years I have been a supporter of a woman's right to choose. My name appeared in an advertisement in Tuesday's <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline>  supporting that position. I was not hiding behind any bushel, and I do believe, although I have not checked—the chair of the Senators' Interests Committee will probably be able to check this for me—that I have declared I am a member of an organisation that calls for abortion to be freely available to women who want it. Thanks to the antics of Mr Egan and his organisation, women in Western Australia should now be able to control their own bodies and their own lives in future.</para><para>It has been an exhausting debate for my parliamentary colleagues in the west. As the newspaper says, the debate raged in both houses simultaneously. This debate has gone on at a very intense pitch and pace—perhaps as intense as the euthanasia debate which we were involved in in this place last year. The hours that people have put in have been extremely long. The list of who voted for what in the votes are displayed on the front page, and it is rather surprising to see where the support for the right to choose came from.</para><para>The heartening thing about the overall result, irrespective of whatever moral positions individuals take on this issue—I know there are divergent views—is reflected in the headline of the editorial in today's newspaper which states, `MPs' vote reflects majority will'. It is a real bonus to the electorate of Western Australia that their elected parliamen 
 tarians will take decisions that cross party boundaries and reflect the will of the people.</para><para>It has been indicated in public opinion polls that some 80 per cent of the population of Western Australia support either or both, or a mixture, of the bills that are going through the Western Australian parliament. If that is the case, it is not truly reflective of the vote in the parliament, but it is a darned sight more reflective than the vote in this place on the euthanasia bill, which we debated last year and which was carried. We in this chamber last year did not choose to reflect the will of the people on that issue.</para><para>Before leaving this issue, I want to say a few words about the antics of Mr Egan. I agree with him on one point: his criticism of the former Governor-General—although I do not necessarily share the views and criticisms on that particular issue. It just goes to show that, no matter how different you are, you can always be somewhat the same.</para><para>Some of Mr Egan's supporters call him an Ayatollah, fanatic or zealot. Perhaps now—although I have not done so in the past—I will seek to join them. Truly, some of the antics that these people got up to on this occasion have to be condemned. I am surprised that Archbishop Hickey, the Archbishop of Perth, has not come out and distanced himself from Mr Egan. I had expected Barry Hickey to distance himself after seeing Mr Egan following a group of women through the streets of Perth and abusing them in such a manner that it could have been seen to be physical abuse, not just verbal. Unfortunately, Archbishop Hickey did not do that. His Grace also joined one of the main speakers in the pro-life rally in Perth on Tuesday of last week.</para><para>That reflects poorly on the archbishop. These people had used stolen information about a group of 24 women who had had abortions and they publicised that information. That has been universally condemned. It is alleged that even people who supported the pro-life cause in the state parliament have been influenced by antics such as that. It may have influenced their vote. If so, I am very pleased that that is the case; Mr Egan and his group have served society well by their 
 extremism because they may have given Western Australia the most liberal abortion laws in the country.</para><para>I will mention some of the other things that the group has done apart from the files that they released. On Tuesday—the same time as the advert I spoke of earlier—they published their own front-page advertisement to promote their cause. That advertisement, which I deliberately have not taken a copy of to show to the chamber, included a photograph of the Premier of Western Australia, the Premier's wife and their child. They put that photograph in the newspaper without the permission of the Premier, his wife or his child.</para><para>We have some debates in this place and in the other place about family members of politicians, but I suggest that this is one of the instances where people really do have to look at the ethics of the causes that they promote. I doubt very much that they, or indeed anybody seeking to influence Mr Court, will seek to use his and his family's photograph in this way in the future. We know from statements that Mr Court has made to the newspapers that he, his family and his wife were very upset about the manner in which they used it.</para><para>The other thing that the group did, which again featured by way of an article on the front page of the <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline> newspaper, was supposedly show bloodied tools and gloves which were alleged to have been used in abortions. Again, tactics such as this turned off more people than they switched on to this issue. I do not have a problem with honest debate on things, as was proved in the euthanasia debate, which was quite divisive. I think I represented the majority view in the community. Unfortunately, the parliament, the Senate more properly, did not think the same way. But I do not think that any side of the parliament got down to the graceful and disgusting tactics that Mr Egan and his ilk got down to on this. If they are hurting because of the articles on the front page of the <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline> newspaper today, so be it. I am actually quite pleased that that be the case.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs: Questions on Notice</title><page.no>2024</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>2024</page.no><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator CARR</name><name.id>AW5</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Earlier this week I gave notice of a motion in the Senate concerning the failure of the government in regard to its responses to the Senate's Employment, Education and Training Committee—namely, the failure to respond to questions on notice and the failure to respond to committee reports, committee reports for which I note that, in the normal scheme of things, one could reasonably expect responses within a three-month period. There are three committee reports: <inline font-style="italic">Childhood matters: report on the inquiry into early childhood education</inline> , which was presented in July 1996; <inline font-style="italic">Beyond Cinderella</inline> , presented in April 1997; and <inline font-style="italic">Not a level playing field</inline> , presented in June 1997. I also drew attention to the fact that some 154 questions on notice will have remained unanswered at the appointed day for the return of questions to estimates.</para></talk.start><para>I would like to draw to the Senate's attention this evening that, as of 12.30 p.m. today, some 41 questions still remain unanswered. It strikes me that this is a disappointing response from a department. It strikes me that this reflects a deeper problem within the department. It strikes me that this reflects a deeper problem within government; that is, the failure of the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, who has direct responsibility to this chamber for this portfolio. It reflects however a deeper problem that occurs as a result of this government's approach to education, and I have put the view in previous contributions to the chamber that this government is running down the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs to the point from where it was once a great department of state to its being a shadow of its former self.</para><para>The situation is that some two years ago the department had some 16,000 employees, but I understand from responses to answers given to me by the secretary, and confirmed in one of the answers that was received, that the department levels in the coming financial year will be down to 2,500. So that is from 16,000 to 2,500 in a little over two years: a dramatic 
 decline, I would have thought, in anyone's language.</para><para>On top of that, we have a situation where the department is relying increasingly upon consultancies and what I regard are euphemistically termed service contractors. This difficulty is further reflected in the fact that the department cannot answer questions in the absolute, in the cases that I have mentioned, and, where they do, it is all too often the case that answers are given inaccurately. On simple propositions, for example, you ask a question of the department officials, `Give the figures in real terms,' and they give the answer back to you in out-turn prices. Simple propositions like that are of profound political importance in terms of the measurement of budgetary figures, and this is one example that occurred. But we have a much broader problem as a result of what I see as the gutting of the department itself. The secretary of the department, Mr Sedgwick, on 25 March circulated to all staff a minute entitled `DEETYA Resourcing'. It said:</para><para>When launching the Corporate Plan in December, I noted that</para><para>"The Department will always find ourselves needing to change, refocus, re-engineer and respond to [a] rapidly changing world. We will, therefore, continually look at what we are doing and how we do it. And it will lead to changes from time to time.</para><para>He goes on to point out that the government has provided resourcing that was `"zero based" to reflect the scale of operation required' once the various networks and other functions have closed. He says:</para><para>The time has now come for us to make some adjustments to our operation to reflect our ongoing resourcing and priorities.</para><para>He indicates about the department:</para><para>. . . will employ a little over 2,500 staff in 1998-99. This will require us to release or redeploy approximately 150 people from our current National Office payroll.</para><para>He says:</para><para>I have asked Division Heads to give me preliminary plans on how their Divisions can reach the numbers of positions available and allocated to them in line with our corporate priorities.</para><para>And so it goes. He indicates that:</para><para>The particular process to be followed in giving effect to the necessary reprioritisation of our activities will be determined at local level, in consultation with those affected. As usual, there is a range of options available. Depending on the circumstances, this means some temporary positions will cease, some vacancies will not be filled and some staff will be transferred to other functions.</para><para>He goes on:</para><para>Our aim, however, is to reach decisions on the way forward as quickly as possible so as to minimise uncertainty and dislocation.</para><para>Quite clearly this is desperately needed in this department. It is needed not just for the employees who have to face these very difficult decisions in terms of their personal futures, but it is desperately needed in terms of the people that this department serves: the five million students, the hundreds of thousands of unemployed persons, the various employer bodies, the various TAFE colleges and the various educational institutions of this country.</para><para>I put it to the Senate that this department is not able to fulfil its core functions adequately with this level of resourcing. It strikes me that this is a very serious problem which is reflected in the fact that this parliament can no longer get the service that it has a right to expect from a department on very simple measures like the answering of questions. It corresponds to a government attitude whereby it cannot respond adequately to committee reports.</para><para>But there is a further difficulty in the way in which this government approaches education. The minister earlier this week introduced to the parliament on a non-controversial basis a bill which highlighted matters relating to the indigenous education initiatives. The minister's claim in a press release that he is making per capita funding, under the target outcomes project for indigenous students, available to all students, not just those in larger schools, clearly implies that this was a matter of his own initiative.</para><para>The fact is that the government was forced into this position by the opposition. These were points I clearly made in the debate on this bill this week. Without the ALP's pressure, the government would not have even used the powers provided to it by its own 
 legislation to provide the funding to indigenous students. It would have denied around 1,000 Aboriginal children access to funding which was payable under existing legislation. It was the opposition that forced the government to take this position.</para><para>What we see in the minister's press release is a different proposition being advanced. We do not mind that the bill is called non-controversial; we do not mind the minister now turning around and taking the credit. But we do believe that it is a very cheap trick for this government to seek to milk cheap publicity from what is a very serious issue and from the solution which was found as a result of the political process.</para><para>This is a press release worthy of Dr Kemp. I would have thought that Senator Ellison was a better minister than that. I would have thought that he would not have to rely on the Dr Goebbels techniques that we have seen demonstrated all too often by Dr Kemp.</para><para>Dr Kemp indicated this week that there would be no cuts to education funding this year and that somehow or other more places were being provided by this government than they were under the previous government, implying that there had been no reductions. The minister's higher education budget statement, for instance, says:</para><para>A further reduction of 3 per cent (a cumulative total of 4 per cent) on funding previously announced for 1998 will be a major efficiency dividend sought from this sector.</para><para>We notice from the statements in the estimates that there was a cumulative effect of 21,000 fewer places being provided under this government than previously would have been provided under Labor. This situation is quite contrary to the position that is being advanced by the government. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Abortion</title><page.no>2025</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>2025</page.no><name role="metadata">Herron, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HERRON</name><name.id>VW4</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I wish to speak about what I regard as the saddest day in the history of the Western Australian parliament. I refer to the vote allowing abortion on demand in Western Australia. It will be regarded as the saddest day in Western Australia's history 
 because abortion is the deliberate killing of an unborn child. Regretfully, by that decision, abortion will replace contraception. It is all very well to say that it allows freedom of choice but, regretfully, the killing of an unborn child ultimately becomes an alternative to contraception.</para></talk.start><para>I admire Archbishop Hickey's courage, and I admire the fact that he showed the leadership that he did. I respect Mr Richard Egan for his actions in defending the unborn child.</para><para>One of the sad things about our current history is that each year 80,000 immigrants come to Australia in order to stimulate the economy while at the same time 80,000 Australians who would otherwise be born here are killed before birth by being aborted. Euthanasia and abortion are the same in principle; it is just that they are at opposite ends of the life cycle.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><adjournment><adjournmentinfo><time.stamp>16:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>2027</page.no></adjournmentinfo><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senate adjourned at 4.17 p.m.</inline></para></adjournment></chamber.xscript></hansard>
