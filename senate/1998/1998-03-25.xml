 cious claims. My concern here primarily is that the issue is not about frivolous and malicious claims; it is about the rights of people to seek redress when they have been removed from their employment. It is terribly important that this idea that is being peddled in the minister's second reading speech is absolutely put to rest. The fact is that people are being denied a right of natural justice which this government is seeking to remove through this legislation.</para></talk.start><para>The last thing I wish to look at in the second reading speech of the minister in the other place is this. The minister said:</para><para>It is an unavoidable fact that the defence of an unfair dismissal claim, however groundless, is especially burdensome for small businesses.</para><para>This is a complete nonsense. The fact of life is that these people will be denied a fundamental basic right, a right to seek their job where they have been unfairly dismissed. In relation to the `however groundless', people invariably do not seek to redress their dismissal because it is groundless; it obviously has a substantial meaning to them and for them. The provision that the government is trying to bring in will do nothing other than to encourage employers to abuse the rights of their employees. Far from being groundless, there will be many grounds upon which employees should be able to claim reinstatement but will have it denied because the government seeks to have this legislation passed through this Senate.</para><para>Employees with genuine claims, and there are employees with genuine claims, will be totally disadvantaged by this bill. The fact is—and this was brought out by previous speakers in this debate—that there are very few people who will be covered by the provisions of this bill anyway, because most of the people in small businesses, as has been stated earlier in this debate, are people who are covered by state awards. Very few people are going to be touched in effect by this legislation. Really, this legislation has no purpose other than to provide the government with the trigger for a double dissolution. The legislation should be rejected as it has no moral basis whatsoever. All it seeks to do is to deny people their basic rights.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>1216</page.no><name role="metadata">Collins, Sen Jacinta</name><name role="display">Senator JACINTA COLLINS</name><name.id>GB6</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am pleased to be able to readdress the Workplace Relations Amendment Bill 1997 on the occasion of its second reading to make several further points following from the second reading speech of the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) in the other place. Before I go into the detail of the misrepresentations that have been presented there, I want to revisit the basic points of what this legislation is about. The most fundamental misrepresentation involved here is in relation to a fair go all round.</para></talk.start><para>Senators will recall that champion phrase used by the government in relation to its representation of battler workers, that it was about `a fair go all round'. But a fair go all round does not mean, ultimately, that one-third of all workers—if you follow the government's harmonisation agenda—lose their rights to fair and secure employment. That is the final point of this legislation. As Senator Hogg said, yes it is a political tool at this stage, which really does not affect that significant change at this point in time. But the final end point with harmonisation would mean that the one-third of workers who work for businesses with 15 or fewer employees would lose their rights in relation to unfair dismissal.</para><para>There is no case for this legislation. We argued that point quite strongly on the last occasion and nothing has changed. The government's economic arguments regarding the need for these changes—to generate growth, to drive small business and to drive the economy—have no validity. They have as much validity as the suggestion that the solution to the South Korean economic crisis would be to change their legislation. It does not just exempt businesses with four or fewer employees; it exempts businesses with 15 or fewer employees. That is how much validity this argument has. It has no substance.</para><para>The argument for these changes, ironically, has as much substance as the size of this actual bill. It is about using a political tool for a double dissolution; it is not about a fair go all round for Australian workers.</para><para>The case for this legislation has not been improved in the interim between now and its last presentation. When it was first presented, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry was the only business organisation advocating support, but it was on the ludicrous case that addressed the legacy of the old legislation. Their only argument was that a legacy existed in terms of the attitudes of small business employers with respect to the old legislation, not the government's new legislation that the government went to the last election with.</para><para>Even if you take an extension of that argument, if the argument is that there is a legacy of the old legislation, surely the answer is an education campaign. We should re-educate these small business employers so that they understand the current act, not amend it further on some myth.</para><para>Small business organisations were, at that time, more concerned about the fair trading issues, which, ironically, are due in the Senate later this week.</para><para>Small trading was their concern at that stage. In the meantime, the government has probably belted a few of these organisations across the ears and they have come forward to say what Minister Reith wants them to say. Maybe there was something involved with the fair trading legislation which was finally brought on. Mr Reith cited a couple of the examples that he was able to bring forward in support of this legislation. Let me take one step back. In his second reading speech, Mr Reith said:</para><para>Senators who spoke against this bill said that there was insufficient evidence of the need of the bill, and its benefits.</para><para>He then cited several of the surveys that were addressed in the committee hearings, which were misrepresented by the government, discredited in our hearings and also discredited through the estimates process. They all related to the old legislation, not to the current act.</para><para>We go on to the claims now coming forward from small business who, strangely enough, apart from the ACCI, were not around to present any case during the committee hearings. Mr Rob Bastian, representing the Council of Small Business Organisations of 
 Australia, said that small businesses would create 50,000 jobs if this bill got through the Senate. Well, Minister Reith, that is a very nice statement, but where is the substance? Where is the support for that statement? Where is the proof? This is what we have asked time and time again right through this process: where is the proof?</para><para>We then go to Ms Katie Lahey's statement where she drew attention to the New South Wales chamber's own survey conducted jointly with the St George bank. Again, there is no detail of the basis of this survey. Every time we have asked for detail of the basis of any survey, ultimately it ends up being discredited. We move on to the main statement made by Mr Reith in his second reading speech that:</para><para>To make it all completely clear for the Labor Party and the Democrats in the Senate, the Commonwealth government has commissioned . . . a Yellow Pages Small Business Index survey—</para><para>to ask several questions. In this speech, the minister cited a couple of the outcomes of that survey and said:</para><para>In this survey, 79 per cent of proprietors thought small businesses would be better off if they were exempted from unfair dismissal laws.</para><para>That is almost a bit like asking the question: have you stopped beating your wife? I am sure, if we asked small business whether they thought they would be better off if they could pay under-award wages, they would be pretty happy too.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>8O6</name.id><name role="metadata">O'BRIEN</name><name role="display">Senator O'Brien</name></talker><para>—Or no tax.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>GB6</name.id><name role="metadata">Collins, Sen Jacinta</name><name role="display">Senator JACINTA COLLINS</name></talker><para>—Or no tax—that is a very good point—no payroll tax. They would like that situation. The only problem we have with this survey—and it is a pretty fundamental one—is that we have asked the government, through the estimates process: if his survey is good, then please, can we have a look at the questions that were asked? During the estimates process, questions were put on notice asking precisely those questions. Even though the deadline for questions on notice is past, we still have not seen those answers. So the minister is relying upon this survey. And I cannot say I am surprised, given past experience, that he will not fess up to the basis of that survey be 
 cause, as soon as he does, it will be completely discredited.</para></talk.start></continue><para>So here we are in the Senate dealing with this legislation, and the questions we have asked in estimates pertaining to issues very relevant—in fact, referred to in the minister's second reading speech—are not coming forward to the Senate. I hope, when we finally get those questions, we will not be in the situation where we can say, `We think we have been misled in this process because that information has been withheld.' I hope we do not get to that point, but the basics of the situation are this. The minister has referred to this survey in his second reading speech claiming that it should help deal with our concerns and, when we ask basic questions, such as, `What were the questions asked in that survey,' that information has not been brought forward. Why is that?</para><para>I could be quite cynical and give another example of why that might be the case. In the estimates process, another question was asked—and we did not need to put this one on notice, fortunately. The question was in relation to a press statement made by Minister Reith which said that information that had been brought forward from the Industrial Registrar was good news in relation to the government's intentions with this legislation. It helped to demonstrate its case on the number of small businesses that were affected by unfair dismissal claims.</para><para>When we went back to the basis of that survey and asked precisely what question was asked, we found that the question had been asked in such a way as to be self-selecting. It was self-selecting in the sense that the headline of the question was businesses with 15 or fewer employees. Half of the businesses confronted with that question would have said, `That doesn't apply to me. I won't bother answering it.' This is the quality of the research done when Minister Reith wants to sustain the case for his political tool.</para><para>On our side, we are still waiting for questions to be answered in relation to the Yellow Pages survey. I do not think anybody in this place would be surprised that we are not convinced about what Minister Reith has said in his second reading speech on further 
 evidence supporting his case because it simply is not there—the evidence does not exist.</para><para>The other concern we have with this legislation is the arbitrary nature of only exempting small businesses with 15 or fewer employees. In his second reading speech, Minister Reith said that this size of small businesses was chosen because of the precedent provided by the Employment Protection Act 1982 in New South Wales, which was introduced by the Wran government and followed by the then Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission in the 1984 termination, change and redundancy test case.</para><para>This was addressed by the committee. It was addressed last time we debated this legislation. We drew on the international comparisons—and I think Sri Lanka was the only country anywhere near this sort of benchmark. In fact, as I said earlier, South Korea looks extremely generous in comparison. I would like to refer back to a point made in the Labor members' report on the committee hearings on that issue. We commented on the examples used for this benchmark of 15 or fewer employees. With respect to the examples used, we said:</para><para>The Wran Labor government's employment protection act and the commission's decision on the right to redundancy pay can be clearly distinguished from the present case. In both those instances, new employment rights were being introduced for the first time. The decision was made not to extend them at that time to employees of small businesses (as it has transpired on most occasions, the commission has revisited the redundancy decision. On an industry basis, it has removed the arbitrary exclusion). In contrast, the present case involves an attempt to remove existing rights by reference to an arbitrary measure.</para><para>This legislation is about a mean attempt to remove the existing rights of employees working in small businesses. The week before last, the standing that the Australian government currently has internationally in relation to the Workplace Relations Act was highlighted. Add this one as well and you make us look like an absolute international basket case.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">CAMPBELL</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Campbell</name></talker><para>—Did you say a banana republic?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>GB6</name.id><name role="metadata">Collins, Sen Jacinta</name><name role="display">Senator JACINTA COLLINS</name></talker><para>—No, I said a basket case. Obviously, senators on the 
 other side are very sensitive to that suggestion—and they should be. Anybody who has any understanding of the nature of exemptions and the application of international law knows that exemptions are things that you are meant to move away from over time, not reintroduce. We have no history of introducing exemptions of this nature—none at all. But again, that characterises the current government and its approach to a fair go all round. I do not remember a rider on the promise of a fair go all round that said `except if you happen to work for a business which has 15 or fewer employees'. I do not remember the Prime Minister making that point.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">CAMPBELL</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Campbell</name></talker><para>—It was Neville Wran, not the Prime Minister.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>GB6</name.id><name role="metadata">Collins, Sen Jacinta</name><name role="display">Senator JACINTA COLLINS</name></talker><para>—I was talking about the misrepresentations in Minister Reith's second reading speech.

Given that this piece of legislation has such significance to the government and its political agenda, I invite Senator Campbell to speak to the legislation when it is his turn—and, in fact, I look forward to it.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Moving back to the point about the misrepresentations that have been made, particularly in the debate in the other place, 
 those misrepresentations were that it is okay to remove employees' rights in relation to unfair dismissal because they still have access to rights in relation to unlawful termination. Unfortunately, that supposed protection is a myth. It is a myth because of the sorts of examples that Mr McMullan raised in his speech in the other place. Let me give one example of that in this place. I liked this example most particularly.</para><para>The example was: if you are a pregnant woman and you work for a business with 15 or fewer employees, you are fine because, if you were terminated, that would be discrimination and you would have access to unlawful termination. However, if you were the boss of that pregnant woman and you refused to sack her, you have no protection if you were sacked and that was unfair or unreasonable behaviour because you are the sucker who works for a business with 15 or fewer employees. That example is just absolutely ludicrous, but true and real. Senator Campbell's boss has no idea of the number of those sorts of cases that really do occur.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">CAMPBELL</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Campbell</name></talker><para>—Those 50,000 people would like jobs except for you people.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>GB6</name.id><name role="metadata">Collins, Sen Jacinta</name><name role="display">Senator JACINTA COLLINS</name></talker><para>—Senator Campbell interjects that, if we can sack people under those circumstances, we can create 50,000 jobs.

In my contribution to this debate on the <inline ref="r401">Workplace Relations Amendment Bill 1997 [No. 2]</inline>  I intend to deal with the issue of whether the legislation we have before us presents a fair go all around for every Australian worker. Before I do that there are two other issues I want to raise in the context of this legislation.</para></talk.start><para>The legislation provides that a small business employer who employs fewer than 15 employees as defined in the bill will be exempt from the unfair dismissal laws. In fact, it represents an attempt to exclude employees who are unfairly dismissed from an employer who employs more than 15 employees because, when you include casual employees in the definition of 15 employees in the act, you exclude casuals who have been regularly employed for fewer than 12 months.</para><para>There are many employers in this country with a substantial proportion of their work force who are casual employees who have worked for fewer than 12 months. Certainly in the hospitality industry, which I have some working knowledge of, there would be many employers employing 20, 30 or 40 employees who, because of the definition of `a casual' within this bill, would be excluded for the purposes of unfair dismissal.</para><para>A second very important practical issue that I want to raise is in respect of employers who are covered by federal awards and are also covered by state awards. Of course, the legislation that we have before us will apply in respect of federal legislation; it will not apply in respect of state legislation. There are many workplaces in that situation. We will have an absurd position where some employees in a small business are covered by a federal award cannot seek redress in the event of an unfair dismissal and some employees at the same business covered by a state award 
 can seek redress in the event of an unfair dismissal. That would be an absolute absurdity. I submit to the Senate that that will be a relatively frequent occurrence.</para><para>This bill will establish two sets of employees in this country. If you work for an employer who employs more than 15 employees, as defined, you have a basic set of rights. If you believe that your termination was harsh, unfair or unjust, you have the ability to lay your case before an independent tribunal to determine whether in fact you have been harshly, unfairly or unjustly dealt with. But it will create a second class of employees. Those who work for small businesses, as defined, will have no fundamental right, no matter how harshly they have been dealt with by an employer, to have the facts of their case examined by a tribunal to determine whether they have been harshly, or unfairly or unjustly dealt with.</para><para>This creates two sets of principles in law. It protects employees, or gives them the capacity to be protected, if they work for an employer who employs more than 15 employees, but it removes any effective protection if you are dismissed from the services of an employer who is a small business employer. You have no right in law to have your case considered at all. This is quite an extraordinary approach to human rights as we know them in Australia. I submit that it does not fit the government's definition—certainly not Mr Howard's or Mr Reith's definition—of a fair go all round.</para><para>It is not as though the matter of unfair dismissals has not been considered by the Senate before. In May 1996, the then minister Mr Reith put before the parliament a new set of industrial relations legislation. That was ultimately passed and enacted into law on 31 December 1996. There was major debate in the Senate chamber about that legislation. Significant changes were made with respect to unfair dismissals at that time. Without going into all the details of the significant changes, the definition of fairness was changed. Before awarding a remedy, if any, to an employee, account had to be taken of the ongoing interests of all the parties. There was a rebalancing of the statutory test to 
 ensure that procedural fairness is only one factor when determining whether a dismissal is unfair.</para><para>Secondly, there were separate streams for handling unfair and unlawful dismissals. The power of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to award costs against employees was dramatically increased and was coupled with a compulsory conciliation stage. A $50 filing fee was introduced. The new act, while retaining the expression `harsh, unjust or unreasonable' in relation to unfair dismissals, went on to confine the operation of federal statute to a narrower field.</para><para>When this act was passed at the end of 1996, Mr Reith was triumphant about the changes that were to apply with respect to unfair dismissal. He said at that time that this was a magnificent example. I am not quoting him, but he was triumphant in hallooing the great negotiating skills and the great processes he had gone through to reform Australia's industrial relations laws. I suspect that it also had something to do with the fact that he wants to be a future Prime Minister—we hope, Leader of the Opposition—of this country that he engaged in such dramatic grandstanding at the time. But here we are, a year on, re-examining the very laws that Mr Reith was so triumphant about just over one year ago.</para><para>During this debate, at various times not only Mr Reith but also Senator Alston—who is handling this matter in the Senate—accused Labor senators of having a vested interest because a number of us happen to have been former union officials before we entered politics.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>EU4</name.id><name role="metadata">O'CHEE</name><name role="display">Senator O'Chee</name></talker><para>—Very touchy, aren't you?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name></talker><para>—I am not touchy about it. In fact, I am proud of it Senator O'Chee. I am proud of the occupation I had before I entered this parliament. Labor does not make a habit of belittling the former occupations of members of the parliament. Frankly, I think it is largely irrelevant. I do not choose to draw to the attention of this chamber that there are many members of the Liberal-National Party who are farmers and belittle them because they were farmers and belittle their contribution on primary industry, for example. 
 I think that they bring a level of expertise and knowledge that is worth while having in the contribution to debates in this chamber. So I do not belittle the former occupations of senators in this chamber.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I say again for the record that I am proud to have been a trade union official. Many of my colleagues in this place are former trade union officials—for example, Senator Collins, Senator Conroy and Senator Cook. We are proud of our background and the contribution that we have made with respect to representing workers in this country in our former occupations. It is in this context that I will read to the Senate a list of wrongful dismissal cases that I handled when I was a former trade union official. It is only a summary of a small number of cases that I handled over a number of years which involved wrongful dismissal.</para><para>The cases included: the dismissal of an employee for eating a sweet from a burst packet of sweets—it was spillage, and she was dismissed for theft; the termination of the employment of an employee of long standing because the employer wanted to employ a family friend; the dismissal of an employee whilst on sick leave for quite a serious illness that had been certified by a doctor; the dismissal of a number of regular, longstanding casual employees working as room attendants, some for eight or nine years, with no reason given; the dismissal of a bottle shop attendant, with no reason given—in fact, what was incredible about this case is that the bottle shop attendant read about his termination in the newspaper when he saw his position advertised in the jobs vacant section before he was dismissed; the termination of an employee because she would not have sex with the manager; the dismissal of a club bar steward because a new committee of management was elected and the new president did not like the bar steward so he decided to sack him; the dismissal of a green keeper because he was too old at 58, despite the fact that there were never any complaints made about his work and he was never counselled, guided or warned.</para><para>What do these eight or nine cases that I have personally been involved in have in 
 common? They were all cases that involved a small employer where there were less than 15 employees as defined by this bill. I do not think there would be a senator in this place, including in the government, who would believe that the circumstances of the terminations in the cases I have just referred to were reasonable. Certainly, I do not think there would be a senator who would argue that, given the circumstances of these cases, these employees should have been prevented from having the facts of their case determined by an independent tribunal. In the cases that I have outlined briefly to the Senate, all of these employees were re-employed, because it was found that their termination was harsh, unjust and unreasonable. The fact is that these types of cases could not be considered by a tribunal if the bill that we are considering is passed into law.</para><para>As I said earlier, I speak with great pride about my background and about my involvement in defending workers who by any judgment have been treated harshly, unfairly and unjustly. For the vast majority of workers in this country it is very important that there are some fundamental protections in law in regard to their employment, their wages and conditions, and the way they are dealt with at the workplace. It is important, because that is all they have. They are totally dependent as employees on their employment.</para><para>It seems to me that if we are to uphold the dignity of labour in this country all employees are entitled to a fair go all round. If they believe they have been harshly, unfairly and unjustly dealt with, they do have a fundamental human right to be heard in front of a tribunal and for that tribunal to determine whether, given the facts of the case, they should be reinstated, or perhaps some compensation paid.</para><para>What type of society is it that Australia is evolving into if we endorse the principle that a person, because they work for a small business, can be sacked, dismissed, with no reason given? If they can be dismissed because the employer wants to employ someone else—a friend or relative—if they can be dismissed because they refuse to have sex with the employer, if they can be dismissed 
 because they are too old, if they can be dismissed because they eat a sweet on the job and that is allegedly theft, what type of society is it that will say that those former employees have no fundamental right to put their case before a tribunal?</para><para>I sympathise with the circumstances of small business. There is certainly no-one in the Labor Party who does not sympathise with the difficulties that small business faces. Many small businesses are struggling. It is argued that small business is struggling and the assertion is—and it is an assertion; it is not provable—that in order to encourage employment small businesses should be exempt from the unfair dismissal laws. But this is just an excuse for the failure of this Liberal-National Party government to address many of the fundamental problems that small business faces. Fundamentally, small business is struggling in many sectors not because of the unfair dismissal laws but because they lack consumer demand, they lack customers coming through their shop or buying their goods and services.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">CAMPBELL</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Campbell</name></talker><para>—The best retail sales figures in a decade.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name></talker><para>—Well, come to Tasmania, Senator Campbell.

I submit that this approach is not in the interests of small business.</para><para>I know that the vast majority of small businesses are responsible employers. They do the right thing. They treat their employees fairly and reasonably. But, regrettably, there is a very small number of businesses that do not treat their employees fairly when it comes to termination of employment. Is it reasonable to say to the vast majority of small businesses who do treat their employees fairly and 
 reasonably when it comes to termination that the small minority of small businesses who do not behave responsibly should be excluded from the adjudication of a tribunal which should determine whether or not the employees have been treated unfairly or not?</para><para>As I said earlier, I am proud of having been a trade union official and I am proud of some of the cases that I have defended and the results I achieved. I am proud of the Australian Labor Party for taking a position in opposition to this legislation. It seems to me that this law will strip 2.8 million workers of a fundamental human right, that is, to be allowed to appeal if they believe they have been harshly dealt with and to be allowed to lay the facts of that appeal before an independent tribunal to determine whether they should be reinstated or whether some compensation should be paid. That is a fundamental right of labour in this country and it should not be taken away. It is about time this government, the Liberal-National Party government, stopped using this sort of issue as an excuse for its failure to assist small business in this country. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>1223</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I have not heard anything since the defeat of this legislation in the Senate on the last occasion to convince me to in any way change the vote that I cast on that occasion.

I start my contribution to the debate on the <inline ref="r401">Workplace Relations Amendment Bill 1997 [No. 2]</inline>  by quoting a significant figure in Australian politics. This person, in a speech to the South Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry on 25 October 1995, said:</para></talk.start><para>I'm not going to leave employees exposed to unfair dismissal by capricious employers.</para><para>The same figure, in a speech to a community breakfast in Perth on 11 July 1995, said:</para><para>We're not going to replace (Labor's unfair dismissal laws) with a law that gives ruthless employers carte blanche.</para><para>In a speech on 18 July 1995, the same figure said:</para><para>Let me make a hard and fast commitment that when we win government we will ensure that Australia has a balanced unfair dismissal provision which is fair to both employers and employees. We won't tolerate unreasonable dismissals.</para><para>Who is this figure? This figure is the Prime Minister. Why is this bill before us, given those commitments on the public record by the leader of the government? Because the Prime Minister is weak and the Prime Minister is lacking in leadership and authority.</para><para>This bill is a stunt. The Prime Minister is allowing a stunt to override commitments he made to the electorate before the election and commitments he made after he became Prime Minister. Why do we have that? It was not a core promise. We remember that, whenever the Prime Minister is in trouble, he defines his way out of trouble. He defines whether it was a non-core promise or a core promise. He did not tell the electors before the election that there are such things as core and non-core. But, since the election, to suit his own needs, he has defined things as core and non-core. The poor fool voters did not recognise that, when he made those commitments that he is now expected to honour, they were not core promises and he never intended to do so. This is not only gutless, this is not only a lack of moral authority; this is, of course, dishonest.</para><para>I want to go to the three major reasons this bill is before us. At one level, it is proposed that it will make it easier to sack people and that, because it does, it will therefore somehow improve employment. If it is easier to sack people, apparently more jobs can be created. The government are campaigning around Australia saying, `Look how many jobs we've created.' If they make it easier to sack people and then rotate the unemployed through those jobs, they do not create an extra number of new jobs. They report the number of new starts that were achieved in the economy and say, `Look how many new jobs we've created,' as if they have done something to improve unemployment. Have they? Of course they have not. They have just revolved the unemployed through some jobs, taking advantage of being able to peremptorily dismiss people without them having a reasonable recourse to appeal and a reasonable recourse to their circumstances being fairly reviewed.</para><para>What else has the government done? Very importantly, they have changed the bargaining relationship between a worker and an employer. Remember that Mr Howard, before the last election, also promised that there would be no reduction in working standards. He made a solemn promise on that.</para><para>By enacting this legislation, the government makes it impossible for a person in a small business negotiating a wage with their employer in a one-on-one situation to win because, if that employer does not like the claim, he can dismiss the individual and there is no effective recourse to an independent appeal. Is that fair bargaining?</para><para>How does a junior worker get on in those circumstances? What about a migrant woman? What about an ordinary Australian male? How do they get on in those circumstances when they are asked to choose between accepting the offer that they have to take or losing their job, and they have a family to support? How do they get on in those circumstances? Is this what we now call job creation? Is this what we now call dealing with unemployment?</para><para>The first proposition that this will make it easier to sack people and, therefore, will 
 improve employment is a false proposition and an arid claim. Indeed, my colleagues who have spoken in this debate who have pointed to the government argument that there will be 50,000 new jobs created because of this provision have demonstrated amply that there is no basis in statistics, there is no basis in objective collection of facts, to justify that. The 50,000 new jobs that will allegedly be created is an assertion. It is not underpinned by any statistical work whatsoever. It is a claim, yet it is bandied around as a fact when, in fact, there is no support for it at all. So let us just deal with that first proposition.</para><para>The second false claim here is that it will help small business. The government must have a very low opinion of many employers in small business. I happen to know a lot of small business people who are proud to be good employers. I do not make the automatic assumption that everyone in business wants to exploit their employees. We do not hear about the examples of good employers; we hear about the examples of bad ones. But there are many people in Australia—and I want to go to this in some detail in a moment—who are proud to have good employees, impose trust in them, make sure they are properly trained, encourage observance of occupational health and safety standards and pay them a decent wage and are repaid by loyalty, productivity and the growth of their own enterprises. They know that the best asset their company has is the people who work for it.</para><para>If you downgrade and humiliate those people, you will get a downgraded, low outcome result. The bottom line is your profit will fall. If you encourage, train, protect the health and safety and pay a decent wage, you will get committed employees, proud of their work, satisfied in their job, who contribute to the growth of that company. There are many employers in this nation who know that and do not want this legislation where the lowest common denominator prevails. They know that, if this is carried, they are in the hands of the narrow-minded, exploitative employers.</para><para>For example, you have a good employer on the block and a bad employer on the block competing with each other. One wants to pay decent wages, respect their workers and 
 encourage higher productivity and one wants to exploit them. If this law comes into being, the second employer wins. Because, therefore, wages fall and the cost of his goods fall, the first employer has to follow suit and reduce his work force as well. You have a race to the bottom.</para><para>Is that the country we want for Australia? Is that what a modern society is about? Are they the high living standards that we always talk about, that we aim to achieve—that is, where fear and exploitation rule the workplace, not a fair go, not decency, not an aspiration for higher skills, better quality output and a committed work force? I do not hold the view that the government holds that exploitation should rule. I hold the view that many employers hold that we should have a committed work force. This legislation does not do that.</para><para>The third thing about this legislation which has been said by all of my colleagues in this debate, and rightly, is that this is an outrageous political stunt. It is an outrageous political stunt because this is an attempt to procure a double dissolution, or, as I heard a breathless journalist say the other day, a double disillusion. One could be disillusioned by this government, but they are after a double dissolution.</para><para>So they put an outrageous piece of legislation to the Senate knowing that Senator Harradine, who holds one of the key votes in this chamber—a balance of power vote—is committed to not supporting it. They want his vote on Wik. They know that he cannot in all conscience, in coming to terms with what he understands as decency in the workplace, vote for this. They know he describes it, as he did a minute ago, as unfair, unreasonable and unjust. They know that. So they confront the Senate in order to artificially contrive a constitutional trigger so they can have an early election.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">FAULKNER </name><name role="display">Senator Faulkner</name></talker><para>—A race election.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>RF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name></talker><para>—And a race election, as Senator Faulkner points out, quite rightly. So this is a stunt. This is a contrivance. This is a manipulation of the democratic process in order to achieve that.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I want to say a few words on behalf of the good employers in Australia on what they aspire to, together with the good workers of this nation, and what they want to see. What does small business really want? Small business really wants as its first priority a stronger economy with stronger growth rates. If the economy is strong and growing, unemployment is falling, there are more wage earners than there are unemployed. People have the purchasing power to buy the goods and services produced by small business. There is greater opportunity with growth. That is what they want to see.</para><para>What is the performance of this government? The national accounts for the March quarter came out just three weeks ago. The markets were anticipating a growth rate for the Australian economy of four per cent for the year or four plus. Many of them looked on the bright side and thought it should be four plus. I punted in the privacy of my own office that it would be around four per cent.</para><para>What did the national accounts show? They showed that the growth rate for the year was 3.6 per cent. They surprised the markets. The exchange rate fell on those figures and the stock exchange went down on those figures because they expected something higher. In other words, this government not only underperformed in terms of growth in the economy on its own estimates, but it surprised the market with how poorly it did as well. The true picture is an economy which came out of a recession—it was not a technical recession, but a low growth period imposed by cuts by the government in the 1996-97 budget which reduced domestic demand—and grew and people thought, `Here is the stronger recovery.' Now that it has wilted, now that it has died in the traces, what we are seeing is much lower growth, and the impact of the Asian currency meltdown has not yet hit the Australian economy either.</para><para>Today we have reports that the Australian economy's growth will be cut by one per cent because of the low demand in Asia for our goods and services. If that is one per cent off the 3.6 per cent, we will have a 2.6 per cent growth rate in the Australian economy. If that is what they are talking about, it will mean 
 higher unemployment, a contracting demand, bankruptcies for small business and many more people out of work. Small business wants a growth economy. They do not want to see that economic performance.</para><para>What else does small business want? I will tell you one of the things they do not want. They do not want a GST. Small business does not want to have to be turned into a tax collector for this government. Small business does not want to have to levy a 15 per cent—or whatever the figure is—goods and services tax on every transaction they make.</para><para>The Australian economy, if you look at it, is about a 73 per cent service economy. About 78 per cent of the Australian work force are employed in the services sector. There is no tax on services, so what the government are going to do is introduce a 15 per cent tax on services. That is not there now and they say that, by making it easier to sack people in small business, somehow we will get employment growth.</para><para>What about a 15 per cent tax on goods and services? That will take money out of the pockets of small businesses. That will be an increase in taxes. They do not want it, but the government are going to introduce it and they have announced confidently that this is so-called tax reform. Well, I urge the government to go back to their dictionaries and look at the meaning of `reform'. `Reform' means positive change. A 15 per cent goods and services tax or a goods and services tax at whatever level is not positive change; it is regressive.</para><para>What else do small business want? They want protection from harsh and unconscionable conduct. They want to make sure that the big end of town cannot manipulate the contracts with the small and more vulnerable businesses to diminish their rights and exploit them. That is what they want. Has this government introduced legislation to meet that need? No, it has not. Will it? It says it will, but does it go far enough? No, it does not either. </para><para>The greatest growth area for litigation in Australia at the moment is that litigation that goes on between franchisors and franchisees. Most of the franchisees are small businesses. 
 It is a classic case. Someone holds the central franchise and asks people to bid for it. They strike terms in a contract, then the franchisee can go out and trade under that franchise name. The fastest growth area in the Australian economy, particularly for small business, is from the blossoming of franchisees everywhere. People owe their future to the company store but they find that, whenever there is trouble, under the terms of their contracts, often that trouble is exacted on to them at the bottom of the pile—not on head office, but on the franchisees. That results in litigation, and it is the fastest growing area of commercial court work in Australia and it is growing uncontrolled. It is a big cost, a big surcharge, to impose the high price legal costs on small businesses that way and it ought to be sorted out.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Senator O'Chee interjecting</inline>—</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>RF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name></talker><para>—Kim Beazley has tried to sort it out. He has introduced a private member's bill and we have introduced one here. The government has not moved. Small business is in pain over this and the government's bleating is an indication of its embarrassment on the issue as well.</para></talk.start></continue><para>What else does small business want? Let me tell you. Small business wants a restoration of the incentives for growth that applied under the Labor government and which were cut in the 1996 budget by this government. They want to see—and particularly now with the Asian currency meltdown—a restoration of export market development grant assistance for small business. Because the Asian economic crisis is destroying their markets, they need to be back in Asia to help protect and renegotiate their contracts. They need to be in third markets to develop opportunities for themselves.</para><para>What is the government's response? The government's response in 1996-97 was to cut those incentives so they could not do it. With the present crisis when they need to do it, has the government's response been to restore those incentives to help them achieve it? No. There has been some playing around with the definitions and there has been some alteration of the red tape but, effectively, there has been no real improvement for small business. That 
 is what they want. They do not want this particular law.</para><para>I want to conclude in the few minutes available to me with another thing that I think small business wants as well. They want to know how to succeed. Most small business people I know want to become medium sized business people as quickly as possible and many of them want to become big business people. They want to be able to grow. This government cut the Australian Manufacturing Council, which for small manufacturers was a major source of guidance and advice on what you have to do to become a more effective company. I recall one of the surveys—the leaders and laggers survey—by the Australian Manufacturing Council. It took a snapshot of what a leader, a successful small business, looks like and what were the ingredients that had added to its success for Australia, and it took a snapshot of what a lagger, an unsuccessful small business, looks like and what were the ingredients of its failure.</para><para>This survey is very instructive. The ingredients of success were good industrial relations, high investment and trading, protection for occupational health and safety, and harmonious workplace relations. They have a committed work force. None of those were problems. There problems were getting into new markets, finding opportunities for their goods. The ingredients of the laggers were bad industrial relations, no commitment to training, high staff turnover, and blame shifting—`everyone else is at fault, not me'.</para><para>In short, leaders, successful companies, are outward looking and have formed their work force into a team, not into confrontation but into cooperation. Laggers are those who want this legislation and they are the failures. This legislation speaks to those companies that want to blame others because they do not succeed. They want to blame their workers because they could not lead an effective workplace team to grow their profits. This legislation should fail with them.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>1227</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I join my colleagues in opposing this legislation.

I read that report with a very great deal of interest. They said that the legislation was very seriously flawed. They also pointed out that opposition to the measures in this bill could be grouped into effectively three major arguments. It is worth repeating them. Firstly, this exemption is an explicit breach of the government's pre-election commitments. Secondly, this exemption is totally unnecessary. Thirdly, this exemption is unfair. We stand behind those arguments.</para><para>But I think we ought to also acknowledge that this legislation amends the Howard government's own unfair dismissal laws, the government's own much touted, much vaunted Workplace Relations Act. It extensively amended the unfair dismissal laws, which 
 came into effect in January of last year. Who could forget the debates that took place in this chamber around those issues, so ably led by Senator Sherry and so many other opposition senators who participated in the debate at that time?</para><para>The Prime Minister and his Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, Mr Reith, boast that their new system of unfair dismissal laws provide for `a simpler, more balanced system that provides a fair go all round'. There is nothing fair about this exemption. It is an exemption that discriminates against employees who work for a small business employer with fewer than 15 employees. If Mr Howard and Mr Reith believe that their own unfair dismissal laws are so simple and balanced to provide a fair go all round, why do they have to seek this exemption for small business?</para><para>We have heard the justification, the naive insistence, that this will boost employment by removing apparent disincentives for small business to hire new staff. But, as Senator Cook pointed out, there is absolutely no tangible evidence to support that assertion—none at all. This does not have any justification beyond what is the government's ideological obsession, which we have highlighted over the two years since this government came to office, to dismantle the rights of Australian workers.</para><para>It is worth recalling the recent Morgan and Banks job survey that revealed that 80 per cent of small business employers did not believe that the existence of the unfair dismissal laws affected their decisions to employ staff. Only 16 per cent of small business employers believed they would benefit from the exemption that this legislation provides. I have to say that those figures were also consistent for all other sizes of business.</para><para>We have heard about the claim that this government is committed to reducing the burden of red tape on small business.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">SHERRY</name><name role="display">Senator Sherry</name></talker><para>—GST.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name></talker><para>—Exactly.

 absolutely kidding himself if he thinks that this legislation will solve the problems and relieve the burdens of small business.

We do not know what corner it is around, and we do not quite know when we will get around the corner to see what the government has in mind because they are keeping it under wraps. But we know what that will mean for each and every small business in Australia.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I think the government would perhaps be a little better served paying heed to a recent Yellow Pages Small Business Index showing that just five per cent of small businesses are concerned about industrial laws. But that same survey showed that 84 per cent of small business are far more concerned about this government's lack of action in getting the economy moving.</para><para>The point has to be made in this debate that this bill is yet another betrayal of the electorate by the government. This is yet another betrayal by the coalition of the Australian people. They have, of course, had a very good record, I think we would all have to acknowledge, of breaking the promises they made to the Australian people in the last election.

That was never said by anyone at any time. They did not say, `If you work for a small business, you do not have a right of appeal.' That was never said by this duplicitous government. What John Howard did say in the good old days when he was Leader of the Opposition was:</para><para>I'm not going to have a law where an unreasonable employer can capriciously sack a decent, hardworking employee.</para><para>That is what he said. He then went on to one of his headland speeches. Who could forget those headland speeches? He said:</para><para>Let me make a hard and fast commitment that when we win government we will ensure that Australia has a balanced unfair dismissal provision which is fair to both employers and employees. We won't tolerate unreasonable dismissals.</para><para>On 20 February 1996, the now Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, Mr Reith, said that the redrafted system of unfair dismissals would not contain any exemptions. I remind the Senate that he also said, on 28 February, `Look,'—you have always got to worry when he starts his sentences with `Look,' and `our position is very clear'. We have always got to focus, when Mr Reith says, `Look, our position is very clear.' But that is how he started his contribution on 28 February. He said:</para><para>Look, our position is very clear. If you have been unfairly dealt with at work, then you should have a right of appeal.</para><para>Nowhere did either of them—Mr Howard or Mr Reith—say to anyone, `There is a major qualifier here. You can have all that, unless your employer employs less than 15 people.' That was never said by either of them, or anyone else from the government, at any time. It is just another example of broken commitment and broken word to Australian workers.</para><para>The measures that are proposed by this legislation go to the very core of the lives of all working Australians and their families. There is a very strong link between a worker's role in the workforce and the quality of life that is enjoyed by a worker's family and children. John Howard promised to provide security and certainty to families. Yet this is legislation that does an enormous amount to dismantle the security of employment that Australian workers hope to enjoy. Of course, security of employment—something that the government does not seem to understand—is fundamental to the security that workers have as a family.</para><para>We say, look, this is not something that John Howard ought to be messing with. And we say it is an absolute disgrace that he has asked this parliament to do so. This parliament has made a decision about this legislation. It was the right decision. The Senate has expressed its view to the government and properly rejected the legislation. You have got to ask yourself—why are we revisiting it? Why has it come back to the Senate? Because the government does want this ideologically-conceived bill to be a double dissolution trigger.</para><para>We say that this legislation is also about the government's election agenda. This is just part of the government pursuing a desire to have a double dissolution election focused on the Wik issue, focused on race. This legislation, along, perhaps, with the Public Service bills, helps to provide a smokescreen for that race election agenda by providing perhaps one or two other triggers for the election. As with the native title legislation and the Public Service bills, the government is not interested in negotiation, it is not interested in compromise; what it wants is confrontation, what it wants is a double dissolution.</para><para>Let me say very clearly on behalf of the opposition, we do not want an election on this bill. We do not want it. We do not even want to mask the government's race election agenda. But we are left with absolutely no choice. We are implacably opposed to the measures contained within this bill. We do not and we cannot support legislation which allows people to be sacked, even if that 
 dismissal is harsh, unreasonable and unjust. We cannot support legislation which takes away the right of appeal and the right to job security and certainty.</para><para>Our position on this matter remains unchanged. We will go right to the wire on this legislation. And I urge the Senate to stand by the view it has earlier expressed on this legislation and reject this unconscionable bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>1230</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to speak on Cheryl Kernot's law. Clearly it is something that she regarded as a triumph, and that is why she supported it in the first instance.</para></talk.start><para>But I want to make some preliminary remarks. I am sure none of us in this chamber will forget Greg Louganis—not only was he a gold medallist but he also inspired the former Prime Minister, Mr Keating, to actually boast about triple backflips with pike. The Labor Party in government had a notorious record for reneging on solemn commitments whenever it suited their political purposes.</para><para>We do not have to simply refer to the occasion on which Greg Louganis was invoked, we have to remember not just the solemn promises, but the legislation actually passed through this parliament which misled millions of Australian voters into thinking they were going to get additional tax cuts, because they were l-a-w, law—ripped up as soon as Labor got back into power. We had all the promises on Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank, about not selling down any further or not selling at all. As soon as they won the next election, they immediately ripped up those promises. So I would have to concede that Labor has an outstanding track record on reneging whenever it suits their political purposes.</para><para>During the life of this government, Labor has also done some amazing backflips. One only has to remember the work for the dole legislation and, indeed, the charter of budget honesty. We had Senator Faulkner fulminating about the evils of work for the dole. He thundered and he postured and he jumped up and down and he wanted to move a whole raft of amendments because these were such odious and unacceptable provisions. But, of 
 course, what did they do? They rolled over. They were arguably much more significant pieces of legislation than this current piece, important though this is.</para><para>Why is it that Labor will not roll over on this bill? Why are they prepared to go to the wire and face the prospect of a double dissolution on it? Quite simply because they have a massive and irreconcilable conflict of interest, because this chamber on that side is a wholly owned subsidiary of the trade union movement. They have said, `No, you are not allowed under any circumstances to support this legislation.' About two-thirds of those on the other side, including Senator Mackay, have very strong trade union backgrounds and have come here out of the sheltered workshop because they could never get a job in the real world.</para><para>I should remind the chamber that Senator Lundy is a classic example. She recently addressed a seminar in this building and solemnly explained that she did not understand the procedures of the parliament because, after all, she came from a private sector background. It really took my breath away to think that dyed-in-the-wool trade unionists now regard themselves as private sector individuals.

It has been a fairly topical issue in Australia in the last four or five years, and probably derives from similar discussions and concerns in a number of Western European countries 
 and particularly in the United States over recent years.</para></talk.start><para>It derives from concerns that developed in the late 1980s and early 1990s which arose primarily from decisions made in the United States in the early years of the Reagan government which legislated for massive tax cuts, with continued outlays growing at significant rates. That resulted, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, in huge budget deficits in that country. It was suggested that, in due course, the budget deficits that arose, and which were forecast to go on if the then budget prescriptions had continued, would imperil the welfare, health and social security systems of that country.</para><para>One of the results that emerged from discussions in the United States in the early 1990s was the balanced budget bill, which was passed by both houses of the US Congress. That bill required the Congress to legislate for balanced budgets by the end of this decade. They have achieved that, not particularly as a result of that balanced budget bill, but because of growth in the US economy.</para><para>Australia has picked up on a variation of that debate and it is apparent in the title of this Charter of Budget Honesty Bill. A number of issues arise from the presentation of the bill to the parliament which are worthy of discussion. I seek to place the views of the Australian Labor Party firmly on the public record. The issues of concern to us are, firstly, the lack of commitment to the real intent of this bill by the current government; secondly, the government's performance to date in relation to the spirit of the legislation behind the bill; thirdly, transparency; and, fourthly, compliance and interpretation when the bill becomes law.</para><para>From the outset, I would like to place on record my support for the bill which has at its core the intent to ensure that there is transparent honesty in fiscal reporting by governments in this country. Such transparency is essential through all stages of the electoral cycle, and the spirit of the bill, as its title suggests, attempts to address this outcome. Unfortu 
 nately, the spirit of the bill has not seen justice in the drafting by the government.</para><para>That brings me to my first point: the lack of commitment by this government to the real intent of the bill. That intent, as the government has suggested for many years now, is integrity. There has been much discussion by coalition members of both chambers on the virtues of the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill. It has been heralded by the Prime Minister, Treasurer and government backbenchers as one of the great savers and enforcers of fiscal rectitude in the history of federation.</para><para>Government members have talked ad nauseam about the importance of such a bill and the impact it will have on governments in the future. From the outset, I must say that I understand the need of this government to sing such high praise for this initiative. It is almost as though, if they keep talking about the charter of budget honesty long enough, the electorate may forget the blatant dishonesty that has characterised the budgets of this government to date. Unfortunately for the government, however, neither the community nor the Labor Party will forget the budget dishonesty exercised by this government.</para><para>However, the opposition also believes that this bill presented to us by the government does little more than make nice noises about honesty, rather than drafting legislation that would actually play a role in enforcing some standards of decency and honesty in budget reporting. The problems with this bill are paralleled by the hypocrisy of the government. When this government was in opposition it made a commitment to budget honesty, while making a range of other promises.</para><para>Those promises included: to maintain funding levels for the ABC; to make no changes to the operational subsidy of the community based long day care sector; not to introduce health policies which would entail funding cuts to public hospitals; to maintain expenditure on labour market programs; to maintain all concessions for older Australians; to continue support for research and development; to maintain regional development funding of over $150 million over four years; to give a fixed share of Commonwealth revenue to the states and territories; not to 
 increase taxes or to introduce new taxes; and to maintain funding levels for Australian universities.</para><para>What has happened to the promises made by the coalition, remembering that they were part of the package that promised the charter of budget honesty? I am sad to report that all of the above-mentioned promises have been broken in one form or another. The ABC has had its budget cut by $209 million over four years. Operational subsidies for community based long day care were abolished, costing families in the order of an extra $14 per week. The health budget was severely cut, with widespread reductions in public hospital funding, totalling approximately $800 million.</para><para>Labour market programs were cut by $1.8 billion over four years. Concessions for the elderly were cut, with the most notable being the dental care scheme. Research and development concessions were reduced and syndication was abolished. The regional development program was abolished. Fiscal grants to the states and territories were cut by $1.5 billion over three years, and specific purpose grants were cut by three per cent per annum. New taxes have been introduced on superannuation, and the Medicare levy has increased for those without private health insurance. Operating grants for universities have been reduced by over $600 million over the four-year period.</para><para>The government's response to the intent and spirit of the legislation is not the only issue. One of the fundamental problems with this bill and with the government's attitude is the lack of transparency. The Howard government provides significantly less information in its budget papers than the previous Labor governments. In the 1996 budget papers, the government excluded information detailing specific purpose grants to the states and territories, thus denying the states information necessary for the preparation of their budgets over time. After pressure from the opposition, the government agreed to publish those figures in the 1997 budget papers.</para><para>Additionally, the government removed from the budget papers international comparisons that were common under previous Labor budget regimes. These international compari 
 sons play an important role in the comparative analysis of the Australian economy. By excluding these comparisons, the government was trying to avoid that detailed comparative analysis.</para><para>Finally, in respect of budget paper presentation, is the treatment of asset sales. The Labor Party was constantly accused by the coalition of fiddling the budget papers through asset sales. This was untrue as the Labor government always disclosed underlying as well as headline results. The coalition in government, though, has included asset sales, including property sales, only in its underlying budget bottom line, even though it attacked Labor for a similar practice.</para><para>With the coalition's broken promises in mind and its hesitancy in ensuring transparency of budget papers, claims of budget honesty appear not to ring overly true with this government. To justify these broken promises, the coalition introduced the classification of core and non-core promises. It would appear that this classification of core and non-core promises overrides the necessity for budget honesty as far as this government is concerned.</para><para>The introduction of the non-core promises fiasco and the blatant disregard for pre-election promises by the government highlight another key problem with the bill before the chamber—that is, transparency and compliance. If the government is serious about the need for budget honesty, then it ought to consider a range of options that would improve the process and make budget forecasting more transparent.</para><para>Firstly, the government should allow full scrutiny of the bill. Appropriately, this would require the legislation to be examined by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit. Such an examination is recommended by the committee for all fiscal reporting mechanisms. This is an idea opposed by the government in the House of Representatives, but imposed upon it by the Senate. However, the time allowed for such examination was very restrictive. The chair of the joint committee himself made this point, `Even without committee examination, there are a number of apparent problems.'</para><para>Accountability is a significant issue. It has been widely recognised that this bill provides less accountability than that recommended by the National Commission of Audit, the government established body. The primary recommendation of the commission was that economic forecasts concerning pre-election reports, the budget and the mid-year economic review should be the responsibility of, and at the discretion of, economic bureaucrats instead of the Treasurer.</para><para>The government has rejected this recommendation of its own commission and has decided instead to allow bureaucratic discretion for only pre-election forecasts. New Zealand, which is a country that this government likes to model itself on in terms of economic reform, requires bureaucratic certification of economic forecasts at all stages. It is apparently okay for that country but not for the government of this country to adopt.</para><para>I would now like to turn to some comments regarding the fourth area of significant concern, which is compliance. Essentially, the government has drafted legislation that does little to ensure compliance. The bill is really a set of motherhood statements. The government has failed to draft legislation that ensures—or, indeed, even encourages—any degree of budget honesty. Why has the government failed to address this issue of compliance? Because at the end of the day it is not serious about the charter of budget honesty. The government has no intention of enforcing standards of decency and compliance. With its record we can see why it has avoided this compliance issue. This is the key problem with the bill. It is meaningless without compliance provisions.</para><para>I return to the comments made by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit. The financial committee stated:</para><para>. . . the Committee does not see a need to formulate binding statutory principles of fiscal responsibility. In any case, such fiscal principles would be so imprecise and so wide open to interpretation that there seems little point prescribing them in legislation. </para><para>The Committee is also wary of the idea that there are enduring fiscal principles. 
</para><para>Of course, the committee is referring to the type of motherhood statements espoused by this government. For example, part 3 of the bill talks about managing financial risks prudently, achieving a reasonable degree of stability and predicability in the level of tax burden, and achieving adequate national savings. All of these points are worthy of support. The problem, however, is that all of them can be interpreted differently by varying governments. With the problem of interpretation we are brought back to the issue of compliance. On what basis is compliance enforced and what is the impact of no enforcement?</para><para>If we need an example of compliance problems, we need look no further than the performance of this current government. Principle (d) of the bill requires the government to maintain the integrity of the taxation system. Yet the first test of their commitment to the integrity of the tax system has resulted in failure by this government. I refer to their refusal to cut back on tax avoidance, particularly in the area of family trusts. The first chance this Treasurer got to show his commitment to the charter, he broke one of the fundamental principles and, as we know, there is nothing that can be done about it because there are no compliance provisions.</para><para>In the House of Representatives question time on 11 March the Treasurer was asked to comment on the opposition's view that the charter is unenforceable. Mr Costello responded:</para><para>It is a completely binding law of the country. Once it is enacted it binds our government, Mr Beazley or any future government to come clean to the Australian people.</para><para>However, section 3(2) of the bill states:</para><para>Nothing in the Charter of Budget Honesty creates rights or duties that are enforceable in judicial or other proceedings.</para><para>When the Labor Party proposed to delete this section from the bill, the government used its numbers and opposed such a measure.</para><para>This is not the only failure of the government in regard to this charter, however. As I have already mentioned, the legislation espouses the commitment to achieving adequate national savings. We have been told time and 
 time again by this government that fundamental to its budget strategy is the need to boost national savings. Yet when it comes to scrutiny of this commitment, as is the role of parliament, the government refuses to provide savings projections. The same issue arises when it comes to unemployment. The Treasurer continues to refuse to provide employment forecasts from the mid-term review beyond the immediate year. Clearly, the government has no commitment to transparency in budget preparation.</para><para>The final significant problem with this piece of legislation is the government's lack of understanding of the real role of government. This matter shows itself to us in the principles of sound fiscal management. These principles, as drafted by the government, illustrate a commitment to government and budget formulation that is not appropriate. These principles are an accountant's view of the way in which government should be managed. There is no commitment within these principles to the role of government as policy maker. There is no real thought given to the government's role in solving problems such as unemployment, education and health care. In this regard, the document is an accounting tool and little else.</para><para>The notion of a charter of budget honesty is one worthy of support. The spirit of the legislation is clear. However, the weaknesses in the legislation are also blatantly apparent. One can immediately recognise the spirit of the legislation and directly ignore that spirit, as this government has done, as there are no consequences for such action. If the government were sincere about a charter of budget honesty, they would accept a detailed review and examination of this legislation by the joint committee. They would take advice in a bipartisan manner to ensure that transparency in fiscal policy and management were unquestionable.</para><para>Instead, they have presented this chamber with a piece of legislation that is highly cynical, largely ineffectual and potentially irrelevant. They have dishonoured their election promise through the shallowness of this bill. However, as I have said, the notion of budget honesty is indeed worthy of sup 
 port. We should all aim for greater transparency within government and, importantly, through the parliament. For this reason, the Labor Party is supporting the bill, even with the acknowledgment of its many flaws. The best outcome for decision making transparency would be for this to be recognised as the first step towards honest fiscal reporting.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>1236</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—As the Senate knows, the Democrats were strong supporters of the introduction of the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill and did indeed commend the government for introducing it, but believed that it was a weak bill in a number of respects and needed reinforcement and strengthening. We still feel that way.</para></talk.start><para>By insisting on the amendments last time, we believe the Senate showed our disapproval of a government that will not accept improved legislation—amendments which, in our opinion, considerably improved the bill. However, we have been advised by Labor that they are going to let this bill through this time, so there is obviously no point in further pursuing amendments to the bill. Despite the fact that it seems we will have at least one double dissolution bill whatever happens—and one more will not make any difference—in my view it would be foolish to put to a double dissolution a bill we support in terms of the fundamentals. Even in its unamended form, this is a bill better passed before the election than after, since it does contribute to a better policy costing and appraisal for elections.</para><para>The thrust of our amendments the first time around was that we focused on the fact that the act was unenforceable; it was not binding on the Crown. I pricked up my ears when Senator Bishop said Labor had been pursuing that same issue. I checked the amendments in the last debate—in October, I think it was—and it was in fact the Democrats who moved to make the bill enforceable. Labor quite correctly supported it, and subsequently moved that same amendment, I believe in the House of Representatives, when it came through the second time, and felt very strongly about it. I think Labor coined a rather nice phrase for it when they referred to it as the optional honesty bill.</para><para>If there is anything which is a great sadness to the Australian Democrats, it is that the government should allow a bill which stands on accountability, which has honesty in its title, really not to enforce that dictum. Clause 3(2) of the bill states that the charter of budget honesty is not judicially enforceable and the charter is therefore much like a code of conduct which does not have any enforcement procedures or penalties, a situation which clearly is unsatisfactory. There is no penalty should a party fail to fulfil its pre-election reports and costings or its commitments. The only sanction currently available for when a government ignores the need to comply with the provisions of the charter of budget honesty does rest with the parliament, and that is an unsatisfactory situation given that the government of the day will have a majority in the parliament.</para><para>As Senator Bishop outlined, in contrast, the New Zealand Fiscal Responsibility Act 1994 is binding on the Crown. This means that if the New Zealand government does not comply with the requirements in the act, any citizen has standing to initiate an action in the courts. What we and Labor and the other non-government parties in the Senate felt strongly was that this government should be obliged to face up to its responsibilities with an enforceable act. In our view, such enforceability would demonstrate a serious rather than an optional commitment to the provision of information and the accountability of the government to the electorate. We were disappointed not to see it in the legislation before us. The remedy of enforcement where there is a failure to act is denied Australian citizens, in contrast to New Zealand citizens in their act, and it effectively provides a shield of immunity to any claim on public interest grounds preventing the disclosure of information. This limits the effectiveness of the charter as a mechanism to improve scrutiny, transparency and fiscal responsibility.</para><para>So, Minister, on the one hand, this bill is proclaimed to be an important contribution to the government's accountability efforts and we agree with that claim. On the other hand, the government cannot be held accountable to the provisions in this legislation, and we 
 strongly disagree with that. I was so startled by the very concept that there could be a bill which could be valid when it did not provide for enforceable rights or duties that I put a Senate question on notice to the Minister representing the Treasurer on 30 October 1997. I asked:</para><para>(1) Is the Minister aware of any Act which has been passed by the Federal Parliament which does not provide for any enforceable rights or duties; if so, which Acts are they.</para><para>This was the answer; listen carefully:</para><para>There are a number of Commonwealth Acts which impose duties on a statutory body, but provide that such duties are not enforceable in judicial proceedings. Some examples are:</para><para>. the <inline font-style="italic">Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Act 1986;</inline></para><para>. the <inline font-style="italic">Federal Airports Corporation Act 1986;</inline></para><para>. the <inline font-style="italic">Special Broadcasting Service Act 1991;</inline></para><para>. the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983</inline></para><para>I surmise from that answer that there are no acts relevant to the operation of government, as opposed to a statutory body, which are not enforceable. So this is a first-time, appalling precedent, one which we do not agree with.</para><para>The Australian Government Solicitor's Office advised in an answer to that same question as follows:</para><para>The fact that the Bill is not enforceable in judicial or other proceedings does not affect its validity.</para><para>I am not a High Court judge and I am certainly not a Solicitor-General so I am not going to quarrel with that, but it does not do away with the principle. The Treasurer, with his wonderful ability to spin lines, can never get over the fact that this is an optional honesty bill, that this bill is not enforceable. We commend the Treasurer for the bill, but it is an optional honesty bill.</para><para>Other amendments we focused on the first time around included the fact that the act provided for costings only for the Liberal and Labor parties. I am often surprised in this parliament when the word `bipartisan' is used. I would have thought that they could at least use `tripartisan', because the National Party are part of the major scene. As for the rest of the cross-benchers, we prefer `multipartisan' or `cross-party'. The fact is that even the National Party are excluded from the costings 
 of this bill. That struck us as extraordinary. We tried to fix it up for them, but they as the junior partner were not able to help themselves on this issue. Anyway, it is another amendment that went through which the government refuses to accept.</para><para>We also focused on the fact that in appraising the effects of taxes and spending proposals, the social effects on future generations were insufficiently covered and the principles of ecologically sustainable development were not covered. In a country where, in the last 15 or 16 years, salinity has increased something like 18 times and is forecast to reach 12 million hectares, I would think that a focus on ecologically sustainable development makes very sound economic environmental and social sense.</para><para>We also focused on the costing of election commitments and various matters to do with that. We focused on an issue which we have been running hard on for nearly 20 years now in a number of parliaments in the country, and that is truth in political advertising—to try to get some honesty in that area. And we focused on the nature of modelling processes used in economic and social forecasting. However, the government in its wisdom is not going to accept any of those solutions.</para><para> If we are not going to push through those amendments this time, let us focus on why this bill is necessary. In the 1982 budget, an election budget, the then Treasurer, Mr Howard, forecast a surplus of $230 million which blew out to a deficit of $4,473 million. The post-election revelation of the budget deterioration allowed the new Labor government then to junk virtually all their election promises. It sounds familiar, doesn't it? Since then, that practice has become pretty much a recurring picture.</para><para>Again, in 1992, Labor's then Prime Minister, Paul Keating, produced his infamous One Nation forecast which claimed that the deficit would repair itself. On the back of this, he and Dr Hewson went into the 1993 election campaign with what we regarded as outlandish and unfunded tax cut promises. The Democrats said at the time that the tax cuts were not funded and were not fiscally responsible, but the coalition joined with 
 Labor to vote in the $4 billion of tax cuts which they both knew were not funded. Three years later, the coalition were busy gloating over the Beazley black hole, but if they had voted with the Democrats to stop an unfunded $4 billion in tax cuts, there would not have been a Beazley black hole, just a minor Beazley blemish.</para><para>Over the last four years, fiscal reporting continued to be a very political process. The 1995 budget included the claimed headline surplus of $718 million. The real picture was an underlying deficit of $7.2 billion. Again, the coalition joined with Labor to defeat the Democrats' proposal to set up a Senate inquiry into the matter. It suited the coalition at that time, in our view, to rely on Labor's ridiculously rosy economic forecasts which Labor was using to build up unaffordable election promises of $7 billion. So with the change of government, again, the new government were able to junk most of their election promises, their so-called non-core promises, after a shock-horror revelation about the black hole which our parliamentary records showed they helped create. </para><para>If this charter of budget honesty bill is in fact going to stop that kind of malarky between the two parties contending for power in this country, I think—and my party thinks—it is to be very warmly welcomed. The Democrats congratulate the government on recognising this as a problem, on recognising that there is a public perception problem out there, on recognising that a much improved budget presentation process, a much improved and transparent process, will advance the cause of more accountable and better government.</para><para>In concluding, Minister, whilst I say that we are disappointed that the bill remains weak and optional we are nevertheless delighted that the bill will move into legislation, because it does at least advance the cause of accountability in a number of important directions. I move:</para><para>At the end of the motion, add ", but the Senate:</para><para>(a)	 calls on the Government, at the earliest opportunity and preferably before the next or the following Federal election, to follow the lead set by New Zealand's Fiscal Responsibility Act and replace the optional and weak nature of the unenforceable Charter of 
 Budget Honesty with a Charter that binds the Crown in right of the Commonwealth and creates rights and duties that are enforceable in judicial or other proceedings; and</para><para>(b)	 is of the view that access to the bureaucracy to provide costings of policies should be extended to the nominated representative of any party which is registered under the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918</inline>  or which has at least one representative in the Parliament; and</para><para>(c)	 urges the Government to include consideration of the social and environmental effects of its policies on future generations, as well as the financial effects, in its principles of sound fiscal management and in intergenerational reports.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>1239</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The key issues for the Greens (WA) in relation to this boomerang bill, the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill 1996 [No. 2], are the government's commitment or lack thereof to the democratic process and the inherent dishonesty of a bill which basically claims to be a bill about honesty; a bill which gives a narrow and misleading account of fiscal policy which does not include social or environmental accounts.</para></talk.start><para>The government's commitment to the democratic process is, we believe, highly questionable. The government seems to have no respect for the Senate as an institution or the legitimate role in the democratic process that the Senate plays. In that sense, it is tending to echo the last few years of the Keating government: contempt for the democratic process. We are moving, I believe, more and more to three-year elected dictatorships, judging from the kinds of statements that have been made in relation to the Constitutional Convention.</para><para>But let us get back to the process in relation to the charter of budget honesty—or dishonesty, depending on which side you take. The first point I want to make is that the government has returned this bill to the Senate without considering the range of amendments put forward. I did not agree with all the amendments, but that was the Senate's decision in relation to those 10 amendments which were passed.</para><para>A double dissolution is only intended for a situation where a hostile Senate fails to pass bills that render the government unable to govern. It is custom to provide the Governor-General with advice as to whether the parliament has become unworkable. It would, in the opinion of the Greens (WA), be preposterous to argue that this is the case with the charter of budget honesty. These are the reasons we believe so. The bill is not justiciable or enforceable in any manner, thus failure to pass the bill cannot affect the ability of the government to govern.</para><para>The legislation is unnecessary to achieve its immediate purpose. What is to be achieved under the bill can be achieved administratively through existing executive discretions for the life of the present parliament. Regulations are not required to allow the government to provide the electorate with the sort of information that the bill seeks to guarantee. How can anybody say that the passing of amendments to this bill would make Australia ungovernable?</para><para>The second point I want to make is in relation to a point I made in my speech during the second reading stage when we previously debated this matter: whether or not under the trade descriptions act there might be a problem with the naming of this bill. We believe the bill promotes a narrow and misleading account of fiscal policy. This is, in fact, a charter of budget dishonesty, as it does not give the full picture. Rather, it gives a narrow view of what the national accounts are and a narrow view of what the economy consists of and the implications for the economy in the future.</para><para>Budgets are not about economics in the restricted sense; they are about public policy and people. These days, this mostly seems to be forgotten. All decisions on revenue tax and spending are about politics and how to make and direct choices. The use of fiscal accountability implies that fiscal benchmarks are the most important or, perhaps, the only relevant criteria for judging policy. This implies certain values. It pre-empts discussion and forces conclusions in certain directions. It fails to take into account, for example, environmental and social accounts, indexes on 
 equity, employment, greenhouse gas production and so on, and fails to give a complete picture of what is happening in the wider economy. This is in contrast to the momentum established internationally against such narrow economic accountability. There has been much talk overseas about widening the accounts basis by integrating environmental and economic accounting and social impacts. Australia is going in the wrong direction.</para><para>I find the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill a problem, as it suggests that the government presents budget information honestly. In other words, it suggests that the information presented to the Australian public concerning what is important now and in the future is honest whereas, in reality, they are presenting only one side of the picture and a very narrow view of life, valued in monetary terms, in the present.</para><para>The reductionist nature of this bill is, of course, problematic to us. It has the potential to be used as part of the growing view towards fiscal restraint which is used as an excuse to further reduce revenue from those who cannot afford it and to devalue legitimate concerns in the community.</para><para>The views of the Greens (WA) have been made very clear in this respect. We believe that many people—and Senator Murray has expressed the views of the Democrats—see this bill as weak. I see it as less than weak; I see it as going in the wrong direction, according to the principles of ecological and social sustainability.</para><para>My views on the bill have not changed, but the way the government has dealt with this bill and the way the Senate has responded to this bill are, in my view, despicable.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>1240</page.no><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGAURAN</name><name.id>WH4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak ever so briefly to support the government's charter of budget honesty.

Straight after the election, we found out the 
 dishonesty and the cover-up that occurred. The previous government went into the election campaign claiming that there was in fact a balanced budget. Not only that, the legacy of the debt that was left, I believe, is worse and harder to overcome than the deficit itself. The debt figure left for this government was well over $100 billion. To put that in perspective, ironically, when Mr Keating was first elected as Prime Minister, the Commonwealth debt was $30 billion—quite manageable. But, within four years of the Keating prime ministership, it blew out to $100 billion plus. That is a harder figure to pull back, Senator Quirke, than the $10.3 billion deficit, which we have done.</para></talk.start></continue><para>We are now working on that major debt left to this government. We are doing it through asset sales particularly. This government's asset sales will be dedicated to reducing the Commonwealth debt. We believe that the two-thirds sale of Telstra will bring in some $40 billion, which will go towards reducing the Commonwealth debt to under the $50 billion mark. That is a responsible attitude towards privatising our national assets or our national carriers like Telstra.</para><para>It is not just the Telstra sale that we will be dedicating to the reduction of this government's debt. The airport sales of over $4 billion must go towards reducing the heavy debt burden that this government was left. There are the sales of AN rail and ANL, Australia's shipping line. Commonwealth offices and property to the tune of billions of dollars will also be put on the market. There will be other such asset sales like Dasfleet. They will all responsibly go towards the reduction of Commonwealth debt.</para><para>The point is that, when the opposition was in government, it chose to privatise in the most tortured way possible. For example, Qantas was on the budget four times to be sold and dishonestly used to reduce the government deficit of the day, yet it was not sold until the fourth occasion. Also, in relation to the sale of the Commonwealth Bank, those opposite went to the people in a dishonest fashion and said that they would not privatise it, and they did—unlike us. They got a very good price for it too. The Australian 
 taxpayers got their first taste of shareholding a former government asset, like they did with Telstra.</para><para>What did you do with those funds? You did not use it to reduce debt at all. You frittered it away on the current expenditure. It was completely frittered away. Where did the billions of dollars received from the sale of the Commonwealth Bank go? It was completely wasted on the budget because we still ended up with a $10.3 billion deficit.</para><para>The point of the legislation before us today, the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill, is that that sort of dishonesty can no longer occur. We are locking you in now, should you ever have the opportunity to return to government—and perhaps in the decades to come that will be possible; the wheel always turns in politics, as we know. We are now locking a future Labor government and ourselves into responsible, transparent fiscal reporting. No longer can we set up budget surpluses for you to come in and fritter away on the taxpayers. We will come back into government, as a result of the slow turning of the wheel of politics, and have to rein in the expenditure again.</para><para>Now it is going to be open for judgment by financial reporters and by the taxpayers. The books will be open to show exactly the government's financial situation. The underlying budget deficit or surplus can no longer be hidden from public scrutiny, as it was during the Hawke and Keating years. You never really reported correctly what your budget deficit was. You tried to constantly cover it up through asset sales. There is now going to be a separation of asset sales and proceeds from the underlying budget figure.</para><para>In order to reach that situation of accurate government reporting, the charter of budget honesty will establish a framework within which formal reports will be made. Along with the release of each year's budget, a report will be required that states the government's economic and fiscal projection for both the budget year concerned and three years ahead. These projections will indicate the expected consequences of the proposed fiscal system. Midway through each financial year, another report will update the process of 
 the fiscal and economic projections that were set out in the budget. Within three months of the conclusion of the financial year, a report will be issued detailing the fiscal outcomes of that year. Further, every five years, a report will be made outlining the long-term sustainability of the current fiscal policies.</para><para>This bill ensures that the secretaries to both Treasury and the Department of Finance and Administration prepare a pre-election report providing an up-to-the-minute assessment of the government's fiscal policy. What could be more transparent? What greater scrutiny could be put on a government—and which we are putting on ourselves—than that form of reporting to the parliament and to the people?</para><para>There will also be a provision for more equal access to Treasury and Finance costings of election commitments. That should make for a very interesting exercise in the upcoming election, because we heard from Senator Kemp yesterday during question time that the shadow minister for health, Mr Lee, has already committed the opposition to a $6 billion health budget, while at the same time the former finance minister and current Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, has committed the opposition to a balanced budget. This is the man who left us with a $10.3 billion budget deficit, but now he has changed on the road to Damascus and he is going to produce three years of balanced budgets if he ever gets the opportunity.</para><para>The pull on that is that Mr Ferguson, in the other House, does not believe in surplus budgets. He and his left wing  colleagues will be coming to Mr Beazley saying, `We don't believe in balanced budgets.' So you can see the pull and the tug from the Labor Party but, under this legislation, they will be committed to costing their election commitments under the scrutiny of Treasury and Finance. So will our side, but we can deliver because we have delivered a balanced budget already and we are reducing the burden of the government debt.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">SHERRY</name><name role="display">Senator Sherry</name></talker><para>—It has gone up.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGAURAN</name></talker><para>—No, it has not.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">SHERRY</name><name role="display">Senator Sherry</name></talker><para>—Total Australian debt has gone up in the last year.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Calvert)</name></talker><para>—Order!

We moved in this place to put in a provision that the charter of budget honesty be enforceable, and what you are proposing to do by what you are doing now is to remove that provision. You removed it in the House when the bill went back. The bill has now come back here and you want to take that provision out.</para><para>So let us deal with this cant, this hypocrisy, that this bill will in fact do anything. This is an optional charter of budget honesty. There is nothing compulsory about this. If we wanted to enforce this legislation on the government, should it become law, no court in the land will be able to adjudicate on it because the government does not want them to do so and they are using their numbers to crush that possibility. So let us just get them little apples out there in the clear. This is optional. This is not real. This is a stunt. If it were not a stunt, you would make it compulsory. What have you got to hide? Why won't you do that? You prefer the stunt of course.</para><para>Can I just say this: we are very disappointed that the government has taken the view it has. This bill was brought to this chamber some months back. This chamber, which is not a chamber dominated by the Labor Party, constructively amended this bill. We put through 10 amendments. The bill went back to the House and the government refused all of them. When I say this is not a chamber dominated by the Labor Party, I mean that the balance of power here is held by Senator Harradine, the Greens and the Democrats. All of us agreed that these changes would improve the bill. The government does not want 
 to accept any of those changes. Who is being intransigent here? Isn't there a middle ground? Couldn't some of them have merit at least? Wouldn't it be a useful thing, for example, to make this compulsory, to give it a standing in law so that it could be enforced? What does it mean if it cannot be enforced? A sham is what it means. But, no, none of those proposals that this Senate put are acceptable and the government is confronting the Senate and accusing the Senate of causing obstruction if the bill is not carried.</para><para>The second great lie about this legislation is that the Labor Party does not support it. We have supported this legislation in the House and we have supported it here. What we have tried to do, however, is improve it and make it workable—change it from a stunt to something of substance. That is what we have tried to do. Of course the government does not want to hear any of that. It is my intention at the conclusion of my remarks to move an amendment to the second reading, which has been circulated in the chamber.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Calvert)</name></talker><para>—Senator Cook, you will be foreshadowing an amendment because we already have an amendment moved by Senator Murray.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>RF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name></talker><para>—If that is the right form, then I foreshadow an amendment. I have seen Senator Murray's amendment, by the way, and I will support that. The Labor Party will support the Australian Democrats on their amendment and I do anticipate they will support us on ours. However, I want to go to the detail of the amendment I intend to move because it does put this whole debate into context.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The first part of it is that the charter of budget honesty should be legally binding on governments and not be optional. I have dealt with that in my lead off remarks. This is a sham. This is a fraud. The title `charter of budget honesty' can note something good is happening but if it is not enforceable then you can drive a coach and four through it and it does not matter. This is in the realm of core and non-core promises. We heard from the Prime Minister after the election that he made two types of promises. Only one type would 
 be kept—they were core promises. The non-core promises would not be kept. But he never differentiated between them at the time of the election, so Australian electors did not know.</para><para>This charter of budget honesty sounds cute, addresses some important principles I have to say, but unless it is enforceable then it has no real meaning. The first point of my amendment is to make it enforceable. The second part of my amendment is to include, among the stated principles of what constitutes sound fiscal management, commitments to achieve full employment in Australia. That should be something that a charter of budget honesty should examine, and it should examine the overall economic prosperity and welfare of the people of Australia and the maintenance or improvement of the real value of wages and conditions and the welfare of workers.</para><para>Anyone listening to this debate who is familiar with the legislation governing the Reserve Bank of Australia knows that those principles are enshrined in the legislation of the Reserve Bank. The Reserve Bank, which fixes the interest rate level effectively in Australia, is governed by those values. Why can't we put in this bill those exact same values so that when parties make promises at election time those promises can be costed against the achievement of full employment and the overall economic prosperity and welfare of the people of Australia and the maintenance or improvement of the real value of wages and conditions and the welfare of workers? Isn't that reasonable? The Reserve Bank must do it. Why can't the political parties be made to measure up by those standards? The government does not want them to. We do. The government does not want that to be in their charter of budget honesty.</para><para>The next provision in my amendment seeks to include in the required budget economic and fiscal outlook report an estimate of the net effect of the budget on public saving, private saving and national saving and an independent report by the Commissioner of Taxation and the secretary to Treasury on material threats to the tax base, the size of the fiscal threats and the specific means necessary 
 to counter these threats. Let me take those two ideas together.</para><para>The biggest problem this nation has is generating a level of national savings, that is, a pool of money owned by Australians, that can be used to invest in the development of this nation. Australia is a net borrower in the world. We do not finance all of our own development. We borrow from overseas to do so. A prime economic goal ought to be to build up a level of national savings so that we can finance our own development and we are not in hock to foreigners.</para><para>One of the biggest advantages of Labor's great reform on superannuation is that it established a massive pool of national savings which will build up over years in order that Australians can own the farm and buy back the farm. That is something on common ground among most economists in Australia. When we ask the political parties to declare their promises, why can't they say what those promises will do about building up a level of national savings, both private savings and public savings, so that Australia can look forward to a time in which it can finance its own development?</para><para>The second part of this provision is about tax. This is a major debate in Australia. Threats to the tax base—that is, areas of massive avoidance or evasion of taxes—means that governments increase taxes to compensate for the loss or, if they do not do that, they reduce the services provided by the government to the community, usually important services. We have seen in the last week the stand off between the Prime Minister and the premiers over health. The argument is that the government does not have enough money to provide Australians with a decent health system. The Labor Party will not cop that argument, but that is what the government's argument is.</para><para>If the tax base is haemorrhaging because there is massive avoidance, why can't we know about that at election time? Which way is it haemorrhaging? What is the nature of those threats and what can be done about it?</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3L6</name.id><name role="metadata">CONROY</name><name role="display">Senator Conroy</name></talker><para>—Family trusts.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>RF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name></talker><para>—There are two issues of considerable importance immediately. One of them has been mentioned by my colleague Senator Conroy—family trusts. It has been on the news this morning. We know that 19 members of the front bench of the government, 19 ministers, have family trusts, and the purpose of trusts is to minimise the amount of tax you pay. For every dollar a rich person saves on tax a poor person pays it.

You stonewalled it and then you brought back a pallid version of that bill. What the tax commissioner tells us is that the amount of resort to family trusts is getting to epidemic proportions and there is a real threat to revenue, that the number of family trusts is growing faster than the number of private companies in Australia. And here is a chance for people who have the income, who can consult the tax accountants and smart lawyers, to arrange their affairs so that they get under the tax-free threshold and not pay tax.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Why can't we know about that in your charter of budget honesty, Minister? Why won't you allow that to see the light of day? Let me cite another example of a threat to the revenue—salary repackaging. This is where wealthy people say, `My salary is worth $150,000 a year, but I won't take it as money. Give me a car; put my kids in a private school; give me admission to all these private clubs; give me services in kind which I would like to buy, and reduce the amount of cash in hand I get so that I am down the scale and I pay less tax.' That is, you rearrange it with sharp accountants.</para><para>Most wage and salary earners in Australia have their tax taken out of their wages every week, or every fortnight, or every month—whichever is the interval of payment for them. They cannot avoid that. So why should the salary repackaging, where people can avoid tax, be allowed? Why can't we honestly see, in this so-called charter of budget honesty, what the effect to the revenue base is of smart 
 manoeuvres that minimise the tax payable by wealthy people in Australia? Why can't we see that, and why won't your government allow that to be in there? Because what you are proposing is to prevent it from being in there. That is exactly what this bill deals with. I have dealt with those three matters, Mr Acting Deputy President.</para><para>Let me go to point (d) of the amendment:</para><para>require the Government to improve the transparency of its fiscal reporting by publishing each month a consolidated list of Budget-significant decisions announced in the previous month, quantifying the effect of those decisions over the full forward estimates period</para><para>What does this mean? When the budget comes out, the government says, `This is the amount of surplus that there will be in the budget. These are the expenditures that we'll outlay funds against, and that's how it is.' Then, as the year rolls by, they make little extra payments here and little grants there and so forth, which alter the bottom line. So what you hear on budget night is one version of the truth; what you see at the end of the budgetary period is what actually happened, and the difference usually is the amount of change that went on through the year.</para><para>But these things do not often go to the macrostructure of the budget. The government will not admit that its expenditure levels are increasing and it will not say what the causes of those increases are. The effects on the macro-outcomes usually are different. We want these rules applied to us; they should be applied to you as well. All we are saying is: when you do something that changes the bottom line on the budget, then declare it, and do so on a monthly basis. No change? Fine. Some change? Well, let's see what it is so that we know what the macroparameters of this budget are. To shift your funds around otherwise is to present a distorted picture to the community and, importantly in this context, to the money markets as well.</para><para>Point (e) of the amendment says:</para><para>require inter-generational fiscal reporting to occur at least every three years rather than five years;</para><para>Intergenerational fiscal reporting is where we borrow in the future against the costs of today.

Truly, by that measure, that is saying something. Let me make it clear to people who are listening to this debate that you would not believe, from Senator Cook's speech, that he is actually supporting the <inline ref="r425">Charter of Budget Honesty Bill 1996 [No. 2]</inline> . Admittedly, the Labor Party had to do a mighty backflip on this issue and, admittedly, they had to change their minds about it. But this bill has come back to the Senate and, despite what people may think, from what the Labor Party people have been saying in this chamber, their leader, Mr Beazley, has indicated that the Labor Party will be supporting it.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The reason they are supporting this bill is that they know that out there in the public there is very strong support for a charter of budget honesty bill, and they understand the reasons why this has been brought in. As Senator Cook is still in the chamber—he is about to leave—I point out to him that one of the reasons is, of course, a result of the behaviour of Senator Cook and his colleagues, who were former ministers in the Keating government. In, I think, November 1995 Senator Cook made one of his many famous quotes in this chamber when he forecast that the budget was in surplus and would continue in surplus. Of course, in less polite society and in a less august chamber there is a word for the type of comment that Senator Cook made, but I will say that what Senator Cook said was untrue, and it was proved to be untrue.</para><para>When we were looking through the pious amendments that Senator Cook is seeking to move, my colleague Senator Ian Campbell quite rightly got very upset at the hypocrisy, as he saw it, in all the amendments and particularly in amendment (g), which reads:</para><para>(g) prohibit the Treasurer from interfering in the production of the pre-election economic and fiscal outlook report, except for providing requested information;</para><para>Those who can cast their minds back to the last election will remember Mr Beazley, the current leader of the Labor Party, giving assurances to the public that the budget was in surplus. He was unable to give us the latest figures, but he gave us those assurances. However, two days after the election, on the Monday, the Treasury was able to inform the incoming government of a massive black hole that had been left by the Labor Party. That was the $10.3 billion black hole which the fiscal mismanagement of the Keating-Beazley government had created. That was the genesis of the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill.</para><para>We said that no government should be allowed to pull the stunt—a disgraceful, dishonest stunt—that was pulled by the Keating-Beazley government prior to the last election, pretending that their budget was in surplus when in fact the budget was in massive deficit. As a consequence, we indicated that there would be a charter of budget honesty bill which would do quite a number of things but, among other things, it would make it very clear what the fiscal position of the country is before an election.</para><para>So there has been very wide support for this bill. We welcome the comments by Senator Murray, who has qualifications. We do not agree with him on those qualifications. But Senator Murray of the Democrats indicated in his remarks that he saw this as a very big step forward, and he is dead right in that respect. That is precisely what this is.</para><para>As I said, this is a very important bill. It is a bill widely welcomed by the public. It is a bill which was promised by the Howard government in the pre-election phase and it will now be passed by the Senate within, hopefully, a comparatively short period of time, largely as a result of the fact that the Labor Party has backed down on their amendments.</para><para>Senator Cook made it very clear in his remarks that he was a bit concerned about tax avoidance, as indeed we all are. But, of course, one of the reasons why there has been 
 concern about tax avoidance was the very lax administration of the previous Keating government and the holes that it left in tax law. I was amused to hear Senator Cook indicate that he was particularly concerned about certain measures on tax avoidance. If we hark back, we will remember that it was Senator Cook himself who, when we tried to close major tax loopholes like the R&amp;D syndicates, led the attack and encouraged the Labor Party to vote against what the coalition was doing. If Senator Cook had had his way, a major hole would have been left within the tax law of this country on syndicates.</para><para>Then Senator Cook was concerned about whether the wealthy were paying their fair share of tax. We well remember the campaign led by Senator Cook and Senator Nick Sherry to try to prevent the superannuation surcharge from being passed by this Senate. It was a very inglorious period for the Labor Party, out of a lot of self-interest on their part it has to be said, in their campaign to prevent the surcharge from coming in. So for the Labor Party to get up and pretend that they are serious about closing loopholes in the tax system when we review their record in government and out of government is a gross hypocrisy.</para><para>The Charter of Budget Honesty Bill is a major structural reform in the way this country presents and runs its fiscal policy. As I said, the bill fulfils an election promise made by this government to make sure that the Australian accounts are presented in a fair and honest manner and to enshrine in legislation a requirement which will govern this government and any future government as to the way in which they present and improve their fiscal performance. No government will be able to do the sort of gross cheating that the Labor Party got up to before the last election and which was exposed within 48 hours of the Howard government coming to office. This kind of reform will be a permanent feature in making sure that Australian economic policies run better, in making sure that the public is kept better informed and in making sure that there is transparency in the economic policy of this country.</para><para>This is the same bill that was introduced into the House of Representatives on 11 December 1996 and passed by the House of Representatives on 10 February 1997. On 28 October 1997, the Senate passed the bill with 10 amendments. These amendments were unnecessary and made aspects of the bill unworkable. I will not go through the arguments on those amendments, but let me make it clear that those people who are interested in this debate should refer to those earlier copies of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> to see the pathetic way the Labor Party attempted to deal with this bill. As on a number of other issues, such as work for the dole, we have seen a very inglorious backflip as their hypocrisy has been exposed. Make no mistake: the Labor Party's intention was to make this bill unworkable. They knew the government could not and would not accept the amendments they moved. As a result of the government's determination and as a result of public support, the Labor Party has had to back down.</para><para>The bill will reform fiscal policy formulation through introducing principles for sound management of fiscal policy against which governments must develop their fiscal strategy. These principles will focus attention on a range of issues that must be addressed if fiscal policy is to be sustainable over time. The charter of budget honesty will also ensure that up-to-date information is available so that the government's performance can be assessed against its fiscal objectives. To achieve this, the bill establishes a formal reporting structure. With each year's budget, a report will be released setting out the economic and fiscal projections for the budget year and three forward years. These projections will illustrate the consequences of the adopted fiscal strategy.</para><para>A further report released midway through the financial year will update the fiscal and economic projections contained in the budget report.

The Australian parliament has a long history of acknowledging allegations of human rights violations in Tibet. This parliament has called on China to respond constructively to discussions with Tibet's spiritual and temporal leader, the Dalai Lama, and to address the issue of allegations of human rights abuse in Tibet.</para></talk.start><para>I stand here today in recognition that we live in a country in which our rights as individuals are recognised and respected. I stand in recognition that as Australians we have a duty to assist people elsewhere to receive similar recognition of their rights and dignity, and to assist people elsewhere in the exercise of their right to self-determination. For many years, I have watched the oppression of the Tibetan people and the suppression of their culture. I have watched as democracies around the world have passed and implemented significant initiatives in support of the people of Tibet. I am proud to publicly support that movement in championing the Tibetan people, their culture, their language and their identity.</para><para>One of the most influential bodies which has been involved in and concerned by developments in Tibet for nearly four decades is the much respected International Commission of Jurists. The commission is made up of 45 leading judges and lawyers from around the world. In 1959, the International Commission of Jurists published a report called <inline font-style="italic">The question of Tibet and the rule of law</inline>. This report examined Chinese policy in Tibet, violations of human rights in that country and the position of Tibet in international law. The report found that:</para><para>. . . almost all the rights which together allow the full and legitimate expression of human personality appear to be denied to the Tibetans . . . on the basis of the available evidence it would seem difficult to recall a case in which ruthless suppres 
 sion of man's essential dignity has been more systematically and efficiently carried out.</para><para>In the following years, the ICJ published further reports detailing evidence relating to genocide in Tibet and finding that acts of genocide had been committed in Tibet in an attempt to destroy the Tibetans as a religious group. The ICJ also found widespread violations of numerous civil and political, as well as economic and social, rights.</para><para>The United Nations, like many individual countries, also expressed concern during those years about the continued ill-treatment of the Tibetan people. The UN called many times for China to ensure respect for the fundamental human rights of the Tibetan people and for their distinctive cultural and religious life. In 1961, the UN General Assembly called on China to cease `practices which deprive the Tibetan people of their fundamental human rights and freedoms including their right to self-determination'. This call was repeated again in 1965. Yet the situation of the Tibetan people deteriorated further.</para><para>During the Cultural Revolution in China, every aspect of Tibetan culture came under attack. By 1976, Tibet's cultural and religious heritage was decimated, as were almost all of its thousands of monasteries. Hundreds of thousands of Tibetans had been killed. More recently, the Sub-Commission on the Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities of the UN Commission on Human Rights expressed concern at `the continuing reports of violations of fundamental human rights and freedoms which threaten the distinct cultural, religious and national identity of the Tibetan people'.</para><para>In response in 1991, the International Commission of Jurists decided to conduct an up-to-date study of the situation of the rule of law and human rights in Tibet. The report <inline font-style="italic">Tibet: Human rights and the rule of law</inline>, published last December, is a result of that study. It notes the intensification of repression in Tibet since 1996, focusing particularly on the re-education drive in the monasteries, arrests of leading religious figures and the ban on photographs of the Dalai Lama. It also examines increasing threats to aspects of Tibetan identity and culture through colonis 
 ation, the erosion of the Tibetan language and the degradation of Tibet's environment.</para><para>The report describes the Tibetan people as a people under alien subjugation, entitled under international law to the right of self-determination. Many policies erode, or threaten to erode, the distinctive elements of Tibetan identity and culture. These are outlined in the report of the ICJ. They include the fact that systematic population transfer from China to Tibet has ensured that Chinese people now account for approximately one-third of the total population of all areas with Tibetan autonomous status. Tibetans have become a minority in their own land.</para><para>The report also noted the undermining of Tibet's cultural heritage through the destruction of over 6,000 Tibetan monasteries, the restriction of cultural activities and the blatant assimilation policy, as well as the erosion of the Tibetan language—an issue intricately bound with identity, communication and education. Chinese language dominates education—an issue to which I shall return—and it dominates commerce and administration. In so doing it marginalises Tibetan as a language and the Tibetans as a people. Finally, the report also noted the environmental degradation and the resource exploitation which have destroyed most of Tibet's wildlife and seen much of its forests cut, hills eroded and the threat of flooding magnified. As a direct consequence, the long-term viability of Tibetan civilisation is threatened.</para><para>Education—obviously a key factor in the propagation of a people's culture and identity—is also severely restricted. The United Nations Covenant on the Rights of the Child, of which China is a signatory, safeguards the right of a child to education, the development of the child's cultural identity, language and values, the minority rights of culture, religion and language, and the right not to be subjected to torture or other cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment.</para><para>However, in direct contravention of this, some recent evidence suggests that many Tibetan children receive no education and the Tibetan language is being phased out of schooling and students are forbidden to worship the Dalai Lama, to visit a temple, to 
 eat Tibetan food or to read material written in Tibetan. I note that there are many Australian school children in the gallery today. I ask how we would feel if they were forbidden to eat Australian food or to talk in English. Children are further promised money to report their parents if they talk about subjects relating to Tibetan culture, history or religion—obviously very divisive—and children often suffer brutal punishment in schools.</para><para>Not only will Tibet's unique and special culture die if its children are not taught about it but the current system also prevents Tibetan children attaining a sufficient standard of education to participate fully in their community. This also decreases their chances of employment. Tibet's very survival is threatened. These are merely the policies which are subsuming Tibetan culture and identity, not the abhorrent breaches of political and religious rights perpetrated in Tibet and which have been well documented for over nearly 40 years.</para><para>In 1948 Australia was one of the first members of the United Nations to vote for the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Since that time it has been a party to several declarations and conventions which reinforce that declaration. One of the most important of these is the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. This covenant stipulates that people have a right to, among other things: their own language and religion; participation in public affairs; freedom of expression and opinion; freedom from arbitrary arrest, detention or exile; freedom of association and assembly; a fair trial and equal treatment with others under the law; freedom from cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment; and life, liberty and the security of person.</para><para>These rights, which we as Australians recognise and take for granted, are denied to the Tibetan people by a totalitarian regime. In particular: those in detention, as documented by groups like the Australia Tibet Council and Amnesty International, are often subject to torture and ill treatment; the death penalty may be imposed without due process or fair trial; restrictions on freedom of speech are rife and re-education is even monitored by neigh 
 bourhood committees; freedom of religion has been inhibited by the destruction of monasteries, subjugation of monastic orders and the severe curtailing of religious teaching; the forced sterilisation of thousands of Tibetan women, the forced abortions and the imposition of fines ensure that Tibetan families are restricted to having only one child; since 1949, 1.2 million Tibetans have been killed; and the Tibetan people are clearly unable to exercise their entitlement under international law to self-determination.</para><para>The history of human rights in Tibet is disgraceful. I stand here, as others have stood before me, to highlight the situation in Tibet and to call for the reaffirmation that human rights are both universal and indivisible. The Tibetan people are entitled to a constructive engagement on the issue of human rights in their country, a restoration of an atmosphere of trust and reconciliation between their leader in exile, the Dalai Lama, and the People's Republic of China, and the right of religious freedom and the release of all political and religious prisoners of conscience in Tibet. Together we must work towards a common goal—a goal that human rights abuses are eradicated around the world and that individual's rights are protected. The Tibetan people have suffered brutal treatment in their own country. Their human rights must be upheld.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Minister for Resources and Energy </title><page.no>1253</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>1253</page.no><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name><name.id>RF4</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Today I wish to speak on how Senator Parer, the millionaire coal minister, turned a 44c investment in QCMM(ESP) Pty Ltd into a golden nest egg of $56,300 in the space of a couple of years. Many people may ask: how was this possible? How does one turn 44c into $56,300 in a couple of years when it can take a lifetime of work for ordinary Australians to save enough through their superannuation to have a semblance of a decent retirement income?</para></talk.start><para>When it comes to Senator Parer, though, all you need is some slick Sydney accountants, some wealthy Queensland mates and lots of money. Combine this with an abject abuse of the taxation system and you can, as Senator 
 Parer has, turn 44c into a magical $56,300. Just as a point of comparison, it would take the ordinary person, if you assume a compound rate of 10 per cent, just over 120 years to turn 44c into Senator Parer's $56,300.</para><para>We know this is just an impossibility, but not if you are a millionaire coal minister. So how did Senator Parer manage to achieve such spectacular gains? What contribution did Senator Parer make to the management and running of QCMM(ESP) Pty Ltd that added such amazing value to his 44c one cent shares he holds in QCMM(ESP) Pty Ltd? The answer is nothing other than some paper and money shuffling between companies that Senator Parer held shares in.</para><para>Senator Parer first struck the big time in April 1994. It was during this month that Senator Parer first had allocated to him 12 one cent employee class shares in QCMM(ESP) Pty Ltd. Along with six other supposed employees of QCMM(ESP) Pty Ltd a total of 1,000 employee class shares were allocated for a total outlay of just $10 or one cent per share. On the very same day, each of the holders of these 1,000 one cent shares had their respective employee contribution accounts credited with $1,000 for every one cent share held. Hence Senator Parer, for just a 12c investment, on the very same day became entitled to $12,000.</para><para>That is not a bad lurk one would say and one Senator Parer was happy to engage in along with his wealthy mates. But it gets better. We know that since that magic day in April 1994 Senator Parer received a further 32 one cent shares to give him a total of 44 one cent shares now worth $56,300. We also know that contributions to QCMM(ESP) Pty Ltd ceased in 1995, according to Senator Parer's own statement.</para><para>In the space of just over a year a 44c investment in QCMM(ESP) Pty Ltd became worth $56,300. Not a bad return some may say. It would be if it were not for the fact that it was a tax rort. Senator Parer quite happily rorted the tax system and used it to enrich himself. Why? Because he could.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>EU4</name.id><name role="metadata">O'CHEE</name><name role="display">Senator O'Chee</name></talker><para>—Mr Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order.

Why did he engage in tax manipulation to enrich himself? Because he could. It is obvious that his $2 million worth of coal shares, which he conveniently forgot to disclose, were simply not enough, he wanted more. How best to achieve this but bring together some wealthy mates and manipulate the tax system. In for a penny in for a pound, as you would say.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Let us have a look at how this complex tax manipulation works. In order to qualify for employee shares in QCMM(ESP) Pty Ltd one would assume that you must be some type of employee. As Senator Parer said himself, ESP stands for employee share plan and not extra sensory perception. Although, it is obvious that Senator Parer had the powers of ESP as he was able to foresee how much his 44c investment would soon be worth.</para><para>What we have here is the moonlighting Senator Parer masquerading as some type of bona fide employee of QCMM(ESP) Pty Ltd in order to qualify for the company's very generous employee share plan. In fact, Senator Parer was a director of QCMM(ESP) Pty Ltd and the employee share plan was an exclusive  club for him and six other directors. How else does a $10 investment entitle them to a $1 million payout on the same day?</para><para>Let us not forget that this was just the first of many allocations because as we know Senator Parer has 44 one cent shares in QCMM(ESP) Pty Ltd. This still leaves the question of how the $1 million in QCMM(ESP) Pty Ltd became available to the owners of the 1,000 employee class shares who had invested just $10, of which Senator Parer invested just 12c? This is where the manipulation really comes in.</para><para>If we look at the latest ASC return for QCMM(ESP) Pty Ltd we see that it has 
 issued a total of 3,683 UNC employer class shares at $1 each but that it has a balance in its share premium account of just on $2.7 million. This means the owners of the 3,683 UNC employer class shares paid a premium for these shares of $2.7 million. This is very significant because it is this $2.7 million that forms the asset base of QCMM(ESP) Pty Ltd in which Senator Parer has a $56,300 interest based on his 44c investment in QCMM(ESP) Pty Ltd.</para><para>It is important then to look at the owners of these 3,683 UNC employer class shares. A quick look at the annual return of that company reveals that Advance Queensland Resources and Mining Pty Ltd owns 2,350, QCMM Pty Ltd owns 570 and Tremell Pty Ltd owns 763. As we also know, Advance Queensland Resources is a fully owned subsidiary of QCMM Pty Ltd and that Tremell in turn is 51 per cent owned by QCMM Pty Ltd.</para><para>What we see here is a nice little cosy arrangement between Senator Parer and his web of companies that has given life to this nice little tax manipulation. The best part of that is that the $2.7 million sitting in the share premium account of QCMM(ESP) Pty Ltd was in fact a tax deduction for all of the companies involved. We know that on that magic day in April 1994 when Senator Parer turned 12c into $12,000 Advance Queensland Resources and Mining Pty Ltd paid QCMM(ESP) Pty Ltd $1 million for 1,000 UNC employer class shares. This was comprised of $1 for each of the employer class shares accompanied by a $999 premium per share thus giving QCMM(ESP) Pty Ltd its capital base of $1 million.</para><para>The beauty of it was that this $1 million was fully tax deductible to Advance Queensland Resources and Mining Pty Ltd, which is fully owned by QCMM Pty Ltd. In fact, the entire share premium balance in the accounts of QCMM(ESP) Pty Ltd of $2.7 million was fully deductible to the owners of the 3,683 UNC employer class shares. At the centre of this tax web is the $2 million man and the minister for coal, Senator Parer. All the companies that perpetuated this tax manipulation—QCMM Pty Ltd, Advance Queensland 
 Resources and Mining Pty Ltd and Tremell Pty Ltd, through the purchase of 3,683 UNC employer class shares in QCMM(ESP) Pty Ltd at a total cost of $2.7 million—did so under the guidance and instruction of Senator Parer and his wealthy mates.</para><para>Who was the director of QCMM(ESP) Pty Ltd when 1,000 employee shares worth $10 on the same day became worth $1 million? It was Senator Parer. Who was the director of Advance Queensland Resources and Mining Pty Ltd when the decision was made to acquire $1 million worth of UNC employer class shares in QCMM(ESP) Pty Ltd? It was Senator Parer. Who was the director of QCMM Pty Ltd when the decision was made to acquire 570 UNC employer class shares in QCMM(ESP) Pty Ltd? It was Senator Parer. In essence, all tax avoidance roads lead to Senator Parer. That is basically how Senator Parer turned 44c into $56,300.</para><para>Some other issues need to canvassed in this tax manipulation saga. On what basis and how was it decided that Advance Queensland Resources would purchase $1 million worth of tax deductible employer class shares in QCMM(ESP) Pty Ltd? What did Advance Queensland get in return for this substantial transfer of money out of its coffers and into Senator Parer's and his six fellow directors' pockets?</para><para>Was an independent assessment carried out to determine whether the $1 million transfer was a suitable purchase or was it made purely for tax purposes? Did Advance Queensland seek an opinion from the Australian Taxation Office as to the bona fide arrangement regarding the purchase of one million employer class shares in QCMM(ESP) Pty Ltd? Did Senator Parer have to actively engage in work for the companies that purchased the UNC employer class shares in QCMM(ESP) Pty Ltd in order to qualify for his $56,300 worth of employee class shares for which he paid only 44c?</para><para>Lastly, let us look at Senator Parer's comments that QCMM(ESP) Pty Ltd was in fact a superannuation type company. There was no doubt that it was a very generous and exclusive superannuation type company for Senator Parer and his six mates. How many battlers 
 are able to invest $10 in the morning and be entitled to $1 million in the afternoon? None at all. Yet this government has ensured that the minuscule superannuation savings of battlers must now be included in determining their entitlement to social security benefits. Yet it is okay for the $2 million coal minister to turn 44c into $56,300 and the government to put this down to being a successful business man when in fact it is tax manipulation.</para><para>One may question why Senator Parer even needed to be in a superannuation type company when he is obviously a member of the parliamentary superannuation scheme. Senator Parer entered the Senate in 1985. When he was allocated his initial 12 one cent shares in QCMM(ESP) Pty Ltd in April 1994 he had been in the Senate for nine years and had therefore qualified for a parliamentary super pension. Given his re-endorsement, you would expect that Senator Parer would possibly be in the Senate until 2005 or in total 20 years. This 20 years would be comprised of two years as a minister and the balance as a backbencher. We know that he will be a minister for two years because we know that as soon as the poll driven Prime Minister (Mr Howard) sees the results of the Liberal Party focus groups Senator Parer will be left out to dry.</para><para>Here we have Senator Parer looking at receiving a parliamentary pension equivalent of 80 per cent of an MP's salary or probably just on $65,000 a year plus his $2 million coal investment plus his $56,300 in QCMM(ESP) Pty Ltd employee shares, for which he paid only 44 cents. Why then did Senator Parer need an employee share plan in QCMM(ESP) Pty Ltd when he had one through his parliamentary superannuation scheme? The answer is that it was tax manipulation and Senator Parer could not help himself but take part.</para><para>We saw the other day the plethora of government ministers and backbenchers who actively engage in income splitting and tax avoidance through their family trusts. Senator Parer has proved that he is no different. He is just another member of what is the wealthy ruling elite with its snout in the tax trough 
 paid for at the expense of ordinary Australian PAYE workers.</para><para>Finally, I would note Senator Parer's comments that QCMM(ESP) Pty Ltd stopped receiving contributions in 1995. Why was this so? Because the Labor Treasurer Ralph Willis closed down this manipulation in 1995 against a torrent of protests from the then Liberal opposition. Treasurer Willis said at the time in a press release:</para><para>The new taxation arrangements will serve to achieve our objective of removing the previously unlimited tax deferral opportunities for higher income earners.</para><para>This is exactly what Senator Parer was engaged in.

Despite years of promises and expansive statements by governments of both persuasions, little has eventuated in the form of real relief for the suffering many young people are experiencing.</para></talk.start><para>It is the sad truth that the road to this hell has been paved with good intentions. I note in an address to ACOSS in 1995 that the Prime Minister, John Howard, said to those gathered:</para><para>All Australians should have access to an adequate income, affordable housing, quality health care and a level of education that enables them to fully achieve their potential.</para><para>I am sure that most members in this place and, of course, the Australian Democrats could not agree more with these particular goals. Yet this government has failed to match its rhetoric with any real action to achieve them. It has brought Australia to a 
 current situation where Australia's young people have shown to be suffering more than ever before.</para><para>I refer in particular to the release of quite a comprehensive report by the Dusseldorp Skills Forum last Friday entitled <inline font-style="italic">Australia's Youth: Reality and Risk</inline>. I know that I and other politicians in this place on all sides of the political spectrum were briefed on this report prior to its release. I think we are still awaiting a formal response or statement from government and perhaps from the opposition on some of the findings in this report. It is a comprehensive report dealing with the manifold ways in which young people lack opportunities—a failing on the part of society, contributed to by this government through its cutting back on education, training and employment opportunities for young Australians.</para><para>Figures released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics last week show that youth unemployment is still at an unacceptably high level of 26 per cent and that regional unemployment continues to rise. The report by the Dusseldorp Skills Forum reveals that almost 15 per cent of all 15- to 19-year-olds are not in full-time education or work—a proportion that has actually increased during the past decade.</para><para>The report does paint a rather bleak picture for the prospects of young people. In 1996 the number of unemployed 15- to 19-year-olds stood at 78,200. At the start of this year that number had risen to 88,500. In 1996, there were 67,800 15- to 19-year-olds in part-time work. By the start of this year the figure had risen to 78,900. We have discussed many times in this place the increasingly casualised nature of the work force. Where jobs have been created they are usually part-time or casual positions. We are really failing to address the issue of the provision of long-term, sustainable and meaningful jobs not just for young people but for people generally in our society.</para><para>The report tabled on Friday raises an even more worrying issue—that is, the number of young people who are simply not reflected in the official figures. We are conscious that the official rate is 26 per cent—and we all condemn that figure as unacceptably high—but 
 more worrying are the number who are not considered in that estimate. The report estimates that as many as 25,000 young people have simply fallen through the holes in our social infrastructure. For every young person seeking work there is at least one other who is not counted in the official statistics.</para><para>We know that young people often find themselves disempowered or disenfranchised. Unlike previous generations, represented by many colleagues in this place, young people lack many of the opportunities afforded to the majority of Australians a decade ago. I do not underestimate some of the difficulties that confronted previous generations in many forms, but I think we have to accept that we have a radically different and restructured work force, for a number of reasons, and that youth unemployment is at almost unprecedented levels.</para><para>As the report states, young people face numerous challenges in their transition to adulthood and the spectre of unemployment looms large in frustrating many of their efforts to meet these. From completing education to leaving home and developing stable relationships, young people rely on finding long-term, meaningful employment to enable them to fulfil their potential. Yet the policies that have been implemented by this government in particular have prevented many young people doing just this. Instead of providing access to high quality education, we know that this government has cut funding to many of our education and training institutions—that is, at the primary, secondary and tertiary education levels. These cuts have directly advanced those already advantaged members of our society and usually, if not undoubtedly, at the expense of those who most need assistance. I have spoken many times in this place of the adverse impact that cuts to operating grants for universities have both on quality and access and equity. Certainly my colleague Senator Lyn Allison has spoken many times of her concerns and our party's concerns in the relation to the cuts to public education at the primary and secondary level. </para><para>Cuts in training programs and apprenticeships have also compounded this attack on 
 access to skills development and education. We know that the key to a successful, an educated, a skilled and a competitive work force now and in the future will be effective education and training opportunities for all Australians, because education is increasingly a lifelong pursuit, as well as specifically for young Australians. I note we have three opportunities over the coming days in this place to address some of the changes that have been made to apprenticeships and traineeships in relation to cuts to the craft schemes. I think the opposition parties will seek to prevent the government making changes to the employer subsidy in relation to full-time apprenticeships.</para><para>There are also the recent changes to the common youth allowance which will affect especially lower middle income families, but which will again increase the financial burden and other burdens on families and reduce opportunities for many young people who are not in full-time employment, education and training.</para><para>Since coming to power, this government has been engaged in a sustained attack upon young people. As if the common youth allowance was not bad enough, young people must now contend with the imminent commencement of the new Job Network scheme. I say `imminent commencement' but I am just wondering exactly how many of the operators and providers will be up and running by 1 May with the necessary social infrastructure, support base and community links that they will need, if they are to tackle the seemingly intractable problem of unemployment and youth unemployment in particular.</para><para>Under the scheme, young people stand to be further disempowered in their search for employment and opportunities to fulfil their potential. Large numbers of young people will not be eligible for the common youth allowance, for example, because their parents earn more than the threshold at which the parental income means test kicks in—and at around $23,400 it is not even average weekly earnings; it is an extraordinarily low threshold at which to begin kicking-in for a parental means test. Those people will be either barred or have their payments reduced as a result of 
 that parental means testing arrangement. These people will also find themselves barred from receiving real assistance from employment services providers.</para><para>The Dusseldorp Skills Forum report presents a number of proposals worthy of consideration and I commend them to this chamber. They include: prioritising marginalised young people, including those outside the labour market and those in part-time work, as well as those who are unemployed; recognising the need to better address the needs of early school leavers; placing a stronger emphasis on demand side policies in the labour market; reforming secondary education; and reforming vocational training to better address the needs of young people.</para><para>I have been rather concerned by the response to this report from both sides of politics, because many of the recommendations to which I have just referred are shared by people in this place. I see Senator Amanda Vanstone, who has talked many times about the need for reform in secondary education and about the need to match, in many cases, the education that we provide at a secondary level to the needs of not only the work force, but of young people, so that we cater more broadly and more diversely for the needs of young people in secondary education. So there is common ground on a number of these recommendations.</para><para>However, I noted the response of Dr Kemp, the minister responsible, to this report. It was that it was all Labor's fault. Labor's response, from their youth and education spokesperson, was that it was Dr Kemp's fault. Despite the fact that this is not really an issue about simply affording blame, no-one was prepared to accept that there were very real problems and very necessary recommendations in this report that required some response—even just a willingness to suggest, yes, this is a devastating problem and we will at least make some attempt to address the issues contained in the report. Rather than getting down to finding those solutions to the problem the report identified, both the old parties were engaged in a protracted buckpassing exercise. This political point scoring went no way to addressing some of the challenges in the 
 labour market and the new challenges which may face young people and, of course, their families.</para><para>It is time for all politicians—all of us—to recognise that young people have enormous potential and should be given opportunities to realise this. Instead, young people are increasingly finding themselves blamed for the predicament in which they find themselves—for the lack of opportunities with which they are presented, and most often in an environment which serves only to disenfranchise or alienate them further.</para><para>It is little wonder that a Victorian education report came out about three weeks ago which suggests that young people's trust of politicians or their elected representatives is at an all-time low. I believe six per cent of young people trust us. It is no wonder that they feel so cynical and disillusioned when one report, perhaps the most comprehensive report in the last couple of years into the issues facing young Australians, has been met with such a disappointing and despondent response.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Grafton Meatworks</title><page.no>1259</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:25:00</time.stamp><page.no>1259</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Chee, Sen Bill</name><name role="display">Senator O'CHEE</name><name.id>EU4</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Today is a day of interesting coincidences because I had in fact been planning to give an address today on the Grafton meatworks and I will do that. But it is interesting because the sale of the meatworks was announced today by the local state member, Mr Harry Woods, in New South Wales. It is interesting because Mr Woods did not announce the sale price for the meatworks.</para></talk.start><para>Why is this matter of interest and why should it be of interest to the parliament of this country? Let me explain the problem which is faced. The meatworks at Grafton has been operated by a company called R.J.Gilbertson (Queensland) Pty Ltd and is part of a group of companies called the Gilbertson group. There was another company involved at the meatworks, a company called Giltech Pty Ltd, which employed about 50 people. For some period of time, these two companies had been part of a group of companies controlled by the Gilbertson family, which operated in the meat industry.</para><para>On 7 October last year, administrators were appointed under the Corporations Law to both R.J. Gilbertson (Queensland) Pty Ltd and Giltech Pty Ltd, and those administrators were Mr G.J. Kelly and Mr S.L. Horne of Clark and Co., who are chartered accountants in Melbourne.</para><para>Prior to this happening, a very peculiar thing occurred. Remember that the appointment of these administrators was on 7 October 1997. I am reliably informed that on 27 June 1997, two cheques were drawn in favour of other companies in the group from the accounts of one or other of these companies. One cheque was in the amount of $4,611,908.21. Another cheque, drawn on the same day, was in the amount of $1,233,981.96. These two payments alone total $5,845,890.17. Why, you may ask, were two cheques drawn on the same day to related companies in these massive amounts? I will get back to that. What is important to know is that the payments occurred at a time when the directors knew that these companies were probably insolvent. They certainly occurred within six months prior to the appointment of those administrators, which, as honourable senators will recall, occurred on 7 October 1997.</para><para>The administrators had to prepare a report for creditors. They prepared that report and presented that report to creditors, and that was dated 21 October last year. So they prepared the report within 14 days, and that was presented to a meeting of creditors of that company on 31 October last year.</para><para>The report is quite interesting because one of the obligations of the administrators is to investigate whether there have been any preferential payments, which are also called voidable dispositions. This is where a payment has been made to somebody who knows that the company which is making the payment is unable to meet its debts, and the payment has happened within the six months prior to the appointment of an administrator. It has the effect of giving the person who receives the payment a preference or an advantage over other people who are owed money by the company. Mr Stirling Horne of Clark and Co. cited section 588FA of the 
 Corporations Law, and this is what he said about unfair preferences in his report:</para><para>This section of the Corporations Law provides for the recovery by a Liquidator of payments made by RJGQ to its creditors in the event that the company is wound up. Transactions that may be investigated are those made in the six months immediately prior to the commencement of the winding up which would be the date of the Administrator's appointment in this case.</para><para>A review of the creditors balances does not indicate any creditors received payment of their accounts ahead of other creditors.</para><para>All purchases and payments appear to have been made in the normal course of business with no suppliers threatening legal action. In the two weeks, prior to the appointment of Administrators I understand livestock suppliers had refused to allow the company to purchase further stock without a reduction in the debt. However, this situation generally applied to all livestock suppliers and again no one supplier appears to have been preferred.</para><para>Accordingly, I am of the opinion there were no unfair or other preferences of any material amount.</para><para>I think I have ably demonstrated that the two payments in question, which total some $5.8 million or more, are in fact prima facie preferences because they are paid to companies related to these in the group, at a time when the common directors knew these companies were in trouble—because they were about to apply for a release from the class order which governed the accounts of the group—and it had the distinct effect of preferring related companies over other creditors. Those other creditors included the employees of meatworks as well as local suppliers in the town of Grafton.</para><para>I think it was rather surprising that Clarke and Co. should form the view that they did. I think that most insolvency practitioners would have formed the contrary view. I think every insolvency practitioner I know would form the view that massive preferences existed here. I do not believe that Clarke and Co. acted with any mala fides at all. I think they were not aware of the full situation.</para><para>But what was the effect of that statement they made? The effect of that was to say to creditors, `You do not need to put these companies into liquidation. Put them under a deed of arrangement and you will get just as 
 good an outcome if not better.' Of course by going  into a deed of arrangement the effect of the deed was to prevent the creditors or a liquidator from going back and recovering that money. So in fact what has happened is that the creditors have been disadvantaged. Remember, the creditors include the workers and the local suppliers in the town of Grafton.</para><para>These matters were drawn to the attention of the Australian Securities Commission I understand as early as November last year. To the credit of the union they were drawn to the attention of the ASC by the Australian Meat Industry Employees Union, the Newcastle and northern branch I understand. That is to their credit.</para><para>It is a shame that I understand that the Australian Securities Commission took no action. It was not in fact until my colleague in the other place, the honourable member for Page, Mr Ian Causley, had his staff repeatedly contact the Australian Securities Commission that any action was taken by ASC relating to this matter. I understand though it is not just the $5.8 million that I have outlined here. I understand that preference payments could exceed $6 million. But not only did Mr Causley contact the Australian Securities Commission; he only contacted the scheme administrators, Clarke and Co., to say that he had very grave concerns about the matter.</para><para>In the interim Mr Causley has also provided me with documentation, including a letter sent by the union to ASC on 25 February this year and also material which was prepared by Clarke and Co., and I would not have been able to give this speech if it was not for Mr Causley's assistance in providing that information. When I saw the statement that was made in the circular to creditors dated 21 October, I was immediately concerned. So yesterday I contacted a representative of Clarke and Co. who admitted that they were not aware of the payments until Mr Causley drew them to their attention.</para><para>To their credit, however, they said that immediately they were aware of the payments they contacted the directors of the Gilbertson group and said that they thought there was a major problem. I think that was probably a understatement because if these payments go 
 through and they are not recovered then the employees are out of pocket. The reason why the employees are out of pocket is because the ANZ I understand is owed around about $3.24 million. That was what it was owed on 7 October. I understand that interest has accrued in the interim and a payment may have been made to reduce it as well. But I understand the amount outstanding to the secured creditors is $3.2 million. They get first bite. They get first bite under  legislation that was prepared by the previous government.</para><para>So if it is in fact the case as I suspect that the purchase price for this meatworks is in vicinity of $3.2 million, the only people who will get paid out will be the ANZ Bank, and the workers and the other unsecured creditors will be left with nothing. Of course, the Gilbertson group would also have the advantage of not having any liability for that $6 million in preference payments which may have been made.</para><para>Clarke and Co. as a result of Mr Causley's approaches to them, and also as result from pressure from Australian Securities Commission—and Mr Causley and the union have both written to Australian Securities Commission, but Mr Causley had contacted them on a number of occasions—then proceeded to contact the directors of the Gilbertson group and said, `Look, we think you had better do something about this because the whole deed could be set aside.' Honourable senators who are familiar with the operation of the Corporations Law would know that it is quite possible, even right now, for the court to order that the deed be set aside and a liquidator appointed to these companies to recover the amount of money.</para><para>I am pleased to tell the Senate that I was told yesterday by Clarke and Co. that an offer has now been made of a guarantee of further moneys outstanding to unsecured creditors from the Gilbertson group. This has been a direct result of the assiduous work of the honourable member for Page, Mr Causley, and a direct result of his pressuring both the Australian Securities Commission and Clarke and Co. to do something about this.</para><para>Why do I say that? Because yesterday, in a debate on another matter, I had to sit here and endure the usually tirade from Senator Forshaw who claimed that the members of the government and in particular the members of the National Party were doing nothing to look after the workers. Let me point out that while Senator Forshaw was grandstanding to the media, he was not doing any of hard work and was not actually looking after the interests of workers. He can thank the member for Page, Mr Causley, that that is now a possibility. But, it would wrong for me to say here and now that the matter is over. Because it is not.</para><para>There are a number of matters which now arise as a direct result of this offer of a guarantee. Let me run through those matters because they are very important. First of all, you have to know who is giving the guarantee, and that is not clear. Who would benefit under the guarantee? Will it be just the workers or will it also be all the other unsecured creditors in Grafton. I understand that they total in the vicinity of $3 million or more. So it is a massive loss, not just to workers but to small business people and to the cattle producers and so on.</para><para>Would the creditors be better off accepting this guarantee or would they be better applying for an order to set the deed aside and liquidating the companies, because it may well be that guarantee is worthless or the guarantee is not as good as the amount of money which could be recovered in event that companies were put into liquidation.</para><para>The other matters that have to be considered are how would it be administered and who would decide on the claims that unsecured creditors would make? It is quite obvious that Clarke and Co., for all their good efforts, are somewhat compromised because of this situation. It should not properly be adjudicating on the claims of unsecured creditors when the people who appointed them are the people who are probably giving the guarantee.</para><para>These matters I believe need to be resolved immediately. The reason why they need to be resolved immediately is that this sale has been announced but probably will not be completed 
 for some weeks. In that period it is critical that another meeting of creditors be called at which all of the workers should have representation, and all of the small business suppliers as well. It should be at that meeting that a full and accurate and independent assessment of situation is provided to those unsecured creditors so that justice can be done in this case. We are close to achieving justice but until these matters are resolved, justice will not be done. I think if justice is finally done it will be in large part due to the efforts of my friend, the Hon. Ian Causley, and all the work he has done as well as, in large part, as a result of the work of the union. I think both of those deserve to be congratulated. But I warn that unless these matters are resolved there is remains the distinct possibility that workers and small business people in Grafton will remain hopelessly out of pocket.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Asian Economic Crisis: Tasmanian Tourism Industry</title><page.no>1262</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>1262</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to talk about the Asian economic crisis and the impact it is having on the tourism industry, particularly the Tasmanian tourism industry. The effect of this crisis is already being felt in this key sector and I fear the worst is yet to come. That is certainly the view of the industry. For that reason, the Tourism Council of Australia has been pursuing the Howard government for months to help cushion the industry against the collapse in the number of Asian tourists.</para></talk.start><para>This is an industry that provides one in nine jobs. It contributes $60 billion to the domestic economy and $16 billion in export earnings. The March 1998 American Express Tourism Leading Indicators, a survey of industry expectations, showed business was expecting sales and profits to deteriorate in the March quarter, with job prospects to remain weak until September. Tourism Council Australia chairman, Bruce Baird, said the results of the survey highlighted the need for the federal government to act to support the industry. He said that negative growth in the industry was likely in the coming months as the Asian crisis fall-out fully affects arrival figures.</para><para>There was a similar view in a report from the Metal Trades Industry Association. The 
 report, entitled <inline font-style="italic">The Economic Contest in 1998</inline>, states that tourism is already feeling the effects of the Asian crisis, with short-term arrivals slowing noticeably—and it forecasts worse to come. The report says that efforts by the industry to offset losses from South-East and North-East Asia, through increased numbers from China, Europe and America, will be very difficult. It says the reversal of growth in the South-East Asian and Hong Kong markets is even more damaging because spending per visit of these tourists is on the high side—a combination of more spending per night and longer stays. The evidence is there for all to see and the impact is already being felt. But so far the industry's quite legitimate call for assistance from Mr Howard has largely fallen on deaf ears. </para><para>The package the Tourism Council of Australia is asking Mr Howard to support includes three key strategies. First, the introduction of a 12-month visa-free trial for selected markets, including the United Kingdom, the USA and Singapore. According to the Council, the current visa policy is costing up to 15 per cent of our potential Japanese market and costs more than $45 million a year to administer. Secondly, a one-off campaign designed to boost domestic tourism in partnership with the states and the territories—the `Holiday at Home' campaign. And finally, a strategy to grow emerging markets, such as China and India.</para><para>Government support for this key sector of the economy is very important nationally, but it is vital from a Tasmanian perspective. A report prepared by Tourism Tasmania last year, which was based on 1995 data, shows just how important this sector is to the Tasmanian economy. In that year, visitors to the state spent $857 million on travel, the industry employed between 13,500 and 18,700 people and contributed between 5.8 and 8.3 per cent of the gross state product.</para><para>Three industry groups accounted for more than 70 per cent of the jobs created by tourists. They were the wholesale, retail and insurance industry; restaurants and hotels; and the entertainment and recreation industry. A key feature of the employment generated by the tourist sector in Tasmania is the wide 
 distribution of its benefits. The study found that more than half the employment was generated in the southern region, 30 per cent in the northern region and 19 per cent in the north-west. The economic benefits are also spread throughout the state, with the small business sector being a big winner. Without a properly funded and marketed plan, the Tasmanian industry is badly exposed to the Asian crisis.</para><para>While a reduction in the number of international visitors will not have a direct impact in Tasmania, it will certainly have an indirect effect. The decline in international visitors in Queensland—particularly in Cairns—will see heavy discounting of airfares and accommodation in the north to build up domestic visitations. If successful, that strategy could hit Tasmania hard and the leakage of domestic travel into relatively cheap Asian destinations will only add to these problems.</para><para>This trend is likely to strengthen over the coming months, especially after May. Not only is May the month when the industry in Tasmania expects the difficult market conditions to bite, it is also the month when the Howard government delivers its third budget. This budget holds the key to the future of this key industry. With the right support, tourism will continue to earn millions of dollars in export income and to generate thousands of new jobs. If the government does not financially reinforce the strategies the industry has put in place to counter the Asian downturn, then the sector is in for a tough time.</para><para>The future welfare of the Tasmanian industry is heavily dependent on interstate visitations. In 1995, 76 per cent of holiday travellers came from interstate, with intrastate travellers accounting for just under 10 per cent and international travellers 14 per cent. From a local point of view, the planned `Holiday at Home' campaign is a key to minimising the anticipated downturn. The campaign would focus on encouraging more Australians to holiday at home instead of travelling overseas. The efforts of Tourism Council of Australia to further boost the number of tourists from the traditional markets of the United Kingdom, the USA and Europe would also help Tasmania.</para><para>Investment in tourism is money well spent because of the number of jobs generated. Investment in promoting tourism is money well spent in that each dollar spent generates eight dollars for the economy. Governments also get a good return from their investment through taxation revenue. The Tasmanian tourism study found that in 1995 government tax revenues from tourism in Tasmania amounted to an estimated $287 million, with about 73 per cent going to the federal government, 22 per cent to the Tasmanian government and 5 per cent of the revenue going to Tasmanian local government authorities.</para><para>Last year was a boom year for the industry in Tasmania. Just under half a million tourists visited the state. There was a 7.7 per cent increase in international tourist visitors, with a 9.6 per cent increase in Asian tourist visits, excluding Japanese. There was a 2.7 per cent increase in interstate visitors.</para><para>I have noted that the Tasmanian tourism minister, Mr Groom, was quoted in the Launceston <inline font-style="italic">Examiner</inline> as saying that he was quietly confident that the 1998 tourism season would produce even better results. I hope he is right but, frankly, I fear that he is not going to be right on that score. Certainly, his prediction will not be realised unless there is a concerted effort by the industry, the state government and the Commonwealth government to put in place a strategy to insulate Tasmania from the Asian crisis.</para><para>This is not a time to sit back. It is certainly not a time to take the approach promoted by the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism, John Moore. Mr Moore said on <inline font-style="italic">ABC</inline> television, in response to calls by the tourism industry for support to help beat the Asian crisis:</para><para>If they're—</para><para>by `they' he meant the airlines—</para><para>not filling the seats, then don't run the planes.</para><para>His comments came as the government announced a $300 million rescue package for exporters to Indonesia through the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation.</para><para>Mr Acting Deputy President, if the airlines don't fill their seats and they then do not fly their planes, then the hotels and motels do not 
 fill their rooms, the restaurants do not sell meals, service stations do not sell petrol and other small businesses do not sell their goods and services. Then they all start laying off workers. Let us hope Mr Moore sees some sense before the next budget in May. Otherwise states like my state of Tasmania will pay heavily for this indifference.</para><para>There are two other issues the Howard government has put on the agenda that are having a significant impact on the tourism industry, particularly in Tasmania. They are, firstly, the threat of a goods and services tax; and, secondly, the constant threat of an early election. Both these issues are creating considerable uncertainty in the community and people are less likely to spend money on a holiday as a result. Mr Howard's GST will also turn tourist operators into tax collectors. According to the President of the National Tax and Accountants Association, Mr Ray Regan, the GST will cost small businesses at least $7,000 a year in compliance costs, and will require at least 228 hours to meet monthly compliance requirements. This is just what the Tasmanian tourism industry does not need.</para><para>In the upcoming budget Mr Howard should do two things to help the tourism industry. He should give it the financial support it needs and he should rule out a GST. He should also stop fuelling election speculation every time he does not get his way in the Senate. It is very bad for business, especially the tourism business in Tasmania.</para><para>In closing, I want to say that following the division this morning on what is being touted as a double dissolution bill—the Workplace Relations Amendment Bill 1997 [No. 2]—one of the government senators, after the announcement of the vote, punched the air in an indication of exultation or triumph. I think it is important to put that on the record because I think it demonstrates the approach of this government to that legislation. It is very distressing for industries, like the tourism industry, to see the games being played about legislation that will impact on their industry if this government isn't very careful.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Information Technology</title><page.no>1264</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>1264</page.no><name role="metadata">Tierney, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator TIERNEY</name><name.id>O15</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to make the first of a series of three speeches dealing with my continuing study of the rapidly changing world of information technology.

Just as I believed in 1994 that we must ensure universal access to this technology to make sure that there was not a developing underclass in Australia, I also made the point at that time that there was an opportunity for Australia to become the information hub of South-East Asia.</para><para>Australia has many advantages in this regard in the new information age. We are politically stable, we have a highly educated population and a single communications structure which moves across major population centres. These are based around the south-east corner of Australia where up to 80 per cent of the population live in a narrow crescent between Brisbane and Adelaide. We have highly developed information technology and a very high take up rate of that technology.</para><para>Therefore, three and a half years on, it was very useful to visit one of our neighbours—Malaysia—which also felt that it should become an information hub for the whole South-East Asian region. Recently, in Kuala Lumpur, I met with industry executives and 
 government officials who were involved in information technology. Malaysia is in high-speed mode to get its multimedia super corridor—the MSC—operational. They claim to be 10 years ahead of their time, which actually makes Australia's failed multifunction polis in Adelaide of 20—or was it 10 years ago—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>4J4</name.id><name role="metadata">SCHACHT</name><name role="display">Senator Schacht</name></talker><para>—Ten years is better.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>O15</name.id><name role="metadata">Tierney, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator TIERNEY</name></talker><para>—Twenty years ahead of its time, perhaps, Senator Schacht. The MSC concept is, in many ways, similar to the multifunction polis but with two very significant differences. Malaysia in 1998 is starting this on the cusp of the information age and, unlike the ALP's stewardship of the MFP from the mid-eighties to the mid-nineties, Malaysia's MSC is part of their 2020 vision for their nation and is driven from the top, by Malaysia's Prime Minister.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The multimedia super corridor is being sold as the region's launch site for companies developing and using multimedia technology. This is competition for Australia and Malaysia is pushing itself as the location for multinationals in this sort of industry across the region. It is important, then, that we in Australia keep track of how the Malaysian multimedia super corridor is progressing. Senator Alston visited Malaysia about 12 months ago and in that short time, things have progressed significantly.</para><para>You would think the project's high speed would be slowed by Asia's economic meltdown—not so. The Malaysian government is so keen for this project to get going that they have quarantined it from any budgetary cuts. The Malaysian government has cut its expenditure by 18 per cent but nothing came off the MSC funding. I was told the Malaysian government sees this project as the key to its future. The MSC is a 15 by 50 kilometre zone extending south from Kuala Lumpur to the new airport. It includes building two new cities, one known as Cyberjaya—cyber city—which will house businesses and workers. The government plans to base itself in a new city next door called Putrajaya which will be the new administrative centre of Malaysia.</para><para>The MSC will bring together four elements. It will bring together firstly, leading edge software infrastructure, including highly 
 attractive incentives; unrestricted import of foreign knowledge; the world's first comprehensive framework of `cyberlaws' and the world's first multimedia convergence legislation. Secondly, world class IT networks consisting of a high-speed backbone network and cost-competitive telecommunications tariffs will be put in place. Thirdly, a multimedia development corporation will be created and this will ensure that companies interested in locating in the MSC can get what they need to succeed and will expedite permit and licence approvals. Fourthly, this will all be done in an environment of top quality urban development in Cyberjaya.</para><para>It is ultimately planned that this city will house 240,000 people—about the size of Canberra. It is estimated that 500 information technology and multimedia companies will be located in Cyberjaya by the year 2020. I was told by several sources that 116 international companies have already signed up to locate in the MSC. The Malaysian government has put together a number of commitments to companies interested in coming on board. These include the incentive for unrestricted employment of local and foreign knowledge workers; freedom of ownership so that total foreign control of firms is actually welcomed; a five-year exemption from Malaysian income tax, renewable to 10 years or 100 per cent investment tax allowance on new investments made in the MSC cybercities. In addition, government officials, including the Malaysian Minister for Communications, said that the country should have its convergence act in place by the middle of the year—a broad act to create a very flexible environment for new business. I was told during the meetings with industry and government officials that other areas in Malaysia also want to establish MSCs with Penang already fairly well advanced.</para><para>This is a huge project and it is important to Australia that we are aware of what is happening in Malaysia in this international context. I will look forward to sharing with the Senate what else I discovered and other aspects of this dawning information age in future MPI speeches.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title><type>Questions Without Notice</type><page.no>1266</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Minister for Resources and Energy</title><page.no>1266</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>1266</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is directed to Senator Parer, the Minister for Resources and Energy.

Lindsay Tanner is out there saying, `We can't defend the indefensible'—that is his position—`but we'll say as little as possible and hope no-one notices.' This is gutlessness at its highest, Madam President.</para><para>The fact is that Mr Beazley's position is that he wants to call in Bob Hawke. What would Bob Hawke do? Bob Hawke happens to be the bloke who, in 1989, when he was presiding over the pilots strike, said, `This mob will cop every instrument of punishment and retribution. It's a different game this time, boys. It's war. They are exceptionally greedy.' Surely those words apply. Those words apply in spades to the MUA, so why won't Labor stand up and criticise them? Why does Labor tolerate the airconditioning rorts where everyone goes out if the temperature gets to 39 degrees celsius outside, even if you are freezing to death inside?</para><para>This is the mob that supports the safety card rort where, the moment you want to put 
 pressure on a shipowner, you claim that the gangway is a bit unsafe. They support the car loading rort. We have two security wharfies, one first aid wharfie and two wharfie clerks watching cars being unloaded. Has Labor criticised any of these? Of course they have not, Madam President. They stand shoulder to shoulder with the MUA. They know full well that is unconscionable and outrageous. But, no, because they are told that they have got to stand in support, they do it.</para><para>This is the greatest conflict of interest in history, Madam President. Let there be no misunderstanding. When nine out of the last 10 Labor senators in this place have trade union affiliations, when two-thirds of them are locked into the trade union movement, what else can you expect? It is an outrage. They ought to come clean about it and say they are not prepared to do anything that would jeopardise the interests of the trade union movement. They are certainly doing it by their actions. Why don't they come clean and say it in words?

I have never followed his argument.

They are not discredited measures that mean you simply do not take any notice of them and that you rely on the likes of Professor Quiggin to somehow give you a sensible 
 valuation. Quiggin's position is utterly ideological. He does not believe there is any value in selling off any government business enterprise, no matter whether it is exposed to full competition or whether or not it is an enterprise that can be just as easily or better handled in the private sector. He does not believe under any circumstances to my knowledge that there is any basis for moving in that direction.

This apparently eminent body of scientists has just discovered it and now, 10 months later, has put out a statement. I have enormous respect for scientists concerned with the biodiversity of Australia, and as a great fan of Tim Flannery and his book <inline font-style="italic">Future Eaters</inline>, I am very sympathetic to the arguments they put on biodiversity. But it is a pity that they know absolutely nothing about native title and absolutely nothing about the Native Title Amendment Bill, let alone the Native Title Act.</para><para>They have proceeded on the very strange presumption that the federal government has always had control over land management in Australia—one of the constant myths that is 
 perpetrated by opponents of the Native Title Amendment Bill. It is a fact of constitutional law in this country that the states have total responsibility for land management and have had since our federation commenced.</para><para>The Wik decision did change that. The Wik decision did mean that, as a consequence of the discovery of the fact that native title may have survived on pastoral leases, the Native Title Act automatically was triggered on pastoral leases and came into application. Therefore the states, which, up until that point, had a completely untrammelled sovereign right to manage pastoral leases in a way that accorded with the laws passed by democratically elected parliaments in the states, and implemented by their governments, were all of a sudden constrained by the Native Title Act. The constraints imposed by the current Native Title Act can, in many ways, prevent the states doing anything on pastoral leases and, indeed, mean that pastoralists cannot actually do what is legally allowed under their leases. That is the unintended consequence of the application of the Native Title Act on 42 per cent of Australia, as a consequence of the Wik decision.</para><para>What we are trying to do, despite the obstruction from the Labor Party and the Democrats, is fix that Native Title Act so that pastoral lessees can continue to operate according to their leases and according to laws passed by sovereign governments in the various states. We do happen to believe that this is a federation and that the states should primarily continue to have responsibility for land management. However, under our Native Title Amendment Bill, that will be able to continue, but within the constraints imposed by the Native Title Amendment Bill. The states will no longer have the free and untrammelled right to issue upgrades or changes in land use conditions on pastoral leases. In future, they will have to comply with the Native Title Amendment Bill and, hopefully, if the Senate cooperates, the new Native Title Act.</para><para>So the Biodiversity Council is completely wrong in its premise. It is coming from the position that, somehow, the Native Title Amendment Bill is all of a sudden authorising 
 things on pastoral leases that were previously not allowed. It is the complete reverse. Their proposition is a complete perversion of the reality that it is the states that manage these things and have always done so. All of a sudden, they now can only do so if they comply with the Native Title Act, and the Native Title Act as amended by us. Our bill will ensure that rights granted to pastoralists can only be in accordance with state law. There can be no arbitrary extinguishment of native title on pastoral leases. All the environmental conditions that apply now to pastoralists must be observed. Nothing is changed in that. There are no new rights granted to pastoralists by the Native Title Amendment Bill, so the Biodiversity Council, regrettably, has no idea what it is talking about. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>1278</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Madam President, I ask a supplementary question.

It has been well understood by most. In relation to risks, the registrar went on further to say:</para><para>. . . so grave that both formal codes of conduct and practical modes of political accountability often require prior removal of the risk of influence. Prior removal is achieved either by disposal of the personal interest before assuming the public office or by declining the public office.</para><para>Again, that is an accepted course of action—hitherto an accepted course of action. I want to quote one brief paragraph of the advice of the Clerk of the Senate on the same issue of conflict of interest. He said:</para><para>It has been said that a conflict of interest does not exist until it is established that public duties have been performed in such a way as to favour a private interest. This is a complete misconception. The conflict of interest exists regardless of how the public duties are performed.</para><para>Again, this has been an understanding that all of us have had in relation to what conflict of interest is and how a person holding public office deals with conflict of interest.</para><para>The problem that we face in Australia today is that Mr Howard and his government have redefined conflict of interest. What Mr Howard now says is that a conflict of interest does not arise unless you have literally been caught with your fingers in the till. That is what he is saying—unless you have literally got your hand in the till and you have been caught. That is what Mr Howard has now redefined as conflict of interest. The problem is that that is a redefinition to suit Mr Howard's own purposes because any proper definition of conflict of interest would ensure that Senator Parer would have to resign.</para><para>The government says we are muckraking as we focus on Senator Parer's many investment 
 related activities, but there is very good reason why an opposition would concentrate for such a period on Senator Parer, on the Prime Minister's code and on the issue of blatant conflict of interest. We have a situation where this redefinition has led to a very sad day for Commonwealth decision making. I believe that Mr Howard should hang his head in shame and that Senator Parer should resign. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>1281</page.no><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator ABETZ</name><name.id>N26</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is quite clear that the wheels have fallen off the Labor Party's smear wagon against Senator Parer. Day after day we have been subjected to these allegations against Senator Parer, none of which have stuck. What do they do now? They come out with a version of conflict of interest which is completely and utterly irrelevant to the ministerial code.</para></talk.start><para>I have some questions in relation to the commentary provided by officials of the Senate in relation to conflict of interest, but that aside, that only relates to senators in relation to declarations in this chamber. It has nothing whatsoever to do with the ministerial code of conduct, which the Prime Minister wrote up and which the Prime Minister applies. We are talking about two completely different documents and two completely different scenarios. What Senator Faulkner, quite cleverly, has sought to do is to merge the two to try to make them into the one, and then further besmirch Senator Parer.</para><para>There are two things that Senator Faulkner does in his little repertoire—and there are only two things. He never has the facts, so we witness hysteria like we did on Monday and Tuesday of this week or he struggles through his speech without his heart being in it, as was quite obvious today. Indeed, the real Leader of the Opposition walked out of question time early and, I am sure, will not participate in this debate because he saw that the tactics were falling to pieces and he did not want to be associated with the sham with which the Labor Party were associated.</para><para>If the Labor Party were so genuine about conflict of interests, I wonder whether Senator Faulkner wrote to the good Clerk of the Senate or to the Committee of Senators' Interests, or indeed to people in the House of 
 Representatives, to inquire whether there was some conflict of interest when a person who was then federal Treasurer of this country gained a loan from the Commonwealth Bank for a piggery that was basically impecunious. No, of course Senator Faulkner did not write then, and that was a clear case where somebody enriched themselves through their position. The Labor Party were deathly quiet on that. Yet they seek to besmirch Senator Parer when they have been unable to lay a glove on him.</para><para>If the Labor Party were genuinely concerned about ministerial ethics, they would explain to the Australian people why they still hold out Senator Nick Bolkus as an appropriate person to be the first law officer of this country—a person who, if Labor were to win office, would be in control of the Skase matter; indeed, as Attorney-General, would be in control of funding for the Federal Court. Do you know what he did? In breach of Federal Court rules, he leaked a confidential affidavit from the Federal Court. He got caught red-handed. This senate censured him for it. Every single person in this Senate, other than Labor Party senators, voted for that motion.</para><para>If you are so concerned about ministerial ethics, why is it that Senator Nick Bolkus is allowed to retain a position on the front bench of the Labor Party? It is because the leadership of the Labor Party is too weak to remove him. But if the people of Australia want a clear demonstration of the standards that would apply in relation to ministerial conduct were Labor ever to win, all they need to do is look at Senator Bolkus, who is allowed to leak, in breach of Federal Court rules, confidential documents which have the capacity to undermine our chase for the Skase assets, and he is allowed to continue on the front bench.</para><para>While Senator Nick Bolkus remains on your front bench, the opposition has no right to talk about ethics in any shape or form because the actions of the Labor Party speak a lot louder than their words during Senate question times.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>1281</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In speaking to this motion, I wanted to refer again to the speech which the Prime 
 Minister, Mr Howard, made to the House of Representatives on 11 April 1986. I see that two journalists writing in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline>  today have recited large tracts of that speech in their articles, no doubt having regard to the fact that it was drawn to the Senate's attention yesterday in my speech. The reason I want to do that is that it places Mr Howard's position today in such stark contrast to his self-righteous indignation in 1986 when the mother of the then Minister for Trade, Mr John Dawkins, held BHP shares, which Mr Howard said was a heinous crime. Mr Howard was attempting to censure the then Prime Minister over this.</para></talk.start><para>Mr Howard wanted the House to censure the then Prime Minister for condoning the failure of the Minister for Trade to make full and frank disclosure of matters which may have given rise to a conflict of interest. He also said that he wanted to censure the Prime Minister for his failure to maintain proper standards of ministerial conduct. He also wanted to censure the Prime Minister for his blatant double standards relating to ministerial propriety and for his expedient and opportunistic interpretation of rules which he himself had laid down for the conduct of ministers. If that does not apply to Mr Howard today, nothing does.</para><para>Clearly, the Prime Minister has redefined and reinterpreted his own rules so that Senator Parer can get off the hook. He is clearly caught. The editorials of the major newspapers around this country have said that Senator Parer should stand down and that the Prime Minister should cease protecting him. That is what they have said. They said it days and days ago. But this government has decided that it is going to abandon its standards because it cannot afford to lose a minister.</para><para>No-one on the government side should talk to us about double standards, because here we have evidence that the Prime Minister has changed his standards. The standards which Mr Howard wanted applied to John Dawkins because his mother owned BHP shares do not seem to apply to Senator Parer, who is part of a family trust with $2 million worth of coal shares. Other issues were raised in question time today relating to the non-declaration of 
 valuable shareholdings, which he was required to declare by the Senate. No doubt we will hear more about that.</para><para>In April 1986, Mr Howard, quoting Prime Minister Hawke—but he chose to repeat it and he took comfort in it—said:</para><para>If a man . . . shouts from the roof tops that those in high office should be subject to scrutiny he should have exactly the same standards applied to himself.</para><para>I say to the Prime Minister that they do apply to him and they will be applied to him. As quoted by Mike Seccombe in today's <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> , the Prime Minister said:</para><para>Everybody knows that if a man who stands to gain . . . goes out of this Parliament and tries to tell the average Australian that he may not have a conflict of interest . . . there is not a man or a woman who would believe him.</para><para>That is what the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, said.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5F4</name.id><name role="metadata">CALVERT</name><name role="display">Senator Calvert</name></talker><para>—That is just the politics of envy, that's all.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>8O6</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name></talker><para>—You are the one who punched the air over the vote this morning, Senator Calvert.

The more jackals there are, the more likely it is that they will bring the lion down, but they will not bring this lion down because there are not enough jackals on the other side.

In an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> of 24 March, Kate Askew said:</para><para>Because Pan Australian is a small explorer, not a miner, its activities arguably would not be affected by any of Senator Parer's policies.

Indeed, the Prime Minister himself has said that there is no conflict of interest. The head of the Prime Minister's department, Mr Moore-Wilton, has also said that there is no conflict of interest. But if there was a conflict of interest and it has been rectified by the senator, why is he 
 still being pursued to the detriment of the Australian people?</para><para>There is no doubt that Senator Parer is one of the best that this nation has ever seen in the portfolio of minerals and resources. People of his acumen, ability and expertise do not come along every day who are prepared to give up a very rewarding life in the private sector in order to come into this place and serve their nation as they see fit and as the expertise which they have built up over a lifetime in that particular area dictates.</para><para>As I have said, even if there had been some blows landed, I do not believe they have been justified in any way. It is cowardly to accuse a man of a conflict of interest, of misleading parliament, in this place.

How much longer is the charade going to go on? They are hoping and praying that at some stage they are going to lay a blow but they will not lay a blow on Lion Parer. The jackals can yap, scream and screech all they wish.

No doubt we do that privately, but we do not use the chamber and we do not use the time of this place to discredit someone who does not justify it.

We cannot accept that, because the Prime Minister has signed off in this instance, a potential, at the very least, conflict of interest does not exist.</para></talk.start><para>I do not want to spend much of my time here this afternoon on Senator Parer. Basically, I think Senator Parer is a decent fellow and a good minister. I think his administration of that area, at least as far as I have seen it—and I have had only some six months to take a close look at it—is reasonably good. But, unfortunately, owning shares—albeit in some contorted system of ownership that keeps them supposedly at arms-length—in an area of portfolio responsibility is inappropriate. In my view it is an open and shut case.</para><para>I want to quote a couple of people who I think share that view.

As a result of the breach—</para><para>and this was talking about a much earlier one—</para><para>that just occurred of those guidelines, even though there is no suggestion there was any intention of personal benefit that would flow from that breach, a minister has paid a very high price—the highest price a minister could pay.

As I interpret that, if the company in which the minister holds shares is the company out of which the conflict arises, there would be a need to divest.</para><para>Sadly, I think it is quite straightforward that in this instance the Prime Minister's code of conduct is not to be applied. I can only speculate as to the reasons for that. Those reasons have been speculated upon in this chamber.</para><para>Quite frankly—and I agree with the clerk on this point—Senator Parer owned those shares, however so constructed—and I use the word closely and I make no point on that. The fact of the matter is that at the time he was a minister he had a family trust that owned extensive mining shares in areas of his ministerial responsibility. In my view, that is inappropriate.

Do you know that in 1997 the opposition did not ask one single solitary question on debt, not one on inflation, not one on interest rates and not one on small business—all the things that are crucial to this country.

I was not aware that one would be faced with this situation at the present moment. It is an example of the fact that honourable senators are faced with a growing number of notices of motion. The time that is given to us does not enable us to seek or obtain detailed information and advice on these notices of motion, particularly when you are in the situation, as I am, where you have a whole range of matters to get over. In this particular case, one is engrossed in discussions and negotiations about very important legislation that is likely to come before the Senate in the next few days and particularly next week.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I raise with honourable senators the fact that, over the last few years, the number of notices of motion which have been placed before this chamber, declared formal and voted upon has more than trebled. In the last year they have at least doubled. If honourable senators continue to do this, I believe that we will reach a stage where motions which are adopted, decisions made by the Senate, will lose their credibility. I do not believe that that is good for the Senate or the institution itself, nor is it of benefit to those honourable senators and their constituents for whom this procedure is necessary. I believe that we need to do something to bring this to a head. Frankly, from tomorrow onwards I intend to deny leave to any notice of motion that is put forward until such time as some rationality enters this particular area. I do hope that honourable senators realise that it is in our best interests if we come to some sort of understanding and arrangement.</para><para>The other thing is that, because of the change in sitting times for the Senate, notices of motion are now put forward in the afternoon. Then there is the whips meeting, and one gets a response from the whips meeting on how the various parties are going to vote on particular matters. There is no time at night to make contact with relevant experts in 
 the field, so as to be properly informed, or to contact the library. Quite often the people are just not available at that time of night. You might say, `Well, there's always the morning.' I do not know about other honourable senators, but I get in here at half past seven in the morning and I find that my day is considerably taken up.</para><para>I do apologise to honourable senators, but I am not in a position to do justice to the matters that come before us in this particular fashion. I wonder whether at some stage you could all think about possibly setting aside one afternoon, whether that be Thursday afternoon, to look at them, which would give us plenty of time to consider the ramifications of the notices of motion. Let us ensure that the decisions of this Senate are mature and not just taken on the hop.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>1289</page.no><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator ROBERT RAY</name><name.id>UI4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I agree with a lot of what Senator Harradine said, but I think notices of motion fall into three categories.

We have all been through that.</para></talk.start><para>The second lot are those that express an opinion of the Senate that are often executed by sending them to an embassy or somewhere else, and I think this is the nub of Senator Harradine's problem. But I would urge him not to refuse leave to those machinery matters which may extend the time for a report or for a public sitting because they are running out of time. I think they are in a third category. You did say you were going to refuse leave for all, Senator Harradine; I hope you will exempt those.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>1289</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I share with Senator Harradine a prodigious workload, in my case on behalf of the Australian Greens, having to canvass the whole gamut of legislation, questions, notices of motion and so on. That is something that Senator Tambling and others opposite have never had to experience, but it is part of our duties.</para></talk.start><para>What does concern me about Senator Harradine's proposal is that, of tomorrow—and I think it is the second or third time that such a proposal has been flagged here—he 
 will, and can, as a single senator, block formality being granted by a simple vote on the voices or, if necessary, a division on the matter as a protest about that workload. It would be a better solution for an arrangement to be made so that the motions can be dealt with in a more expeditious fashion, if indeed it is available.</para><para>Another option is to look to increasing the wherewithal in Senator Harradine's office and those of others who have to deal with this workload. But it is up to each senator and to each party to evaluate for themselves what is important that is happening in this nation, in our states and to the world and to be able to bring forward those issues and have them dealt with as expeditiously as possible.</para><para>Simply blocking them as a wholesale act of discontent about that workload is not giving proper weight to the content of those motions, some of which are extremely important and urgent. So I would think that the sensible thing would be to find the alternative solution rather than simply to block the process. Of course, I do know that, if the process is to block, we spend more time in here debating process rather than the issue itself.

It is one that this chamber does need to discuss. I have worded my motion in such a way that I hope we can get bipartisan support and that we can send a very clear message to the people of Australia that this chamber—and, hopefully, both the government and the opposition—supports the Medicare system and, in particular, supports the public hospital system.</para><para>This ongoing funding dispute between federal and state governments is nothing new. I think the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron), representing the Minister for Health and Family Services, was quite right yesterday when he suggested that a lot of huffing and puffing goes on whenever we have a Medicare agreement up for negotiation, but I think we all must agree that this time it has gone a lot further than just people taking their own corner, digging themselves into a trench and doing a bit of arguing. What we have got now is a funding deadlock, and what this is doing in all states is undermining the confidence people have in the public health system and, in particular, the confidence they have that, should they need a public hospital bed, one will actually be available for them.</para><para>Yes, some of the messages that have been sent out by various states have helped in that undermining process. I am not saying for a moment that it is all the doing of the federal government, but my aim in discussing this motion today is to send a very clear message that we are determined to see this problem 
 sorted out and to get a commitment from this government that it will be involved in the sorting out process.</para><para>I am particularly concerned about the longer term. Since this government came into office, its health policies have resulted in a perception that there is a covert agenda to gradually starve the public health system—in particular, the public hospital system—of funds and get it down to the point where people give up and say, `Okay, I'm going to have to get private health insurance and go private.'</para><para>I do not want to start pointing the finger at any particular state; that will only take us back to the realm of buck passing and that is what we want to try to avoid. I think I can make a very general statement, though, that all parties have been involved both in cost cutting measures that went far beyond realistic levels and in cost shifting. I put very clearly on notice that all state governments have been involved in this practice of trying to shift costs on to the Commonwealth and also shift costs on to the individual.</para><para>I have held the Democrats health portfolio for over six years and, during this period, have been disturbed by the continuing drain of funds—and I go back to the previous Labor government as well as this present government—out of the public health sector. We have seen, for example, the dental health program go altogether, and we now see this difficulty with our public hospitals. Part of the attraction for governments when they see this big pot of money is that they think, `A couple of percentage points here this year, a couple of percentage points there this year and a bit next year won't make much difference.' But that has been going on for so long now that it is making a difference—a considerable difference—and that is why we have reached the impasse.</para><para>A number of things have been suggested over the years as we have been moving towards this impasse, and I would say that our public hospital system is now on a precipice. I suggest that not just the minister but a number of government members—if they have the time in the break after Easter—should actually visit several hospitals in their own state, talk to the nurses, doctors and 
 administrators and look particularly at the pressure on beds and at some of the wastage that is occurring, with wards being closed because there is simply not enough funding to keep the hospitals operating properly.</para><para>The Democrats on many occasions have proposed a range of what we believe are very practical and responsible positions. In some cases, these were put on hold, and two or three months or maybe two or three years down the track they were revisited and looked at by government. We had a case under the Labor government where they were looking at some of the reasons why people were leaving private health insurance. We are not convinced that people leaving private health insurance is a key factor in the situation public hospitals find themselves in—it is certainly a small factor, but not a key factor—but, if funding levels for public hospitals had been maintained, they would not be where they are.</para><para>A major reason for the shift away from private is the out-of-pocket expenses that people find themselves facing. People think, `Hopefully, the day will not come but, if I had to use a private hospital, I do not want to face the extra costs.' The knowledge that the costs are there, the knowledge that others have faced them and the knowledge that two or three months down the track some people are still getting their fourth, fifth and sixth bills from a visit to a private hospital does nothing for confidence in private health insurance.</para><para>We could not talk the previous Labor government into seriously considering this, but I am pleased to say that this government is now setting up pilot programs in this area and we at last seem to have doctors interested in this issue and doctors understanding that it is a problem. It has taken five years, but at last we are getting somewhere.</para><para>Another example of some of the suggestions we have made—and this one was made in 1997—is a progressive Medicare levy. I believe Australians on higher incomes would be prepared, if they saw the money going into the public hospital system, to pay a little extra. Unfortunately, when the government adopted this in 1997, they did not put the 
 money being raised into the public hospital system at all; it has gone off into general revenue. If they had been looking at a higher levy going into public hospitals, we would have at least another $350 million available.</para><para>As we look for a solution to this impasse, we are looking to the Productivity Commission's recommendations for a broad review of the Australian health system. That was made in April 1997 and has been echoed by the South Australian Premier, Mr Olsen. But we heard yesterday that this government is apparently not interested in finding a solution to this impasse. They have now ignored that call and have preferred apparently to leave the average Australian in this situation of uncertainty, where we have an inefficient financing process that leads eventually to insecurity. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>1292</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Environment</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The government will accept the urgency motion moved by the Australian Democrats. It states:</para></talk.start><para>That in the opinion of the Senate the following is a matter of urgency:</para><para>That the people of Australia are guaranteed that their access to public health services will not be reduced due to the current disagreements over funding between the Federal and State/Territory Governments.</para><para>It is the view of the Commonwealth government that the failure of the states to accept a new Commonwealth-state health care agreement should not be at a cost to the public and that the security of the public in relation to public health services should be continued.</para><para>One wondered when the premiers walked out of the meeting with the Prime Minister last week, refusing to agree to the Commonwealth's offer in relation to the health care agreement, what their real intention was and exactly what were their tactics. One hopes that their tactics were not that they believed as a result of disagreement over a new agreement and failure to achieve a new agreement that there would be pressure through patients. The Commonwealth, in any event, was certainly not prepared to allow that to occur. Thus the Prime Minister very quickly said that the key parts of the Commonwealth offer would be implemented even without the 
 agreement of the state premiers. Notwithstanding their walkout, and no matter what their motive in doing so, patients will not be allowed to suffer as a result of that particular negotiating tactic.</para><para>It is important in this debate to establish the facts because there has been a lot of misinformation out there in the community. One of the facts relates to just how much money the Commonwealth does contribute to health care through the states. In the last five years the Commonwealth has in fact spent $27.3 billion on Commonwealth-state health care agreements. As I said yesterday in answer to a question, the forward estimates show that the funding would rise to $30.3 billion over the next five years. So the government was committed, through its estimates, to increasing public expenditure funded by the Commonwealth through taxes raised by the Commonwealth over and above that which the Commonwealth paid last year—an additional $3 billion. Our intention was therefore to increase the funding to some $30.3 billion.</para><para>On top of that it is also important to understand that the Commonwealth has been willing and is prepared to pay even further. It offered to the states an extra $1.5 billion in base funding over the next five years. That is on top of the $30.3 billion. It is prepared and will pay an extra $750 million for funding for veterans being fully treated in public hospitals. It is prepared and will pay an extra $500 million for initiatives in efficiency and effectiveness in hospitals, particularly in the area of information technology. All of this is going to be paid even though the state premiers are not prepared to sign the agreement. That is the security in terms of the motion moved by Senator Meg Lees, that public health services will not be reduced as a result of the premiers' walkout last Friday.</para><para>In addition to that, the Commonwealth is also prepared to  pay another $120 million to reduce waiting lists in public hospitals. I want to come back to that in a moment. Therefore, what we are offering above the forward estimates actually adds up to another $2.9 billion of new money. This is a 6.9 per cent increase in the first year of funding, moving 
 towards a 15.4 per cent real increase over the five years of the agreement. With that very substantial real increase—what is being offered is a 6.9 per cent real increase a year over an inflation rate of practically negative levels—it is very difficult to understand what the state premiers are complaining about.</para><para>The only complaint one really hears that has some bite is this issue about people leaving the private health sector and therefore putting further pressure on the public health sector and whether in fact that should be compensated in some way. This government, in contrast with the previous Labor government, is prepared to address that as well. We have done so by giving a commitment that if the level of private health insurance coverage drops then we will add another $83 million a year to health care agreements for any one per cent reduction in the number of people covered by that private health insurance.</para><para>We of course do not want to see private health coverage reduced any further. It was substantially reduced in the years of Labor—in fact reduced from a figure of almost 70 per cent of Australians having private health in 1983 to 35 per cent at the end of Labor's reign. Labor was basically opposed to private health insurance. We have heard it so often from the former Prime Minister, Mr Keating. He did not believe that it was a necessary part of the health system. In that environment people got out of private health care and that has placed further pressure on the public sector. We do not want to see that continue, but if it does we have provided this extra funding support which should give confidence to the states that they will be able to meet that extra demand.</para><para>How we act then to ensure as best we are able that there is not a further reduction is, as we have done, by providing a health insurance rebate of $450 a year for families, which grosses to some $600 million a year. So we have already put in $600 million a year to support the private health cover system. That will be continuing of course on an ongoing basis, except if Labor happen perchance to win the next election. They are opposed to that $600 million, so they will withdraw that, which will place further pressure on the 
 public sector again. As a matter of interest, in passing, they are also opposed—which is really extraordinary—to the surcharge that we placed on the Medicare levy in respect of higher income earners to put more money into the sector.</para><para>So what you have from the coalition government is an assurance that we will continue to fund the sector at an increased rate from the past—an extra benefit that we will put in if, unfortunately, the coverage of private health is further reduced—and, as I said, $120 million also to reduce waiting lists in public hospitals.</para><para>This is an incentive for the states. Only one state or territory has taken it up so far, and that is the ACT. The ACT is getting significant benefit. In fact, the ACT, having signed an in principle agreement—and that is all we ask of the states—will be able to draw half a million dollars this week which will fund an extra 200 admissions.</para><para>One can see what benefits would flow to each of the states—the extent to which they would be able to reduce their waiting lists if they took up our offer of a share of that $120 million. I would have thought that not only is this a generous offer that has been put to the states but also it gives assurance to the public that they will not suffer as a result of the intransigence of the state premiers. On top of that it provides the extra incentive of $120 million to reduce waiting lists very substantially and thus meet this extra pent-up demand which is really a flow-on from the failures of the last Labor government in this sector. I put the offer to state premiers again and urge them to see sense on this issue in the interest of the health of all Australians.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>1294</page.no><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name><name.id>656</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—There can be few greater responsibilities, I would suggest, on governments in this country, be they federal or state, than to ensure that all Australians have access to health care and particularly hospital care. It is a pity that the minister who has the responsibility in this chamber is not participating in today's debate. I noticed, however, that the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Hill) stated that his government has a commitment to ensuring that no Australian 
 will suffer as a result of the current impasse between the states and the Commonwealth on renegotiating the Medicare agreements.</para></talk.start><para>All Australians will note that commitment. This parliament certainly notes that commitment. The test will be whether or not it is delivered. I submit that, on the government's performance so far, in the two years it has been in office, it is unlikely to meet it. I fear that Australians will have reduced access to public health services.</para><para>The Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) has outlined details of the offer that has been made to the states with respect to renegotiating the Medicare agreements. I will come to the figures that have been cited by the minister in a moment. If what Minister Wooldridge was saying, if what the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) was saying and if what the Leader of the Government in the Senate was saying today was correct, why is it that all the state premiers in this country do not believe the minister for health or the Prime Minister or Senator Hill? Why is it that every single premier and every single state health minister in this country is telling the government that, firstly, its offer does not represent a real increase in health funding when one considers the amounts that have been taken out of the health budget in the last two years by this government and, secondly, it falls way below the amount that is required for the states to deliver an effective public hospital system?</para><para>As we know, the states have the responsibility to provide the hospitals, the staff and the infrastructure of public hospitals in this country. But, at the end of the day, the financing of that largely comes from the Commonwealth. Despite all the arguments about cost shifting—when we were in government we were aware of those issues as well—we have a situation where this government has come up short by billions of dollars in respect of what is needed in the public hospital system.</para><para>Time is running out. This matter has been on the negotiating table now between the federal minister, Minister Wooldridge, each of the state health ministers and the health ministers of the two territories for well over a year. There is still no agreement across the 
 board. The only agreement that has occurred is with the ACT and it occurred not long before the recent election in the ACT assembly. But each of the state ministers and now the premiers—because this matter was referred to the Premiers Conference last Friday—has told the government that its offer is just insufficient.</para><para>Why are they saying that? The current offer from the Commonwealth is of the order of $2.9 billion over five years, but much of what is being offered to the states in that respect is simply a return of money that was slashed out of the health budget by this government in its last two budgets. For instance, $750 million, or 25 per cent, of that amount is for veterans' hospital care. All that is is a transfer of the responsibility. There is no actual increase in funding through Medicare to the states or the territories. It is a shift from the Commonwealth to the states for that responsibility.</para><para>Furthermore, $479 million of the Commonwealth offer is already existing money that is in the estimates for palliative care and mental health care. It is not new money. It is not an increase in money over and above what has already been budgeted for.</para><para>When you put that beside the fact that this government in its first two budgets took $800 million out of the funding for public hospitals and saved a further $400 million by the abolition of the dental health program which was, of course, available for the most needy, particularly the aged and health cardholders, then a large proportion—almost all—of this supposed generous offer that the government says it is making is the return of money that was already in the system at the time they came into government. That is why the premiers are complaining. That is why Richard Court says that this is a dud deal.</para><para>I notice that Senator Eggleston is in the chamber; I would be interested to hear his remarks because the Premier of his own state says that this is a dud, and Senator Lightfoot has actually agreed with that. Jeff Kennett has, of course, attacked the proposal of the government and he, along with all the other premiers, walked out of the Premiers Conference last Friday—an action that the Prime Minister described as kindergarten tactics but 
 which, in reality, was the demonstration of absolute frustration that the states have had with this government because of the amount of time that has been spent on negotiating this agreement and the failure of this government to come up with a responsible offer.</para><para>The Leader of the Government referred to the private health insurance incentive scheme which they put into place to try to increase private health insurance coverage. As my colleague Senator Bishop interjected, it has not done that. So far, $650-odd million has been outlaid and a projected $1.7 billion over three years is to be paid as a rebate to encourage people to take out private health insurance. That is what this government has put on the table; that is what it is implementing.</para><para>But the level of private health insurance has dropped. It has dropped down now to its lowest level ever of about 31.6 per cent. People are not taking out private health insurance. People are leaving private health insurance. They are doing it because they recognise that, at the moment, given the huge gap that they usually have to pay for medical services in a hospital, it is not worth their while. That is the reality of it. That is why there is a growing crisis in public hospitals and waiting lists in this country.</para><para>New South Wales was in a position about a year and a half ago where it had its waiting lists down to some of their lowest levels ever, to manageable levels, after the Carr government came into office. But that problem has now increased again directly as a result of the blow-out in terms of people wanting access to public hospitals and the failure of this government to provide adequate funding.</para><para>So there is no doubt that this is a matter of urgency. This is an issue about which all Australians, all state governments and the Northern Territory government are saying to this government, `You have to get off your ideological horse; get down and understand that there is a need for a significant increase in the offer to the states to fund the public hospital systems.' Stop trying to fudge the figures; stop trying to pretend that you are actually increasing the amount available when in fact you are not, when all you are doing is returning back into the equation money that 
 you took out over the first two years.	If you have any commitment to Medicare—and I doubt it, but if you have any—as your Prime Minister said at the last election, then you will listen to your own party colleagues in those states and to the New South Wales Premier; you will sit down and renegotiate this and come up with a better offer than is on the table at the moment. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>1296</page.no><name role="metadata">Eggleston, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">Senator EGGLESTON</name><name.id>4L6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The whole issue of the need for extra funding for the public hospital system relates to the current situation of overcrowding in our public hospitals. I think we really have to ask: who is responsible for that overcrowding in our public hospitals? The answer is very clear: the previous ALP government.</para></talk.start><para>With the introduction of Medicare, Australia's private health insurance system has all but collapsed. In June 1982, 68 per cent of Australians had private health insurance. If one compares this with December 1997, one will see that the figure was only 32 per cent, and it is now down to just over 31 per cent. Over the past 15 years, private health insurance membership has declined by around 30 per cent. The greatest decline occurred during the years of the Hawke and Keating governments—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>2M6</name.id><name role="metadata">COONAN</name><name role="display">Senator Coonan</name></talker><para>—And under Carmen Lawrence.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>4L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Eggleston, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">Senator EGGLESTON</name></talker><para>—And under Carmen Lawrence, sadly, a Western Australian, let me say. That is when the great move to public hospitals occurred, resulting in the current situation where we have overcrowded public hospital outpatient departments and enormous waiting lists in public hospitals, something we never used to see in Australia. But we now have waiting lists of 18 months for hip surgery and two years for many other things like cataracts. That is a legacy of the Labor government.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Today, Australia's private hospital system treats about 30 per cent of Australia's patients, which means that something like 70 per cent now use the public hospital system. As I said, that explains why we have overcrowded public hospitals while the private hospital resources alongside them are 
 underutilised. I have to say that that is a disgrace and a very poor use of existing resources in this community.</para><para>Another impact of the drop in private health insurance is going to be on the concept of community rating. Community rating is the unique feature of the Australian private health insurance system and has meant that Australian health insurance companies have operated as mutual funds rather than discriminating against people in premium terms on the basis of their medical history, as is the case in the United States.</para><para>What the decline in private health insurance membership and the increase in public hospital utilisation mean is that the concept of community rating is now under great risk. Australians face a situation where health funds will become like the American model. It will no longer be possible for us all to pay the same premium and get covered for whatever is wrong with us. Instead, we will have to pay loaded premiums according to our histories and perhaps some people will be declined private health insurance because of their medical history, as happens in the United States. The blame for the overcrowding and the funding crisis in Australia's public hospitals rests entirely with the ALP.</para><para>I turn to the federal government's offer to the states. In the last five years the Commonwealth-state health care agreements have been worth $27.3 billion. The present total offer over and above forward estimates is of an additional $2.5 billion, which is very generous. Within this total, the government is offering $1.5 billion in base funding increased over the next five years; $750 million for veterans' affairs patients; $500 million for efficiency and effectiveness in hospitals, particularly in the area of information technology; and $120 million to address the long waiting lists which, as I have said, are a legacy of the previous government's policies. This is a 6.9 per cent real increase in the first year of funding moving to a 15.4 per cent real increase over the five years of the agreement.</para><para>One of the major aims of the new agreement is increased flexibility in the provision of health services. Funding will be able to follow the patient so that care can be provid 
 ed in the most appropriate setting. This will lead to better results for patients because they will be receiving the right treatment in the right place. The Commonwealth is also offering funding of $500 million for projects to improve the health care system in general, particularly integrating care across all sectors. Continued funding of around $500 million will also be offered for mental health care reform and palliative care service delivery. Funding of almost $700 million will be offered to reward quality service providers, all on top, as I have said, of the additional $120 million which is being offered to reduce those long waiting lists which are a result of Labor policies in public hospitals.</para><para>Let us look at the achievements of the coalition government versus the failures of the ALP government in the health area. First of all, the Howard government is committed to retaining Medicare. We have increased funding by $2.9 billion in real terms and offered to increase it in this next agreement. We are addressing the shortfalls in private health insurance and cutting waiting lists. By contrast, private health insurance dramatically dropped under Labor.</para><para>Australians should realise that, when it comes to health policy, one thing is clear: Kim Beazley wants to abolish the private health insurance rebate which gives families $450 a year to encourage them to go back into private health insurance. Labor will abolish that rebate. I remind the Senate that Labor had 13 years to fix Australia's public hospital system and failed to do so. Why should Australians believe anything the ALP has to say about health when they presided over the biggest fall in private health insurance and caused the current problems? <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>1297</page.no><name role="metadata">Neal, Sen Belinda</name><name role="display">Senator NEAL</name><name.id>B36</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I must say it is really a bit much to hear members of the government bemoaning what might happen to the private health insurance rebate when we see what this government is doing to the public health system in Australia and when we see that this very expensive gamble, a gamble that has cost Australians $1.7 billion for a rescue package for large featherbedded health insurance 
 companies, has been an absolute and utter failure.</para></talk.start><para>You might recall that there was a debate at the time that this budget initiative for private health insurance was first announced. Initially, the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) assured us that this initiative, the private health insurance rebate, would not only stem the flow in private health insurance but also bring people back to the fold in that more people would be insured with private health insurance. It did not take very long. I think it was a matter of a week when the minister started back-pedalling and saying, `No. I never actually said that people would take up insurance again. What I said was that fewer people would leave health insurance and that in fact the number of people who were in private health insurance would remain steady.'</para><para>But that really has not happened, has it? Not only has the flight from private health insurance continued but in fact it has accelerated. So as a country we have been spending $1.7 billion over four years to achieve absolutely zero. If this government thinks that that is good value for money, then I really believe that this government should think again. I do not believe that most of the community thinks that spending $1.7 billion on achieving nothing is very good value for money. But that is not where this government's incompetence ends, but I suppose that is what the debate is about this afternoon.</para><para>This Prime Minister, John Howard, and the minister for health have been incapable, through their lack of leadership, of concluding a Medicare agreement with the states. You would have thought that reaching agreement about what is a reasonable amount of money to fund our public hospitals would not be so extraordinarily difficult.

That is not a small amount of money. The premiers, as a group, had some fairly scathing things to say and expressed a great deal of concern that the level of funding that was being offered by this government would not allow them to properly meet the demands for health treatment within their hospitals. I find a comment made by Mr Kennett—a Liberal premier—quite fascinating. He said:</para><para>If you want an illustration of that, particularly those that are elderly will be the first hurt because most of the expenditure on health services goes towards people in the latter days, weeks, months of their lives.</para><para>These sentiments were echoed by Mr Carr, Premier of New South Wales, when he said:</para><para>People will be hurt, very largely older Australians.</para><para>And the Premier of Tasmania, Tony Rundle, said:</para><para>The state health systems need an infusion of money. The Australian hospital system is suffering from financial anaemia. It needs an infusion of funds.</para><para>You really have to start to believe, where you have a cross-party agreement on funding of health, that maybe the premiers are right and that our Prime Minister and his health minister are wrong. I have noticed that the government is now saying, `There's no problem. We're incapable of concluding an agreement in terms of health funding but we will just forget about all that. Rather than trying to reach a real agreement on a reasonable level of funding for health, we will just send off a cheque. When the agreement expires on 1 June, we'll just put a cheque in the mail and the states can do the best they can with the level of funding that we decide we will provide them with. Whether it is adequate or not, we don't really care.'</para><para>What concerns me is the consequences that will flow from a failure to have a Medicare agreement and just to have the funds sent off in the mail. There are a number of very important things that Medicare agreements do to protect the public and to ensure that they are treated fairly and properly in public hospitals. One of the things that the Medicare agreement does is to prevent the states from requiring patients to provide a co-payment when they go into a public hospital. I believe one of the great things about our public hospital system is that, if you are a person in need of treatment, you can go in there and be treated for sometimes quite extensive periods of time and not receive a bill when you leave.</para><para>Do you realise, without the signature on a Medicare agreement, that public hospitals are free to require patients to make any contribution that they choose? If you genuinely 
 believe that Mr Kennett, the Victorian Premier, will not feel tempted to say, `Anyone who goes into a public hospital will pay us an extra $100 a day,' or whatever figure he might choose, then I think you do not have the realistic view of Mr Kennett which most of the community have, particularly those who are ill and elderly in the State of Victoria. This Prime Minister is quite happy to see a situation exist where public hospitals in the states may require the sick to contribute when they are being treated in a hospital.</para><para>There is another very important provision that, to date, has been contained in the Medicare agreements. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>1299</page.no><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator COONAN</name><name.id>2M6</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Part of the health funding equation that has not received very much attention—and certainly no rigorous scrutiny—is the mismanagement of the vast health budget by the states. Nowhere is this more obvious than in New South Wales. The Commonwealth has made a firm and highly appropriate offer to New South Wales. Under the proposed agreement, New South Wales would get an extra $154.9 million in funding next year. The Commonwealth health minister, Dr Wooldridge, also offered Mr Carr $3.8 million next week if New South Wales agreed to the new agreements. That $3.8 million would have moved 1,425 people off the waiting lists right now; 1,425 people would have had their long and sometimes painful medical conditions attended to. What hypocrisy not to have accepted that.</para></talk.start><para>The offer to New South Wales included a rise of $55.4 million, or 3.76 per cent in base funding, for hospitals to bring it up to the $1.53 billion. Mr Carr was also offered $58.2 million in new funding for veterans health services and $41.3 million to reduce waiting lists, but Mr Carr stomped his feet and said that all this was not enough. In light of the fact that the federal government has stated clearly and on many occasions that the offers are not negotiable, Mr Carr's behaviour can be regarded not only as self-serving, but as selfish and in total disregard of the welfare of the people of New South Wales.</para><para>Even with Mr Carr's disregard for the people of New South Wales, the Common 
 wealth government will still be lifting funding for health in New South Wales. Under the 1993-94 to 1997-98 Medicare agreements, funding to all states and territories rose by approximately 5.5 per cent in real terms. In 1997-98, total funding is currently estimated at just under $5 billion, of which New South Wales will receive $1.6 billion. Despite the chorus from Mr Carr and Dr Refshauge that the problems in New South Wales are all due to Commonwealth funding cuts, that represents a real increase of 1.3 per cent. Why don't we hear any of this?</para><para>Under the 1993-94 Medicare agreements, funding to New South Wales has increased by about 8.7 per cent. The recent revelation that Mr Carr had managed to get the waiting lists for elective surgery above the 50,000 mark saw him again turn around to the whipping horse of the Commonwealth government, yet again claiming that funds for hospitals had been cut. I wish some electronics company would give a calculator to the New South Wales health minister, Dr Refshauge, and the Premier, Mr Carr, so that they can work out the difference between a rise and a cut. The way it is going, it must be the kindest cut of all—that is all I can say.</para><para>The Medicare agreements offer can only be described as generous. It represents a 15 per cent increase in real terms over five years, plus new funds for veterans and to reduce waiting lists. For the first time, the agreement contains an adjustment factor relating to people who may drop out of private health insurance. Are you listening over there? This provides for reimbursement of $83 million a year to the states for any one per cent further reduction in the number of people covered by health insurance.</para><para>Senator Forshaw and Senator Neal, who also come from New South Wales, talked about how difficult it is going to be because of problems with private health insurance. We have just fixed it. We have made you an offer of $83 million a year for any one per cent further reduction, and you are still not happy. Dr Refshauge does not seem to be aware of this either. In today's <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline>, he said that the demand on hospitals was caused by falling numbers in private health 
 insurance. He does not seem to realise that he has just been offered $83 million a year to fix that very problem.</para><para>The inference is irresistible that the mismanagement of the Carr government is destroying the health system in New South Wales. A clear indication of this is that, according to research released by the Minister for Health and Family Services, Dr Wooldridge, the New South Wales hospital system is 20 to 30 per cent more expensive per episode than the national average. The available funds are being used on an inefficient and very expensive system which is successfully limiting the services and facilities available to the people of New South Wales, the most populous state. You do not have to be an actuarial genius to see where the health budget blows out.</para><para>Mr Carr should examine some of the problems in the health system that his government has caused and which it is therefore incumbent upon him to fix. Trying to pass the blame constantly just does not wash. The list of breakdowns in the health system under Mr Carr is truly frightening. A record number of people are waiting for elective surgery in New South Wales public hospitals. By January this year, the figure had reached 50,778, up from 44,707 in March 1995. More people are waiting longer for surgery. The average waiting time has blown out to 1½ months, from 27 days in 1995. The Carr government has denied any knowledge of an across-the-board 12.5 per cent increase in hospital user charges. Mr Carr has simply blamed this shift on the Director of Health, washed his hands and walked away from it.</para><para>The New South Wales health minister, Dr Refshauge, has thrown the Sydney metropolitan health system into such chaos that it hardly bears thinking about. His plan in 1996 was to close a number of established hospitals, including St Vincent's in Darlinghurst, and it was only the outcry of New South Wales residents that saved it. You have to hand it to the Carr government: with its cuts and reductions to the health budget in New South Wales, it has not only hit the patients; it has even hit the people who park in the 
 hospital car parks when they go to visit their relatives.</para><para>As a senator for New South Wales, the treatment of people in the state which I represent concerns me greatly. What is most upsetting is that it appears that the Carr government is playing politics. A breakdown of figures for people waiting 12 months or more for elective surgery is a matter of great concern. Of the top six hospitals where the numbers waiting for surgery have risen most, guess what? Four are in areas held by the coalition. I wonder how that happened? The lack of commitment to the health system by the New South Wales Labor government has resulted in the deterioration of services, which is affecting the lives of many people. While Mr Carr and Dr Refshauge indulge in the politics of blame, the system will continue to fall apart.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>1300</page.no><name role="metadata">Lees, Sen Meg</name><name role="display">Senator LEES</name><name.id>8U4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am very pleased to see we have cross-party, all party, support for this motion today. However, I am not pleased with the direction of the debate. Indeed, I think we have heard, particularly from this side, a very good reason why we should listen to the Productivity Commission and have an inquiry into Australia's health system.</para></talk.start><para>Can I take issue with a couple of things, particularly with what Senator Eggleston has said. Senator, on the one hand you claim this government is very keen on Medicare, it supports Medicare and it is a system that you believe in, but on the other hand you are saying we want people to go off into private health insurance. Basically, the inconsistency of that is: Medicare is a universal system and private health insurance is an option that people may like to take if they want a choice of doctor, or they want immediate treatment—in other words, to bypass the waiting lists—and they want a private room. It should not be seen as a core part of the health system.</para><para>People have left private health insurance in droves. They have voted with their feet. They do not think it is a good idea. But what does this government do? It puts $1.7 billion back into private health insurance. Ninety per cent of that money at least went to people who 
 already have insurance. It did not encourage any new members. That money stuck to the private health insurance system. It will not find its way out into the public health system.</para><para>Imagine what our public hospitals would be like today if when you came into office you put $1.7 billion extra into the public hospitals, into the dental health programs and actually had a real universal system in this country, which is what people want. They want a system where we all pay on the basis of how much we earn—that goes in through the tax system to Medicare—and then we use it on the basis of our need, we know that there is a good public hospital and we do not have to check again to see how much a person earns when they turn up at the public hospital: we are treated on the basis of need.</para><para>I do have to take issue, too, with Senator Hill and I think with Senator Coonan when they talk about this new process of linking the Medicare agreement to a drop in private health insurance. That was done in 1992 and I moved those amendments. The problem is that the government chose not to then make up the money. That trigger has been there and it has triggered two reviews—in 1995 and 1996. I want to see when we get to the legislation in 1998 that it is actually tied in so that drops in private health insurance, if there are further drops, will actually get some money into the system—that it is not just going to be a system where there is a trigger, there is a review and then virtually nothing happens.</para><para>Minister Newman, the past government took no notice. Senator Hill has now left the chamber, unfortunately. We are going to make sure that, when that agreement appears before the Senate, that trigger is actually going to mean something this time and it is not going to mean just more buck-passing and more words, which is really all we have had today.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>1301</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Public Works Committee</title><page.no>1301</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report</title><page.no>1301</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>1301</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Chee, Sen Bill</name><name role="display">Senator O'CHEE</name><name.id>EU4</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On behalf of Senator Calvert and the

This is a welcome change from the way in which we get responses from this government, and I thank the minister for that assistance. I am not altogether certain that he will thank me for my understanding of that assistance.</para><para>The Workplace Relations Act 1996 provided for the education ministers to make regulations in regard to approving authorities for apprenticeships and traineeships. They provided that any state or territory training authority and industry training advisory body, or any other body which meets the requirements set out in those regulations, could make orders in regard to those matters relating to the approving authority. The regulations that we have before us also go to allowing state and territory training authorities to delegate their powers and their functions as approving authorities to other bodies.</para><para>The government has sought to provide criteria under which such bodies should make determinations in regard to traineeships and apprenticeships. This went to the questions of whether there was adequate industry support, knowledge of the industry, knowledge of the competency approach to training, whether there was a capacity to have a protection against conflict of interest and a capacity to comply with the law. None of that is particularly surprising.</para><para>My concern, however, is with the detail and the way in which these measures work in practice. My concern is where this government is moving in terms of the operations of the vocational education and training system in this country. I am particularly concerned about the impact of these regulations on the issues arising from the conflict of interest that exists and the government's proposed strat 
 egies to manage those conflicts of interest where they do exist. The contention that I put to the Senate is that the strategies are not adequate to protect the interests of workers undertaking training and apprenticeship arrangements under these regulations.</para><para>We have to appreciate that the government's actions in this regard have to be seen in the broader context of the massive changes that are occurring to the vocational education and training system. We have a system of vocational education and training in this country which the government's own preferred and favourite consultant, KPMG, has indicated is totally under funded. You have a situation where the government is introducing a massive revamp of the apprenticeship system. They are introducing their so-called new apprenticeship scheme, which suggests, in regard to the massive advertising campaign they are running to support this program, massive growth in traineeships at the expense of traditional apprenticeship models of training. You have a government that talks increasingly of flexibility. But we have had a series of regulations before us today which would open the door to lower quality training and lower wages than currently exist.</para><para>We are witnessing dramatic changes to the form and method of delivery of vocational education. I am concerned about the way in which that form and that method of delivery actually impact on individual workers. I am concerned about the proliferation of private providers and the adequacy of existing measures, let alone measures proposed under this arrangement, to ensure that there is effective policing of the quality of training that is undertaken.</para><para>I have deep concerns about the loss of quality of training measures as a result of this government's changes to the vocational education system. It is a concern that not only I have; it is a concern that I believe is widely felt within industry. We are concerned about the levels of deskilling and the narrowing of training options for workers that are arising as a result of this government's actions, and which are now being replicated by various backward looking conservative state governments. We have seen in the states of Victoria 
 and Queensland moves to remove declaration of trades and vocations and replace them with so-called accredited courses. We have seen the undermining of the apprenticeship system and a proliferation of narrow enterprise based apprenticeships, limitations on portability and, in my opinion, a widespread exploitation which arises from the growth in what I call cheap and nasty training packages.</para><para>What you will see is a government that is pushing growth without proper funding in regard to the vocational education system. I have a fear that, as a consequence of that increase in levels of activity by various providers without funding, there must be a reduction in the level of quality. I am concerned that the government is launching an attack upon the apprenticeship system. We have seen their attempt to remove apprenticeship designations from federal awards, even where you have employers such as the MTIA and the ACM in agreement. We have seen actions by the government before various courts in this country to remove those longstanding provisions in awards reached by agreement. This is part of a general approach by this government to promote individual contracts for apprentices and trainees. It is a much easier vehicle to force young workers in particular to accept lower wages and lower levels of training.</para><para>The Senate ought not regard this as just an academic exercise. It ought to be seen in the context of what workers have to put up with in terms of the deskilling which arises from these actions. Deskilling for workers means fewer job opportunities, not more. It means lower wages, not higher wages. It means lower standards of living. These are regulations which, in my mind, will open the door to these actions by unscrupulous employers—ruthless employers who have no real interest in the long-term viability of training within industry.</para><para>These regulations have significant implications for workers—mostly young workers—in regard to their career paths, their pay, and of course the portability of qualifications and the integrity of the Australian qualification framework. They allow for an inconsistent use of the qualification levels.</para><para>These regulations, in my view, are a device to provide for a more flexible interpretation of the various commitments that this government has already given to the Australian Democrats when the original debate occurred on the workplace relations regulations. They are commitments which we said at the time were totally inadequate and which are being demonstrated to be so by these regulations. They provide a vehicle to circumvent the national training award. They allow for variations in awards under the so-called disadvantage test and they will provide a vehicle for various employers who seek to use them to reduce trainee and apprenticeship wages.</para><para>These regulations should be opposed because the approving authority acts within guidelines which fail to prevent a number of quite serious problems. These guidelines are fundamentally flawed. There are a number of inadequacies which are highlighted by the fact that existing employees who are under awards get their full rate when training but under these arrangements they could have their pay reduced. A further inadequacy is that an apprenticeship could be retitled as a traineeship and there would be a subsequent reduction in wages as a result.</para><para>Further inadequacies are the fact that national training wage award traineeships could be renamed in order to provide so-called new flexible traineeships. That new designation is a device by which unscrupulous employers can use the determinations of these so-called approving authorities to seek variations to awards under the no disadvantage test—in so doing, the rates of pay of workers engaged in training are reduced. The regulations also have transitional arrangements in them which in themselves highlight the inadequacies of the government's approach. The transitional arrangements are so vague that we could end up seeing arrangements that fit either the old or the new models—whichever suits the employer. That is all very well if you have a good employer or an employer who is committed to long-term training in an industry, but that is sadly not the case all too often. Section 8 of these regulations says:</para><para>. . . The Australian vocational education and training system is currently undergoing a number of substantial reforms. These reforms may take some time to finalise at the national level and to be implemented by industry.</para><para>It continues at 8.1:</para><para>A training agreement may not be available at the time at which approval of a traineeship or apprenticeship for the purposes of the Act is sought from the approving authority. In these circumstances, it will be necessary for the approving authority to consider the traineeship or apprenticeship for approval under sections 170XC or 170XD of the Act without these agreements. In deciding whether to approve an apprenticeship or a traineeship and in making  determinations for those which are approved the approving authority may take into account information such as the following about the training arrangements for the traineeship or apprenticeship:</para><para>This is quite clearly far too vague an arrangement, far too serious a matter to be left in the hands of approving authorities under these circumstances. </para><para>The whole truth of the matter is quite simple. What this government is seeking to do under these regulations is to get around section 170X of the Workplace Relations Act. This section excludes the approving authority from being able to make any determination under 170XC with regard to the national training wage traineeships. Under the Workplace Relations Act, if an AWA or a CA is entered into by a trainee then the award, for the purpose of the no disadvantage test, can be either, firstly, a national training award for the national training wage traineeship; or, secondly, if it is not a national training award traineeship, the junior wage rate in the parent award is adjusted where necessary by an approving authority determination of training hours.</para><para>The Commonwealth is trying to say under these measures  that a traineeship that uses exactly the same materials, goes for the same period of time, has the same working hours and provides an identical qualification under the national training award traineeships could have a new designation as a so-called flexible traineeship and hence is no longer eligible for the rates of pay as set down in the Workplace Relations Act.</para><para>For many industries that will mean large pay cuts for individual workers. For example, a young person in the metal industry could have their pay cut from $170 a week to $104.40 a week. This is before any determination is made about hours spent in training. Under these regulations there are a whole series of measures which seem reasonable on the surface but, when you look at the detail, they could quite seriously disadvantage the wages and conditions of workers engaged in training or an apprenticeship.</para><para>If the approving authority makes such a determination, the young person will have their pay reduced even further than I have already indicated. So there is a double attack on wages and conditions under these regulations—an approach that can produce lower hourly rates of pay and a potential drop in the number of hours they actually get paid for. With most awards, the more time that is spent in training, the less money is actually paid.</para><para>There are other problems with the guidelines. The answer to those problems is not in having more approving authorities. I believe that the regulations fail to meet the criteria which have already been agreed to by the government and Australian Democrats at the time of the workplace relations debate. As I understand it, that agreement involved a proposed regulation which would `contain guidelines on who else may qualify as an approving authority. They would deal with issues such as necessary expertise, the need to avoid conflict of interest, the necessity for training courses to comply with national competency standards etc. They could also allow state training authorities to delegate their function as an approving authority to other bodies, but only if strict criteria are met.' These strict crieria are not being met.</para><para>These regulations are part of the government's attempt to decrease apprentices' pay and conditions and reduce the quality of training that they receive. In recent estimates hearings we heard of an increasing tendency for a proliferation of these so-called private providers, including industry training advisory bodies. It is clear that, under these regulations, they would automatically get approval, yet there quite clearly is a conflict of interest 
 for an advisory body to act as an employing body. For the individual worker, that can mean nothing but trouble. These regulations need to be seen in the broader context of what is happening to the vocational education and training system in this country.</para><para>This government has reduced employer subsidies for taking on apprentices by some 40 per cent. There has been a sharp decline in apprenticeship numbers. This government's policies mean that apprenticeships are being replaced by short-term—often very short-term—traineeships. We have seen a narrowing of the training base and a deskilling of workers. We have seen the growth in apprenticeship commitments drop by 25 per cent in the last two years. This government is projecting a growth of some 12,000 new traineeships, compared to a growth of only 2,667 apprenticeships. </para><para>We are seeing a shift away from apprenticeships to traineeships, but we are not seeing adequate protection for workers under these new arrangements. We are seeing a move to short-term quick fix training, which increasingly is being encouraged by private providers. TAFE directors tell me that these matters are increasingly of concern in so far as they involve persons who will not necessarily have a commitment to the long-term interests of training in any particular industry.</para><para>This government is overseeing a period of great confusion, a period of great uncertainty. Many employers now believe that apprenticeships do not exist at all; that only traineeships are operating. There is a lack of promotion and an absence of any real commitment by this government to quality vocational education and training. We are seeing privatisation of public institutions and privatisation of our TAFE colleges. We are seeing massive job shedding in the public sector in that regard, which has, of course, impacted on the number of apprenticeships being offered by the public sector. All these things have combined to produce a culture which is, I think, highly negative for the advancement of training for young people in this country.</para><para>There is also a move by some agencies within government to use the training regime introduced by this government to exploit 
 workers. One example was brought to my attention recently. A 50-year-old fully trained printer was placed in a printing industry traineeship. In his first five weeks in the traineeship he was working unsupervised and was not being paid for overtime. There was no training involved in his placement. He was, of course, being used as nothing more than cheap labour by the company concerned, rather than being provided with adequate training.</para><para>This government talks about devolution of these authorities to state governments, but we have to look at the records of those state governments. They have been sacking very large numbers of workers in the public sector and they are reducing their commitment to training. Some six per cent of training undertaken by the private sector is in apprenticeships; a figure considerably less than has traditionally been the case. The Victorian government has abolished declared trades. Allowances are now being made for the dismissal of apprentices despite various arrangements which normally protect apprentices from unfair dismissal.</para><para>We are seeing the removal of the right to continue in an apprenticeship upon the transmission of any particular business. We are seeing the removal of scrutiny by the state board of young people undertaking apprenticeships in various trades. We are seeing an open-ended probation period for apprentices. A general decline in the level of protection is now being experienced by apprentices and trainees. These regulations will do nothing more than increase the vulnerability of young workers. But it will not be just young workers who are affected; older workers who are obliged to undertake training programs—so-called traineeships which are, of course, nothing more than cheap labour schemes—will also be affected.</para><para>Most employers, from my dealings with them, have a long-term commitment to training and apprenticeships—most big employers, that is. The problem is that smaller employers often do not have that commitment. The fly-by-night operators, the unscrupulous operators, are undermining the commitment to training of the more scrupulous and those who 
 actually are interested in the long-term future of their industry. This measure will only exacerbate the pressure upon the reasonable employers who are committed to ensuring there is adequate protection and quality of provision. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>1311</page.no><name role="metadata">Tierney, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator TIERNEY</name><name.id>O15</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on the motion moved by Senator Carr. He has moved:</para></talk.start><para>That the Workplace Relations Regulations (Amendment), as contained in Statutory Rules 1997 No. 314 and made under the Workplace Relations Act 1996, be disallowed.</para><para>Senator Carr has presented one of his usual diatribes here today. We have had continuing slagging of the business sector and what the business sector might do; fly-by-night operators; unscrupulous people. This is the usual old union rhetoric that we hear when the Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate tries to denigrate what is happening out there in the workplace.</para><para>The reality of what is happening in the workplace is that, as we move into a very rapidly changing industrial structure, we need a much more flexible approach to training. What we have put forward here is a series of regulations, after careful consultation with a wide group of people, that very carefully set up this new system. There have been negotiations across parties. There have been negotiations with industry.</para><para>Senator Carr has to realise that we are moving into this new world. The old type of approach that we had previously, particularly the standard type of apprenticeship that might have run for four years, is just not appropriate anymore in the current industrial environment. That is why, when we brought in the new system, we called it a new apprenticeship system to reflect those changes.</para><para>It took the Labor Party a very long time to wake up to the need for changing the way in which we handle training in this country. That is shown, Senator Carr, by the absolutely dismal record of your government over 13 years in the apprenticeship area. You should hang your heads in shame that you, the Labor Party, the party that claims to represent the workers, did so little for people in basic training in the apprenticeship system.</para><para>One of the reasons why it failed, apart from the ineptitude of your government, was the very rapidly changing nature of industry and the globalisation of our economy. The way in which that led to less security in business meant that the old approach where you might require an employer to put someone on for about four years just was not going to work anymore. This government has come up with a much better and more carefully crafted approach, a much more flexible approach, so that you can get a range of different types of training systems that work that are more targeted to what is needed on the job front.</para><para>I know this goes against Labor's broad view, Senator Carr. I know it goes against your own inclinations on the way things should be structured. I know from your speeches in this place over many years that you like this big, centralised, top-down type system with a lot of central controls. Those days are now passed. That is not the appropriate way to run things. We have delegated this to a broader range of providers in a far more flexible approach to its control.</para><para>Regulation 30ZR states the criteria to be met to be declared an approving authority and says that the proposed authority must have experience and expertise in vocational education and training. The minister must be satisfied that the proposed authority will act fairly. Regulation 30ZS enables the delegation of approving authority functions by state or territory training authorities which are declared. I do not understand why Senator Carr actually opposes that. The explanatory statement of the regulations makes it clear that its purpose is to allow the powers and the functions of approving authorities to be more widely devolved and assist in making the vocational education and training system more responsive to the needs of business and industry.

There are certain core skills you need as a bricklayer, and probably about 95 per cent of the time that is all you do in bricklaying. On top of that, of course, there is some very fancy work that you can do in bricklaying—the way you do semicircles, the way you put in very special types of brickwork. It might take you the full apprenticeship to develop that but, initially, at the entry level, you do not need that. Would it not be far better to spend less time on some of those skills and then, by some post approach to the initial training, develop those skills further on?</para><para>That is the sort of flexibility that we feel we need in the workplace. That is not the flexibility that I assume you are advocating. What are you advocating, Senator Carr? We have not really heard. You have been very negative, very critical, about what the government is proposing, but what are you suggesting, Senator Carr? Are you suggesting that 
 perhaps we go back to four-year apprenticeships? How did you go under that? Didn't you end up with 60,000? What a disgraceful record at the end of 13 years. Under our proposal, we are moving to 200,000 apprenticeships, traineeships. Under what we are proposing is a move that more reflects what is going on in the economy of this nation. So you stand up here with very little credibility, given what happened under the previous government.</para><para>We are making the vocational education and training system much more responsive to the needs of business and industry. The regulations that we formed, the ones that are here being considered today, have been formed after a wide range of consultation with all parties. Those consultations fulfilled and went beyond the strict requirement of the agreement that was made with the Australian Democrats on the passage of the Workplace Relations Bill. With this government's policy, apprenticeships and traineeships will be more attractive to business and industry, Senator Carr. Let me emphasise the reason: they are more flexible, they are often not as long and businesses are more likely to take people on.</para><para>These regulations are part of the government's effort to create more entry level training opportunity, particularly for young people. Senator Carr, it seems, and the Labor Party, which he represents, want to hinder that. These regulations should not be disallowed. Senator Carr said he is concerned about the approving authority. Again, I think this is part of his centralist approach. He is missing several very important points in terms of approving authorities.</para><para>There are now three approving authorities. They are already declared under the act's existing provisions, and these authorities are actively making determinations. Let me clear this up for Senator Carr. He has left the chamber and that is a pity, as I was just going to clear up this point for him. The approving authorities make determinations about the effect of training on work time and progressions through wage levels. Let me repeat that—and I hope Senator Carr is listening to this somewhere—they make determinations on the effect on work time and progressions 
 through wage levels. When Senator Carr was standing there slagging what we were doing, and what he is proposing in disallowing the regulations, he was trying to claim that this was going to lead to a drop in wage levels, but these authorities do not set wages.</para><para>These regulations contain strict criteria that have to be met to be declared an approving authority. Proposed authorities must have experience and expertise in vocational education and training. The minister must be totally satisfied that the proposed authority will act fairly. These criteria will ensure that approving authorities are aboveboard, and this should relieve the concerns that Senator Carr raised earlier.</para><para>These safeguards show that the opposition is not correct in claiming that these regulations will dilute the quality of training received by apprentices and trainees. Approving authorities will only make determinations on apprenticeships and traineeships which sit within the national training framework and lead to nationally recognised qualifications. This government has ensured that these regulations will not result in the exploitation of apprentices or trainees. Why is the opposition pretending to be concerned about apprentices and trainees when the apprenticeship system collapsed totally under the ALP's 13 years of mismanagement in this area?</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>1313</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Australian Democrats will be supporting the disallowance motion moved today by the opposition. We are well aware of the changing nature of not only the workplace but the education environment and, in particular, the training environment. We are very conscious of the need for flexibility, and indeed some reform, within that training environment. However, this does not mean that we are willing to accept a lack of quality or a reduction in quality in that environment, nor are we prepared to throw out accountability mechanisms or channels through which we can ensure there is quality accreditation, especially when it comes to providers of training. So we share the concerns articulated by Senator Carr on behalf of the opposition today in relation 
 to accreditation and quality in the training environment. It is those concerns that motivate us to support the disallowance motion before us.</para></talk.start><para>I should also add that we are acutely aware of the need for greater education and training opportunities for people in the Australian community—in particular, for young Australians. We have expressed many times in this place our concern with both sides of the chamber but, in particular, with the current government, which has compounded the high levels of youth unemployment by scaling back funding for education and training opportunities for young Australians. We are acutely aware of the need for an injection of funds to ensure that young Australians, in particular, have access to skills development and the acquisition of knowledge. We all know—and certainly, Senator Tierney, this is a sentiment I got from your speech—that education, training and skills acquisition are the keys to a successful and competitive workplace.</para><para>I only have to draw the Senate's attention to the Dusseldorp Skills Forum report that was released on Friday to demonstrate that there is a lack of education, training and employment opportunities for young people in Australia today. I wish to place on record, for the second time today, my disappointment at the failure of the government and the opposition to respond in any meaningful detail to the Dusseldorp Skills Forum report. I think that report raises some devastating concerns for this government and for previous governments. So the Democrats are very concerned about the nature of the training environment.</para><para>We note that the Workplace Relations Act 1996 established a framework, if you like, for more flexible apprenticeships and traineeships. The act actually provides for individual Australian workplace agreements for apprenticeships and traineeships, allowing for part-time training or modification of other award provisions subject to the overall no disadvantage test. However, these agreements require that the actual apprenticeships or traineeships be approved by an approving authority as being within the national training framework 
 and of course fair to the trainees involved. Under the act, the minister can declare as approving authorities state training authorities—for example, TAFE departments, industry training advisory boards or such other bodies that meet the requirements.</para><para>I should at this point acknowledge Senator Tierney's point that there was consultation in the lead-up to the formulation of the provisions in the act, but I must put on record that he was wrong when he claimed that the agreement organised between the government and the Democrats on this particular section of the act has been met and that the strict criteria have been fulfilled, because that has not happened. If that had happened, the Democrats may have been partial to support the government on this, but we will not support the government because we are very angry that the strict criteria that were laid down as part of those negotiations and consultations have not been met. So I place on the record very strongly the fact that Senator Tierney was wrong in his statement in the chamber earlier in relation to meeting the guidelines and the criteria developed between the Democrats and the government.</para><para>We made it clear in our 1996 agreement with the government that the regulations must contain clear guidelines on the types of bodies to become approving authorities, including the necessary expertise, the need to avoid conflicts of interests and the necessity for training courses to comply with national competency standards. The regulations presented by the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Dr Kemp, fall short of these conditions simply through their use of such general terms. We know that this could allow the minister to designate many unqualified or perhaps biased organisations as training authorities, opening up the prospect of substandard training programs being approved with the wages of trainees and apprentices cut as a result.</para><para>The ACTU agrees and concurs with us on this point—that is, the strict criteria laid down by the Democrats has not been met. I quote from a letter from the ACTU Assistant Secretary, Tim Palace. He writes that the regula 
 tions do not meet the strict criteria. The correspondence states:</para><para>The regulations fail to meet the criteria agreed with the Australian Democrats.</para><para>This is completely contrary to the assertions we have just had from Senator Tierney in this place. It goes on to read:</para><para>The agreement between the Commonwealth Government and the Australian Democrats provided that:</para><para>a) 	 The Minister may declare as an approving authority a State or Territory Training authority, an Industry Training Advisory Body (ITAB) or any other body which meets the requirements set out in a Regulation (4.7 and 170x). </para><para>b)	 The regulation would contain guidelines on who may qualify as an approving authority based on strict criteria to avoid conflict of interest, ensure necessary expertise and ensure training complies with national competency standards etc (4.8).</para><para>c)	 The guidelines would be developed in conjunction with governments, employers and unions through the ANTA process (4.9).</para><para>d)	 There will also be guidelines concerning the way an approving authority is to carry out its functions (4.10).</para><para>The criteria have not been satisfied. For that reason, the Democrats today will be supporting the repeal of the regulation on training authorities. We are not ruling out a redrafted regulation. As I said in my speech during the second reading debate in this place on the Workplace Relations Bill in 1996:</para><para>We are of the firm view that training arrangements should not be approved unless they are in the best interests of trainees. It is their interests, not the interests of employers, that must be paramount. From that point of view, we oppose the suggestion that training arrangements in AWAs could be approved by people who are not competent to do so, by local employment councils synonymous with local chambers of commerce as I believe has been suggested by some. Training arrangements must be consistent with the national training framework and regional training standards as enforced by state training authorities, industry training bodies and other such bodies.</para><para>They were the comments made in the chamber at that time of the bill's passage. But the government has failed to date to establish the need for this particular regulation that has been presented by the minister—that is, the 
 government has failed to show exactly what sort of additional approving authorities are needed. So far under the act the only bodies to be declared approving authorities have been the state TAFE authorities. Assuming that the industry training boards follow, it is a little difficult to see why additional bodies would be needed. I ask the minister perhaps when he comments on the disallowance motion before us to explain why we need additional bodies because I am starting to wonder why indeed we do.</para><para>The tendering out of employment services to private providers and the compulsion of young people to work for their meagre unemployment benefits through the work for the dole scheme highlights the need for close examination of this particular regulation. In this context, the quality of training must not be compromised and it is essential that there remains a clear and firm gatekeeper on the quality of training and, through that, the operation of the no disadvantage test on AWAs under the Workplace Relations Act.</para><para>In voting to disallow this regulation, the Democrats are saying to the government, to the minister, if you insist you can bring it back later, but bring it back when and if you have a clearer idea of exactly who the additional approving authorities will be and what criteria will be applied to ensure that such authorities will act in the best interests of trainees and apprentices.</para><para>I wish to turn very briefly to another example of this government's failure to ensure adequate opportunities, employment wise and training wise, for young people just to highlight another area where the government should be assisting traineeships and apprenticeships. Perhaps the minister would like to address this in his comments: the decision by the government to make massive cuts and changes to the CRAFT scheme, the Commonwealth rebate for apprentice full-time training scheme. I understand the government seeks to make a saving of $133 million by the changes and the cuts to this scheme.</para><para>In conjunction with the regulations we have before us, it really suggests that the government's agenda for training and training reform in this country is a sorry one indeed. 
 I ask the minister whether or not this is simply a penny-pinching, revenue raising exercise on behalf of the government because I cannot see how they will be assisting young people or indeed their trainers or employers by making cuts to the CRAFT scheme. We know currently employers receive around $2,500 tax free if they take on new full-time apprentices under the CRAFT scheme. Yet the budget last year announced that this incentive will be made taxable with a further payment of $1,500 made available upon completion of the apprenticeship roughly three years later.</para><para>For an unincorporated small business, the effect of these measures is to reduce the commencement and progression incentives by around $1,200 after tax. Even after receiving the final payment a small business would be still around $440 worse off. Incorporated business will lose $900 after tax on the commencement and progression incentives with the difference only being made up with the final payment when the apprenticeship is completed.</para><para>So the result of these changes may be a substantial budget saving of around $133 million over four years but these changes inevitably make taking on apprentices less attractive for employers, particularly employers in small businesses. This is a particular concern given that the number of apprentices is estimated to have fallen dramatically in recent years from around $49,742 commencements in 1994-95 to $43,930 in 1995-96 to just $40,495 in 1996-97. So clearly now is not the time to be cutting apprenticeships, let alone incentives to employers to take on apprentices.</para><para>The Democrats remain committed to fostering an environment where perhaps the training environment can be more flexible but we will not do so at the expense of quality or at the expense of accountability and certainly when it comes to the regulation of and approval of those various industry and training approval authorities. We will be supporting the disallowance motion before the chamber today.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>1315</page.no><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name><name.id>SF4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Senator Carr and Senator Stott Despoja have 
 made quite convincing arguments as to why these workplace relations regulations should be disallowed. The other speaker so far has been Senator Tierney. In my view, what he had to say showed, again, why these regulations should be disallowed. He painted a very rosy picture but he based it on suppositions, or facts, if you like, which may or may not be accepted but which are not prescribed in these regulations. In other words, he painted a picture which may or may not be borne out in fact but which, in any event, is not provided for in these regulations. That is the problem with these regulations. As Senator Stott Despoja said, there may be a basis upon which a further set of regulations can be approved but certainly not these ones.</para></talk.start><para>I will explain that in a little more detail. These regulations are proposed to make effective part VIE of the Workplace Relations Act. Part VIA talks about the minimum entitlements of employees; part VIB talks about certified agreements; part VID talks about Australian workplace agreements and part VIE, which I shall refer to, talks about the no disadvantage test in respect of which these regulations are to operate.</para><para>Those parts deal with conditions and the remuneration which are to be received by employees employed by different people. These regulations talk about an approving authority. An approving authority has the function, as has been stated by Senator Carr, of putting into operation a plan whereby apprentices or apprentice-like employees can be remunerated. These approving authorities have considerable influence on what wages people will receive. That can be ascertained from section 170XC of the workplace relations legislation. Subsection 2 states:</para><para>For the purposes of subsection (1)—</para><para>that is, working out a proportion of the wages that a person is to lose by undertaking training—</para><para>the appropriate percentage of the benchmark rate is such percentage of that rate as is determined in writing by the approving authority having regard to the reduction in the productive time of an employee undertaking the approved traineeship due to time spent in training. 
</para><para>So the approving authority has to make a decision as to how much time is productive time when a person is in training. The employee cannot determine how much time is productive, nor can the employer. It is up to the approving authority, and it is up to the approving authority to ascertain whether a particular traineeship is a worthy one or not.</para><para>The approving authority has a very important part to play in the scheme of training. It is for that reason that the definition of approving authority in the act says that the approving authority means any person or unincorporated body that—</para><para>. . . is a state or territory training authority that exercises approval powers in relation to traineeships or apprenticeships—</para><para>and it says that if the state has a system whereby these approving authorities are set up, those approving authorities are worthy approving authorities for the purposes of the Commonwealth act, and that seems to be reasonable—</para><para>or is an Industry Training Advisory Body—</para><para>again that seems reasonable—</para><para>or meets the criteria prescribed for the purposes of this definition; and is declared in writing to be an approving authority for the purposes of this Part. . . </para><para>Given the seriousness of this matter, the criteria prescribed, one would have thought, should be very precise and defined. This part of the act is dedicated to the training of people and it is likely that it is going to be young people who will be affected and it is young people that need protection. If they have any disputes with a training authority and an approving authority they should be able to judge against very precise criteria whether or not the proposed authority is a proper one and is doing the work that it should do. It is important to find out what the criteria are. It is at that point that these regulations come into serious question because it is stated:</para><para>The prescribed criteria in relation to a person or unincorporated body (`<inline font-weight="bold">the proposed authority'</inline> ) for the purposes of paragraph (c)—</para><para>that is the one I have been speaking about—</para><para>of the definition of `approving authority' in section 170X of the Act are that the Minister is satisfied that the proposed authority has:</para><para>. . . skills and experience of a high order in the field of vocational 	 education and training . . . </para><para>What does that mean? Where are there any prescriptions about what skills and experiences of a high order involve? It is simply up to the minister to be satisfied of that. The second criterion states that the approving authority has:</para><para>. . . the capacity to act fairly in discharging the functions of an approving authority.</para><para>What is meant by `fairly' in this context? Fair to whom? Does it mean fair in terms of the economic soundness of the business? Does it mean fair in terms of whether or not the person is getting proper training? What does it mean by saying that all that the minister has to be satisfied of is the approving authority's capacity to act fairly? Why should the criterion not be that the minister is satisfied that the approving authority will act fairly. Any of us have a capacity to act fairly, but the real question is will we act fairly. To define an approving authority as one that has the capacity to act fairly seems to me to be too vague and too unsafe to allow through. The regulations go on to state:</para><para>For the purposes of paragraph 1(b), the Minister must consider whether the proposed authority, if declared to be an approving authority, will be likely to balance the interests of trainees or apprentices with those of employees in:</para><para>(a) approving traineeships and apprenticeships; and</para><para>(b) making determinations under section 170XC and 170XD of the Act.</para><para>Again, this is a standard which is hard to judge. I would ask the minister, who is very knowledgeable and skilled in this area, whether it would not be better to have a lot more precise criteria so that a young person could judge whether he or she is being properly treated.</para><para>The regulations, as they stand at the moment, are very vague. They are not the sort of regulations against which a person who might be interested can test whether or not the conditions have been met. How do you test whether an approving authority is likely to balance the interests of trainees or apprentices 
 with those of the employers? What are the interests of trainees and apprentices? What are the interests of the employers?</para><para>The other problem with these regulations is delegation. The regulations go on to state:</para><para>An approving authority that is a State or Territory training authority may delegate its powers . . . and functions to:</para><para>(a) a State or Territory training authority of the same State . . .</para><para>It seems reasonable that if states have approved authorities then that, hopefully, should be some protection. Part (c) states in relation to an approving authority delegating its powers that it can delegate its powers to:</para><para>(c) a person or unincorporated body that, in the opinion of the approving authority, has:</para><para>	 (i)  skills and experience of a high order in the field of vocational education and training; and</para><para>	 (ii) the capacity to act fairly in discharging the functions of an approved authority.</para><para>We can have an approving authority that can delegate its functions to another approving authority which it judges will act fairly. Again, what does that mean? The approving authority that is going to give the approval does not have to be satisfied that its delegate will act fairly but just that it has the capacity to do so. It is quite vague and quite at large and should not be passed in its present form.</para><para>There should be a set of regulations that prescribes in considerable detail what fairness means when talking about the interests of the employer and the interests of the apprentice. Does it mean that they should be given fair hours? Does it mean that they should be given proper training? What does proper training mean? Does it mean that you should have so many hours theoretical training, so many hours practical training or so many hours experience? The problem with these regulations is that they cannot be effectively tested by the people who might want to test them.</para><para>An employer might want to test a decision that is made by an approving authority. An employer might want to test the results of a decision of an approving authority. A young apprentice or a union that represents that young apprentice might want to do that. I ask the minister when he is replying to this matter 
 to give us some idea of how a person who is unskilled in the law and might not be experienced in the way these things work can go to these regulations and work out whether they have been applied or not.</para><para>It is going to be very difficult for such a person to judge that because the way regulation 314 of 1997 is written it is so vague that it cannot be tested. It is bad to have regulations which cannot be tested. It is bad to have, in effect, a mission statement containing a set of aspirations rather than what regulations ought to be—that is, a prescription that people can use to measure whether or not they have been properly treated under the act or under the regulations themselves.</para><para>These regulations are very much like the preamble to an act. They are not in any way an exercise of what ought to be the power to make regulations—that is, to make specific and precise statements about what is going to happen under a particular act. Until they are tightened, until they are made more specific and until they are put in a state where an apprentice, a trainee or an employer can ascertain whether or not what is done under them is within the regulations or not, they should not be allowed to continue.</para><para>I congratulate Senator Carr in bringing forward this motion and congratulate the Democrats in picking up the lead that has been given in seeing that these regulations are in a satisfactory state. Indeed, any regulations put forward in this form would be unsatisfactory. I invite the Senate to reject them.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>1318</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Schools, Vocational Education and Training</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—At the outset, I thank senators for their contributions in this debate. It may be of some assistance to the Senate if we look to section 170X of the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Act which deals with the no disadvantage test but more particularly the definition of an approving authority. The act states:</para></talk.start><para><inline font-style="italic">approving authority</inline>  means any person or unincorporated body that:</para><para>	 (a) is a State or Territory training authority that exercises approval powers in 
 relation to traineeships or apprenticeships; or</para><para>	 (b) is an Industry Training Advisory Body; or</para><para>	 (c) meets the criteria prescribed for the purposes of this definition.</para><para>Within the act itself we have coverage of the state training authorities and the industry training advisory bodies. The main complaint seems to be in relation to the criteria prescribed for the purposes of this definition in so far as it relates to other bodies. What we have before us are regulations which are made pursuant to this very section.</para><para>Regulation 30ZR deals with the criteria that the minister has to have regard to when looking at an approving authority. That criterion, which was touched on by Senator Cooney, states:</para><para>. . . that the Minister has to be satisfied that the proposed authority—</para><para>which of course will make determinations about the structured training that someone needs to do in relation to a traineeship or apprenticeship—</para><para>has:</para><para>(a) 	 skills and experience of a high order in the field of vocational education and training.</para><para>In the first instance, there is a requirement of satisfaction which is of a high degree. Not only that, but the minister also has to be satisfied that this body has a capacity to act fairly in discharging the functions of an approving authority.</para><para>Senator Cooney touched on what it means to act fairly. If you read on, you see that, for the purposes of this subparagraph which deals with acting fairly, subregulation (2) says:</para><para>. . . the Minister must consider whether the proposed authority, if declared to be an approving authority, will be likely to balance the interests of trainees or apprentices with those of employers.</para><para>That is a weighty consideration indeed. As far as discretions go, I would submit that this criterion is definitive because it requires the minister to address his or her mind to the fact of balance, balancing the interests of trainees or apprentices with those of employers. That is what then leads the minister to conclude whether this body would have the capacity to act fairly. We need to remember that state and 
 territory training authorities have already been provided for in the act.</para><para>During the debate, Senator Stott Despoja queried why we should have the delegation power contained in the second regulation, 30ZS. Senator Stott Despoja misunderstood the reason for that delegation. It is essential for the state training authorities to have the ability to delegate. Senator Stott Despoja mentioned the question of TAFEs. TAFEs are not state training authorities. It may well be desirable that a TAFE might be necessarily categorised as such, but in order to achieve that status it would need the state training authority to have the power of delegation.</para><para>If TAFEs were to be included, as Senator Stott Despoja was alluding to, you would have to have this power of delegation for state training authorities. It is already the case that in Queensland, Victoria and Western Australia there are existing authorities which have been approved. In relation to other states where the state training authority wants to delegate, it is essential that they have the power to do so under this regulation.</para><para>With respect to the no disadvantage test, that is one which is applied in a compendious manner in part 6E of the act. It is translated in a more definitive way into these regulations. In fact, I think Senator Carr said that there was a danger that trainees or apprentices could suffer a reduction in wages by these approving authorities making determinations which would have the effect of reducing wages.</para><para>The government has announced its minimum training wage top up scheme. That is a scheme which will guarantee a training wage for people involved as trainees or apprentices, and I can give you the figures. For a 16-year-old, it is $134 per week; for a 17-year-old, it is $165 per week; and for an 18-year-old or over, it is $206. Any training above AQF 3 or higher is $231 a week. That is the national training wage. If, by inadvertence, a wage is reduced to below that, then it will be topped up to that minimum training wage level. So there you have the safety net, as it were, in a wage sense.</para><para>The other point raised by Senator Carr was that there might be some dilution of training, 
 that there might be a deleterious effect on the training levels. It is part of this whole structure that an approving authority can only operate within the national training framework; that is, the state, Commonwealth and territory governments have come to agree on a national training framework, which applies across Australia. Contained in that is the Australian recognition framework, which I will come to shortly. That in itself has standards within which the approving authorities have to act.</para><para>The other point which was raised by Senator Carr was the portability of skills. The portability of skills is ensured by the Australian recognition framework, which puts in place the very aspect of national recognition of training; that is, you can qualify in one part of the country and be recognised in another. That is most important and is something which is not affected in any deleterious sense by these regulations.</para><para>In relation to the question of the Dusseldorp report which was referred to by Senator Stott Despoja, that was mentioned in the context of scaling back funding. I think the point which Senator Stott Despoja was making was that the Commonwealth government had scaled back funding and that the Dusseldorp report was in some way critical of the government's approach in this regard.</para><para>I remind the Senate that the Dusseldorp report related to the years 1985 to 1996, 10 years of which were under the previous Labor government, most of them under the member for Brand, Mr Kim Beazley, who was then the minister for employment and training. What the Dusseldorp report said was that young people between the ages of 15 and 19 had not progressed during that period. There had been a decline in apprenticeships, there had been a fall in retention rates—in fact, from 1992 to 1996 there had been a slip from 77 per cent to 71 per cent—and there had been, overall, a poor state of affairs indeed for young people in education and training. This is a conclusion by an independent report dealing with a period where 10 years out of 11 were under the previous Labor government. </para><para>I remind Senator Stott Despoja that this government has committed $187 million over four years for vocational education and training in schools. This is an essential starting point for vocational training for young people. What we are looking at is not just leaving it until the young person leaves school and then look at training them; we are looking at picking them up during the school system and funding programs which will pick up these young people who need to build a bridge from school into vocational training. In fact, what we are looking at are school based apprenticeships and traineeships, which are very much a thing for the future.</para><para>The Commonwealth has funding there for that. This is more than what the Labor government spent in its previous term in office which spanned some 13 years. I remind both the opposition and Senator Stott Despoja of that. But it does not stop there.</para><para>When you look back to June last year, the figure for apprentices and trainees, which would largely be younger people, was up 11 per cent from 1996, and that is pointing towards the government and its good policies. It is a positive step forward that this government has taken in relation to young apprentices and trainees. In fact, we will be introducing from 1 May new apprenticeship centres which are a one stop shop, streamlined application of how you go about becoming a trainee or apprentice. It does not only help the young person or older person who wants to go into training; it also helps those employers who, up until now, have thought the system too rigid and too hidebound in red tape.</para><para>The Commonwealth will also be allocating some $265 million in the 1997-98 financial year which will be devoted to the creation of more than 100,000 apprenticeships. Indigenous trainees for the financial year 1996-97 figured some 5,000, which compares greatly to 817 indigenous trainees in the financial year of 1994-95, the last complete year under the previous Labor rule.</para><para>When people say that there is a cutback in funding, they really are barking up the wrong tree in relation to this government. When they cite the Dusseldorp report as being in some 
 way critical of the present government, it relates to a period in which for 10 years this government was not the government of the day.</para><para>Getting back to these regulations, these regulations provide safeguards in the exercise of ministerial discretion. They provide for delegation for the state training authorities, which is necessary if this is to operate smoothly around the country for those states who wish to delegate. It is a situation where the no disadvantage test has been translated from the act itself to apply to these approving authorities. For those who say, `Why should you have this flexibility?', I say that the whole regime of this new training approach is to have flexibility.</para><para>Senator Stott Despoja conceded in her address to the Senate that we are embarking on a new age of training—investing for the future and investing in our young people—which will take us into the next millennium. We need to be more flexible and we need to adapt to the times. That requires a training regime which is flexible and responsive to the needs of industry and the community. Therefore, we need the sort of flexibility where a ministerial discretion can be applied, but applied in a strict sense and with strict criteria.</para><para>The situation I pointed to at the outset—and that brings me back to that very first point—is that, if a state training authority were to delegate to a TAFE, it would need the power to do so under that second regulation 30ZS, because TAFEs are not by their nature state training authorities and do not come within the definition of section 170X of the act.</para><para>These regulations provide the security. We have a national training wage which provides a safety net—and I have mentioned the figures. These regulations provide the flexibility which is needed in the new training regime and, most importantly, these regulations translate the no disadvantage test into effect.</para><para>	 Question put:</para><para>	 That the motion (<inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carr's</inline> ) be agreed to.</para></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>18:16:00</time.stamp><para>The Senate divided.	</para></division.header><para>(The President—Senator the Hon.

The matter he raises is the alleged failure of Senator Parer to register and declare relevant interests in accordance with the resolutions of the Senate relating to senator's interests of 17 March 1994.</para></talk.start><para>Resolution four of the Senate's privileges resolutions require me to have regard to certain criteria in determining whether a motion should have precedence. Those criteria are designed to ensure that only sufficiently serious matters are referred to the Privileges Committee. Those criteria, however, are, in 
 effect, pre-empted by the resolutions relating to senator's interests which include a provision that a senator who knowingly fails to register interests correctly in accordance with the resolution shall be guilty of a serious contempt of the Senate and shall be dealt with by the Senate accordingly, but the question whether any senator has committed such a serious contempt shall first be referred to the Privileges Committee for inquiry and report and may not be considered by any other committee.</para><para>The Senate having declared by that resolution that knowingly failing to register interests is a serious contempt, such a matter meets the criteria I am required to consider. The resolution relating to the declaration of interests does not contain a similar declaration that a failure to declare interests is a serious contempt, but it would be open to the Senate to treat such a failure to declare interest as with any other order of the Senate. I, therefore, give precedence to a motion to refer the matter to the Privileges Committee.</para><para>If the reference is made, it will be then for the Privileges Committee to inquire and determine whether Senator Parer has knowingly failed to register or declare relevant interests.

I realise that we could take half an hour or so, but I certainly won't. I believe that it really speaks for itself. The Energy Research and Development Corporation was set up to manage the federal government's direct investment in energy innovation and research in energy supply and use. The way this works is that it invests in energy projects right from concept through to commercialisation, focusing on traditional energy supply, alternative and renewable energy sources and systems, and sustainable energy use. It covers a range of things, including gas and liquid fuels, electricity generation, distribution and application of energy use in Australian industry, manufacturing, transport, the built environment, appliances, processing and agriculture—in other words, the full gamut.</para><para>The ERDC selects projects and then funds them to meet these priorities. Therefore, it supplies support to the private research sector. It is a big injector of funds in research and 
 development—indeed, the major injector of funds—and was about ensuring that Australia had a leg-up in the new technology field, that we actually got into the sunrise industries and really made a contribution to the future of energy trends and use.</para><para>It has in its short time developed a very good reputation, a good name in the industry and research institutions, and it was helping to create a lot of jobs, not just jobs directly in the specific research areas but, as processes and procedures came on stream and as products were developed, further jobs down the line. As an Australian it was very good to see the Australian stamp on much of this marketed technology.</para><para>This highly successful organisation was to find its funding cut in the first Liberal budget, and its funding has since been abolished. It is Senator Parer who is moving this regulation to abolish the corporation itself, and this is what is before the Senate at the moment.</para><para>In the annual report of the Energy Research and Development Corporation, the chair and executive of BHP said that the decision for the abolition of the Energy Research and Development Corporation was unexpected. It created major problems and was inconsistent with indications of future support that even this government had given at the time of the election and also when it initially came into office. One can question the motives, and one can go on doing that, but I will not go into all that today. Whatever the motives, they have got rid of a premier organisation. This is very puzzling in light of the government's much trumpeted potential budget surplus that it is going to have this year. While to many it is obviously a huge amount of money, in terms of research and development we are, after all, talking about only $12½ million.</para><para>We are moving this motion today to disallow the regulation that actually abolishes the organisation in the hope that we can at least hang on to that. We will then take up the cudgels of asking, arguing and pushing for the government to actually fund it again. We have had approaches from a number of sectors about this organisation, and we have yet to find anyone who does not speak very highly of it. We believe that if the organisation is 
 still at least in existence, although wound down, we would have a better chance of winding it up again than we would have if we abolish it altogether.</para><para>We have a problem in particular with an undertaking that was given that those organisations that were actually undertaking work at the moment would be maintained. It seems that this has not happened. Contractors who had spent quite large sums on the capital technology required for their projects were under the impression, and indeed were given an undertaking, that projects would continue. They have apparently had the rug pulled out from under them.</para><para>Whilst the initial annual report of the ERDC last year had a statement from the chair promising commitments would be met, that report was withdrawn and later a statement was made in the House on 4 March indicating that contracts would be renegotiated with a view to savings. I would be very interested to hear from the minister exactly where that is up to now.</para><para>Another very positive thing about this organisation is that for every dollar spent by the ERDC, $3 was committed by industry and others. So it provided a multiplier effect as far as the amount of money actually going into research and development is concerned.</para><para>I will close by saying that there are a large number of projects that should be developed and continued. The ERDC was only part way into what it could have achieved, and it has been stopped well short of reaching its full potential. Surely the investment already made and the contributions that are very well recognised as to what it has already done are very worth while. What it could have done, I believe, was very worth while, and I look forward to support in the chamber for at least maintaining the organisation.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>1325</page.no><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator SCHACHT</name><name.id>4J4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On behalf of the opposition, I rise to support the motion moved by Senator Lees to disallow the regulation. In doing so, we point out that this is not the first time, unfortunately, this government has acted in a crass way towards the research and development community in this country.</para></talk.start><para>I remember when I was a minister in the industry area we were roundly set upon by the likes of Senator Parer, now the minister, saying that we were not doing enough to promote Australian industry. Yet when the new government took office, it went almost with deliberate glee about reducing Australia's research and development capacity.</para><para>The most infamous decision was to reduce the 150 per cent tax deduction to 125 per cent. That was roundly condemned by every sensible industry person and every sensible person involved in R&amp;D in this country. People who condemned it were not normally noted as being supporters of the Labor Party by any means. We had industry organisations and well-known and public supporters of the election of the coalition government expressing their strong disquiet at a number of these decisions of the government to reduce the funding.</para><para>I can almost anticipate now what Senator Parer is going to stand up and say. It will be, `Ah, yes, but we had inherited a budget deficit when we were elected; this was a horrifying figure.' The figure which will be used will be $10 billion. I have to point out that, in relation to the 1996 figure, when we came into office in 1983, John Howard, as Treasurer, left us with an equivalent deficit of $23 billion at today's figures. So I do not think there is any comparison. But that was used as an excuse to cut the expenditure in the industry portfolio for research and development in various forms.</para><para>I have to say that I suspect Senator Parer, who has an industry background, was conscripted to this cause of slashing and burning in industry and R&amp;D, because I think he has some understanding of the need to have R&amp;D and to have the appropriate structures for Australian industry in place. But I also suspect that Senator Parer was outvoted by the Treasury and the finance ministers under the guise of reducing the deficit—that this was a terrible deficit and had to be tackled immediately, even though subsequent adjustments and estimations by Treasury have often proved to be wrong and, in this case, have proved wrong again, about the size of the deficit and about the fact that we are going to 
 end up within a year of a surplus greater because of growth in the economy, as we have already pointed out.</para><para>But I think Senator Parer was probably disappointed that his view and knowledge of industry was overwhelmed by the Treasury view. Treasury have always had it in particularly for those programs in the industry portfolios that promote the development of Australian industry. I think the phrase that Treasury uses is, `This is industry welfare.' I do not think I am talking out of turn when I say that, when we were in government, I remember going to a briefing by Treasury for Labor ministers discussing industry policy, and the Treasury brief was to describe the proposals we were putting forward to develop Australian industry as `industry welfare'.</para><para>In the lead-up to the first budget in 1996, guess what term Treasurer Costello was using. We had to cut these expenditures because they were `industry welfare'. Governments come and go, it seems, and Treasurers come and go, but the Treasury view is always the same. They hated giving the 150 per cent when that was agreed to by the Labor government in the mid-1980s to boost R&amp;D. They despised it and fought against it. In every budget in the rest of the Labor term of office Treasury fought at every opportunity to remove the 150 per cent tax concession. They always fought to remove various programs to assist in the development of Australian industry.</para><para>Ironically, when a new government comes in they get the chance to trick and bamboozle the new Treasurer—in this case, the famous Mr Costello, who often prides himself on being a tough person—and to say, `These are the programs that should be cut.' And of course they were. In the long term it is against Australia's economic interest to have R&amp;D cut, because the only way we will deal with our foreign debt—in both the private and the public sector but particularly in the private sector—and our current account trade deficit is to boost the value of Australia's exports. The only way to do that is to prove the value adding of them by having decent R&amp;D looking at ways in which those products can be improved in their value.</para><para>We always argued in government that the reason we supported investment programs, R&amp;D programs—whether they were direct funding in a properly transparent process of application and grants or whether they were a tax deduction like the 150 per cent—was that these would lead to an increase in value in Australia's economy by increasing our exports and increasing jobs. That is not a view that the Australian Treasury accept in any way. They have a flat-earth view that, if you just get the deficit down, get into surplus, get low interest rates and low inflation, everything else will look after itself. That may happen in an economy the size of America with 260 million people, an economy running into many trillions of dollars. With an economy of our size—18 million people on a large continent—you need discrete, proper, balanced government intervention and support for Australian industry.</para><para>So today we have an outcome of the mad decisions of this government from when it came in in 1996 and from the follow-up budget in 1997 in putting in a regulation to abolish the Energy Research and Development Corporation of Australia. It is extraordinary that the minister who prides himself on coming from the coal industry, the mineral industry of Australia, has to come in here to defend the winding up of the Energy Research and Development Corporation. One would have thought that this would be something this minister would go to the wall to fight to keep. But we have heard nothing from the minister, despite the fact that his own industry and the broader Australian industry do not want these sorts of programs wound up.</para><para>In the budget of last year we saw just how mean spirited this government is. The government abolished the Energy Research Development Corporation, slashed a further $11 million from the national energy efficiency program on top of $3 million cuts in the 1996 budget. All of these decisions are clear breaches of the 1996 federal coalition promises. The then shadow minister, Senator Parer, personally promised that the coalition would:</para><para>maintain current support for the Energy Research and Development Corporation and continue the 150 per cent tax concession for research and development.

I apologise, Senator Parer. But in view of your interest in the mining industry I suspect you would have supported that being in the coalition document for the last election.</para></talk.start></continue><para>What do we have instead of maintaining that support for the R&amp;D? Senator Parer and the government have abolished it. And last year they reduced the R&amp;D tax concession to 125 per cent. On 16 August 1996, Senator Parer claimed in a press release that:</para><para>the government recognises the important role renewable energy plays in protecting the environment, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and laying the foundation for long-term, sustainable development.</para><para>The press release goes on to say:</para><para>Government support for renewable energy in Australia includes the funding for the Energy Research and Development Corporation and the Cooperative Research Centre for Renewable Energy and Related Greenhouse Gas Reduction Technologies.</para><para>Those are the words of Senator Parer on 16 August 1996. That is almost what the Democrats would say, Senator. I was going to give you a big tick. This is a quote that would not be amiss in a Democrat document about renewable energy, which is an issue they campaign quite strongly on.</para><para>In August 1996 we had this glowing statement from the minister in favour of the Energy Research and Development Corporation and funding for the CRCs in the same area—the cooperative research centres—and yet a year later this minister has to come in here with an enormous amount of egg on his face and move the regulation that the Energy Research and Development Corporation of which he had spoken so glowingly should be abolished. It is a Greg Louganis job as a diver, Senator Parer: a double somersault with backflips all over the place from your position in August 1996 to your position in August 1997 and again to your position here in the Senate in March 1998 in putting up this 
 proposal to abolish the Energy Research and Development Corporation. We believe that in the long run this government's policies, if they are allowed to continue, will damage Australia's industrial development capacity, its R&amp;D capacity and its technological development capacity in a most grievous way.</para><para>This government still has not come to grips with having a decent industry and science research and development policy. As a former minister in the area of industry and science, I agree with Senator Parer that it is not possible to satisfy everybody in the science community and the research and development community. There is always a long list of people demanding access to government funding for various research programs. But this government has not made any attempt to meet those demands; it has cut them all back and ignored them. What I find rather strange, if not sad, is that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) is on the record as saying on a number of occasions, `We should not concentrate on doing value adding to our minerals in Australia. We should concentrate on just sending them overseas as raw tonnage.' We all know that, no matter how much is dug out of the ground in raw tonnage, the full value is never realised. That is why we have a consistent current account deficit, this year running to $20 billion plus.</para><para>The countries that run the biggest trade surpluses in the world are those that have good value adding, manufacturing industries, et cetera. Unless we get some of that in Australia, we will always be on the wrong side of the ledger with our current account deficit. This is something this government is incapable of coming to terms with in its industry policy. Here we see the saddest example of all. I would have thought that, at the very least, Minister, if you were not going to fund the Energy Research and Development Corporation, you would have quietly crept off in the night, left the shell there and given it no money. I would not have thought you would have the gall to come into this place and move a regulation to abolish it when, only 18 months ago, in 1996, you were quoting what a wonderful organisation the 
 Energy Research and Development Corporation was.</para><para>I find that really odd. I think it is a sad commentary on this government's industry policy. Therefore, the opposition has no hesitation in supporting the motion of the Democrats to disallow the winding up of this organisation. I think the government should be heartily condemned by the Senate for this cheeky regulation here today. I conclude on this point to Senator Parer: we look forward to the coming election campaign on the issues of industry policy, science policy and research and development.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>KI4</name.id><name role="metadata">PARER</name><name role="display">Senator Parer</name></talker><para>—You haven't got any.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>KI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator SCHACHT</name></talker><para>—You are just wiping them out, Senator Parer.

The government considered ERDC had established a 
 good foundation for industry to take on a greater role in funding its research in conjunction with other government assistance.</para><para>The government's decision to wind up the ERDC was taken in the context of severe fiscal difficulties left to the government by the previous Labor administration. Because of the need for tight fiscal discipline, the government has had to make the difficult decision to cease funding new investments in energy R&amp;D through the ERDC. The government also needed to ensure the most efficient delivery for support of energy research and development, and it was clear that energy research and development was being supported by a number of programs between which there was significant duplication of effort. In addition to ERDC, the Commonwealth government was funding energy R&amp;D through the CSIRO, which had an energy R&amp;D budget of $44.4 million in 1995-96, programs such as the cooperative research centre program, the R&amp;D start program and the renewable energy industry program.</para><para>Following the winding up of the ERDC, there will be substantial support for energy research and development through government programs and market based incentives. The R&amp;D start program, which was announced in the August 1996 budget, provides funding for R&amp;D, including energy R&amp;D. The program provides a mixture of support measures, including grants and loans for R&amp;D in small and medium enterprises. Total expenditure on the R&amp;D start program over the next four years will be $739 million. The R&amp;D start program is a potential source of government support for energy R&amp;D projects. The program has already granted funding for energy R&amp;D projects, including in new and renewable energy. As senators will be aware, this is within the portfolio of the Department of Industry, Science and Tourism.</para><para>Specific support for energy R&amp;D is also provided by the government through the Australian Cooperative Research Centre's program, which includes the Australian Cooperative Research Centre for Renewable Energy, ACRE. ACRE has a Commonwealth contribution from the CRC program of over $10 million over seven years and focuses on 
 a number of sources of renewable energy, including solar, thermal, photovoltaics and wind. There has been further incentive for industry to undertake R&amp;D from the 125 per cent tax deduction and the existence of significantly more robust and competitive energy markets in Australia flowing from gas and electricity market reforms accelerated under this government.</para><para>A process that had lost momentum under Labor, energy market reform, has created the impetus for innovative products and services and facilitated wider use of low emission energy supplies, such as co-generation, gas-fired generators and renewable energy systems. As a result of Australia's electricity grids being opened up to the private generators, the opportunity for generators using renewable energy technologies has increased. This in turn provides a major incentive for energy research and development. Significant developments have included a supply of over 50 megawatts to the grid using sugar cane waste, or bagasse, the establishment of over 70 megawatts of power plant capacity using gas in municipal landfills and over 125 megawatts of new capacity from small hydro plants.</para><para>New support for energy research and development has been announced as part of the government's response to the greenhouse issue. In November 1997, as part of the $180 million five-year program, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) announced a major new package of measures to encourage innovation in the renewable energy sector. These include $21 million for a renewable energy innovation investment fund on a two for one funding basis with industry and $30 million of concessional loans and grants for development and commercialisation of strategically important renewable energy technologies. This represents a huge increase on the $4.8 million over four years spent by Labor on the renewable energy industry program. There is $10 million for a showcase fund—and I am sure you will support this, Senator—to support leading edge renewable energy projects in areas such as tidal power, solar thermal power and photovoltaics.</para><para>Other measures in this package will stimulate support for energy research and development. These include programs for the mandatory targets for uptake of renewable energy and power supplies; efficiency standards for power generation; an environmental strategy for the automotive industry; industry efficiency benchmarking and best practice; energy performance codes and standards for commercial buildings, domestic appliances and industrial equipment; and energy efficiency improvements in Commonwealth operation.</para><para>There has been much bleating by the Australian Democrats alleging that the wind-up of the ERDC will impair Australia's efforts in alternative or renewable energy research developments. These claims, which were repeated in Senator Lees's media release of 22 March 1998, serve only to highlight the Democrats' failure to comprehend energy policy issues and to acknowledge the extensive support for renewable energy put in place by the Howard government. Far from decreasing support for renewable energy, initiatives taken by the Howard government provide a boost for investments specifically targeted at renewable energy.</para><para>While the ERDC provided funds for all energy research, the program announced by the Prime Minister has a deliberate renewable energy focus. As a result of these measures, the level of support provided by the government for renewables is considerably greater than that provided by any previous government. As part of the wind-up of ERDC, the government will not fund any new investments by ERDC but will meet existing commitments. I think Senator Lees talked about these negotiations in her speech. These negotiations are not compulsory but, where it is to the advantage of both sides, they will occur. In the absence of those, the commitments will be fulfilled.</para><para>The opposition to this motion is really a futile piece of grandstanding which will do nothing to promote its claimed objective of supporting alternative energy R&amp;D. All that the Democrats will achieve, presumably with the support of Labor, is the maintenance of a minimal ERDC board without funding for new projects and no role whatsoever, the 
 effective role residing mainly with the Australian greenhouse office and agencies within the industry, science and tourism portfolio.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>1330</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I totally support Senator Lees's motion. I do so for the reasons she gave, and I want to reiterate those in my way. Firstly, we have here the $71 million that was allocated over five years to ERDC, which has a prodigious record for stimulating research and development, particularly in the fields of alternative energy, and drawing in many millions more from business and industry in that pursuit being denied. Under Minister Parer, $87 million is specifically allocated over the same period for research and development, into what? Into wind energy? Into solar energy? Into energy alternatives which people concerned about greenhouse gases and so on might be concerned about? No, none of those. The $87 million is going for research and development into the coal industry.</para></talk.start><para>So there we have it—$71 million being taken from the ERDC and $87 million going into the coal industry. If there is ever a benighted misdirection of policy, that is it. How could this minister, this government, under the glare of public interest in energy alternatives with the globe warming up, with the enormous fear there is from the threats of global warming, be proceeding in the reverse direction to that which the Australian people would expect? It is unconscionable.</para><para>At some stage down the line, the government needs to be stopped in its tracks and made to think about what it is doing. I know that Senator Parer has a favourable eye on the coal industry. One has only to read the newspapers to know that. But there is much more at stake here than the interests of the coal industry. There is the direction this nation is going as a potential leader in research and development in the renewable energy field—solar power, wind power and energy efficiency, not least.</para><para>So Senator Lees is quite right to make this move to try to put a shot across the bows of this delinquent policy direction that Senator Parer and the government are taking. We have in this country some of the best scientific and research and development expertise—not the 
 least of whom are in universities—in energy renewables anywhere in the world. Some have already been forced to go overseas with their inventions. More are feeling the squeeze.</para><para>In the meantime, we have Senator Parer and the government allocating $87 million to the coal industry—and, by the way, another $24 million to other fossil fuel research and development, making a total of $111 million—but they cannot fund the $71 million the ERDC was getting because Senator Parer says we are facing tight fiscal conditions. What bunkum! What nonsense! As I said, what a delinquent policy direction.</para><para>One only has to look at the government's policy reversal on the diesel fuel rebate—which involves over $1 billion a year, most of it handed to the mining corporations—to see how much easier it would be for the government to reverse its decision on the abolition of the ERDC and the emphasis that needs to be given to research and development in energy renewables. I am aghast and so are many people in the business field, I can tell you, at the direction this government has gone. It is not only a loss now for small business and research and development in this country; it is cutting across the interests of this country as a whole because energy renewables are a sunrise industry. They are one of the identified king-hit industries of the next century. The whole world is going to be looking for the expertise and the investment coming out of this research and development.</para><para>Instead of fostering that, instead of looking ahead, what Senator Parer is doing is looking backwards. He is looking at the now. He is no doubt, because of his long association with the coal industry, being impressed by the arguments and the understanding he has there, while ignoring a more balanced, progressive and forward looking understanding which comes from the recognition that this country can lead the world, reap profits and create hundreds of thousands of jobs—but if only government are prepared to get behind the industries that are making such terrific advances for Australia in this field.</para><para>Instead of getting behind the industry, Senator Parer is simply getting behind. He is going backwards. It is a delinquent policy. 
 The ERDC, instead of being abolished, should be enhanced. Senator Lees is to be congratulated for this attempt to stop the government in its tracks and make it think again in the interests of this country of ours.</para><para>	 Question put:</para><para>	 That the motion (<inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lees's</inline> ) be agreed to.</para></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>19:08:00</time.stamp><para>The Senate divided.	</para></division.header><para>(The President—Senator the Hon.

John Howard commenced his visit with a very successful day in Darwin on 26 February. He visited the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. He viewed the East Arm Port Development, which will be a vital part of the Darwin to Alice Springs railway link, with Chief Minister, Shane Stone, and the Northern Territory transport minister, Barry Coulter. He also attended a dinner for 350, hosted by my colleague the federal member for the Northern Territory, the Hon. Nick Dondas.</para></talk.start><para>He then had the honour on Friday, 27 February of visiting several communities in 
 Arnhem Land at the invitation of Mr Gatjil Djerrkura, the Chairman of ATSIC. The Prime Minister visited Galiwinku, Marthakal and Dhambala on Elcho Island and Nhulunbuy and Yirrkala on the Gove Peninsula. At Galiwinku the Prime Minister was briefed on a $1.8 million joint army/ATSIC project. This project involves the building of 10 new homes plus the upgrading of existing power and water supplies. It is expected the project will prove as successful as a similar one at Bulla near the township of Timber Creek where army personnel are a very good example of the different sections of the Australian community establishing personal connections with Aborigines and working on a deeper understanding of each other's culture.</para><para>The Prime Minister was similarly accorded the opportunity of enhancing his own understanding of Aboriginal culture at Dhambala on Elcho Island where he, the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, Senator John Herron, my colleague Nick Dondas and I were given the very great honour and privilege of participating in a secret men's ceremony with Garrawurra elders. I understand the honour and accept the trust placed in us by the Garrawurra men and realise that it is a privilege extended to very few white Australians. Let me say that the importance and significance of the ceremony and its symbolism and insignia used was not unlike that of a freemason's lodge. The Prime Minister was obviously moved by the ceremony and shortly after said:</para><para>I deeply appreciated the honour that was paid to me and I certainly gained from that ceremony an understanding of how much that ritual and that culture and those thousands of years of practice and history mean to the indigenous community.</para><para>After visiting another public function with hundreds of elders, women and children from Galiwinku, the Prime Minister and our party left for the town of Nhulunbuy where his first duties were at the Miwatj Aboriginal health centre. It was here that the Prime Minister announced a $4.8 million innovative health package to help combat trachoma in Aboriginal communities.</para><para>After addressing a business leaders luncheon celebrating the 25th anniversary of the Nabalco bauxite mine, the Prime Minister 
 visited the home of his host, Gatjil Djerrkura, at the lovely community of Yirrkala. A traditional ceremony of welcome by members of the Djapu clan in full ceremonial dress saw the Prime Minister escorted to the Yirrkala arts centre. This was a spectacular and impressive display particularly by many spear wielding men, women and children singing and dancing in a moving ceremony.</para><para>At the Yirrkala arts centre details of sacred Aboriginal paintings were explained to the Prime Minister and he was presented with a special bark painting of cultural significance. We also on that occasion met with senior traditional leaders for another private meeting on important cultural values.</para><para>The visit by Mr Howard highlighted for me the fact that there are so many aspects to Aboriginal life and culture that are not given the important publicity they deserve. Some life or death issues, particularly when talking about the maintenance of a culture, deserve much more consideration. A common thread running through the discussions on the day was the need for Aboriginal culture to cross generations, in fact for traditional culture to be handed down from generation to generation and not lost forever.</para><para>We must ask the question: are the views of Aboriginal people in the far-flung settlements of outback Australia being listened to, canvassed and voiced by some of the radical Aboriginal leaders that we have in Australia today? I am not convinced that they are. Too many Aboriginal spokesmen in the non-ceremonial or traditional areas have lost the focus and lost the plot.</para><para>In my electorate, the Northern Territory, a vast area of 1.3 million square kilometres, with Aborigines making up 25 per cent of the population—a higher percentage than in any other state or territory—there are hundreds of Aboriginal communities, all with many diverse needs and aspirations. As I have travelled the Territory during the past 25 years of my political career, I have heard many concerned voices, particularly by Aboriginal people, on those isolated communities that follow a number of common themes—themes and issues that are not getting much recognition or voice from the 
 Aboriginal leaders living on the east coast of Australia who seem preoccupied with the concept of land ownership and a continuation of welfare support and government dependency. </para><para>There is very little mention being made of the wonderful art and the ancient living Aboriginal culture that is practised still in so many Aboriginal communities and the need to ensure its protection and survival. I seriously ask: where is the discussion, the action and the acceptance from southern Aboriginal leaders of the many other aspects of Aboriginal life and culture that are so important and many other issues that need to be canvassed at a national level, other than native title or land rights?</para><para>Where is the recognition that for many Aboriginal people land rights and native title are not major issues? They know their site and their place in the world with far more spirituality than most of us. A unique and splendid way of life is on the brink of extinction. The major issue for many people in remote communities is the loss of culture, the loss of their traditional way of life, the loss for many of their very being, their sense of identity. The preservation of what is unique about themselves and their lives is what is important to so many of my constituents.</para><para>The preservation of the hundreds of Aboriginal languages and dialects spoken around Australia is a first step in helping to maintain this identity. Action is being taken in the Northern Territory schools to ensure the survival of Aboriginal languages, but why is there not more of an outcry elsewhere? Surely language is vital to a culture's survival. Our focus on literacy must allow Aborigines to communicate in the two societies in which they must live.</para><para>Aboriginal health and nutrition is deplorable. Why not promote the use of bush tucker before the knowledge is lost and a healthy food source lost with it? Again, in the Territory this has been recognised, but why are Aboriginal leaders in other states not promoting it much more strongly and loudly? Closely related to the skills used to find bush tucker are the skills gained over thousands of years, generations living and learning in the 
 most trying conditions to acquire the unique hunting and tracking abilities needed for survival itself. Action must be taken before these skills are lost totally.</para><para>The importance of ceremony to Aboriginal people as a part of their culture must also be recognised and steps taken to ensure that its continuation is enshrined. Aboriginal art is finally getting the recognition it deserves but there are still many challenges to be met in this area, particularly in recognising copyright and preservation issues.</para><para>The Reverend Djiniyini Gondara spoke recently to the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation and made several very important points relating to the native title process and the cultural issues I have described that must be addressed.

I think the best way I can add to this debate is by speaking about my traditional Law—the Madayin of the Yolnu people of North East Arnhem Land. Then we might be able to see how this can help our discussion.</para><para>Before I start, it would be good to say that Yolnu are only one group of Aboriginal Clan/Nations within the Northern Territory. However my knowledge of other Aboriginal Clan/Nations across the country is that we each have very similar foundational principles of law.</para><para>To me there are three main elements in any good law and this is how it is with Yolnu traditional law.</para><para>These three elements come from the <inline font-style="italic"> djalkiri</inline>  or the foundational source of our law. These three main elements that must be found in all law are;</para><para>1. The law must create <inline font-weight="bold"> Magaya</inline> .  That is, the law must create a state of peace, harmony, and tranquillity, with true justice for all the citizens.</para><para>2. The law must be <inline font-weight="bold"> Dhapirrk</inline>   That is, the law must be perfectly consistent with all the different levels of law from the source down to the lowest acts of law.</para><para>3. The third element of good law is that it must be <inline font-style="italic"> Wana Lupthun</inline> .  That is the law must be assented to by the citizens in a ceremony that 
 shows that they are all under the discipline, responsibility and protection of the law.</para><para>No law and no constitution would be recognised as real law without these foundational principles being included. This is how it is with Yolnu traditional law—the Madayin. I have learnt this from my traditional law.</para><para>I have just used the term—Madayin. Madayin is the terns Yolnu use to talk about our law. So you can understand what I am talking about here, I would like to look at what Madayin means.</para><para>But before I do, I would like to point out what Justice Blackburn said in 1971. In his judgement and summing up of the Gove Land Rights case he said that he "could see that a `rule of lava and not a `rule of marl' operated in Yolnu society."</para><para>The Madayin is based on a rule of law not because Justice Blackburn said so but because it is and we have known that for thousands of years.</para><para>Lets look at the Madayin, our traditional law.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Madayin </inline> is the name for a complete system of law for the Yolnu (Aboriginal people) of North East Arnhem Land.</para><para>It embodies the rights of the owners of the law, or citizens, (<inline font-weight="bold">rom-watanu walal</inline> ) who have the rights and responsibilities for this particular embodiment of law.</para><para>This <inline font-weight="bold">Madayin </inline> includes: all the peoples' law (<inline font-weight="bold">rom</inline> ), the instruments and objects that encode and symbolise the law (<inline font-weight="bold">Madayin girri</inline> ), oral dictates, names and song cycles and the holy, restricted places (<inline font-weight="bold">dhuyu nungat wana</inline> ) that are used in the maintenance, education and development of law.</para><para>This law covers the ownership of land and waters, the resources on or within these lands and waters, it regulates and controls; production and trade, the moral, social and religious law including laws for the conservation of, and the farming of, fauna, flora and aquatic life.</para><para>The Yolnu of Worth East Arnhem Land believe that if they live out their life according to the <inline font-weight="bold">Madayin</inline>  it is a right and civilised way to live.</para><para>The Madayin creates the state of <inline font-weight="bold">magaya. </inline> Magaya is a state of peace, free from hostilities, true justice for all.</para><para>Some of the political structures which are established by the Madayin are:</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Bapurru</inline> —is the name given to the paternal estate owning clan/nation—who have ownership of the surface of the land and waters of the estate.

In this Ceremony the objects representing the law are held by the political leader of that clan/nation and he, together with all the people of that clan, go under the water to indicate that they are under the discipline, responsibility and protection of the law. No one is above the law!</para><para>The principle-"<inline font-weight="bold">separation of powers</inline> "—is embodied within the concept of <inline font-weight="bold">Yothu/Yindi. </inline> For Yolnu this is much more than the name of a rock band. The members of the government are from one clan/nation and are called <inline font-weight="bold">Yindi. </inline> The public servants, including the police and officers of the court are from separate clan/nations and are called <inline font-weight="bold">Yothu</inline> .</para><para>If someone breaks our traditional law, we have a process to deal with this at law.

To Yolnu it means to be reconciled at law.</para><para>These sanctions are carried out by our ceremonial leaders, who are the authorised officers, according to the dictates of the law.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Bayarra, </inline> reconciliation at law, then occurs.</para><para>"Payback", or an action of revenge without a due legal process, is against Yolnu traditional law.</para><para>So you can see, just as Justice Blackburn did, that Yolnu live under a rule of law not a rule of man. We have had this law, our <inline font-weight="bold">Madayin</inline> , since time immemorial and each generation has tried to maintain the three foundational elements that I mentioned at the start of any speech. It is these three elements that all of us must seek to maintain within our Australian Constitution.</para><para>Mr. Chairman I thank you for the opportunity to have addressed this Convention.

As the Senate will be aware, there are many conservation groups of all shapes and sizes in Australia. Tonight I wish to pay tribute to the work that they do and the way in which they make our community and our way of life much more valuable. I pay tribute to the individuals in those conservation groups for the considerable work they do. The reason for my comments tonight is that, in the context of this year's budget, I would like the government to recognise and acknowledge the enormity of the debt that we owe to conservation groups in this country.</para></talk.start><para>Some $1.7 million has been the amount provided for a number of years to be divided amongst a very large number of groups. Since the Howard government came to power they have added more groups to that list, but, unfortunately, that money has remained at the same level. Unfortunately, too, they have used that money as a stick to beat certain groups like the North Queensland Conservation Council, the Cairns and Far North Environment Centre, the Australian Conservation Foundation, the Environmental Defenders Offices and Friends of the Earth. All of these groups had their funding cut last year, no doubt as punishment for the kind of brutal honesty which did not fit with the government's notion of a relaxed and comfortable society.</para><para>I want tonight to compare their meagre funding with that of the mining industry which received $117 million in 1996-97. Next year it will receive around $90 million. Over five years the mining industry is expected to receive $333 million from government. We compare this with just $8 million going to conservation groups. Obviously, there is a 
 very significant difference between those two amounts of money.</para><para>The government will argue that it gets back lots of revenue from helping the mining industry, but its economic model will only include the positive side of that ledger. It will not talk about the massive cost of mining leaving behind polluted land. It will not talk about job losses from mine closures and technology changes. It will not talk about polluted waterways and the cost of having that land locked up.</para><para>Let us not forget about the enormous sums of money involved in tourism to our unique and precious areas. I remind the Senate that if it was not for conservation groups the Great Barrier Reef would probably by now be polluted by oil drilling and, no doubt, be overfished. Kakadu would be mined. Fraser Island would have had its magnificent forest logged and its stunning sand dunes destroyed by mineral sand operations. South-west Tasmania would have suffered the fates of mining and logging and been flooded by an unnecessary dam.</para><para>The wet tropics rainforests, home to so much biodiversity and the only developed world tropical rainforests, would no doubt also be gone. We would have seen Daintree forests replaced by suburb blocks and cement. I could go on, but the point I want to make is that these areas are now recognised as unique in the world and they bring in billions of dollars of tourism. Their intrinsic worth is countless and their spiritual worth to who we are as a nation, is extraordinary.</para><para>These places, along with hundreds of national parks and reserve areas, exist because of the selfless and solid work of community environment groups. It is not just the natural environment that these groups protect. They are our security against land, air and water pollution. They research and identify potential problems with chemicals or toxic overload. They intelligently scrutinise decisions made by those who have a profit-only motive and by governments who help those organisations.</para><para>They point out the fast-tracking and inadequate decision making. They draw attention to the other side of the science. They find the loopholes and help inform the rest of the 
 community. They negotiate to make projects and developers take softer paths on the environment, very often saving those developers money in the process. When enough is enough they stand firm on their principles and, in so doing, annoy governments because they cannot be bought and sometimes they just will not budge. They work nights, days and weekends and very often do this whilst holding down full-time jobs and having families. They still donate their time doing what they believe and what we know and recognise is the right thing to do.</para><para>Many governments and developers do not understand this sort of behaviour. Governments think that if they ignore them they will go away. They tend to shoot the messenger for what they have to say. But, of course, they are not going to go away. They are the voice of reason and I think they are very important to the future of this country.</para><para>In the government's rush to help out their big business mates—and it does not seem to matter whether it is a Liberal or Labor government in this respect—I want to warn the Senate tonight that community groups like the one I came from some years back and the ones I know, will not give up. They will simply become more insistent. I urge the government to take the opportunity this year to fund them in a respectful manner, to recognise the work they do and to recognise what they contribute to the quality of life for all Australians.</para><para>They are the ones who stand up for two very important groups who have no voice and yet should be listened to carefully before decisions are made. I refer to all of the species that we are privileged to share our fragile piece of planet with and all of those children who are not yet born but who will have to suffer the impact of the decisions which we make every day in their lives.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Small Business</title><page.no>1337</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>1337</page.no><name role="metadata">Payne, Sen Marise</name><name role="display">Senator PAYNE</name><name.id>M56</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This evening I rise to address what I and the coalition regard as a very important issue for all people, particularly in greater western Sydney—that is, the issue of small business reform. My New South Wales coali 
 tion colleagues are undoubtedly aware of the significance of the greater western Sydney area in terms of its population growth and its growth in industry—in  particular, in the manufacturing, building and construction, transport and storage, engineering and retail sectors. I am pleased to have the opportunity on almost a daily basis to work closely with my colleagues the member for Parramatta (Mr Ross Cameron) and the member for Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly) in this part of Sydney, listening to and working with business.</para></talk.start><para>On a national level, though, small business confidence has firmed over the last three months to February of this year and is now at its highest level since the post-election peak of May 1996. The informative February 1998 Yellow Pages Small Business Index shows that business confidence is up this quarter in manufacturing, building construction and building services, with the transport and storage sector—essential parts of the western Sydney business community—seeing a boost in confidence of eight per cent—from 45 to 62 per cent since the November quarter.</para><para>The index tellingly goes on to say that, with the exception of the election induced euphoria in the May 1996 survey, small business's assessment of the economy is now at its strongest level since February 1995. Proprietors in all states and territories are strongly positive about the current state of the economy. In New South Wales, our small business proprietors have the strongest perception of economic growth and a strong sales and profit growth. The coalition's approach to small business reform is undeniably paying off right across the nation. This means that important areas such as Sydney's greater west have the opportunity to expand in business and to contribute in a far greater capacity to the nation's economy.</para><para> The greater west generates 20 per cent of the New South Wales work force and some 24 per cent of the New South Wales economy. The coalition acknowledges the contribution of the businesses of greater western Sydney and has fostered an open and accessible approach to receiving feedback from business proprietors at a grassroots level by providing opportunities to discuss the issues 
 confronting businesses through seminars, forums and the like.</para><para> Just last Thursday I had the pleasure of chairing such a forum in Penrith. The event was organised by my colleague the member for Lindsay, Jackie Kelly, and the President of the Penrith and Districts Chamber of Commerce, Mr Ian Palmer. About 70 representatives of small business in both western Sydney and the Blue Mountains area were able to attend. A range of guest speakers was able to join us including my New South Wales state parliamentary colleagues the Hon. John Hannaford MLC, the opposition's spokesperson on small business in New South Wales; the Hon. Chris Hartcher MP, the opposition's spokesperson on industrial relations; the Hon. Mike Gallacher MLC, who spoke on workers compensation; and particularly my federal colleague the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, the Hon. Alan Cadman, the member for Mitchell.</para><para> The seminar's great success was a reflection of the work of one of the many strong organisations that stand behind small business in the greater western Sydney area—that is, in this case, the Penrith and Districts Chamber of Commerce. As with all of the various chambers of commerce in our area, they are actively involved in ensuring that small business is aware of the changes that are occurring at the federal level and the options that are available to all small business as a result of the reforms that this government has introduced.</para><para>But the chambers do not only represent small businesses as a cohesive whole; they work with the community. They work through the local print media to ensure that people are informed about the issues that are confronting their own small businesses and the options that are available to them. One of the most interesting things to come out of the seminar, and very timely, might I say, in relation to today's activities in the chamber, was strong, unanimous and steadfast support for the government's proposed changes to unfair dismissal laws in the Workplace Relations Act, which was today rejected in the chamber.</para><para> The opposition's job-destroying unfair dismissal laws left over from their period in government have been amended since the coalition's victory in March 1996. But the message from small business is that more changes are necessary for the continued viability of their sector. It is a message that has gone unheeded by those on the other side. It is clear that the rejection of the government's amendments means a more difficult road ahead for any prospects of expansion for this vital sector.</para><para> What those on the other side must now do is stand accountable before their small business communities in their electorates across the nation and explain to all proprietors the obscure agenda behind their rejection of these amendments. The proposed changes set out to achieve one thing: very simply, to provide a better future for small business in this country, to provide certainty for small business.</para><para>The opposition and the Democrats have made a conscious decision to place obstacles in the way of those things and in the way of Australia's economic prosperity. The coalition by contrast sees its role as providing business with the opportunity to move forward. The reforms that we have introduced and the commitment we have shown to small business is evident in the mood of the small business proprietors I spoke to in Penrith last week and all across western Sydney in fact. It is comforting to them at least to know that as yet we are only part way through our program of reform. There is more to be done and they, the people on the ground, the people in the workplaces, support our aims.</para><para> I find it difficult to understand the obstructionist activities of those opposite when the call from the electorate for reform in this area is absolutely unequivocal. What the government has done is to provide a positive atmosphere for business to get on with the job. For example, interest rates are at their lowest in 30 years. This is an atmosphere that is conducive to confidence in investment for a small business that looks to a bigger and brighter future. If businesses are to make decisions to expand, they need to know where they are going and where they are going to be in a couple of years time. The low interest rates 
 and low inflation achievements of this government provide small business with the stability and certainty they need to make their decisions for the future.</para><para> I was particularly encouraged at the small business seminar in Penrith to also witness the support for the coalition's proposed tax reform. There was a clear message—that compliance costs to do with taxation and administration are hurting Australian business. The coalition's tax reform will create world's best practice to ensure that Australian business is competitive not only within our region but also with business around the world. It is ridiculous that Australian businesses can spend more hours per week working out complicated compliance issues than in any other country in our region. This government is about creating a framework for a successful and competitive future for small business. The representatives of the Penrith and Districts Chamber of Commerce present last week gave me and my colleagues a clear indication that they consider the coalition is in fact on track to achieve these aims.</para><para>But tax reform and the need for changes to the unfair dismissal laws were only two of the major issues raised at the seminar. A number of the government's other reforms in areas such as access for small business to the Commonwealth banking ombudsman, cutting tax on savings, cutting fringe benefits and capital gains tax, cutting red tape and giving retail tenants a fair go were all equally applauded.</para><para>It would be remiss of me not to point out that overwhelmingly the most important achievement of this government for small business was our efforts to repay Labor's debt. We have in fact come a long way under the guidance of the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) and the federal Treasurer (Mr Costello). We acknowledge that there are areas that still need to be addressed. We are working towards rectifying the unacceptable situation that was left over from 13 years of Labor Party administration.</para><para>If we want to ensure a successful small business community not only nationwide but also for greater western Sydney we have to 
 listen. That is what we are all about—identifying the problem areas at a grassroots level and responding to them. There are encouraging signs of growth. People in Sydney's west are expanding whether in industries like real estate, construction or retail. Let us hope that the actions of those opposite today will not affect that trend.</para><para>I would on this occasion also like to bring to the attention of the Senate not only the success of the government's reforms in greater western Sydney but also acknowledge the strong organisational support that exists for business in the area. In addition to the chambers of commerce, I am also in contact with the Greater Western Sydney Business Connection, known to those familiar with it in the west as `The Connection'. Both the member for Parramatta, Mr Cameron, and I work with The Connection to take the message of western Sydney businesses to the government. It was established over 10 years ago in 1985 to promote the Parramatta CBD—which, after all, is the geographical heart of Sydney—and to enhance its business potential. After a decade of doing that, The Connection's focus is now directed across greater western Sydney. That wider focus has seen an expansion in business development opportunities which The Connection has championed since its inception. And growing out of the organisational structure of The Connection came the birth of the Asia Business Connection.</para><para>Western Sydney is a strong region for business. It is a rewarding job to bring back to this place words of encouragement and support for the framework that is being built from the coalition's small business policies—policies which go a long way to ensuring that 
 business is not held back in western Sydney, but that it is in a strong position to move forward to the next millennium with sound business confidence.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><adjournment><adjournmentinfo><time.stamp>19:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>1340</page.no></adjournmentinfo><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senate adjourned at 7.38 p.m.</inline></para></adjournment><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>1340</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tabling</title><page.no>1340</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following documents were tabled by the Clerk:</para><para>Civil Aviation Act—Civil Aviation Regulations—Civil Aviation Orders—Exemptions— CASA 09/1998 and CASA 10/1998.</para><para>Radiocommunications Act—Spectrum Re-allocation Declaration No. 1 of 1998.</para><para>Sydney Airport Demand Management Act—Determination of Slot Management Scheme 1998.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Indexed Lists of Files</title><page.no>1340</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following documents were tabled pursuant to the order of the Senate of 30 May 1996:</para><para>Indexed lists of departmental and agency files for the period 1 July to 31 December 1997:</para><para>	 Department of Defence.</para><para>	 Industry, Science and Tourism portfolio—</para><para>	 Australian Customs Service.</para><para>	 Australian Institute of Marine Science.</para><para>	 Australian Nuclear and Technology Organisation.</para><para>	 Australian Sports Commission.</para><para>	 Australian Sports Drug Agency.</para><para>	 Australian Tourist Commission.</para><para>	 Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation.</para><para>	 Department of Industry, Science and Tourism: Central Office.</para><para>	 National Standards Commission.</para><para></para></subdebate.1></debate></chamber.xscript><answers.to.questions><debate><debateinfo><type>Answers to Questions on Notice</type><title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title><page.no>1341</page.no></debateinfo><para>The following answers to questions were circulated:</para><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Farm Debt</title><page.no>1341</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 680)</subtitle><id.no>680</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>1341</page.no><name role="metadata">Collins, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator Bob Collins</name><name.id>OF4</name.id><electorate>NT</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, upon notice on, 2 July 1997:</para></talk.start><para>What was the level of gross farm debt and net farm debt in the 1993-94, 1994-95, 1995-96 and 1996-97 financial years.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>1341</page.no><name role="metadata">Parer, Sen Warwick</name><name role="display">Senator Parer</name><name.id>KI4</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Resources and Energy</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><para>(a) ABARE's estimate of total farm indebtedness to financial institutions, as at 30 June, in each of the three years are as follows:</para><para></para><para>1994—$17.13 billion; 1995—$17.98 billion; 1996—$19.02 billion.</para><para>(b) ABARE will publish a June 1997 estimate in the next issue of Australian Commodities, to be released 24 March 1998.
