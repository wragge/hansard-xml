R.A.N. casualties are not yet included on the Roll of Honour at the Australian War Memorial alongside Army and R.A.A.F. casualties;</para><para>2. R.A.N. service has not yet been recognised with the visible signs of service to Australia; the Returned from Active Service Badge and the Naval campaign medal; and</para><para>3. R.A.N. service is still not acknowledged as eligible service for the Australian Service Pension, while service by Commonwealth and allied veterans from 55 other countries is.</para><para>Members of the Army and R.A.A.F. who served during the same period in Malaya had their service fully recognised 24 hours after arriving in Malaya.</para><para>In the 1997 Budget the Government partly recognised that R.A.N. service was `operational' and accepted responsibility for disabilities resulting from that service. Those affected appreciate the belated, partial recognition. However, government 
 departments are still resorting to old, and inventing new excuses, to deny the above 3 points.</para><para>Your petitioners therefore request that the Senate acts to help remove the injustice of 40 years and fully recognise R.A.N. service by providing the same recognition and benefits for that service. The cost will be minuscule, being mainly a transfer of pensions from `age' as paid by the Department of Social Security, to `service' pensions, paid by the Department of Veterans' Affairs.</para><presenter><talk.start><talker><name role="display">Senator Forshaw</name><name.id>656</name.id></talker><para>Senator Forshaw(from 34 citizens)</para></talk.start></presenter></petition><para>Petitions received.</para></petition.group><debate><debateinfo><title>NOTICES OF MOTION</title><type>Notices</type><page.no>889</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Regulations and Ordinances Committee</title><page.no>889</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>889</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Chee, Sen Bill</name><name role="display">Senator O'CHEE</name><name.id>EU4</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Pursuant to notice given at the last day of sitting and on behalf of the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, I now withdraw business of the Senate notices of motion Nos 1 and 2 standing in my name for the next day of sitting.</para></talk.start></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>East Timor </title><page.no>889</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>889</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I give notice that, on the next day of sitting, I shall move:</para></talk.start><para>That the Senate—</para><para>(a)	 notes:</para><para>	 (i)	 the endorsement by the Senate of the United Nations (UN) Commission on Human Rights Resolution 1997/63 on East Timor in November 1997,</para><para>	 (ii)	 the commission will sit from 16 March to 24 April 1998 in Geneva and will again consider a European Union draft resolution on human rights in Indonesia/East Timor,</para><para>	 (iii)	 the recommendations of Resolution 1997/63 included clarification of the Dili massacre, release of political prisoners, access to East Timor for human rights organisations, progress on the establishment of a UN human rights office in Jakarta and cooperation with special rapporteurs, and</para><para>	 (iv)	 the Indonesian Government has not implemented any of the recommendations of Resolution 1997/63 and has cut off negotiations with the High Commissioner for Human Rights on the establishment of a human rights office in Jakarta; and</para><para>(b)	 calls on the Australian Government to:

These schemes present particular challenges for scrutiny committees, because they usually deal with important matters and follow complex  making procedures involving Commonwealth, State and Territory governments. These procedures are sometimes used as a reason to attempt to lessen or exclude parliamentary oversight. The Committee, however, does not accept this dilution of the role of Parliament and applies its usual strict standards to these instruments. The legislative scrutiny committees of the Commonwealth, States and Territories cooperate in their scrutiny of national legislative schemes, which are discussed at conferences and meetings of Chairs. During 1997 the Committee wrote twice to the Chairs of our sister Committees on this matter and then presented a paper to the conference of Australian legislative scrutiny committees. Following that conference and further correspondence most of the committees wrote advising that the Committee's suggestions could form the basis of a coordinated approach by all Commonwealth, State and Territory committees. The Chairman pursued this at a meeting of Chairs yesterday. Also, the Legislative Instruments Bill 1996 included a provision which would dilute the 
 effect of the Bill in respect of parliamentary disallowance of instruments providing for uniform national legislative schemes. The Committee reported to the Senate on the Bill on 21 November 1996, 6 March 1997 and 23 June 1997.</para><para>In respect of the activities of the State and Territory committees, the Committee received a very encouraging letter from the Chair of the Queensland Committee on delegated legislation, Mr Tony Elliott MLA, describing its experiences in scrutinising the important Electricity-National Scheme (Queensland) Bill. Unfortunately 1997 also saw advice from the A.C.T. Attorney-General, Mr Gary Humphries MLA, a former Deputy Chairman of the A.C.T. Committee, that there seemed no prospect of advancing our views through the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General. This was disappointing but the Australian legislative scrutiny committees will continue efforts to coordinate our activities and to give our usual close attention  to individual instruments implementing national scheme legislation which are tabled in our separate legislatures. By dint of circumstance, however, a particular package of regulations made under a national scheme gave the committee the opportunity to demonstrate how co-ordinated national scrutiny could be achieved.</para><para>The <inline font-weight="bold">Road Transport Reform (Dangerous Goods) Regulations, Statutory Rules 1997 No.241</inline> , were made under express provisions of the<inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-style="italic">Road Transport Reform (Dangerous Goods) Act 1995 </inline> to apply as laws of the Australian Capital Territory and the Jervis Bay Territory, with the intention that they will be incorporated into the law of the States and the Northern Territory by adopting legislation. As is often the case with regulations implementing a uniform legislative scheme, the Regulations are much longer than the enabling Act.</para><para>The Explanatory Statement for the Regulations advised that they provide for duties and obligations of participants in the transport of dangerous goods by road and for related administration and enforcement. These participants included prime contractors, consignors, drivers, loaders, packers, importers and manufacturers. The Regulations were developed by the National Road Transport Commission (NRTC) under two intergovernmental agreements, in close consultation with the Commonwealth and State and Territory authorities and major stakeholders. The Regulations were made publicly available for comment and approved unanimously by the Ministerial Council for Road Transport.</para><para>The Committee then scrutinised the Regulations in the light of its high standards of personal rights and parliamentary propriety and found a number of deficiencies which warranted an approach to the Minister. These deficiencies were as follows. 
</para><para>Firstly, the Committee noted that the Light Vehicles Agreement 1992 required the NRTC to develop and maintain national standards as a matter of priority. The present Regulations, however, were not made until five years later. This delay appeared to be a breach of parliamentary propriety.</para><para>Secondly, one single provision provided for 68 strict liability offences. The Explanatory Statement did not advise of the need for these offences. The Committee always questions unexplained strict liability offences, which may breach personal rights.</para><para>Thirdly, the Regulations provided for a system of administrative infringement notices for offences. The Committee has no objection to such systems provided that they include proper</para><para>safeguards. In this case an official who serves an infringement notice was given the power to extend the time for payment, apparently forever, with no indication of when the discretion could be exercised, which the Committee noted could be at the time the notice was issued, within the time provided in the notice for payment, or at some later time.</para><para>Fourthly, the Regulations did not include the essential safeguard that infringement notices must notify persons affected of their rights. In particular, an infringement notice was not required to include the vital information that if a person pays the administrative penalty then any liability of the person for the offence is discharged, the person may not be prosecuted in court for the offence and the person is not taken to have been convicted of the offence. This appeared to be a clear breach of personal rights.</para><para>Fifthly, the Regulations provided for reconsideration and review of specified decisions. This was appropriate but the Committee felt that it should receive an assurance that all legislative instruments in the Regulations are subject to disallowance and all administrative decisions are subject to reconsideration and review. The Committee also wanted to be assured that previously existing approvals, determinations and exemptions which the Regulations continued in operation remained subject to any disallowance or review.</para><para>The Committee accordingly wrote to the Minister asking for comments on the apparent deficiencies and noting the helpful cooperation which it had received in respect of related instruments. The Minister replied in considerable detail.</para><para>With respect to the possible delay in making the Regulations the Minister advised that the previous law was poorly expressed and possibly unenforceable in a number of areas. The Regulations involved therefore a significant exercise to restructure the law and the necessary extensive consultation took time. 
</para><para>With respect to strict liability, the Minister advised that the offences related to matters where a contravention could give rise to serious injury to people, property or the environment. As</para><para>such the offences conformed to Commonwealth criminal law policy. The Minister stated that each strict liability offence was carefully considered and was of a regulatory nature which would not result in a lessening of the offender's reputation. Strict liability would allow for easier enforcement, including the use of infringement notices. It was argued that persons who consign dangerous goods or are driving a vehicle transporting dangerous goods are strictly liable on the basis that the improper transport of such substances may have far reaching and devastating effects. It was stated that if one part of a process does not comply with the Regulations that dangerous situations could occur later.</para><para>The Minister advised that the discretion to extend the time for payment of a penalty could be exercised at any time up until a summons was served on the person for the offence. He undertook that the Regulations would be amended to provide that infringement notices must include the usual safeguards.</para><para>The Minister assured the Committee that all legislative instruments made under the Regulations were disallowable and that all administrative decisions are subject to reconsideration and review, except for those decisions which are not the ultimate decision affecting a person's rights and interests. No discretions were exercisable under the instruments continued in effect.</para><para>The Committee thanked the Minister for his advice, which in general met its concerns. The Committee, however, still had reservations about nine of the 68 strict liability offences and asked the Minister for further advice. Five of the nine offences involved drivers and the Committee was particularly concerned that strict liability might operate harshly against them. The Committee suggested that it may be more appropriate to provide that these offences must be knowingly or wilfully committed, especially given that parallel strict liability offences existed in respect of prime contractors. Two of the other four strict liability offences involved transferors, one an owner and one an occupier.</para><para>The Minister replied with a very detailed explanation of the offences, which met its concerns about five of the nine offences, but which still left the Committee with concerns about the</para><para>remaining four. By this stage however, the protective notice of disallowance in respect of the Regulations had almost expired and the matter had become urgent. Accordingly the Chairman had two separate meetings over two days with the Minister and his advisers, following which the Committee 
 obtained an undertaking that three of the four strict liability offences would be amended in respect of strict liability for drivers. The Minister persuaded the Committee that the fourth offence was acceptable. The Committee therefore withdrew its notice of disallowance on what by then was the last day on which it was able to do so, giving notice pursuant to standing order 78 that it would be withdrawn at a later hour of the same</para><para>day. The Committee is pleased to report to the Senate that the position with respect to these Regulations is now acceptable.</para><para>The Committee is particularly grateful for the personal attention which the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, the Hon Mark Vaile MP, gave to the Committee's concerns. The Minister's actions have ensured that the Regulations will comply with high standards of parliamentary propriety and personal rights.</para><para>As noted earlier, the Regulations form the central plank of the uniform national legislative scheme providing for the transport of dangerous goods. They are also an important part of the wider national scheme for regulation of road transport. The Committee will therefore inform the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills and the State and Territory legislative scrutiny committees of its actions, which are another instance of the capacity of legislative scrutiny committees to bring about desirable change.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>5F4</name.id><name role="metadata">Calvert, Sen Paul</name><name role="display">Senator CALVERT</name></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start></continue><para>That the Senate take note of the document.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>894</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I think the issue of national uniform legislation schemes is important. We are going to see a great deal of controversy on some legislation. We are seeing a situation also where the Commonwealth is getting out of a great deal of their responsibilities, especially in relation to the environment. It is interesting that, considering the amount of public concern on issues like the environment, the environment seems to be the particular area where the Commonwealth is choosing to remove themselves from responsibilities.</para></talk.start><para>One of the major problems here is that there should be some sort of oversight function. In my opinion, the Commonwealth should be able to have some kind of scrutiny to see that the standards, whatever kind of agreements have been set, actually take place. That does not seem to be the situation at the moment in relation to such things as the environment and social issues.</para><para>I believe that in many cases when the Commonwealth is getting out of areas of scrutiny it is a means of just getting it out of the way rather than having any better forms of legislation. That is a pity. I think it is necessary for the community of Australia to make sure that the Commonwealth are in fact maintaining their levels of responsibility and that they do not just pick out particular areas to shovel off to the states on the basis that the states will act responsibly.</para><para>There are areas that the Commonwealth are involved with, particularly in international agreements and international responsibilities, and it will be very difficult to find out what is going to happen if we do not have the Commonwealth actually playing their part. We have had announcements from the government that they are going to move out of everything in the environment except those areas of national significance, but they have given no indication of what that might be in relation to international significance and whether it includes things like greenhouse gas emissions which require a concerted approach from the Commonwealth government.</para><para>I wish to put the government on notice that, in relation to any national uniform legislative schemes, we are looking very closely. We know there have been efforts to make these kinds of moves not disallowable. We know there are moves to put major parts of the native title bills into schemes that the states operate rather than the federal government. We know the issues of human rights, social justice and, obviously, environmental integrity are likely losers.</para><para>I think, in the end, it is going to bring a much wider debate within the community about what is or should be in the constitution. I certainly believe there was a deliberate effort not to include any wider issues in the Constitutional Convention. But I think there is going to be greater and greater disquiet within the community if the Commonwealth continues to act in the way it has to date. I seek leave to continue my remarks.</para><para>Leave granted.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Senators' Interests Committee</title><page.no>895</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Annual Report</title><page.no>895</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>895</page.no><name role="metadata">Denman, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator DENMAN</name><name.id>FY5</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I present the annual report for 1997 of the Committee of Senators' Interests.</para></talk.start><para>Ordered that the report be printed.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Senators' Interest Committee</title><page.no>895</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Procedural Rules</title><page.no>895</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>895</page.no><name role="metadata">Denman, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator DENMAN</name><name.id>FY5</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I present the procedural rules for the declaration and preservation of gifts received by senators for the Senate and the Parliament.</para></talk.start><para>Ordered that the document be printed.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>FY5</name.id><name role="metadata">Denman, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator DENMAN</name></talker><para>—I seek leave to make a short statement.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Leave granted.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>FY5</name.id><name role="metadata">Denman, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator DENMAN</name></talker><para>—On 26 August 1997, the Senate agreed to procedures for the declaration by senators of gifts received by them but intended for the Senate as an institution.

The first tranche of rewrite legislation was reviewed during 1996 with the Committee tabling its findings in August of that year. The second tranche was reviewed in 1997 with the Committee reporting in March 1997.</para><para>The Committee looks forward to reviewing further rewrite legislation as it is introduced to Parliament.</para><para>The rewrite is being undertaken by the Tax Law Improvement Project (TLIP), situated in the Australian Taxation Office, and has the aim of simplifying and restructuring the existing law to make it clearer. This should reduce compliance costs to taxpayers. This Bill has attracted considerable interest from stakeholders as it contains the important capital gains tax provisions.</para><para>The Committee, because of its long involvement with the rewrite of the 1936 Act, has recognised recurrent themes that have arisen during the review of this Bill, and has commented on these matters in the report.</para><para>Firstly, stakeholders have been frustrated for some time with the inability of TLIP to address issues of a small `p' policy nature. The Committee has acknowledged this and in <inline font-style="italic">Report 348</inline> —the review of the second tranche of legislation—recommended 
 that TLIP's mandate be extended to encompass the consideration of small policy issues. Although the Government has not agreed with this recommendation, the Assistant Treasurer has put in place a separate mechanism involving stakeholders by which such issues can be addressed. The Committee welcomes this initiative and believes this may satisfy the thrust of its recommendation.</para><para>A second recurrent theme observed by the Committee, is the continuing perception among some stakeholders that TLIP defers to an Australian Taxation Office view when translating the existing law into new law. Several submissions have focused on this issue and the Committee notes that the perception is strongly held by some stakeholders and has been rigorously defended by TLIP.</para><para>The Committee has discussed this matter in the report and provided some of the evidence as an appendix.</para><para>The Committee notes that if individual stakeholders strongly disagree with the stance taken by TLIP on a particular matter, there are various other avenues to seek redress. This is entirely appropriate and forms a keystone of our system of government.</para><para>A third recurrent theme, and one which appears to have had a critical impact on this review, relates to the time available to review the Bill.</para><para>The Bill contains the important and complex capital gains tax provisions, but unfortunately the time allowed for stakeholders to respond to exposure drafts of the legislation has been truncated, and the time for the Committee to review the Bill after its introduction has been short, especially when compared to the complex issues upon which the Committee has been expected to report.</para><para>As well, there is evidence of undue haste in preparing the Bill because it was incomplete when introduced, and one division and several transitional provisions have yet to be released.</para><para>The truncated consultation process and incompleteness of the Bill have led witnesses to express a lack of confidence in their ability to adequately review the proposed legislation and identify unintended consequences. They have called for the implementation of the Bill to be delayed or for a no-detriment clause to be added.</para><para>The Committee in reviewing the Bill has found itself in a similar position to the stakeholders. The incompleteness of the Bill and the short time for review has prevented the Committee reviewing the legislation with the thoroughness it would like.The Committee has therefore recommended that the implementation of two Divisions and one Subdivision of the Bill be delayed pending its review by the Committee. These provisions were released too late for the Committee to review them or have not been released at all. The Committee also notes that 
 transitional provisions relating to twelve areas have yet to be released.</para><para>The Committee considers it inappropriate to go further and has not agreed with calls to delay the entire Bill. The Committee acknowledges the imperative to maintain momentum in the progressive introduction of clearer law to replace the 1936 Act and is encouraged by the fact that witnesses have commented favourably on the clarity of the Bill. Taxpayers should not be denied recourse to legislation which is designed to be clearer and which should reduce compliance costs.</para><para>The alternative to delaying the Bill advocated by some witnesses—the introduction of a no-detriment clause—has also not been supported by the Committee. Such a clause would prevent closing off the existing law. In reviewing previous rewrite legislation, the Committee supported the view that the rewritten legislation should replace the provisions of the 1936 Act and should not operate in tandem with that Act. The Committee has not changed its view and believes it is more appropriate for taxpayers to rely on the existing section 1-3 and the traditional avenue of legislative amendment to protect against unintended consequences.</para><para>The Committee in reviewing the individual clauses of the Bill has made a number of recommendations which relate to</para><para>.	 policy issues which are outside TLIP's mandate;</para><para>.	 major technical issues which are sufficiently weighty to require substantial review which may be beyond TLIP's capacity to undertake, or be sufficiently broad in scope to impinge on policy matters; and</para><para>.	 minor technical issues of a non-policy nature which TLIP can address.</para><para>The report also contains as an appendix, comments on individual clauses of the Bill made in submissions and by witnesses, together with responses by TLIP. The Committee believes this will be a guide to the evidence and assist the debate on the details of the Bill.</para><para>In conclusion and on behalf of the Committee, I would like to thank all those who have contributed to this review. Many have provided submissions to the Committee and appeared as witnesses at the Committee's public hearings. In particular I would like to thank the private sector representatives on TLIP and TLIP's private sector consultative committee.</para><para>I would also like to thank members of the secretariat, Dr Margot Kerley the JCPAA secretary and Dr John Carter and Ms Tiana Gray who were involved with inquiry. I also thank Mr Gary Martin who was seconded to the secretariat to assist the Committee and its secretariat with the review.

The bills provide both the ABC and SBS with the opportunity to have a direct commercial relationship with transmission service providers  a relationship they have been seeking for a long time.</para><para>In evidence to the Committee, both organisations welcomed the greater flexibility that the new arrangements would give them. They told the Committee that the sale of the National Transmission Network to a private entity would provide them with an opportunity to achieve control of their transmission services, an objective that they had been pursuing for many years.</para><para>Both public broadcasting organisations told the Committee that they had been thoroughly consulted during the development of the bill and that they were confident that the compact that they were negotiating with the government would be satisfactory and would enable them to fulfil their current obligations.</para><para>The government has ensured a smooth transition to the new regime by providing the public broadcasters with the opportunity to enter into a 5 year contract with the NTN and subsequently with the 
 new owners to obtain transmission services which the government is committed to fund fully. In addition, the broadcasters have the option of renewing this contract for two further 5 year periods when the initial contract expires.</para><para>The bill ensures that after the sale, the public broadcasters will be able to maintain and develop their commitment to rural and regional areas. Through the development of a new access regime to transmission services, the government has been particularly careful to ensure that community service obligations continue to be met.</para><para>Community broadcasters who sent submissions to the inquiry acknowledged that the government is providing direct budget supplementation to Radio for the Print Handicapped broadcasting groups to enable them to pay access fees. Other self-help retransmission services and remote commercial television services will also receive concessional pricing arrangements. Those emergency service organisations, largely manned by volunteers, which operate services relating to the preservation of human life will also benefit from concessional pricing and the opportunity of renewing their contracts for two further 5 year periods substantially under the same terms and conditions.</para><para>The Committee was concerned that certain ancillary services such as closed captioning for the hearing impaired might suffer if they are not considered a `protected service' under the new regime. Accordingly, it has recommended an amendment to Clause 15(2) so that closed captioning should be a protected service included in the new access regime.</para><para>I commend the report to the Senate.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1997</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>898</page.no><id.no>r381</id.no><cognate><cognateinfo><title>CUSTOMS AND EXCISE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 1998</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>r407</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate><cognate><cognateinfo><title>CRIMES (SUPERANNUATION BENEFITS) AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>r392</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate><cognate><cognateinfo><title>AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY (PLANNING AND LAND MANAGEMENT) AMENDMENT BILL 1997</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>r377</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate><cognate><cognateinfo><title>LAW OFFICERS AMENDMENT BILL 1997</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>r410</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>898</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bills received from the House of Representatives. </para><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>899</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN MACDONALD</name><name.id>YW4</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I indicate to the Senate that those bills which have just been announced are being introduced together.

It provides new funding of $3,783,052,000 in 1999 (in addition to the existing $8,247,000 already legislated) and $3,581,640,000 in 2000. In legislating funds for 1999 and 2000, the bill confirms to higher education institutions the overall funding levels that are expected to be published later this year in the <inline font-style="italic">Higher Education Funding Report for the 1998-2000 Triennium</inline> . This will assist the institutions in their planning for the next few years.</para><para>I want to take this opportunity to set the funding decisions embodied in this bill in the context of the Government's policy to promote access to higher education in Australia and to build quality. The 
 Government is pursuing a quite deliberate strategy to expand both places and resources for the universities at the same time as it changes the mix of public and private funding.</para><para>Under this Government there has been strong growth in the number of undergraduate student places. In 1997 there were over 17,000 more undergraduate places than there had been in 1996, an increase that will, according to the universities' estimates, still be in place in 1999.</para><para>These figures are even better news for educational opportunity than they first appear, since the 17-24 year old population, from which 70 per cent of undergraduate students are drawn, will decline by 3 per cent over the period 1996 to 1999. The result is that a greater proportion of young Australians will have the opportunity to continue with their studies.</para><para>If postgraduate students are included, the increase in numbers is even greater. On the universities' estimates, there will be in the year 2000 in excess of 453,000 domestic students in the higher education system, an increase of over 27,000 on 1996.</para><para>In every year currently legislated, and in the years legislated by these amendments, there is an increase over 1996 in the number of Commonwealth funded undergraduate places. In the year 2000 there will be over 14,000 more Commonwealth funded undergraduate places than there were in 1996.</para><para>In implementing the efficiency cuts to forward estimates the Government has been careful to maintain fairness. The universities have wherever possible accommodated the changed financing at the postgraduate course work level. This maximises the number of students who will receive a first degree and all the opportunities that can flow from that.</para><para>The universities will from 1998 be paid the equivalent of the minimum up front differential HECS payment for each HECS liable undergraduate they enrol over their target level. For institutions with low costs this is an opportunity to offer additional places without charging fees.</para><para>Further opportunities to participate in higher education have been created by the Government's decision to allow universities, from 1 January next year, to offer undergraduate fee-paying positions once they have met their target enrolment levels. These are all extra places that would not otherwise have existed. As students take up the fee paying positions, this has a flow-on effect, creating new opportunities for students who would otherwise have missed out on a HECS funded place. It is a win-win policy. Students who would have missed out on their first preference course will now get to do it, and students who would have missed out on higher education entirely will now get to enrol. 
</para><para>Over time, this policy could greatly increase the number of places in Australian universities. Up to 25 per cent of course numbers can be fee-paying once the institution has met its target enrolments, so the potential numbers of new undergraduate students on a Commonwealth-funded base of over 360,000 is very large indeed.</para><para>Another important point to recognise is that this policy shift ends the previous government's discrimination against Australian undergraduate students and ensures that Australian students have equal rights of entry to Australian universities with overseas students. Under the Labor Party, if you were from overseas you could invest in your future via education. But not if you were Australian. Under the Labor Party, if you were a postgraduate you could invest in your future via education. But not if you were an undergraduate. This was a very unfair policy. Yet it is a policy Labor plans to bring back. Their draft platform released last week promises the abolition of this new opportunity for students to invest in their futures. This is a very backward step.</para><para>As higher education numbers expand we must make sure that opportunities to participate are widespread. The Government wishes to increase opportunities for groups that have been under-represented in higher education. People with disabilities, people from disadvantaged socio-economic backgrounds, women in non-traditional areas of study, people from rural and isolated areas, people from non-English speaking backgrounds, and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders are all the beneficiaries of the merit scholarships introduced in 1997. These scholarships provide exemption from the HECS charge to an additional 1000 effective full time student units each year. By the year 2000 the scholarships will provide exemptions of 4000 equivalent full time student units, which means that well over 4000 students will benefit each year.</para><para>These groups of people also benefit from the Higher Education Equity Program, which assists the universities in developing appropriate programs to improve educational outcomes. Additional measures costing $72 million over three years were announced last year by Senator Vanstone for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander higher education.</para><para>The distribution of growth places is designed to ensure that potential students do not miss out because of where they live. Between 1996 and 1999 Queensland's Commonwealth funded undergraduate places will increase by approximately 14 per cent, and Western Australia's by around 5 per cent.</para><para>The higher education system cannot just be assessed by the number of students within it at any given time. A high quality education is essential if the potential present in Australia's students is to be 
 realised, and if our universities are to remain competitive in the world market.</para><para>The universities, and many dedicated individuals within them, have already taken steps to maintain and improve teaching standards. The introduction of first overseas and now Australian fee-paying students means that the universities have strong financial incentives to deliver a high quality product. Since it is in most cases impractical for the universities to differentiate between fee-paying and non fee-paying students, the policy of liberalising access to the education system produces spin-off benefits for non-fee paying students.</para><para>The Government has taken other measures to help improve the quality of teaching. The Committee for University Teaching and Development was established in July 1996 with a budget of $20 million over three years. It makes recommendations for grants to encourage practical improvements in teaching and provide for staff development projects.</para><para>The status of teaching within the universities is being enhanced by the Australian Awards for University Teaching, announced in the Great Hall last Monday night. These Awards recognise and reward excellence in teaching, in the way that the grants administered by the Australian Research Council recognise and reward the many outstanding researchers in our universities.</para><para>Funding for higher education research through the targeted higher education research programme has been increased over the 1997-99 triennium, with additional funding totalling $129.3 million including the $90 million for research infrastructure. The quality of research training is being enhanced through an additional $9.3 million in support for Australian Postgraduate Awards. Funding for collaborative research grants, now re-aligned in the Strategic Partnerships with Industry—Research and Training Scheme, has been increased by $30 million. This collaborative funding forges stronger links between industry and universities, providing mutually beneficial opportunities for researchers in both sectors and helping universities diversify their funding sources.</para><para>It is important to look at the overall impact of higher education funding decisions taken by the government. The government's financial commitment to higher education remains, of course, very substantial indeed. Despite the efficiency cuts to the forward estimates total Commonwealth expenditure on higher education will remain higher under this Government than it was under the former Government.</para><para>In considering higher education funding it is important to look not just at Commonwealth funding, but at the total revenues available to the higher education sector. These are the figures that represent the true resources available to higher 
 education. They show that substantially greater funds are available to the universities.</para><para>About a third of all university revenue now comes from non-government sources. These revenue sources have the potential for growth. Total funding from all sources to the universities is estimated to have increased by around $460 million between 1995 and 1997. By 1999 it is estimated that the universities will have revenues around $650 million greater than in 1995.</para><para>While the Commonwealth government will remain the largest single source of funds for higher education, significant growth in higher education funding will be coming from the entrepreneurial activities of the universities themselves.</para><para>To spread the burdens of fiscal restraint fairly, the Commonwealth has phased in the reductions in the growth in the amount of money for higher education. On top of that we provided the opportunity for the sector to expand and become less dependent on Commonwealth money by creating the opportunities for the universities to raise revenue in other ways.</para><para>Australian universities have been very successful in capturing a sizeable portion of the overseas student market. Despite the currency difficulties in some parts of Asia the prospects for the Australian education export industry are positive and our universities should still be able to derive a substantial income from overseas students.</para><para>Growth in higher education overseas student numbers in 1997 is approximately 16 per cent.</para><para>Our ability to sustain growth in the overseas student market is because so far studying in Australia is still comparatively cheap. The United States and the United Kingdom are still more expensive study destinations than Australia.</para><para>Demand for study abroad is likely to be somewhat dampened by the current economic downturns in Asian economies. Nevertheless, currency devaluations may in some countries have worked in our favour by widening the cost gap between us and our major competitor countries, strengthening Australia's position in the education export market.</para><para>The most recent evaluation of the situation is that, due to relative movements in exchange rates over recent months, Australia's competitive position against the US, the UK and Canada has improved in all our major markets—Malaysia, Indonesia, Hong Kong, Thailand, Taiwan, Singapore, South Korea, Japan, Vietnam, China and India.</para><para>Overseas educational qualifications will continue to be strongly valued in Asian economies and the longer term demand for skilled labour will persist. Australia has a good reputation for providing a quality education and therefore I expect that 
 Australia also continue to capture a significant share of the overseas higher education market</para><para>This Government will assist where it can. In order to more fully understand the situation facing the Australian international education and training industry I have commissioned Professor Raoul Mortley to undertake an investigation and report to me by 15 December 1997.</para><para>It is important that the higher education sector, and all other sectors of education and training, meet the needs of the community and employers as well as those of the students. This leads me to the important theme of lifelong learning.</para><para>Gaining skills is now much more complex. In the higher education sector this means that education and training does not necessarily happen at one institution in a continuous block of time. This allied to the increase in student numbers and the diversity of student backgrounds has placed greater demands on universities.</para><para>As the notions of lifelong learning—and the need constantly to update skills—take greater hold the education and training sector must develop appropriate delivery systems at a reasonable cost.</para><para>The ramifications of lifelong learning will go across boundaries. Schools, universities and vocational education institutions traditionally have different missions. It is already apparent, however, that the boundaries between the sectors are becoming blurred.</para><para>We have higher education institutions which offer sub-degree programs and some TAFEs now offer degrees. Considerable attention is now paid to articulation arrangements. I expect this trend to intensify.</para><para>An increase in flexible arrangements in the post-compulsory education and training sector will help to achieve one of this Governments priorities—to ensure that every young person wanting to pursue education or training after the compulsory years of schooling, can do so.</para><para>The fact is that about one quarter of 16, 17 and 18 year olds are not in any form of post-compulsory education and training. This Federal Government will do its utmost to expand opportunities for and lift the skill levels of these young people. At the same time we want to ensure that adults of all ages have good access to post-compulsory education and training at different stages throughout their lives. This Government intends to progress this agenda with the cooperation of all education and training sectors.</para><para>I will now turn to other specific measures in this bill. The bill is designed to improve and streamline the operation of the higher education program, and will also provide increased funds to the sector over existing legislated amounts. 
</para><para>In addition to legislating for the major funding amounts I have already mentioned the bill amends the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 to provide supplementation for price movements, covering items such as superannuation expenses, teaching hospitals, special capital projects, grants to open learning organisations and the total limit for certain grants. The total increase on existing amounts in 1998 will be $165,000.</para><para>The bill also builds on the streamlined arrangements for applications for remission of debt under the Higher Education Contribution Scheme (HECS) and the Open Learning Deferred Payment Scheme (OLDPS), introduced by the Higher Education Funding Amendment Act (No.1) 1997. It introduces provisions to streamline the administration of the remission arrangements, by deeming applicants to have received notification of a decision on their application within a reasonable period. The amendment also places the emphasis on the applicant to advise the Secretary of the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs of a change of address. The amendment will streamline the remission process for students and simplify the administration of the process.</para><para>The bill also amends the Maritime College Act 1978 to ensure that the Australian Maritime College's (AMC) ability to charge fees is linked to the conditions of grants specified in the Higher Education Funding Act 1988. Unlike the statutes of other institutions, the Maritime College Act 1978 currently does not contain any provision to link the charging of fees to the conditions of grant under the Higher Education Funding Act 1988. The amendment will ensure that the Government may take action against the institution for any breach of the arrangements for charging fees to students. This is consistent with conditions already applying to other institutions.</para><para>This bill reflects the Government's commitment to a higher education system that is efficient, relevant and of a high quality, striving for excellence and innovation in teaching and research.</para><para>I commend the bill to the Senate.</para><para><inline ref="r407">CUSTOMS AND EXCISE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 1) 1998</inline></para><para>The Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1998 has three main purposes:</para><para>1.to amend the Customs Act 1901 (the Customs Act) to clarify that the Customs Act does not extend to the Australian external Territories,</para><para>2.to amend the Customs Amendment Act (No. 1) 1997 to remove the reduced entry threshold for goods imported by the post, and

Minor Amendments</inline></para><para>This bill will also make several minor technical amendments to the Customs Act and the Excise Act 1901. These are explained in detail in the explanatory memorandum.</para><para><inline ref="r392">CRIMES (SUPERANNUATION BENEFITS) AMENDMENT BILL 1998</inline></para><para>This bill amends the Crimes (Superannuation Benefits) Act 1989 and the Australian Federal Police Act 1979. Those two acts make provision for the making of superannuation orders against corrupt Commonwealth employees, which have the effect of cancelling those employees' Commonwealth funded superannuation benefits. The bill improves the operation of superannuation orders and makes provision for a more efficient recovery of benefits that have been paid by Commonwealth schemes.</para><para>The bill allows superannuation benefits that have been rolled-over or transferred from Commonwealth schemes to be traced and recovered from roll-over institutions. That closes a gap in both acts which has allowed some roll-overs to escape the operation of superannuation orders.</para><para>The bill also provides a mechanism by which Commonwealth employees charged with or convicted of corruption offences may have their employer-funded superannuation benefits temporarily suspended. Those amendments bring the Crimes Superannuation Benefits Act in line with the Australian Federal Police Act which already makes provision for the suspension of benefits of AFP members and staff members.</para><para>Where a person has been charged with or convicted of a corruption offence, the Minister may make a written direction to the accused's superannuation fund, the effect of which is to temporarily suspend the accused's employer-funded superannuation benefits. The suspension prevents the dissipation of superannuation benefits which may later become the subject of a superannuation or recovery order. Suspension or "freezing" of employer benefits preserves the benefits in the Commonwealth scheme until the finalisation of superannuation order proceedings. A person's own contributions are not affected by the suspension and may be 
 withdrawn or cashed in accordance with the cashing restrictions of the superannuation law. The suspension expires after 12 months, or sooner, for example, if the person is acquitted of the offence or if the charges are withdrawn or otherwise not proceeded with.</para><para>The bill also authorises the Official Trustee to take charge of and sell restrained property in satisfaction of a superannuation recovery order. Those provisions are modelled on similar provisions in the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987. The Crimes Superannuation Benefits Act has always made provision for restraining orders but until now, there has been no mechanism to dispose of restrained property to discharge superannuation order debts.</para><para>The bill simplifies the way in which information is provided to a court that certifies the extent of a person's superannuation benefits in superannuation order proceedings. It seeks to relax the rules concerning the admissibility of certain documents.</para><para>Finally, the bill facilitates the provision of information by superannuation entities concerning Commonwealth employees to the Commonwealth.</para><para>The extension of superannuation recovery orders to roll-overs, the suspension of employer-funded benefits of persons charged with or convicted of corruption offences, and the new role of the Official Trustee, fortify the operation of the two acts and ensure that corrupt Commonwealth employees either do not receive or retain the benefit of Commonwealth funded superannuation. That is consistent with the underlying policy of superannuation orders that a Commonwealth employee who discharges his or her duties in a corrupt way has failed to fulfil a fundamental condition of employment and by doing so, forfeits his or her entitlement to publicly funded superannuation. Under the two acts, a person is entitled to a refund of his or her own contributions and interest and these amendments do not disturb that position.</para><para>The amendments are expected to have a minor and unquantifiable financial impact on Government revenue.</para><para>I commend the bill to the Senate.</para><para><inline ref="r377">AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY (PLANNING AND LAND MANAGEMENT) AMENDMENT BILL 1997</inline></para><para>The purpose of this Bill is to increase the attractiveness of the Australian Capital Territory to potential investors by removing the perceived disincentive to business and other investment, brought about by the limit of land tenure to 99-year estates, as distinct from freehold title enjoyed elsewhere in Australia.

I thought we would move requests for amendments which fitted in with that report as it had been such a longstanding debate going back over many years. I had moved similar requests previously. As a matter of fact, it was Senator Patterson, Senator Lees and I who agreed on the occasion we had moved, once again, that same request for amendment—that it should go to an inquiry.

 and business assets in businesses in which the parent is substantially engaged.</para><para>That is a very clear policy and this is a chance for the coalition to implement what they themselves recognised first of all in the inquiry we had and then in their own policy.</para><para>As a matter of fact, when I pressed Senator Brownhill prior to the election he told me that I would be pleased with the coalition policy on this issue. When I saw it I said, `It's not the 100 per cent the inquiry recommended but it is a first step.' I thought that it would not be long before we saw the coalition bringing this matter into this place so that they could implement it because of their representation of farmers. When this legislation came forward I thought it would be the first opportunity to do so. I was surprised that it was not there. So I thought that we would help the coalition to fulfil a very important promise to give access to education to farm families affected by the nature of farming.</para><para>I was pleased that the coalition had extended that beyond simply farm assets to other business assets where there is a similar situation obtaining.

It is very good of you to give me a chance to have a word. Senator, you would be well aware that there have been concerns for a long time in the farming community about issues to do with assets testing. As a result, as soon as we came into government we set up a rural task force, headed at that time by my Parliamentary Secretary, Senator Rod Kemp, and latterly by my next Parliamentary Secretary, Senator Grant Tambling. </para></talk.start><para>They went around Australia and they met with organisations and individuals and came up with recommendations as to what needed to be done to best help the farming community in response to issues related to the assets test. As a result, the triple A package, which was announced in September or thereabouts by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Anderson, has been very well received in the farming community as going to the special needs of farmers having difficulty on the land.</para><para>An important element of that triple A package was the retired farmers adjustment scheme, which has in fact allowed for the orderly gifting of farm assets from one generation to another where a family farm is not viable to keep two families. That has meant that farmers who have a personal interest of up to $500,000, debt free—and that in itself is quite something, but their personal share in the farm is up to $500,000—are enabled to gift the farm to their family who are working the farm and move onto age pension, provided they meet the criteria. That is really substantial because the average age of Australian farmers is 58, which is way too high. We need a younger generation of farmers coming on and we need to be able to keep our young farmers on the farm, and one of the problems has been the lack of succession planning and the limitations which the gifting provisions have put on people who leave it to the last minute. So the window of opportunity that that legislation will give to struggling farm families who may in fact be asset rich but getting little reward from their farm is going to be a major benefit, not to a wide range of farmers; I do not want to suggest that—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>B36</name.id><name role="metadata">NEAL</name><name role="display">Senator Neal</name></talker><para>—Something like 60, I think you said.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>BE4</name.id><name role="metadata">Newman, Sen Jocelyn</name><name role="display">Senator NEWMAN</name></talker><para>—Nothing like that; it was 2,100.

It is an expensive measure to help them; I think it is something like $70 million of public funds to help those farmers who may on paper have what looks like substantial assets. I think we have honoured our commitment to farmers. When you take 
 into consideration in addition to that the substantial benefits that this youth allowance legislation is going to mean for country kids in terms of being able to afford to go away to study, you would have to agree that, as a package of measures, it has meant that we have been very focused on helping farm families.</para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>907</page.no><name role="metadata">Neal, Sen Belinda</name><name role="display">Senator NEAL</name><name.id>B36</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I take on board the minister's description of the provisions that allow farmers to pass on their farm and receive the pension, but that is not what I was asking.

In fact, I wrote a private member's bill on this some time ago and then discovered that the government were taking it up. I will say, though, that we are going to have to amend it fairly heavily because it is far too exclusive, particularly the intergenerational transfer. From round the country financial planners are telling me that they are not able to find farmers who are able to fit all the criteria. So we are going to have to fix up the government's package when it comes into this place, but we have not seen the legislation yet. What I am trying to do is not simply to help the transfer of older farmers out of farming so that younger farmers can come in and take over but to help the families of those younger farmers, particularly the children of those younger farmers, to be able to get education. That is the issue, and it relates particularly to this common youth allowance legislation. That is why I want to press this amendment.

I have been doing my best to ensure that accountants, lawyers and farm leaders around the country understand the fine print as well, because one of the things that has not been well understood is that it is not only the net value of the farm but it is the net value of the farmer's interest in the farm that has to be under $500,000. That, for most farms in Australia, is pretty reasonable. But this is not the occasion to be debating farmers. I am glad you think it is a worthy measure. I look forward to that debate and your support. By that stage I hope that you see that the fine print is very good. There have been something like a thousand or more expressions of interest so far in it and I think 400 or 500 have put their names down to apply as soon as the legislation goes through.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>907</page.no><name role="metadata">Neal, Sen Belinda</name><name role="display">Senator NEAL</name><name.id>B36</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Maybe I missed it yesterday, but has the government indicated whether they will be supporting this amendment?</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>907</page.no><name role="metadata">Newman, Sen Jocelyn</name><name role="display">Senator NEWMAN</name><name.id>BE4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Social Security</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—No, the government will not be supporting it.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>907</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Because Senator Newman did not actually answer the question asked by Senator Neal, can I just clarify with the minister that you are confirming that you are going to be voting against your own policy?</para></talk.start><para>	 Question put:</para><para>	 That the request (<inline font-weight="bold">Senator Woodley's</inline> ) be agreed to.</para></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>10:11:00</time.stamp><para>The committee divided.	</para></division.header><para></para><division.data><ayes><num.votes>0</num.votes><title>AYES</title><names><name>Allison, L. </name><name>Bartlett, A.

You might recall that, previously, the social security legislation for students had provision for a yearly income test which had similar effects to this, but this is the first time the income test as such—as an income bank—has been included in the legislation. I think it is a very good move.</para><para>In most cases students are allowed to earn $230 a fortnight before their Austudy, or youth allowance in this case, is affected. If they earn a larger amount, they can extend it, over a longer period, to allow them to still access the allowance. In the normal lifestyle of a student, that would allow them to work intensively during the vacation period and earn in excess of $230 per fortnight but then to earn nothing, or very little, during the normal studying period and to even out their income over the year so that it is not detrimentally affected. That obviously gives a lot of benefit to students. It ensures that they can maximise their income earning capacity during the vacation periods and maximise their time for studying during the semester periods. I really have to say it is a very positive step. The effect of our amendments is to try to extend this mechanism to unemployed young people—of course, that would include those young people who are presently being case managed.</para><para>The provision now for young people is that they can only earn $30 a week before their youth allowance is lowered and, for many people, $30 a week is not a great deal of money. I suppose there may well be an acceptance in the community that if you are earning more than that amount your reliance on the community should be reduced.</para><para>What I am concerned about and what the amendments are aimed at is that, with the way that work practices are and with the present level of unemployment, sometimes access to employment may only be in very short bursts. I do not believe that it is unusual for a young person to be offered employment for, say, a short period of one or two weeks. That person would obviously earn substantially in excess of the $30 a week. What I am concerned about is that we, as a community, want to maximise the possibility of that young person ultimately being employed—hopefully in a career that they enjoy—and that the best way of ensuring that they eventually enter full-time and ongoing employment is that they obtain some sort of work experience. It is really not a very unusual story to hear from young people that their biggest impediment to getting work is that, 
 when they apply for the job and are asked what experience they have, their answer is none. I do not think that is through any fault of their own. You have to start somewhere.</para><para>By allowing the income bank to be applied to those young people, I am not suggesting in any way that their income-free area should be extended beyond the $30 a week but they should be able to average it out over time. If they, say, get a couple of weeks employment but then are unemployed for a substantial period, their income should be evened out so that their youth allowance is not affected. I think this would be a very useful mechanism to emphasise to young people that they should take up work, even if it is only for a very short period, and to encourage them to gain that sort of short-term experience in the hope that, ultimately, that will serve them in good stead in getting long-term work. It is unfortunate but, with our present levels of unemployment and in particular our levels of unemployment for young people, it is often extraordinarily difficult for young people to get work, and we should be assisting in any way we can.</para><para>I suppose what the minister may say in response is that we cannot be too lenient—that if they are earning above the $30 a week, their youth allowance should be reduced. But, in terms of encouraging young people to get that work experience, I am prone to lean on the side of leniency and to say that it is more important to get them back to work in the long term than it is to apply strictly an income-free zone without exception in the short term. One of the great problems that has been developing—only in the last three to five years, maybe less, it seems to me—is that of long-term unemployment. I do not mean that in the technical sense of over two years. I am talking about people who are unemployed, with few skills, little experience and a limited expectation of ever being employed. This group starts at 18—not at an older age—and, with each passing year that they remain unemployed and without work experience, the chances increase of their ultimately becoming one of the entrenched long-term unemployed. I plead very strongly with the Senate to consider these requests for amendment care 
 fully, to vote for them and for giving unemployed young people a better opportunity of gaining experience and of ultimately being gainfully employed.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>909</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Greens (WA) thought this was such a good idea that we also had this in our amendments. But, because we knew the ALP were moving it, we dropped it off our sheet. Naturally, we will be supporting this. One of the issues that is very prevalent amongst young unemployed people is the level of indebtedness. It is not unreasonable to suggest that seasonal work of some nature hardly delivers a sovereign's ransom. It would be unfortunate if they were punished for trying to get a Bankcard debt down or trying to get on their feet and cover some other costs in their life by utilising those kinds of seasonal work opportunities or, as Senator Neal suggested, other potential work opportunities.</para></talk.start><para>A work opportunity could arise from somebody in an office going on leave and an unemployed person then has an opportunity to fill that position and get some real experience. We should try to find ways to deal with that transitional time: from the point of being unemployed to the point of gaining the confidence to go out into the workplace and earn a real living. Unfortunately, the government is not doing a lot about that, so the very least it can do is assist young people to get that experience, to utilise seasonal work where it exists, and to have the potential to stay out of debt.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>909</page.no><name role="metadata">Newman, Sen Jocelyn</name><name role="display">Senator NEWMAN</name><name.id>BE4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Social Security</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I caution the Senate against accepting this opposition amendment. One of the most telling things is that, as I am advised, it would cost around $27 million a year to extend this provision to the young unemployed from being given just to students. I remind the Senate that Department of Social Security statistics show that on average young people now remain on unemployed payments for five months. That would not seem to be an enormous problem when you compare their ability to take up opportunities for part-time work with the situation of students, who may be on a youth allow 
 ance—Austudy, as it is now—for a number of years.</para></talk.start><para>There are differences in this element between students and the young unemployed. Students have a much more constrained opportunity to take work because of the nature of their studies and their time commitments. It is much more difficult for them to take part-time work during the year, but they can take it during semester breaks and the long break in the summer. That is why we have tried to make special arrangements for students. </para><para>The current income test for unemployment benefits is a fair balance. It is one for which I give credit to the previous government, as I have done before in this place, for having introduced in 1995 a better arrangement for people trying to get some part-time work while they are on benefits. As Senator Neal has said, that is $30 a week without losing one dollar of benefit; for the next $40 a week they lose only 50c in the dollar; and beyond that it is 70c in the dollar. It is a long taper for income testing, which I do not believe is unfair.</para><para>The current system gives people an incentive to find work. When the Labor Party introduced that tapered means test, the argument was very strongly put that that was in order to give a real incentive to find work and to reward people for finding work. We agree with that; it was the right thing to do. It certainly has proved its worth. More and more people are taking up part-time or casual work opportunities when they arise.</para><para>Also, they are not likely to be unemployed or to be on income support for as long as students are and do not have the same constraints on when they earn their income. But, if you extend the student income bank, you would effectively be undermining means testing for young people. That is why the Senate should recognise that the result of that would be extra expenditure of around $27 million a year and that would be totally unacceptable to this government.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>910</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Considering the minister has not answered any of my questions I asked yesterday about her costings, it is extraordi

Senator Neal knows that every time she has asked for information I have done my utmost to get it for her in a speedy fashion. As she was in government—although not as a minister—only relatively recently, she would realise that this can be a problem for ministers in debates, no matter what the political colour, no matter which department we are talking about. If oppositions or minority parties want additional information to what is available to the officers who are present in the chamber, then sometimes it can take some time to get.</para></talk.start><para>I am sorry, Senator, if you do not feel that you have had speedy enough service. I have done my utmost to accommodate you. I understand that you would like more information on this, but I have given you the information that was very relevant to this debate. It is that on average young people between the ages of 18 and 20 are on unemployment payments for five months. That is very relevant to this question about incentives and questions about young people taking up work, because it means that they then go either into work or into study after that period of unemployment. You are asking for additional information on that. I do not have that yet, and I am sorry about that, but you have enough to be going on with because, quite clearly, the issue is one of incentive.</para><para>Your government—obviously Senator Margetts did not realise this—introduced what I think was a very good change to the Social Security Act which did provide for much greater incentives for people of any age to take up available work, and I have commended you for it. That remains. It is not something we have introduced, but it is a good thing. Therefore, I think the young unemployed people who do have more available time to look for work and to take up opportunities for work do not need the income bank provisions which are provided specifically for students because they do not have those same opportunities to take up job opportunities of one kind or another during an academic semester. You would recognise that 
 is the case. I cannot believe that you would be prepared to spend $27 million per annum extra in order to extend the income bank provisions to a group of young people who, because of your own government's actions, already do have substantial incentives to take up what work is available.</para><para>Before I sit down, I point out to you that the whole purpose of youth allowance—there are several, but a very primary purpose of youth allowance—is to make sure that young people by the time they are 18 are much more employable than they are now, because too high a proportion of them are offering themselves on the job market without skills. When this measure is introduced, we will start to see young people acquiring the skills up to the age of 18 that they will need to offer employers. Hopefully we will not have the big pool of unemployed young people that we inherited when we came into government.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>914</page.no><name role="metadata">Neal, Sen Belinda</name><name role="display">Senator NEAL</name><name.id>B36</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I do not wish to take up the time of the Senate on this issue for much longer, in terms of access to information.

It is an amendment to the Social Security Act relating to the two-year waiting period for newly arrived residents and it seeks to exempt those people from the waiting period simply in relation to special benefit. The reason why I am moving this—I understand the Greens (WA) have an identical amendment that they are seeking to move as well—is in response to a growing number of calls from community and charity groups, groups that work with newly arrived residents, who are seeing the impact that this measure of the two-year waiting period is having on a number of people.</para><para>Those community groups are being left to pick up the pieces when our newly arrived residents find themselves in circumstances of destitution, unable to meet their most basic requirements and needs of life. That situation is a direct result of the legislation that was passed by this parliament last year which does leave a number of people finding that they cannot meet even their most basic requirements of life. These are legal Australian residents who have been invited into Australian society. They are unable to buy sufficient food to eat, unable to access safe or suitable accommodation and unable to feed their children an adequate and nutritious diet. In fact, some newly arrived residents have found that they have been left with no option but to have their children cared for by other people simply because they cannot access adequate financial resources to care for themselves. In the Democrats' view, that is a totally unacceptable situation.</para><para>The two-year waiting period overall for social security benefits for newly arrived residents was introduced in March last year and passed through the parliament at that time. At that time the Democrats opposed that measure. We continue to do so because we believe that the principle that it is founded on is fundamentally flawed and discriminatory and also counterproductive, not only socially but we believe economically.</para><para>A number of organisations have criticised the measure. Welfare rights groups and ACOSS in particular have said that the introduction of the social security waiting period for newly arrived migrants is basically creating a nightmare for those people and is perhaps the most serious undermining of the basic fabric of Australia's social security safety net. The Democrats believe that leaving newly arrived residents, or anyone else for that matter, without access to any income at all when they have no other alternative means of support is completely unacceptable.</para><para>However, this amendment is not seeking to re-run the whole debate about the two-year waiting period. The Democrats are still opposed to it but we accept that the government is committed to that, and that is their choice. What we are really getting at today is specifically removing that solely for special benefit, which is the payment of last resort. It has traditionally been the very bottom safety net of our social security system available to people who are in desperate need of income support, are not eligible for any other form of social security benefit and have no other alternative means of support.</para><para>Since last March, apart from some exemptions, such as family members of refugees and citizens, special benefit can only be paid to a migrant within two years of their arrival if they prove they have suffered a substantial change of circumstances beyond their control. That is the wording from the legislation. The government argues that that provides sufficient discretion for the department to provide special  benefits for newly arrived residents who are in need. I think that was the argument they used that convinced enough of the Senate to support the measure last year. The reason why we need to re-visit this particular 
 aspect of it now is because of the evidence that is now coming through that that is not sufficient to meet all the circumstances that people are finding themselves in.</para><para>That exemption has been interpreted in a manner that still leaves a number of newly arrived residents whose funds have run out being denied special benefit despite being completely destitute. These people are then confronted with additional problems because, being ineligible for a social security payment, they are also ineligible for other assistance such as access to labour market programs and concessions that may assist them in becoming a more productive member of Australian society. Even worse, because they are unable to support themselves and their families, many new migrants are also effectively barred from participating in migrant English program courses, which again would assist them in more adequately being able to be productive members of Australian society. So it is really a catch-22 situation for these people. They are finding themselves with no way out. Many of them came to Australia with very high expectations. Many of these people are skilled migrants who have a lot to contribute to Australian society in economic terms as well as socially and culturally.</para><para>Is it really any wonder that a recent study by the Ethnic Communities Council, which was done in conjunction with the University of Sydney, showed that 46 per cent—nearly half—of recently arrived migrants now wish they had never come to Australia? The government may say, `That is good. That shows that we are giving the message that we are not giving migrants an easy ride.' I think that is an unfortunate interpretation. To think that half of the newly arrived migrants in this country are now wishing they were not here does not give a very hopeful sign for the future in terms of how those people are going to feel and the many more who are going to follow them who may feel likewise. How are they likely to feel in terms of how connected they feel with the broader social fabric in Australia?</para><para>I think it is important to emphasise that the government has been looking very closely at ensuring that the amount and quality of 
 information they give to people who are considering coming to Australia is as accurate as possible. Through the immigration department they are continually searching to improve the service in that regard to ensure that people are fully informed about not only the existence of this two-year waiting period but also their prospects of getting jobs when they get here, what the cost of living is and whether their qualifications are likely to be recognised.</para><para>I accept the government's efforts in that regard. I think it is important to recognise that no matter how good that becomes you will never be able to make sure that everybody knows everything they need to know in all aspects before they come here. The Democrats believe that to simply say to those people who get here and run into trouble, as people often do, that that is just their bad luck is totally unacceptable.</para><para>Once many of these migrants do arrive in Australia they are finding the reality much different from what they had envisaged. That is always going to be the case with some people. Many find it difficult to get a job. We have heard a lot during the course of this legislation about unemployment and the difficulties of young people who have lived here all their lives getting a job. Many young migrants included amongst those obviously have even higher hurdles they have to try to get over to get employment. That is particularly the case for those who come from non-English speaking backgrounds.</para><para>I imagine many senators have been getting letters from some of the community organisations that are dealing with this problem out in the field. It is important to emphasise the burden that that is putting on them—not just the financial burden on their resources but also the time involved and the emotional burden on those workers. These are groups like the Welfare Rights Centre, the Council of Social Services groups, a number of other groups and the migrant resource centres that are working at the grassroots level. I have had letters from the Fairfield youth workers network and the non-English speaking background youth issues network specifically addressing the impact of this measure on 
 young people. That is partly why I think it is particularly relevant that we are dealing with this matter as part of the youth allowance legislation.</para><para>There is any number of case studies those organisations have provided of the situation that people are finding themselves in which are enough to demonstrate that there are people in total and absolute need through no fault of their own. Maybe they did not get the correct information; maybe they were just naive about how well they thought they would go when they got here. From the Democrats' point of view, that really does not matter and it is not the role of departments or government or society to judge people on that matter. The bottom line is that people are being left with no means of support whatsoever and no opportunity for getting it; they are totally destitute in situations of extreme need, putting massive burdens on emergency relief operations—the Salvation Army and related services like that—which are not set up to deal with those sorts of situations over a long-term basis. I believe, and the Democrats believe, that that is totally unacceptable.</para><para>I do not believe that the government intended or envisaged that that situation would necessarily occur or that the government is so harsh. I recognise they want to send a strong message out with the two-year waiting period. I have already indicated that the Democrats do not agree with that, but I do not believe the government is so harsh that they want to have a situation which now exists through the existing legislation with such harsh consequences being visited on people through no fault of their own. For that reason, the Democrats are presenting the government and all of the Senate with the opportunity to reconsider this matter solely in relation to the special benefit and address the real need that is being demonstrated out in the community.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>917</page.no><name role="metadata">Newman, Sen Jocelyn</name><name role="display">Senator NEWMAN</name><name.id>BE4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Social Security</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I have listened very carefully to Senator Bartlett. I do not want to engage in a re-run of the previous debate we had on this in previous times. As a former social security staff member, he would well understand what good review and appeal processes are available to 
 people. They are working, Senator. The recent AAT cases have shown that people can demonstrate that they fit within the guidelines for special benefit, and decisions can be overturned. That is an indication that that review and appeal process does work and is working for people in these circumstances. No doubt we will see some more. It is important to recognise and acknowledge that.</para></talk.start><para>Another sign that the system is working is that there are currently over 300 migrants receiving special benefit—in fact, it is about 340 at the moment. That is growing month by month, as you would expect. So we are recognising that there are cases that fit within the criteria for the special benefit and that they are receiving it. I do not make any apology for the wording of the current law. It is not something I really want to talk about now because of time constraints.</para><para>If, through circumstances beyond their control, people come to this country and find that they cannot support themselves—for example, because their sponsor has died or because the job that they have been contracted to come to has gone—then special benefits step in. But we do not believe that Australians expect new migrants to come here and walk straight on to welfare without sponsors being prepared to honour their commitments. In the case of independent migrants, they should either prearrange a job for themselves or bring sufficient money with them to support themselves. If there was no particular test for migrants wanting special benefits, as we said in the previous debate, it would simply be a backdoor method to actually accessing support from the taxpayer. It would be circumventing the migrant waiting period altogether.</para><para>I do appreciate, Senator, that you are well meaning in your motives in proposing it, but I think it would send all the wrong signals to people. We have been trying to say, `You come here; you are welcome; we welcome your contribution to our country, but you are expected to make proper provision for yourself in those first two years.'</para><para>I do not know that there is anything additional I should put on the table except that the amendment has been costed by my department for 1998-99 at $13.3 million and for 
 1999-2000 at $19.5 million. It is interesting here that ACOSS claims that it would be a cost of some $30 million. One of the reasons they are wrong is that they are accessing special benefit now, as I just demonstrated.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>918</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Thank you for that response, Minister. I would just like to raise a couple of points out of it. I recognise and agree with your comments about the appeal and review processes that are available through the social security system and the appeals tribunal. I could sidetrack here about the proposed changes to tribunals and whether that is the way to go given how effective the Social Security Appeals Tribunal currently is, but I will leave that one for another time.</para></talk.start><para>I think there are two issues here. One is the extra difficulty that newly arrived migrants in particular would have in being aware of all their rights in that regard. It is a constant battle, as you know, for the department to ensure that people in the general community are aware of all the avenues open to them, and newly arrived residents in particular are less likely to be aware of all their rights. I do not believe it is satisfactory to expect people—particularly people who are in desperate situations, who are new to the country and who often have language difficulties et cetera—to have to battle their way up through all the levels of the appeal system just to get enough to eat. That is not satisfactory.</para><para>I also think the way the department appears to be interpreting `a substantial change of circumstances beyond their control' is operating in a way where it is being interpreted very tightly, so the fact is that people have run out of money. We are not talking about people who are ignoring assistance from their sponsor or whatever. We are talking about people who have explored all of those avenues, or those avenues have dried up and they now have no other alternative.</para><para>We are looking at the situation where they have no alternative means of support at all. That is a situation which applies with the special benefit in any case, and that has always been the case. This extra hurdle is something that newly arrived residents and nobody else have to jump—they have to show 
 that the circumstances of absolute need that they are in have arisen due to things beyond their control. The provision is being interpreted, it appears to me, as something that they could not have envisaged. The problem seems to be that the department is saying to people, `You have run out of money but you should have been able to see that was going to happen because you could not have expected to get a job or you could not have expected to have survived with the amount of money that you have.'</para><para>Maybe these people have made a misjudgment. I am loathe to make this look like it is all a matter of foolish migrants who have not thought through what they were going to do before they came here, because I do not think that is the case in a lot of circumstances. But, even in the circumstances where that is the case, I do not believe it is appropriate that people who are in those circumstances and have no means of support whatsoever should basically be told, `Tough luck. You should have stayed at home.'</para><para>That is the message here and I believe most Australians, whether or not they support the overall principle of the two-year waiting period for migrants, would accept the reality of the situation that some people are being put in where they have no alternative means of support, whether through their own misjudgment or through being given this information or whatever, and are basically left to starve. I do not believe the average Australian would support that situation, so I would ask the minister to reconsider that.</para><para>I have a couple of specific questions to try and focus some of the issues here, and I do not want to prolong the debate too much. Firstly, in regard to the cost figures that the minister gave of about $13.3 million and $19.5 million a year, what are the actual numbers of people that they represent? Hopefully that is not a secret. As for the other question, I ask: in relation to the recent appeals tribunal rulings that have received a lot of publicity, is the department likely to reconsider its directive to the regional offices about its interpretation of the clause `a substantial change of circumstances beyond their control'. As part of the wash-up of reviewing 
 that decision, is the department likely to change its interpretation of that clause in any way?</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>919</page.no><name role="metadata">Neal, Sen Belinda</name><name role="display">Senator NEAL</name><name.id>B36</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I wish to harken back to that point you made earlier, Senator Bartlett.

I well recall the discussions that have been held in this chamber over the last few years. I have pages and pages of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>  in which there have been questions asked of the minister and expressions of concern made by various honourable senators and myself.</para></talk.start><para>I am personally distressed that the situation has arisen whereby people are in a situation of absolute destitution. Many are not picked up and even those who are picked up very often do not have their situation catered for by any sort of safety net. I say that personally, but I know that there is also a considerable amount of concern amongst agencies such as St Vincent de Paul, Anglicare and City Mission—organisations which are more at the coalface than we are. We do, in the course of our duties, run across very difficult situations and people in great poverty.</para><para>I do not want to remind honourable senators of the reading about the rich man Dives and Lazarus but we do have a considerable responsibility to address this issue and address it urgently. I understand the point of view of the chamber at the present moment. It appears that the feeling is that maybe  this is not the 
 place to do it but I commend Senator Bartlett for raising it here. I feel so strongly about it at this time that I would like to support him in this measure.</para><para>I was given certain indications, if that is the word—rather than undertakings—that there would be a satisfactory safety net in the form of a special allowance for those migrants whose circumstances change significantly for reasons beyond their personal control after their arrival in Australia. I would like to know from the minister why that is being interpreted so narrowly. Those are the issues. We really do need to have some indication from the government that the tragic circumstances of quite a number of newly arrived migrants—I cannot put a figure on it—will be alleviated. I remember that the government did have regard to a number of things that I raised, including the parenting allowance, the maternity payments and so on. Clearly they do alleviate the problems that are being experienced and about which other senators have made some comment.</para><para>It has been made perfectly clear to the chamber that, without the social security payment, unemployed migrants are not entitled to access government labour market programs, transport concessions, which are rather important, particularly when looking for jobs in the larger cities, public housing, rent assistance and so on. The impact of all of this in malnutrition and the declining health of some of those migrants is there to be seen. No doubt the minister has received representations from a number of organisations. I thought that one of those organisations, the Council for Social Services in New South Wales, did present a very thoughtful and well-constructed letter which pointed out the problems. It was that letter of 9 March 1998. No doubt other honourable senators and the minister have received a copy of that letter. The minister may wish to comment on the matters that have been raised with her by a number of groups and also now in the chamber.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>920</page.no><name role="metadata">Newman, Sen Jocelyn</name><name role="display">Senator NEWMAN</name><name.id>BE4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Social Security</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—As I said to Senator Bartlett, the review system is working. We are seeing the AAT cases which 
 have found in favour of the migrants. That is a pretty good example that it still works in this area and that if we make a decision that is found to be outside the guidelines then the review process works. Senator, we are also reviewing the operation of the guidelines continuously. As I said to you, something like 340 people were receiving this special benefit as at January; it has been increasing month by month. You might be interested to note that the rejection rate in the last three months has been trending down. In November last year, for example, 39 people were rejected; in December, 28 were rejected; and in January, 22 were rejected.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>6H4</name.id><name role="metadata">HARRADINE</name><name role="display">Senator Harradine</name></talker><para>—Out of how many?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>BE4</name.id><name role="metadata">Newman, Sen Jocelyn</name><name role="display">Senator NEWMAN</name></talker><para>—I think it was out of total claims of 173. Those figures could be due to a couple of things. There could be fewer people coming who were not adequately advised at the beginning or who did not take in the advice they got. It could be that the initial operation of the guidelines has settled down and there is greater consistency across the Centrelink system. I cannot say, Senator. Given the concerns that you have, that trend over those three months has to be more reassuring. Rejection numbers are reducing. At the same time we have a substantial number of people on the benefit and those that have been unsuccessful in getting the benefit—three cases, to my knowledge—have come through to the AAT and been successful. Other people could have been successful at earlier levels either in the authorised review officer process or in the Social Security Appeals Tribunal process. I do not have that information here with me but that system is certainly still continuing and available to migrants, many of whom had some help from the Welfare Rights Centre.</para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>920</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I looked at those figures that the minister just gave us—39, 28 and 22. Even if that was averaged at, say, 30 a month, that looks like it is over 300 a year. The minister mentioned that there were 340 migrants receiving special benefits, and it could be extrapolated that around half were being knocked back, that is, half of the people who actually know that they can have an 
 appeal. We know that the government has been very mean-spirited. Worse than that, I believe it has denied basic human rights of many newly arrived migrants and people seeking to be migrants in terms of access to legal advice. We know that court costs have increased, we know that costs of justice have increased and we know that to do anything in the system when you do not know that you have rights is almost impossible. I really think that these figures of 340 migrants and growing could indicate a growing problem that is perhaps massively more than the figures actually portray.</para></talk.start><para>I think the signal this government basically is giving is that it is all right to come to Australia if you are rich. If you have got resources behind you, a big fat bank balance or some rich relatives, that is just fine. But, if you are an ordinary person who has come to Australia for a variety of reasons and have been accepted on the normal basis—and that is fairly restrictive these days—you are going to have a really hard time from this government if you are not rich or if you are not immediately able to access jobs. We know it is going to be really difficult if you do not have access to language classes and other support and employment services. So it is all stacked against you from this government's point of view.</para><para>I believe the reason is that it is really very useful to have a group of people or several groups of people that you can blame for the current economical woes. The government does not actually come out and say that, but that is exactly the effect that it has. If you target migrants, refugees, unemployed and Aboriginal people, you have a way of directing the anger of people of Australia who have had such a hard time over the past few years because of the current economic situation—not just about their levels of income but what is happening with the things they can buy and the things they cannot buy, and what is happening with their own job security—towards those people who are not in a position to fight back. That is called scapegoat politics. This is, unfortunately, what we see, and what the Greens (WA) and the Democrats are trying to do here is to redress some of the 
 worst aspects of scapegoat politics. We know that this six-month waiting period was started by the previous government, but that is no excuse. Senator Harradine, the Democrats and the Greens were on all of those occasions standing up strongly against that level of cheap politics, scapegoat politics, which was intended basically to direct attention from the economic and social outcomes of government policies towards those people who cannot easily fight back.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>921</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Briefly, I put in a plea to the government to support the not unreasonable amendment that has been moved by Senator Bartlett. I thank the minister and the government for accepting one of my earlier amendments in relation to the waiting period for newly arrived residents, particularly in relation to what we consider the retrospective aspects of that provision as it relates to the common youth allowance. This amendment relates to special benefits. Senator Bartlett has outlined, as have other honourable senators, many good reasons for the government accepting this, but I think that when we are talking about special benefits those arguments apply even more so.</para></talk.start><para>The Democrat opposition to the two-year waiting period has been put on the record squarely and many times. At the time we expressed our concern at the original inclusion of benefits from disability wage and carer's pension through to the common youth allowance and, of course, parenting, maternity and special benefits. Senator Harradine is right in saying that some of those concerns were taken on board by the government when the issue was re-debated, and it was a number of times. But special benefits are the payment of last resort for those people in the most anxious and dire straits, and we know that people are in dire straits.</para><para>As Senator Harradine pointed out to the chamber, we are all receiving correspondence from various community and advocacy groups, in particular the Welfare Rights Centre, who have described cases of individuals and families who are really unable to get shelter, to feed themselves properly and to 
 attend AMEP classes. This is a reality. I share Senator Bartlett's hope that the government is not so harsh that it will reject this amendment, because it is in relation to those really special cases. I thank the government again for taking on board one of my amendments, though not quite our ambit claim amendment in relation to the two-year waiting period, and I hope that they will extend that logic and that concern to accepting Senator Bartlett's amendment before us.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>922</page.no><name role="metadata">Neal, Sen Belinda</name><name role="display">Senator NEAL</name><name.id>B36</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—You may recall that we had this debate earlier about the extension of benefits generally during that two-year waiting period for immigrants. Clearly the opposition have made a decision in that regard. Special benefits are in a special category in that special benefit is a payment of last resort, it is not an entitlement. Whatever other requirements must be satisfied, it is essentially discretionary. It is a payment where all else fails. I suppose there is a general feeling in the community that it should not be the Australian taxpayer who supports people who decide to emigrate to Australia and intentionally come here knowing that they have no support and believing that they are unlikely to be able to obtain support for themselves while they are here.</para></talk.start><para>What is less clear and what is of concern to the Labor opposition is whether it is acceptable that, if people who do not immigrate with that intention but rather with the intention of supporting themselves by being employed or who have sufficient assets to look after themselves until they are employed find themselves in circumstances where they cannot support themselves or their families, we should wash our hands of them as a community and say, `We will do nothing. We will allow you to remain without any support at all.'</para><para>At the moment there is some provision that says that if circumstances have changed you can, at the discretion of the secretary to the department, have access to that special benefit, even if you are an immigrant or an immigrant family, within that two-year period. It appears that that definition of changed circumstances has been expanded somewhat 
 by interpretations of the AAT. If you check with your adviser you will find that is the case, Minister. The question that we need to determine here today is whether the provisions for special benefits that already exist are a sufficient safety net for immigrants who do come here and who do, in most circumstances, come here in very good faith.</para><para>Minister, you have said there have been a number of applications and in the last six months there have been some refusals. I would be interested to know if you have any information about the basis of those refusals and whether there were a large number of refusals on the basis that their circumstances had not changed. I would also be interested to know—as all sensible people making these sorts of decisions would like to know—the cost involved in the extension of special benefits. Really, what we are saying is that the change of circumstances provision is no longer required. Maybe the minister could provide us with that information.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>922</page.no><name role="metadata">Newman, Sen Jocelyn</name><name role="display">Senator NEWMAN</name><name.id>BE4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Social Security</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In response to Senator Neal, I understand that the rejections of people have been, I think almost entirely but certainly mostly, because there has been no evidence of a change in circumstances beyond their control, which is the basic criterion. Essentially people have come here without adequate means to support themselves.</para></talk.start><para>I do not know how the family category can possibly cause a problem for people coming here because they are coming with a sponsor. If the sponsor dies or goes bankrupt, those are considered to be circumstances beyond their control and they are eligible for the special benefit. It tends to be more of a problem for people in the skilled migrant class, some of whom are coming regardless of the fact that, on any reasonable understanding—and they are given information about the cost of living and also the employment circumstances in Australia—they come with a totally unrealistic idea of how they could keep themselves for more than a week or two. Some people are coming hell or high water, as I understand it from some of the cases that I have been 
 reading about. Does that answer what you were getting at?</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>B36</name.id><name role="metadata">NEAL</name><name role="display">Senator Neal</name></talker><para>—Yes.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>923</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I did ask a question of the minister to which I have not yet got a response, although I can understand that, given that she has had people throwing all sorts of requests and questions at her over the last half an hour or so. The question I asked was about the number of claims represented by the $13.3 million and the $19.5 million annual costs that she provided earlier. Perhaps this is part of what the minister was just saying in terms of this probably not relating much to the family reunion and being more to do with skilled migrants coming here without adequate means of support or adequate funds.</para></talk.start><para>I understand that recently the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Mr Ruddock, indicated finetuning of the skilled migrant program to put a higher requirement on the amount of funds people would need to have before they could come to Australia. One question I would ask is whether the minister can confirm that that is the case, without going down another sidetrack about the appropriateness of the direction of the immigration policy of the government. That is another issue we could talk about, but I will refrain. I would also ask the minister whether, assuming that my understanding is correct, those likely changes coming into effect would possibly reduce the cost of the measure that the Democrats are proposing here today.</para><para>Again, it comes down to a basic situation of people who have arrived legally in this country and whom we have welcomed here. It is not a matter of people migrating here and walking straight down to the dole office; it is a matter of people who migrate here and find themselves, for whatever reason, without any means of support. That is what the special benefit is about. It is a discretionary payment. It is about helping people who do not have a sufficient livelihood and who have no alternative means of support. The basic principle here is that we have people who are legal Australian residents and to whom we have said, `Yes, come to our country.' Using 
 phrases to describe people being determined to come here `hell or high water' I think gives a bit of a strange signal about people we are legally allowing into the country. If we do not want them to come in then we should not let them in. Again, that is another debate on immigration policy about which there would different views.</para><para>If we are going to allow people in through all of the appropriate processes and expect them to, and indeed insist that they, contribute as much as they can to Australian society and our economy, if they find themselves with no means of support whatsoever—no options, total destitution—then surely it is a fundamental principle in those circumstances that those people have the same right to the last resort safety net as anybody who was born here or who is a legal resident of this country. It astonishes me that such a discriminatory principle can be defended in a situation that does not apply to a large number of people. It applies to people who have fallen through all of the nets available and who are in dire straits.</para><para>We need to recognise that, if we are going to allow these people into the country, we have a duty as a civilised society to assist them. It gets back to what appears to be too tight a definition or interpretation of the legislative provision about requiring a `substantial change in circumstances beyond their control', and that hurdle having to be put on new migrants and nobody else. One of the examples among many—and there are any number of case studies that have been provided by organisations that have had to deal with this situation—which perhaps highlights more than most the way the application of that provision is too tight is the example of a man who came here as a skilled migrant—an engineer—from Bangladesh. His qualifications and employment background had been closely scrutinised by the Australian authorities before he came here. He did not bring a large amount of money with him, which was obviously a bad idea, but that was all he had left of his savings after all the costs of migrating.</para><para>He was not able to find work quickly, did not have adequate funds, et cetera, and ap 
 plied for a special benefit. He did not succeed initially. It went to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal, and this is one case where the appeals tribunal worked in an applicant's favour and paid a special benefit. The minister may say that that again proves that the system is working but, according to the Welfare Rights Centre who assisted this client at the tribunal, the reason why he won his appeal on the grounds of changed circumstance was because he had become so destitute that he was suffering from malnutrition and depression. That was determined by the tribunal to be the circumstances beyond his control—that it was unreasonable for him to have perceived that he would get here and become malnourished. If we are getting into a situation where people have to become malnourished simply to be able to qualify for assistance then, surely, that is a situation that is totally unacceptable. I would urge the minister to look at that sort of situation and recognise that, because of the way this legislation is being interpreted, it is not catching everybody and also recognise that, as a civilised country, we have a duty to that small number of people—and I hope we eventually get those numbers—who are in situations where they have no opportunity at all to support themselves.</para><para>It is probably worth bringing to the attention of the Senate and the minister some of the case studies—and, as I said, there are a number available, and I will not go through all of them—that the Welfare Rights Centre has provided not only of the people who have gone through the Welfare Rights Centre but also those which they have provided on behalf of a wide range of organisations, mainly in the Sydney and New South Wales region. We have heard from the Migrant Resource Centres of Illawarra and Newcastle and different parts of New South Wales, the Ethnic Community Councils, the Canterbury Bankstown Migrant Resource Centre, et cetera. Some of the case studies that have been provided relate specifically to people who were sponsored migrants and then found themselves in situations where they were not able to be adequately supported.</para><para>One case study that was provided was of a woman who was sponsored by her sister for 
 permanent residence and, upon her arrival, it then became apparent that she had basically been brought here by her sister to work as an unpaid housekeeper and to care for the mother who was suffering from dementia. It became a fairly abusive situation which involved being subjected to domestic violence, et cetera. According to that case study, that client claimed a special benefit but was refused and there was no investigation into the domestic situation. That is another situation where the department's processes fell down somewhat, but those sorts of things are going to happen.</para><para>As I mentioned before, in terms of the attempts of the immigration department to be as efficient and as clear as possible, I am sure they do try as hard as possible and I know that Social Security tries as hard as possible, but you are never going to get it perfectly right. You are going to get people who are in desperate situations coming in to apply and the officer at the counter will tell them, `Look, you came here less than two years ago. You're not eligible. Don't bother applying,' rather than saying to them, Well, put it in, we'll test it out and we'll see.' That sort of situation can happen and, in those circumstances, the person is not going to appeal because they have not applied and are not aware of the opportunity to test their case. Quite reasonably, if they go to a government department and the person who represents the department at the counter tells them that they are not eligible, they will take that on good faith and go away.</para><para>Those sorts of situations can happen and they are hard to track officially because they are not ones that enter the system. It is only when they come to the attention of specific community organisations that they can actually be measured and addressed, and I think it is important to emphasise that point. Apart from all those who are coming to the attention of these groups, how many others are there who are perhaps going into the underworld or illegal activities out of a need to support themselves? They will not be picked up by these other organisations and they will not be contributing in a positive way to Australia if they have to get into illegal or exploitative 
 situations to be able to survive. Again, I ask the minister for the figures about the number of cases.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>925</page.no><name role="metadata">Newman, Sen Jocelyn</name><name role="display">Senator NEWMAN</name><name.id>BE4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Social Security</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The answer to Senator Bartlett is that the number of cases is 1,100 and 1,800.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>925</page.no><name role="metadata">Neal, Sen Belinda</name><name role="display">Senator NEAL</name><name.id>B36</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Minister, I am not quite sure what you said then.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>BE4</name.id><name role="metadata">NEWMAN</name><name role="display">Senator Newman</name></talker><para>—There were two figures: 1,100 and 1,800.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>B36</name.id><name role="metadata">Neal, Sen Belinda</name><name role="display">Senator NEAL</name></talker><para>—Were they the number of applications?</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>BE4</name.id><name role="metadata">NEWMAN</name><name role="display">Senator Newman</name></talker><para>—They were the number of cases that were underpinning the dollar numbers that I gave you some time ago—$13.3 million and $19.5 million.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>B36</name.id><name role="metadata">Neal, Sen Belinda</name><name role="display">Senator NEAL</name></talker><para>—Is that on an annual basis?</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>BE4</name.id><name role="metadata">NEWMAN</name><name role="display">Senator Newman</name></talker><para>—For 1998-99 it was $13.3 million; for 1999-2000 it was $19.5 million.

We have increased that since we came into government. As I recall, in the first year of government we worked with the agencies to improve the formula on which that funding is based.

I am also aware of the AAT decisions and their significance.</para><para>But what I believe we all need is more information, more detailed information, which is not readily available to us. I would like to see, for example, an opportunity for these organisations—welfare organisations and other organisations—and individuals to come before a committee to give that committee the evidence and information upon which we can make a valid decision, together with the information that we will receive from the various departments—Immigration, Foreign Affairs and the Department of Social Security.</para><para>I do not know whether the committee would consider this possibility. Obviously, we cannot adjourn this requested amendment because that would hold up the legislation, and I do not think it is in anybody's interests to do that. I just wonder whether Senator Bartlett might consider withdrawing the request at this stage—and he has other options, of course—and that would be on the basis there is an understanding around the chamber that the issue will be referred to a committee for a short hearing enabling this matter to come back to us in time to deal with it in some legislation.</para><para>I personally would like to see it dealt with in the consequential legislation that comes back.

I do not want to delay the debate any further on this, but I do think the bottom line is, as Senator Harradine himself said in his most recent contribution: we do know that there are people in desperate need in the community now. For that reason, I believe that this is an urgent matter that needs to be addressed now. It is not one that is going to go away. Regardless of whether this request goes down, as it may well—and I recognise that the government is not disposed to accept it—or returns to the lower House, I think it is important to at least signal the strength of concern about the situation as it stands now.</para><para>As I have said, this matter is not going to go away anyway. Hopefully, there will be an opportunity—whether through the budget and other measures bill, another social security bill or a specific reference—for this situation to be examined in a bit of detail by a Senate committee. But I think at the moment, because of the fact that there are people in need now in the community, it is incumbent on the Senate now to signal its position on this issue.</para><para>It is the view of the Democrats that it is one where we should be recognising the need that people have. It is not a situation where charities should be picking up the pieces. They are there for emergency relief; they are not there to support people for one or two years. It is those groups who are pushing the need for change because of the burden that is being placed on them, the drain on their resources, so that they cannot then utilise those resources for other members of the community who are in crisis need.</para><para>So I would like to proceed with my requested amendment.

It will go a long way to addressing the problems that schools foresee in this legislation. The effect of the Democrats' amendment is to remove the obligation of 16- and 17-year-olds who had already left school at the beginning of this year to return next year in order to be eligible for the youth allowance. So it takes that away. This effectively is a phasing in approach and removes the retrospectivity of the measure. We also welcome the government's move to defer the implementation of this bill from July this year to January 1999. The difficulties that schools would face in taking back 13,000 students—and I think that is a conservative estimate—two-thirds of the way through the school year has been recognised. I think that is much to the relief of principals, parents and teachers.</para><para>Next year, 1999, would have been a particularly difficult year. Young people who left school at the beginning of this year in year 10 or 11 and who might have been looking for work—many of them living independently—would be forced back into a school that they left 12 months earlier. This would have been an one-off situation next year and something of a nightmare for schools. As a former teacher I can tell you that students who do not want to be in school can make it very difficult for those who do. There are students who some years ago would have left school at year 10 or 11 and taken on a proper apprenticeship or gone straight into jobs—jobs which are largely non-existent these days.</para><para>As governments have wound back spending on education and adopted a return to basics approach to schooling, the sorts of alternative programs that were once available in technology, the arts, outdoor education and that kind of thing have largely disappeared too. Principals will tell you that the alienation, particularly of boys, in senior secondary school is a huge problem, in fact the biggest issue that they face. These young people do much better in the TAFE system, where they are surrounded by adults, but that is not an option for 16- and 17-year-olds whose families are on low incomes. The fact is that most of them would have to go back to the school that they left. For those who have already left and no doubt think themselves adults, to return to school uniforms, a timetable and no real change in the programs would not necessarily be a happy experience.</para><para>It goes without saying that the Democrats support the idea that young people should stay in education for as long as possible, but this bill effectively raises the school leaving age to 18 and will cost state governments—according to my calculations—an extra $52 million every year. That is what it will cost those governments to accommodate the extra 13,000 students. Of course, this will have to come out of federal assistance grants. No doubt the states are not pleased with this arrangement, especially coming on top of the EBA cut of $11.9 million this year and higher EBA cuts each year thereafter.</para><para>The federal government is tipping in $22.66 million over four years for special programs related to the return of these students. That works out to be just $435 per student. The reason I wanted to speak to this amendment, even though the government is supporting it, is that I wanted to get the minister's assurance that this money will not be reduced at all by this amendment.</para><para>The federal government will pay a $550 per capita grant on average to these students who are in schools, but the rest will have to be found by state governments. That is, of course, if they find it at all and do not expect the schools to simply do more for less. As we know, it costs around $4,500 to educate a student in a government school. However, the principals estimate that the cost to provide worthwhile programs for returning students is more like $7,500. Instead of providing $435 per student for the so-called full risks or at risk programs, the Commonwealth ought to be providing around $3,000 extra for this measure.</para><para>Another matter I wanted to raise was the fact that there is no money in the proposed budget for capital works. There will be another 13,000 students in the school system. By my calculations, if that is 30 students per classroom as it is in Victoria by and large, that is an extra 400 classrooms and there is no money here for capital works.</para><para>I have concerns about the process for distribution of this money. This $22.66 million over four years is a very small sum of money. Schools must put in bids to a state board committee which will somehow be gathered at a regional level, and that is not entirely sorted out yet. Schools will not necessarily get the funding. They will have to go through a bidding process and they may well lose. Questions arise about what happens to the schools that do not get any funding. What happens if they end up with two extra classrooms full of students? What happens if that school does not get the funding? Is it intended that the students would go elsewhere where the program was in place? How will those schools cope with that? Is it expected that students will travel to other schools? Is 
 there a special allowance for that? Apparently not.</para><para>The government says it will not give the money to schools on a simple per capita basis. That is unfortunate. Presumably, the schools cannot be trusted to manage that money. This idea of schools having to bid for the money, regardless of how many of these students they have, is fairly ridiculous, given that this kind of project does not lend itself to that competitive ethos, especially when there just simply is not enough money around. Presumably it will be a question of who writes the best, most sparkly application which will determine which school gets the money.</para><para>I have those reservations. The Democrats are pleased that the government is supporting this, but I needed to get on the record those other serious concerns that schools have about having inadequate funding for what will be very necessary programs for these students who would otherwise have left school and be looking for jobs at 16 or 17.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>930</page.no><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator CARR</name><name.id>AW5</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The opposition supports this amendment. In doing so, I draw the attention of the Senate to some concerns we have about these proposals put by the government. I emphasise that our fundamental concern is that this government is introducing a policy here without proper consideration of its practical implications for our education system in particular, and of course for families in terms of their requirement for families to meet additional expenditure, many of whom will not have the money available to fulfil that additional commitment. Our concern also is for the schools and TAFE systems of this country which we require to take on additional responsibilities without adequate resourcing.</para></talk.start><para>There may well be quite significant damaging effects to a much greater number of students and their opportunities in life as a consequence of not providing the resources necessary to adequately provide for the additional students that are being required now to rejoin the education system.</para><para>I say this because we must bear in mind the nature of the particular students we are talking about in this bill. The Department of Employ 
 ment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs and, I expect, the Department of Social Security would have by now appreciated that the students who are affected by this measure—that is, people who have been unemployed for some period of time and are being forced back into the education system—will have particular learning difficulties and social disadvantages which have a profound effect on the capacity of those people to actually do well at school.</para><para>The very fact that students were forced out of the education system is all too often a reflection on the failure of the education system to actually provide for the special needs of students, many of whom are often described as at risk—that is, in educational jargon, they are students who leave school early because of their low levels of school achievement. That is due to their low literacy levels, often because of their low numeracy levels and because they have particular learning difficulties which are the result of a range of factors, including social and physiological or economic factors which relate to the capacity of students to do well at school.</para><para>The very fact that these particular students will often come from families who have suffered family dislocation, itinerancy, violence, abuse, poverty and homelessness; have a record of truancy and may well have a record of substance abuse. These are the sorts of issues that the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs drew to the attention of the government and which this government has failed to respond to. It has failed to respond to those fundamental questions about providing the necessary resources for students, particularly those at risk of educational failure. Failure is a word that I do not like using but I think it often explains in simple terms the consequences of people not being able to achieve well educationally.</para><para>The fact is that people leave the school system as a result of a range of factors. We cannot simply say that it is because they do not want to be there. They do not want to be there because of the social, economic and often physical conditions that they have to endure. It seems to me that if the school 
 system is to be more effective, it has to be able to provide more relevant experiences for those students. That inevitably means that there are additional requirements upon school authorities, particularly teachers, which have to be met in terms of providing that service to those particular students with learning difficulties. This government has not provided the resources to back up this initiative in that regard.</para><para>The government talks about expanding educational opportunities. It says, `We will have VET in schools. We will provide $20 million out of ANTA funds and give that to the schools.' It does not explain what moneys are provided to back that up in terms of in-service training, curriculum development or the provision of resources. Equally, it says, `We have to get the industry more involved in the delivery of specific programs.' Again, it does not address the practical problems. These expressions are easy to draw attention to but they are not easy to develop programs around without the necessary funding to back them up.</para><para>This is a position that the states have identified. The states have identified their concern only too clearly. Senator Allison has given figures which show a $53 million shortfall in the states' resources—that is, an additional demand on the states to meet the requirements of the 13,000 extra places. She bases her figures on a calculation of about $4,500 per place. That is a very modest view of the cost of educational places. It is certainly not the costs that the states themselves have put to the Commonwealth with regard to various submissions through the Commonwealth-state educational forums. The Victorian government, for instance, calculated an amount of $7,000 per spot and argued that they were some $40 million short in Victoria alone as a result of this government's initiatives and requirements by this government to meet those matters.</para><para>A similar pattern emerges with the TAFE colleges. It is often the case that the schools themselves will not be able to cope with these particular students. This amendment points to the fact that they are not excluded from TAFE colleges. Here again, you will see very sub 
 stantial sums of money being withdrawn from the TAFE system by this government and demands by the states to meet additional requirements in terms of Commonwealth programs, yet no additional money has been provided by the Commonwealth to meet the requirements under their new ANTA arrangements. In fact, we have no new ANTA agreement to meet these particular initiatives that are being proposed by the government. What we do have though is the government announcement on 28 January that it will provide some $42 million. I say that that is $100 million short on what has been proposed by the Department of Employment, Education, Training Youth Affairs through its cabinet processes. What this government produces is $42 million or thereabouts.</para><para>One of the initiatives is for a full service school for students at risk. But in the estimates process we were not able to establish what it is that the government means by the concept of a full service school. There is no definition given and no understanding within the bureaucracy of what that term actually means. Again, it looks great on a press release. You can go around the country, put your hand on your heart and say, `We care.' But you do not actually do anything in a practical way to actually assist the people that you are obliging to enter into these particular programs.</para><para>So what you have is an initiative being taken, as I understand it—a name taken from the American education system—and applied to Australia without any understanding of the cultural conditions in this country or without the resources that go into the American education system. Americans fund their public education system at a much higher level than we do in this country. So we have a government engaging in a highly cynical device—telling people that they are concerned about their sons and daughters but not concerned enough to provide the resources necessary to ensure that they get a fair go when they are forced back into the education system itself.</para><para>The initiatives that the government has proposed and the Prime Minister announced in a hail of publicity in late January—the jobs pathway program and new apprenticeships 
 and access programs—are not moneys that go towards the schools. These are in fact moneys that are supposed to be used out of the school arena. So you cannot actually argue that the government has provided additional resources for the education system, but has provided them for a period of transition from school to work. I am not saying that that is a bad thing, but it does not address this fundamental problem.</para><para>We have the issue of the way in which these funds are being distributed. I am greatly concerned, given the run-down of the department, that there will not be the resources available through the department itself, given the way in which the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs has been gutted, to be able to administer these programs effectively and to ensure that the money actually goes to the people who need it, as distinct from being dished out on a basis of some sort of shoddy bidding process which does not guarantee that the money actually goes to the places that it is actually needed.</para><para>We still do not have within this government an understanding of where these particular students are going to be located. There is no sense, from the estimates answers I have, that the government has commitments from the states or an understanding of the particular regions other than the most broadest concept of the impact of these measures. They are not able to actually identify the school districts, the school regions, where the additional resources will need to go. They say, `That's all up to the states; we'll let someone else worry about that; and we'll let someone worry about that in the fullness of time.'</para><para>Meanwhile, this is a program that is due to come into operation from the beginning of next year. They had to put it back six months because the administrative arrangements were not in place. I say that they are still not in place. But what we have is a program being initiated by the government which has no real understanding of the social and educational consequences of its actions. As a consequence, while we support the amendment, we raise these concerns with the Senate and express our very deep frustration with the government, which seems to be so intent upon 
 undermining our educational system and undermining the opportunities of tens of thousands of Australians.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>933</page.no><name role="metadata">Newman, Sen Jocelyn</name><name role="display">Senator NEWMAN</name><name.id>BE4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Social Security</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to advise Senator Allison that, although the question she asked really relates to the portfolio of Senator Ellison, as I understand it, the $42.6 million is currently being negotiated by Senator Ellison with the states.

That letter makes clear the government's position on this issue. I have been authorised by the Attorney-General and Senator Minchin to table that letter. The government is keen to make clear to the Senate the nature of this legal advice and the reason it is entirely confident of its position, a position which has been supported at all times by experts in constitutional law. It is important, however, that legal professional privilege is respected and maintained by the Senate.</para></talk.start></continue><para>A key concern of Senator Woodley appears to be the reliance made by the clerk on some 
 obiter comments made by then Chief Justice Barwick in the 1975 High Court case, Victoria v. the Commonwealth. Senators should note that the context of these Barwick comments relate to when the three-month period for the purposes of section 57 is calculated; that is, from the time first passed by the House or as a result of the Senate's actions. In his letter, the Attorney-General sets out the government's position as follows:</para><para>I do not consider that use of the words `will not agree' in s.57 imposes any requirement that there be an opportunity for the Senate to reconsider its position on amendments disagreed to by the House. Rather, at most it indicates that the House must make clear its rejection of the Senate amendments.</para><para>In my view, the interpretation the Government gives to s.57 is supported by the wording of s.57 itself. If there were a requirement that a bill be considered twice by the Senate, one would expect to see that stated expressly in the <inline font-style="italic">Constitution</inline> . The High Court has indicated its reluctance to read words into s.57 that are not there: <inline font-style="italic">Western Australia v. Commonwealth</inline>  (1975) 134 CLR 201. I find nothing in the words `will not agree' that supports the conclusion that the disagreement must be a disagreement evidenced by a second consideration of the Senate amendments. The conclusion I have reached is, in my opinion, also consistent with the object of s.57, namely, that its mechanisms be available once there is a clear disagreement between the two Houses</para><para>There is little judicial guidance in relation to this aspect of s.57 but what little there is appears to support the Government's position—see <inline font-style="italic">Victoria v.

Barwick CJ says that it cannot be said that `there are amendments to which the House <inline font-style="italic">will</inline>  not agree until the processes which parliamentary procedure provides have been explored' (emphasis in original). A consideration of the paragraph as a whole shows that Barwick CJ was concerned with the question of the commencement of the three months period 
 for determining when the House can pass a bill a second time. He was rejecting the argument that the period could be taken to have commenced at the time of first passage of the bill by the House. His statement cannot properly be understood as requiring that a bill be returned to the Senate. Elsewhere in the passage in question, Barwick CJ refers to a requirement that the attitude of the House to the amendments must be decided and `must be made known' before the interval of three months could run. I do not read that as a requirement that the House must return the bill to the Senate.</para><para>The conclusion sought to be derived from this statement by Barwick CJ was not, in any event, supported by two other judges, as referred to above.</para><para>The Attorney-General, the first law officer of the Commonwealth, has succinctly stated the government's position.

We now have that answer, and it is yes. We have pursued this issue to highlight what we suspect is the case: that the government had not sought formal, independent legal advice on how to prepare the Native Title Amendment Bill for a double dissolution election.</para><para>We note that three ministers, Senator Minchin, Senator Vanstone and Attorney-General Daryl Williams, have avoided our questions about whether the government sought formal independent legal advice prior to setting the Wik bill aside in December last year. I acknowledge, however, that the government had legal advice, certainly from the Solicitor-General. We have no way of knowing because the government is refusing to table its legal advice. That was the precise order of the Senate. So every reasonable voter is entitled to believe that there is a doubt over the validity of any bill passed by a future joint sitting of both houses of parliament. I believe that the Liberals have made a mistake and they do not want to admit it. The main point is: what is this government hiding? Sadly, it appears that we might not know until after this country goes through the enormous disruption of a $60 million double dissolution election on race, only to have the High Court strike down the Wik bill after it is passed in a joint sitting because the government failed to do a bit of procedural housekeeping.

<inline ref="r412">NRS Levy Imposition Bill 1997</inline>  and the Telecommunications Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997. They are being debated at a non-controversial time so obviously everybody else supports them. There are some minor amendments in the package but there are two important points about the National Relay Service.</para></talk.start><para>This bill will enable non-carriers to be eligible for the provisions of the NRS. In the new competitive market that we now have with carriers and non-carriers providing telecommunications services, that is a useful and necessary development. The other point is that the funds for the provision of the National Relay Service will be paid on a quarterly basis rather than on a yearly basis. This helps carriers and non-carriers with their cash flow. At the moment about $7 million a year is provided.</para><para>The National Relay Service is an excellent service that provides people who are hearing or speech impaired with access to a standard telephone service on terms and in circumstances comparable with those that other Australians have to a standard telephone service. This bill enhances that service for those people with those impairments. In the future, with the development of more and more sophisticated value-added services and telecommunications, I have no doubt that there will be consideration given to the National Relay Service not just being provided to the standard telephone but to those other add-on services. I do not know what the cost of that would be but that will have to be debated at the time. One can imagine that, with all the new on-line, broadband and Internet services, sooner or later, and quite rightly, people will say that they should be available to those who have those impairments of hearing or speech.

There was a perception in submissions to the 
 Committee's inquiry that the Commonwealth does not intend to apply provisions of State or Territory environment law to its activities as a first option for implementation. However, the structure of the Bill ensures that the Commonwealth Environment Minister considers the application of provisions of State or Territory environment law to Commonwealth activities before considering the use of regulations under Part 4.

The staff at present providing the Parliament with its support services operate under administrative and staffing structures established by the Public Service Act 1922; however it has been decided that the parliamentary administration should have its own legislation which recognises and mandates that the primary obligation of Parlia 
 mentary Service staff is to serve the Parliament as a whole.</para><para>The bill is identical to the bill that was passed by the House on 30 October 1997. It had been introduced into the House on 23 October 1997 and was amended following the report of the then Joint Committee of Public Accounts into the Public Service Bill 1997. The Senate returned the Public Service legislation and the Parliamentary Service Bill with amendments to which the House disagreed, and the three bills were laid aside on 5 December 1997.</para><para>The Parliamentary Service Bill follows as much as possible the philosophy, content and structure of the Public Service Bill 1997, which changes significantly the structure of public service employment, with certain modifications necessary to ensure the independence of the Parliament from executive government. It establishes an employment framework which mirrors that proposed for the Australian Public Service generally and provides specifically for the reciprocal mobility of staff between the two services without loss of accrued entitlements. Arrangements will also be put in place to ensure mobility for staff currently engaged under the Members of Parliament (Staff) Act.</para><para>There are significant differences between the Parliamentary and Public Service Bills which recognise that staff in parliamentary departments serve the Houses of the Parliament. That distinction is reflected in the first object of the bill which is to establish an apolitical Parliamentary Service that is efficient and effective in serving the Parliament. The Parliamentary Service Bill contains a statement of Parliamentary Service values and a Code of Conduct, provides for the appointment of a Parliamentary Service Commissioner, makes specific reference to the offices of Clerk of the Senate and of the House of Representatives, and provides for appointments to those offices. Tenure as Clerk of either House will be for one ten-year period. The bill also stipulates conditions for earlier termination of those appointments. Occupants of the office may retire earlier once they attain the age of 55 years. Secretaries, other than Clerks, are to be appointed by the Speaker and the President for five year terms with termination arrangements similar to those applying to secretaries of executive departments. There are transitional arrangements to ensure the continuation in office of current heads of parliamentary departments.</para><para>In broad terms, the Presiding Officers will have the same employment powers as Ministers under the Public Service Bill with advice from the Parliamentary Service Commissioner. Consistent with the need to preserve the independence of the Clerks as impartial advisers, the Clerks of the House of Representatives and of the Senate are not to be subject to direction from the Presiding Officers in 
 relation to the nature of their advice provided with respect to either House, to members or senators or to committees. Secretaries of parliamentary departments, including the Clerks, cannot be directed in relation to the exercise of their powers in respect of specific individuals. The Presiding Officers will have the power to give secretaries of parliamentary departments, including the Clerks, general directions relating to the management and leadership of the Parliamentary Service.</para><para>The bill also creates the new office of Parliamentary Service Commissioner with a role similar to that of the Public Service Commissioner. The Parliamentary Service Commissioner will have the task of advising the Presiding Officers with respect to the management practices and policies of the Parliamentary Service and, if requested by the relevant Presiding Officer, of investigating and reporting on specific issues.</para><para>While the bill provides specifically that the Parliamentary Service Commissioner is to be appointed separately and independently by the Presiding Officers, it is expected that normally the same person would fill both of these offices. This would assist in ensuring overall comparability and consistency between the two services. However the bill specifically provides that the Commissioner cannot be subject to direction by executive government in relation to the Parliamentary Service.</para><para>Secretaries of parliamentary departments, including the two Clerks, are to have the same employment powers as those proposed for departmental secretaries in the Australian Public Service.</para><para>As mentioned earlier, the bill incorporates a legally enforceable Code of Conduct and a statement of Parliamentary Service Values. These values reflect the fact that staff serve the Houses but in other respects mirror those of the Public Service Bill, with a parallel reference to the requirement that employment decisions in the Parliamentary Service be based on merit.</para><para>In summary, this bill gives legislative effect to the decision that the parliamentary administration should not continue to be covered by the standard Australian Public Service Act. It establishes a statutory framework and administrative arrangements broadly consistent with those for the public service while incorporating the changes necessary to accommodate the unique circumstances of serving the Houses. It provides the Houses with a set of arrangements which will allow them to continue to attract and provide a career for those staff who will be equipped to deliver the high level of service the Houses currently enjoy.</para><para>I commend the bill to the Senate.</para><para>Ordered that further consideration of the second reading of these bills be adjourned

We have been successful in implementing two of these, but the third, the Public Service Bill was amended by the Senate.</para><para>The Government will not be deterred from completing its reform of the APS by the short-sighted obstruction of the Opposition and minor parties. The effect of this obstruction is simply to frustrate 
 the very many people in the public service who are keen to press ahead with a reform agenda in the development of which they have had an important role and which they see clearly is essential for building morale and opportunities for the future.</para><para>This is the same as the Bill that was passed by the House of Representatives on 30 October 1997. It had been introduced into the House of Representatives on 26 June 1997 and immediately referred to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts (JCPA) for consideration.</para><para>The JCPA handed down its Report on 29 September 1997. In the Report the JCPA supported the need for the 1922 Act to be replaced, and favoured the simplification, modernisation and the more accessible format of the Bill. The Committee made twenty recommendations all of which the Government accepted either in full or in part. The Opposition were, of course, well represented on the JCPA.</para><para>The legislation was also referred to the Senate Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee which reported to the Senate in early October. The Committee largely endorsed many of the JCPA report recommendations, while acknowledging the very brief period in which the Committee had to consider the report.</para><para>The Democrats, however, who did not take up representation on the JCPA, submitted a dissenting report recommending that the Bill be withdrawn and rewritten.</para><para>The Government accepted all 20 of the JCPA's recommendations. The Government accepted the recommendations, in a spirit of compromise, in the belief that all Parties, Members and Senators shared a common goal for a public service that would deliver the best value from public funds to serve the Government and the community for the 21st century.</para><para>Amendments to the Bill, in response to the JCPA recommendations, were made to:</para><para>.	 strengthen the APS Values;</para><para>.	 strengthen the references in the Bill to merit as a fundamental principle of APS employment by including a definition of merit in relation to the engagement and promotion of APS employees; and</para><para>.	 enhancing the level of scrutiny and reporting of agency workplace diversity programs.</para><para>The Government amendments were accepted without dissent by the House of Representatives.</para><para>The legislation was introduced into the Senate on 11 November where the Opposition and minor parties moved seventy-four amendments to the Bill during some 17 hours of debate on 17, 18 and 19 November 1997. 
</para><para>The Opposition amendments do not recognise the increasing need for APS agencies to be freed from central controls and to adopt employment arrangements which meet their particular needs. This Bill provides that flexibility.</para><para>The pressures for public service reforms have not slackened. The Government is determined to bring public service employment arrangements into line with community standards; to enable the public service to meet market competition and to promote a stronger performance culture. We have already introduced administrative reforms that will come into effect on 15 March 1998. Under these reforms:</para><para>.	 Departmental Secretaries will have greater authority and flexibility to effectively manage their staff;</para><para>.	 new Public Service Values and a Code of Conduct for staff will be established through new regulations;</para><para>.	 public accountability will be increased and strengthened; and</para><para>.	 protection for whistleblowers raising allegations of Code of Conduct breaches will be strengthened.</para><para>The Government will also press ahead with reforms and improvements to public service workplace relations through the Workplace Relations Act.</para><para>This is not to suggest that legislative reform is unnecessary. A new Bill is essential because there are a number of key areas in the current legislation that are not amenable to simplification by administrative action. For example,</para><para>-	 giving employment powers direct to Agency Heads;</para><para>-	 ensuring a secure Parliament-endorsed legislative</para><para>-	 framework for APS values, the new code of conduct</para><para>	 and protection of whistleblowers;</para><para>-	 removing complex appeals arrangements;</para><para>-	 removal of inflexible employment categories;</para><para>-	 removal of compulsory age 65 retirement;</para><para>Therefore, it will be impossible to build a fully coherent, reformed, management structure without legislative change.</para><para>Cultural change is also necessary. The extent to which the reforms are acknowledged as real changes and embraced by staff and middle management, will be an important determinant of the success of the reform process. The existence of a new Public Service Act will be the major contributor to the perception, among public servants, of real and significant change.</para><para>The current Public Service Act is over 75 years old and has been amended 100 times. It is complex, 
 prescriptive and out of date. The new Bill removes that prescription, is easy to understand and is only 40 pages long.</para><para>Although there will be some fundamental employment relationships that we cannot change without the new Public Service Bill, the Government will continue, in the meantime, to use the Workplace Relations Act to make a significant impact on the performance of the APS.</para><para>As the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service has stated on a number of occasions, Australia needs a public service that can:</para><para>.	 position Australia in a global environment to ensure that we are future focused and seeking out the changes that will guarantee our national future;</para><para>.	 benchmark itself against all sectors to determine what it does best, what it can improve, and what is more effectively delivered by the market;</para><para>.	 provide frank and fearless—and innovative—advice to government; and</para><para>.	 access the best service delivery skills, quality and cost, wherever they might reside.</para><para>Along with reforming workplace relations generally, and the waterfront in particular, achieving a more relevant, efficient and innovative, world class Australian Public Service is a key objective of the Government.  The Government is determined to build on the strengths of—and make even more effective—one of the key institutions supporting Australia's democratic system.</para><para>The Public Service Bill is therefore an essential part of our reform agenda.</para><para>I turn now to the terms of the Bill itself.</para><para>The Public Service Bill is a very exciting piece of legislation, aiming to put in place a framework for a high performance public service.</para><para>Alan Kohler, writing in The Age, commented last year that the Bill is:</para><para>' . . . the most uncompromising deregulation of the Public Service anywhere in the world. The bill lays down standards for ethical behaviour and impartiality, establishes the first code of conduct for public servants, sets up a process for accountability and scrutiny, and then lets departmental heads run things as if they were corporate chief executives.'</para><para>'[It] is one of the great pieces of Government employee legislation—simple, clear and powerful'. (<inline font-style="italic">The Melbourne Age</inline> , 11 July 1997)</para><para>It not only removes prescription and central control, but enhances the accountability framework which the Parliament and the community expect of the public service. It will enable the public service to meet market competition, to benchmark itself more 
 effectively against other sectors and to promote a stronger performance culture.</para><para>The Bill is all about making the Public Service more efficient and effective and delivering better service to both the Government and to the public. It gives a message about the expectations of citizens in a democratic system of governance appropriate for the twenty-first century.</para><para>What holds the APS together, what creates a unified Service, is the shared values and ethos of public service. And these are reinforced in the Bill, by setting out for the first time, the APS Values and a Code of Conduct for all public servants. This legislative framework of values, conduct and scrutiny provide, for the first time, a coherent statement of the public interest.</para><para>The community also expects that its public service will be subject to the same workplace arrangements as apply to the rest of the workforce. The Public Service Bill seeks to achieve this by giving Agency Heads the same rights, duties and powers as an ordinary employer, thus allowing employment arrangements that will meet the particular needs of each individual workplace. Accordingly, the Bill devolves employment powers from the central agencies to Agency Heads. It does not prescribe process but instead ensures that Agency Heads are held accountable for their actions.</para><para>I believe that the Bill will be welcomed by those innovative and creative public servants who are actively seeking a higher standard of performance and who are frustrated by the constraints.</para><para>For example, the 1995 Australian Workplace Industrial Relations Survey indicated that employees in the Public Service felt disempowered by the highly protected and regulated environment. While formal consultative processes were twice as likely to be in place than in the private sector, public servants did not feel able to make decisions for themselves at the workplace level.</para><para>They did not have a high level of workplace autonomy—the Survey showed that more than twice as many private sector employees recorded high levels of workplace autonomy.</para><para>Under the Public Service Act of 1922 public servants have been working under a piece of legislation more than seventy five years old. It is outdated, overly prescriptive and unnecessarily centralist. Workplace flexibility and accountability is limited. Personnel decisions are slow, paper-driven and labour-intensive.</para><para>The Government is reintroducing this Bill unchanged, not because we want an election over it, but because we believe this Bill as it stands provides the type of Public Service that the Government and the Australian Community have a right to expect. 
</para><para>I commend the Bill to the Senate.</para><para><inline ref="r450">PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT (CONSEQUENTIAL AND TRANSITIONAL) AMENDMENT BILL 1997 [No. 2]</inline></para><para>The Public Employment (Consequential and Transitional) Amendment Bill 1997 deals with the consequential and transitional matters arising from the proposed repeal of the Public Service Act 1922 and its replacement by the legislation set out in the Public Service Bill 1997.</para><para>This is the same Bill that was passed by the House of Representatives on</para><para>30 October 1997. In November 1997 the Opposition parties in the Senate passed amendments to this Bill and the Public Service Bill 1997. The Government rejects outright those amendments and is reintroducing this Bill to progress the reforms which will allow for a dynamic and flexible public service.</para><para>Both this Bill and the Public Service Bill underwent extensive scrutiny by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. I am pleased that the Committee supported the need for the present Act to be replaced and favoured the simplification, modernisation and more accessible format of the new Bill.</para><para>The Government adopted, in whole or in part, the twenty recommendations made by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. The Government also gave close consideration to the substantive comments contained in the report but which were not expressed formally as recommendations.</para><para>Despite the Government accepting the recommendations of the Committee, the Opposition and minor parties in the Senate went on to amend the Bill. The amendments did not recognise the increasing need for APS agencies to be freed from central controls and adopt employment arrangements which meet their particular needs while retaining the best characteristics of the APS: integrity; professionalism and accountability. This Bill, together with the Public Service Bill 1997, provides that flexibility.</para><para>I turn now to the terms of the Bill itself.</para><para>The Bill sets out certain transitional provisions that are necessary with the introduction of the Public Service Bill. There is a need for provision of transitional arrangements from the old to the new employment framework and a need to validate actions and decisions taken under the old legislation where that action has not been completed.</para><para>There is also a need to make consequential amendments to the extensive range of legislation which incorporates references to the Public Service Act 1922.</para><para>The transitional provisions fall into three broad areas.  
</para><para>First, it is necessary to set in place conversion arrangements for those who work in the APS. With the removal of the concept of office for APS staff and the creation of a single employment category, officers and employees covered by the existing Act are converted to employees in their corresponding agencies with their corresponding classifications. Fixed-term Secretaries to Departments under the old Act will become Secretaries of their corresponding Departments under the new Act. Similarly, the person holding office as the Public Service Commissioner under the existing Act will become the Public Service Commissioner under the new Act, as if she had been appointed under the new Act.</para><para>Second, as the Public Service Bill 1997 is primarily principles-based, there are some conditions covered by the Public Service Act 1922 that require transitional arrangements because they will no longer be regulated in the same way.</para><para>The most important of these are the arrangements governing the rights of return of staff who have left the APS to take up non-APS public employment under the complex, legislative provisions of the old Act. These staff will be able to return to the APS under the transitional arrangements and, in future, APS employees will be able to move in and out of APS employment, where it is in the interest of the APS, under a simpler model of unpaid leave.</para><para>Third, there is a need to provide for the continuation of processes already set in train. Action may have commenced under the Public Service Act 1922 or the Merit Protection (Australian Government Employees) Act 1984  that will not be completed by the time the new Public Service Act is proclaimed.</para><para>I refer to matters such as appointments, promotions, suspensions, transfers and advancements, as well as to appeals, grievances and other reviews of employment decisions. To enable action to be completed, regulations will be made to ensure the continuation of those processes after the new Act is proclaimed.</para><para>The validation of actions and decisions taken under the former legislation will be largely dealt with in regulations.</para><para>With respect to the consequential amendments, the Acts specified in Schedule 1 to this Bill will be amended or repealed as set out in that Schedule. The amendments can be divided into the following categories:</para><para>.	 changes in the current provisions relating to staffing to reflect the new employment framework;</para><para>.	 removal of obsolete references to the Public Service Board; 
</para><para>.	 consequential amendments to the superannuation legislation, but without any changes in the operation of the schemes;</para><para>.	 changes to the role of the Remuneration Tribunal in relation to the remuneration and allowances for Secretaries;</para><para>.	 removal of cross-references to reciprocal mobility which will now be dealt with by directions by the Public Service Commissioner;</para><para>.	 removal of references to the old mobility arrangements set out in Part IV of the Public Service Act 1922;</para><para>.	 standard translations for common terms in the old Act;  and</para><para>.	 other miscellaneous amendments to ensure appropriate links to the new APS employment framework.</para><para>The Bill also deals with the consequences of devolving the arrangements for setting the salaries of the Senior Executive Service (SES). The link of the remuneration of Members of Parliament with the SES Band 2 minimum salary will be replaced by a link to the classification structure created by the Remuneration Tribunal for certain statutory offices. It is not intended to increase the level of remuneration.</para><para>Subject to any special requirements in relation to particular consequential amendments, this Bill will commence on the same day as the Public Service Act 1997.</para><para>The proposed amendments have no financial impact.</para><para>Collectively the arrangements proposed in this Bill will provide the necessary certainty and continuity of administrative and management arrangements for the Australian Public Service. They will enable an orderly devolution of employment powers in the APS and a transition to a less regulated workplace.</para><para>I commend the Bill to the Senate.</para><para>Ordered that further consideration of the second reading of these bills be adjourned until the first day of the winter sittings, in accordance with standing order 111.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Sitting suspended from 1.00 p.m. to 2.00 p.m.</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS</title><type>Ministerial Arrangements</type><page.no>942</page.no></debateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>942</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Environment</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I inform the Senate that Senator John Herron, Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, will be absent from the Senate chamber for question time today.

An additional 14,800 Australians joined the work force in February. This means that we have seen employment rise by a strong 140,600 over the six months to February. Employment is continuing to grow at a solid rate and, just as important, unemployment remains on a downward trend. In fact, I believe that the unemployment rate now is lower than it has been for over seven years. What stronger endorsement could you have for an incoming government than in just two years of office, by adopting sound economic policy, they have been able to contribute to such a positive employment environment and such a significantly reducing unemployment rate.</para></talk.start><para>It does demonstrate, yet again, the extent to which this government is interested in real jobs. It is interested in job security. It is interested in attracting investments and promoting exports. It is obviously interested in contributing to a growing economy and that is why we have put such emphasis on maintaining lower interest rates and low inflation, giving incentives to support industry to grow and to employ.</para><para>No other industry has been any more important in this area than the resources sector, which is booming under this government. I take the opportunity to congratulate Senator Parer for his leadership in this critically important portfolio. Let us look at the record. More than 40 new projects have been commissioned in the past 12 months, involv 
 ing an investment of some $7 billion. More than 120 resources and energy projects are currently under construction or have been committed to. This represents a capital investment of over $20 billion and will create 7,000 direct and over 20,000 indirect permanent jobs. An excellent record. More than 160 additional projects are currently under consideration by industry, involving an estimated investment of $70 billion, with the potential to create many more thousands of new jobs. Under this government and under this minister the resources and energy sector has been a stunning success story. That is of benefit to all Australians and particularly of benefit to those who are aspiring to jobs.</para><para>Contrast that record with that of our opponents. Labor's record is one of high unemployment, high interest rates—record interest rates, in effect—and no incentive for business to grow; a miserable record to pass on to an incoming government. The contrast is so stark that it demonstrates what good policy and good ministerial leadership can really achieve.</para><para>Labor are not interested in unemployment at all. We listen to Senator Faulkner, who leads off with the dirt file every day, slurring innocent parties whether they are dead or alive. The Baillieus are one example of that. We still have not got the apology. He still has not been prepared to exhibit a touch of decency and apologise. What some might think is more important is: where does he stand on unemployment? In 85 days of sitting last year, Senator Faulkner, Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, demonstrated how important they regard unemployment by asking only three questions on unemployment.

Of course this government will concentrate on the high priority of reducing unemployment. Not only did we inherit unemployment levels that were too high but we inherited an economy in which the fundamentals were so wrong. We will get the budget into surplus within three years after inheriting a deficit of $10.3 billion. We have been prepared to take the hard decisions to keep down inflation, to reduce interest rates, and to give industry and investment a real opportunity to bring full benefit in terms of employment opportunities. There can be no better demonstration, Senator Boswell, of the determination of this government to keep on down that path. The result will be continuing reduction of unemployment and continuing employment growth, and that is good news for all Australians.</para></talk.start></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Minister for Resources and Energy</title><page.no>944</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>944</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is directed to the Minister for Resources and Energy, Senator Parer.

It is one thing to defend crane drivers, who have an hourly performance rate about 50 per cent below their major international counterparts, getting $90,000-plus per year for working about a 14 hour week—an absolute disgrace in itself—but the notion of their now turning around and going on strike, seeking a $4,500 pay rise and better superannuation simply defies belief. They are doing it because they are on a vengeance binge. This is simply a cover in order to pay back Patricks for the action they have taken to try to open up the waterfront to sensible competition. Even the Labor Party understands the need for competition on the waterfront because we saw a bunch of weasel words in their national conference document which paid lip service to the concept.</para></talk.start><para>Apart from that, there has been an absolutely deafening silence on the other side. Of course, the reason for that is clear; there is a massive conflict of interest. These people come in here and want to talk about standards and conflicts of interest. What you have confronting you on the other side of this chamber are people who, when in government, gave away millions and millions of dollars to their trade union mates. In 1994-95, $16½ million went to the trade union movement—up 300 per cent from two years earlier. Unions associated with 10 of these people 
 over here got in excess of $5 million in that same year.</para><para>It is an absolute disgrace. The MUA got $220,000. Can you imagine why they would need that sort of assistance?

You come in here and try to impugn the integrity of people like Senator Parer when you well know that not only is he doing a first-class job in his portfolio but he has very much upstanding standards of integrity that you would not even begin to comprehend. We see people like Senator Bolkus having the absolute gall to simply ignore all the proper standards of propriety and aspiring to be the Attorney-General of this country when he has no conception of what ethical standards are about and we find Senator Faulkner, nearly two weeks later, not being prepared to apologise. Who are these people to talk to us about conflicts of interest and standards? They have got nothing to say on policy issues. That is why we now have a shadow minister for muckraking leading the team on the other side. Senator Ray comes into this chamber only when there is a bit of muck around. He does not bother to take an interest otherwise. But he is there in spades when there is a bit of dirt to be thrown.</para><para>Time is running out for this mob.

So do not come in here lecturing us about these things. Get back to the things that the people of Australia want. They want real reform on the waterfront. They certainly want an apology from Senator Faulkner. They cannot comprehend how someone can have the unmitigated cheek to just sit there and smirk when he has defamed both the living and the dead.

That advice is in the following terms: the High Court has consistently held that the Commonwealth of Australia's sovereignty over Australia cannot be challenged, controlled or interfered with by the courts. However, the courts can, of course, examine the consequences of the acquisition of sovereignty. In Mabo, the High Court rejected, as Senator Margetts said, the concept of terra nullius. The acquisition of sovereignty does not depend on acceptance of the doctrine of terra nullius. The High Court confirmed in Mabo that sovereignty may be acquired over an inhabited territory just as it may be acquired over an uninhabited territory and that the acquisition of sovereignty cannot be challenged in the court.</para></talk.start><para>The High Court found that, on the acquisition of sovereignty over territory, the Crown acquired a radical title to that territory. The radical title is subject to the pre-existing native title of the indigenous inhabitants. That native title may, however, be extinguished by a legislative or executive act which is plainly inconsistent with the native title rights. Chief Justice Brennan, in the majority judgment, stated:</para><para>Sovereignty carries the power to create and extinguish private rights and interests in land within the Sovereign's territory. It follows that, on a change of sovereignty, rights and interests in land that may have been indefeasible under the old regime become liable to extinction by exercise of the new sovereign power. 
</para><para>As the Native Title Act case—Western Australia versus the Commonwealth—made clear, the Commonwealth clearly has the power to regulate native rights and interests.

There is no doubt that, in seeking to implement the court's ruling in relation to native title, there are a whole range of practical issues that need to be addressed.

In stark contrast to the standards that are not permitted here, this government will implement standards. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Minister for Resources and Energy</title><page.no>954</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>954</page.no><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name><name.id>RF4</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is directed to the Minister for Resources and Energy.

But I think it is worth examining closely these protestations of innocence from Senator Parer. Firstly, let us look at the issue of the Senate's requirements in relation to its system of disclosure of pecuniary interests. Senator Parer has failed to declare to the Registrar of Senators' Interests his directorship of Investment Management Pty Ltd, his family trust company. He has failed to declare his shareholding in that company or his family trust shareholdings.</para><para>Senator Parer claims not to be aware of the letter of 20 March 1997 from the Registrar of Senators' Interests informing all senators of the requirements to `notify actual shares held by relevant family or business trusts as of 20 March 1997'. He claims to be only in technical breach of the guidelines. But he conveniently fails to mention the fact—he ignores the fact—that he has also failed to declare his shareholding in Queensland Coal Management ESP. This was a requirement of the Senate disclosure system from the very beginning. It is not a technical breach; it is a serious breach.</para><para>Then there is the issue of compliance with the code of conduct of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). That is now an infamous and much discredited document. Surely we need to go 
 no further than the requirement on page 11 of this code, which says:</para><para>Ministers are required to divest themselves of all shares and similar interests in any company or business involved in the area of their portfolio responsibilities. The transfer of interests to a family member or to a nominee or trust is not an acceptable form of divestment.</para><para>Does Senator Parer possess shares or similar interests in any company or business involved in the area of his portfolio responsibilities? The answer to that question is yes, he does. Has Senator Parer divested himself of these shares and interests? The answer is, of course, that he has not. Is he in compliance with this much discredited prime ministerial code of conduct? No, he is not. Of course, you could look, in relation to ministerial conduct, at page 10 of the code:</para><para>The nature of their duties is such that they may need to have regard to the interests of members of their immediate families (to the extent that ministers know their interests) as well as their own when ensuring that no conflict or apparent conflict between interests and duties arises.</para><para>Again, the same problems. But what the opposition in the Senate has been asking today is: what about his compliance with the Prime Minister's requirements for a confidential declaration of interests from all his ministers?</para><para>Here we only have Senator Parer's word. Why should we accept it? He would not answer direct questions from Senator Cook which were directed to him in question time today on a range of issues in relation to disclosures he made to the Prime Minister. He insists that he fully complied with the Prime Minister's requirements. We invite him to table confidential documentation in the Senate to prove that that is the case.</para><para>The truth is that on those three grounds—the Senate requirements, the ministerial code of conduct and the Prime Minister's confidential declaration; on all three counts—Senator Parer has failed. He is a liability to the government. Our view is that there is no alternative for him but to resign or be sacked by the Prime Minister. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>955</page.no><name role="metadata">MacGibbon, Sen David</name><name role="display">Senator MacGIBBON</name><name.id>YH4</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am not going to give respectability to a perfectly scurrilous attack on the charac

Senator MacGibbon, the Prime Minister marched into the House of Representatives, puffed up, in May 1996 and said, `I'm setting a whole new standard.' He implicitly criticised the previous government, even though a lot was drawn from the cabinet handbook. We are simply asking that Senator Parer and every other minister observe those standards.</para></talk.start><para>There is no use saying that we are being scurrilous in this. The first question we raised was: why didn't Senator Parer comply with the March 1997 directive from the registrar? What is his response to that, Senator MacGibbon? `I'm guilty,' he says. We have established that. It is not a completely threadbare assault on Senator Parer. Then we asked the second question: why didn't you declare your 44 shares which were declarable long before the March 1997 directive? We did not really get an explanation as to why they were not declared. We asked him whether he declared them to the Prime Minister. Through all the fog of the answer I got the impression that he did not. Then we hear the Prime Minister over there in the other place absolutely asserting that he was notified of the 44 shares. We need to clear that up.</para><para>The one thing that is difficult for Senator MacGibbon or anyone else to argue about is the clear reference in the ministerial code of conduct to disposing of shares which directly affect your portfolio area. He did not do that. They were not easy to dispose of—we can see that. But if he had let us know that he had them and that he had difficulty in disposing of them we would have some idea that there was a potential or a perceived conflict of interest. </para><para>Senator Parer jumped on the point I made yesterday. I will repeat it for him if he wants to jump on it every time and grab it like a lifeline. I do not think Senator Parer would ever deliberately go out and enrich himself in this area by an action to favour a particular company where he has an investment. But neither will I accuse Senator Short or Senator Gibson of that. They breached the ministerial code. They went; Senator Parer does not go.</para><para>The other side gets upset when we question the basis of these financial arrangements. But he was someone, absent from a meeting in 1993—but, nevertheless, as chairman of that area later concurring—who got 16 C-class shares at $1 each which, within three years, have a minimum value, because they cannot be established at the maximum, of $2.3 million. He has to explain that to the battlers. How many battlers can go out and get given sixteen $1 shares that have a value three years later of $2.3 million? The income stream from those shares to the family investment company to the family trust in 1995 was $99,000. In 1996 the two payments into the family trust totalled $290,000. Not bad going for a battler. But the really strange thing is that Senator Parer cannot seem to remember any of this. He cannot remember the odd $99,000, the $149,000 and the $140,000 cheques coming in.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>AX5</name.id><name role="metadata">EVANS</name><name role="display">Senator Chris Evans</name></talker><para>—Small change.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>UI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator ROBERT RAY</name></talker><para>—You are right, Senator Evans.

That has sent the boat out very quickly. Is the Prime Minister the one to really judge in this particular case? At least the Prime Minister says that he relies on the judgment of his senior public servant Mr Max Moore-Wilton, the most political appointee in the history since federation.</para></talk.start></continue><para>It is so coincidental that he brings down his report on 9 May and then on 10 May at 9 o'clock in the morning the Prime Minister rings Dr Shergold and says, `I want you now to do a review of Mr Max Moore-Wilton's entitlements because the horrible senators have been raising it in the Senate committee

For goodness sake!</para></talk.start><para>Isn't it about time that we, as the elected representatives of this country, actually addressed the real issues affecting the people of Australia rather than going on with this eternal trawling about things that real people out there do not seem to be really too worried about? Real people out there must be rubbing their eyes in disbelief at what has taken the time of this chamber for the last couple of days. The real issues and the real problems do not seem to be of the remotest concern to Senator Ray, Senator Faulkner and those in the opposition.</para><para>I wonder how many people are actually lying awake at night wondering about Senator Parer's family trust. There is not one shred of evidence to suggest that Senator Parer has ever misused his office for any improper purpose or even an allegation that he has been guilty of some actual conflict of interest. Not only is this a grubby exercise; it shows the utter lack of appreciation by those on the 
 other side of how a trust actually works. We do not really know whether whoever is feeding all this stuff to the opposition has ever really looked at the memorandum and articles of association of this company. Senator Ray seems to be aware that we are looking at C class shares, which invariably have restrictions, and, of course, Senator Parer has said until he is practically blue in the face that the trust has 16 non-voting shares. We almost need to put the words to a song here—`16 non-voting shares'—but the message does not seem to be getting through.</para><para>It is very difficult to value shares, and certainly we question the sorts of values of non-voting shares that have been tossed around here at random as Senator Ray sought to do when he took note. These are not publicly listed shares. They are certainly not easily divested. They are very difficult to market. I think Senator Cook said all you have to do is consent to sell the shares in Queensland Coal Mine Management Pty Ltd. That's a laugh! If it were that easy to get rid of non-voting shares, I am sure a lot of people would do so with alacrity. </para><para>The truth of the matter is that you do not have much control over non-voting shares, and certainly very few people want to buy them if they cannot exercise any vote in relation to their interest. So the matter of whether or not there is a market for non-voting shares is critical in this case, and it is certainly one that ought to excuse Senator Parer from having to adopt the sort of wild values that have been tossed around in this chamber.</para><para>Quite apart from the fact that there has been no conflict of interest at all, there is further evidence—and I cannot believe that those on the other side of the chamber would not accept Senator Parer on this—that he has obtained no personal benefit from his ministerial responsibilities. That is really the critical issue. There is absolutely nothing to suggest that he has ever had any personal benefit from his office. Senator Parer has not breached the ministerial guidelines and the worst that can be said is that there is some technical breach of the Senate explanatory note. Are you really going to seek to hang 
 Senator Parer for this? As I said when I started my speech, let us get a bit of reality into this debate. It is time that this is played out. I say to honourable senators on the other side, give it a rest.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>958</page.no><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name><name.id>RF4</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—That was an amazing speech; I don't know that it would hold up anywhere but in this chamber. This question is about probity in public office and, most of all, it is about the integrity of the Prime Minister. It is about that because the Prime Minister himself declared to the Australian electorate before the election that he would bring new standards, and after the election he did. Although they embodied most of the ministerial handbook, he declared what those standards are and they are on the public record. The particular standard under debate here is:</para></talk.start><para>Ministers are required to divest themselves of all shares and similar interests in any company or business involved in the area of their portfolio responsibilities.</para><para>The transfer of interests to a family member or to a nominee or trust is not an acceptable form of divestment.</para><para>That is the Prime Minister's own standard. We have just heard that that is fine as long as you can't say that the person has benefited from them in his own right. That is a preposterous notion. It says, in the Prime Minister's own standards, that there cannot be any `apparent conflict' between the exercise of public duty and that of the private potential gain of the individual minister.</para><para>It is not just a matter here of whether there was an actual conflict; it is also a matter of whether there is a potential conflict and it is also a matter of whether there is an appearance of conflict. This is the well trodden area of law that justice has to be done and justice has to be seen to be done. Both precepts have to be met. Let us compare this case with what happened to Senator Short. On 14 October 1996 the Prime Minister said, in the case of Senator Short after he had resigned, that there was `an apparent conflict of interest'. Those are the words of the Prime Minister in the case of Senator Short.</para><para>Where are those words now? Does the Prime Minister uphold his own standards? He has been silent on this. He will not answer that question. He needs to set his consistency on the line. He either upholds the standards he has imposed or he does not. And if he does not he is a hypocrite and he never intended those standards to be upheld anyway. It was simply a way of gulling the Australian electorate.</para><para>Short said at the time that he had made a `careless and distressing oversight'. He confessed to an apparent conflict of interest. We have here a similar confession to an apparent conflict of interest by the Minister for Resources and Energy (Senator Parer), who has said, in a quaint way of putting it, `I made a technical mistake.' There is no provision for technical; you either made one or you didn't and a confession of a mistake is a confession of a mistake. He also went on to say that he did not read the letter that alerted him to what his public duty was. Since when was that a defence? Try standing up in a court and saying that you did not know what the law was and therefore you are innocent. That is exactly what is being said here. Why should that standard apply to ordinary Australians and not to a minister of the Crown? Why can a minister of the Crown say, `I didn't know; therefore I am innocent,' but an ordinary Australian say, `I didn't know what the law was,' and be convicted? That is a direct comparison of their hypocrisy on this matter.</para><para>There is a series of comparisons I would like to make—and I know that I will not have time to complete the list—between Senator Short's conduct and the conduct we are now witnessing from Senator Parer. Senator Short confessed to owning 6,679 ANZ shares, through the Short family trust, worth approximately $64,000 at the time of his resignation. Senator Parer owns just over one per cent of the issued capital in QCMM Pty Ltd, worth an estimated $2.3 million. Is it because of the higher value of the shares that a different level of conduct is acceptable? Is it because Senator Short was a supporter of the Prime Minister but not a personal mate, as is Senator Parer? Is that why a different standard of conduct is acceptable? Is that what it means?</para><para>Senator Short went on to say that he had held the shares in the trust, the ANZ Bank, for a considerable amount of time and that this holding had been recorded in the Register of Senators' Interests since its inception. Parer claims, as some sort of defence, that the trust has been in existence for 28 years and that he has a one-ninth interest in it. This must mean that he is one of nine family beneficiaries. At least Short declared it.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—Senator Cook, could you please use their correct titles?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>RF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name></talker><para>—At least Senator Short declared it; Senator Parer did not. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:25:00</time.stamp><page.no>959</page.no><name role="metadata">Crane, Sen Winston</name><name role="display">Senator CRANE</name><name.id>UW4</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I too would like to enter this debate and make a number of points.

This is just a sloppy, dirty diversion away from the real issues facing Australia.</para></talk.start><para>We hear from those on the other side about Senator Parer using the words `technical breach', which he did. But I have never heard such a mishmash of argument as that put before us in that last contribution from Senator Cook. You could not even call it a technical argument. In fact, one could quite fairly and freely say that Senator Cook mislead this place when he said that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) remained silent on this. Aren't you aware that the Prime Minister went into the other place last night and made a statement? For your benefit I will quote it. I will read out a couple of these points:</para><para>I inform the House that I am satisfied on the basis of the advice I have received since question time that Senator Parer has not breached the ministerial guidelines.</para><para>That is from the Prime Minister himself. If the Prime Minister stands up in the other place and says that, then I am satisfied. He 
 also made a number of other points, as Senator Parer has done: there was no personal benefit out of the arrangements that were put in place; there is no conflict of interest in carrying out his job. These are very important aspects of what we have here before us at this particular time.</para><para>I had the benefit not so long ago of being in Kalgoorlie with Senator Parer. What did he do? He got on and dealt with the issues before us. In Kalgoorlie he discussed the problems that the goldfields and the mineral fields of Western Australia have with native title, which I have already mentioned. He talked about the issues of transport, the problems there and the need for infrastructure development to assist in the great industries we have in my state in those particular areas. There was no conflict of interest whatsoever or any pretence of conflict of interest in what Senator Parer was doing in carrying out his particular job and in performing his responsibilities as a minister. And to try to run a comparison between other people and Senator Parer and his particular position is absolutely a nonsense argument and position to be in. Senator Cook has left the chamber. He may have aspired at one time to be a lawyer but after that contribution he has a long way to go. He is certainly no Rumpole as far as I am concerned.</para><para>Returning to the issues that are very important: there is no conflict of interest, no profit and no voting rights. What more do you want from a particular individual? What amazes me most is, and it also  applies to the Democrats and that silly question that was asked by their leader, Senator Meg Lees today: why do they so desperately hate anybody who is successful? I thought we should have this place full of successful people—people who know how to run a business, how to do things, how to be successful. I doubt whether you can find one senator on the other side who has ever made a buck of their own, who has ever taken their shirt off their back and done a decent day's hard work. And here you are attacking the man who has done it himself. He is a self-made person who has contributed an enormous amount to this economy of ours.

There is the question of whether or not Senator Parer has been open and direct in his declarations to this parliament under the pecuniary interest requirements of the Senate, and there is the issue as to whether or not the Prime Minister has failed in his duty to uphold the ministerial guidelines that he himself has flourished as a great hallmark of his government and the allegedly higher standards that he is representing in this country at the moment.</para></talk.start><para>In the first instance, it is undoubtedly the case, as Senator Parer himself acknowledges, that there has been at the very minimum, on his own admission, a technical breach. There is a more fundamental question, however, as to whether or not that technical breach goes to the issue of whether there has been a more fundamental conflict of interest between his activities as the minister for coal and his 
 ownership of shares in coalmining in this country.</para><para>For the Prime Minister, however, there is a more substantial question still—not that the issues regarding Senator Parer in themselves are trifling affairs. What the Prime Minister said in regard to Jim Short when he laid down the benchmark here on 10 October 1996 was that he felt that, although Senator Short, as he then was, did in fact breach the guidelines, it was only a minor breach. That was his first position. He said that he thought that, while he believed that Senator Short did not comply and had acknowledged that to the Senate, he had discussed the matter with Senator Short. He had considered sacking him but he felt that, because there was no personal benefit directly to the Assistant Treasurer, as he was at the time, that he had made no consideration directly to benefit himself, as he saw it, it involved no impropriety. So Senator Short, as he was then, ought not be forced from the ministry. He said:</para><para>I think anybody who knows Senator Short will be aware that he has not been guilty of any deliberate dishonesty. In all the circumstances, I do not believe that he has profited from any deliberate decisions. I do not think the ownership of those ANZ Bank shares influenced decisions that he took. In those circumstances, I have taken the decision that I have and I remain confident of the minister's capacity.</para><para>Of course, the problem for Senator Short and for the Prime Minister was that by the weekend, by 11 October 1996, Minister Short was writing a letter to the Prime Minister resigning his portfolio. He said that he had become aware, as a result of staff going through his papers, that he had in fact undertaken a number of decisions involving ANZ interests. What he said in a letter to the Prime Minister was that he had found several dozen approvals relating to the administration of banking laws. In his letter to Mr Howard, according to the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline>  of 14 October, Senator Short said that the ANZ request was a routine one and his approval had been based on the recommendation of both the Reserve Bank and the Treasurer. There were no grounds on which the request might have been decided differently. He said:</para><para>My approval was influenced in no way whatsoever by the fact of my shareholding in the ANZ Bank. When I spoke with you on Wednesday evening I had not recalled having given the particular approval, and similarly during the Senate sittings on the Thursday. Now my attention has been drawn to that approval, I feel that the circumstances of the matter have changed, and in light of this I have given the deepest consideration to the circumstances and I have decided to tender to you my resignation as Assistant Treasurer.</para><para>What is a difference between Senator Short, as he then was, and Senator Parer now?</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—Order!

move:</para></talk.start><para>The Senate notes, with concern, that:</para><para>(a)	 despite coming to office pledging to reduce youth and long-term unemployment by boosting economic growth, the policies of the Howard Government have in fact delivered:</para><para>	 (i)	 a 15 per cent increase in long-term unemployment since March 1996,</para><para>	 (ii)	 a fall in employment growth from 2.9 per cent per year during the last term of the Labor Government, to 1.4 per cent per year under the Coalition,</para><para>	 (iii)	 an increase in the youth unemployment rate from 27.4 per cent to 28.4 per cent since March 1996, and</para><para>	 (iv)	 a fall in economic growth from 4.7 per cent to 3.6 per cent since March 1996;</para><para>(b)	 the Government's response to this disastrous employment picture has been to contract out the responsibility for its failures by abolishing the Commonwealth Employment Service and introducing a `market-based' approach to employment services, without parliamentary scrutiny and excluding many hundreds of community-based employment service providers with excellent track records and priceless intellectual property;</para><para>(c)	 the Government has introduced this fundamentally flawed employment policy with a 
 tender process which has been secretive, has demonstrated no link between resource allocation and need, and fails to deal with ongoing issues such as performance monitoring and purchaser/provider dispute resolution; and</para><para>(d)	 the Government's policy, despite being promoted as more flexible and effective, is no more than a cynical measure designed to artificially deliver a lower long-term unemployment rate by actively excluding from the employment services market 400 000 unemployed people who are not on benefits, people over 50 and people who have been in case management for more than 39 weeks.</para><para>I thought I would start off by anticipating the speakers from the government who will, no doubt, talk about the unemployment figures that were released today. I would like to point out, before the chortling from the government, that what we have is a flatline employment situation. Employment is stuck at 8.1 per cent. The other key fact is that there has been no improvement whatsoever in youth unemployment since this government was elected.</para><para>I would like to go through the economic situation because I am sick to death of the nonsense coming from Peter Costello with regard to the economic situation in Australia and the selective quoting of statistics that he is so good at. Let us have a look at it.</para><para>One figure they do not talk a lot about on the other side of the chamber is growth. The reality is that last week's national account figures showed economic growth for the year to December as 3.6 per cent. You cannot get genuine employment growth in an economy unless you get over the hurdle of four per cent to 4.5 per cent growth. Who said that? Who said you have to get at least four per cent growth before you can make a real dint in unemployment? I bet you he has rued the day he made the statement. It was the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, who said that. Yet in the whole two years that this government has been in they have not cracked the four per cent. What was the growth rate when Labor went out of office? It was 4.6 per cent. So in two years of coalition government growth has dropped. That is the first point. It was probably a non-core promise but it was a commitment by this government that it would get 
 growth above four per cent. But what has happened is that, under the policies of this government, growth has reduced by one per cent. That is an indictment in itself. But there is more.</para><para>Let us have a look at the situation with regard to the average rate of economic growth achieved under the Howard government. Average economic growth is three per cent. In Labor's last term of office the average rate of growth was 4.5 per cent. That is a 1½ per cent difference. In Labor's full 13 years in office the average annual rate of economic growth was 3.7 per cent—more, right through the recession in the early 1990s, than this government has managed to achieve in two years when the commitment was four per cent. In the calendar year 1997, the first full year of the Howard government, the economy grew by just 2.8 per cent, despite an OECD prediction of 2.9 per cent.</para><para>Let us go through this litany of mismanagement. The transport industry also recorded negative growth in the December quarter of minus one per cent. Corporate profit, something they are very fond of trumpeting here, actually fell by 0.4 per cent in the quarter. Despite the fact that inflation continues to remain low, the major deflators—private consumption and GDP—all show a rise in inflation. Let us have a look at savings. The household saving ratio fell from 3.9 per cent to 3.1 per cent. The ratio was 3.6 per cent when Labor left office. The manufacturing sector, a very important sector and a major job creator, recorded negative growth of minus 0.6 per cent in the December quarter. That is outrageous in such a labour intensive sector.</para><para>Employment growth since March 1996 has averaged just 1.4 per cent compared to almost three per cent under Labor. Long-term unemployment, the most serious and difficult form of unemployment to deal with, has risen 15 per cent since the Prime Minister took the axe to Working Nation. This is outrageous. As I said before, in the entire term of this government there has been no improvement in youth unemployment, despite the commitment they gave that youth unemployment was a high 
 priority. Secondly, we have a situation where, as I said before, 8.1 per cent is flatline.</para><para>The economy, the government says, is going really well. It says the preconditions are there and all we have to do is wait. To quote the previous minister for employment, Senator Vanstone, it is a bit like a farmer waiting for the drought to break. The drought still has not broken and the reason the drought still has not broken is that nothing has happened in this economy under this government for two years.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5F4</name.id><name role="metadata">CALVERT</name><name role="display">Senator Calvert</name></talker><para>—Hasn't it?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>9L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator MACKAY</name></talker><para>—That is right.

Do you know why? Because what this government is doing is creating a casualised and part-time work force, and the strategy is absolutely deliberate.</para><para>One of the most important things that came out yesterday was the consumer confidence figures.

If the people on the other side think it is funny then you do not deserve to get re-elected and you will not.</para></talk.start></continue><para>What has the government done in the face of this situation?

It is one of the most mismanaged, maladministered messes that I have ever seen. I think it is the most mismanaged, maladministered mess that this government has created. That is the reality.</para></talk.start></continue><para>How did all of this commence? The previous minister for employment, Senator Vanstone, introduced a bill. The opposition was successful in getting amendments to that bill, which included a reference to universality and which included reference to a public service. No way. The government did not like that. The bill was pulled; they ran away. They could not take the heat. They could not take the public scrutiny so they pulled the bill. They proceeded anyway and what an absolute disaster that has been.</para><para>If you do not believe me—as I am sure those on the other side do not—listen to what the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> of 28 February 1998 had to say about this new market approach to employment services. It says:</para><para>Providing a bounty of up to $10,000 for a successful job placement for someone who is defined as long-term unemployed seems, however, a system ripe for exploitation.</para><para>They got it in one. They were absolutely correct—`ripe for exploitation'. Gary Hardgrave, the Liberal member from Queensland, said:</para><para>I am angry about the awarding of contracts because many community providers with strong records of helping the unemployed missed out on contracts.</para><para>So, if you do not believe the opposition and the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline>  editorial, what about one of your own people who made that statement? He should be angry because that is exactly what happened.</para><para>Let us revisit—and see if we can actually get it through to the government—what is happening with the 400,000 people who will not be eligible for employment services. Let us just go through it one more time because we still have not had assurances from the government in relation to it. The reality is: if you are unemployed and not on benefit, you are not entitled to access to employment services for free.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>FQ6</name.id><name role="metadata">SYNON</name><name role="display">Senator Synon</name></talker><para>—And you never were under Labor.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>9L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator MACKAY</name></talker><para>—With the CES you were.

What does that mean—that you are not going to be thrown out of an office when you walk in? I want this government to give an absolute guarantee that every single person who is unemployed will have free access to employment services. That is what we want. We want that guarantee.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Let us revisit the long-term unemployment figures. We have a situation where long-term unemployment has increased by 15 per cent under this government. What is the government doing for long-term unemployed people? If you are long-term unemployed and not on benefit, you do not get—and I said it the other day—a cracker. You do not get any assistance whatsoever. Let us just clarify this because you have to listen very carefully to what Dr Kemp and Minister Ellison have said in relation to this. If you are not on benefit, you will not get assistance. If you have been unemployed for 12 months, you will not get assistance. Who said this? Not the opposition—Employment National. Employment National said, `Sorry, we're interested in profit. We're running things on a market basis. If somebody, not on benefit, has been registered as long-term unemployed for 12 months, we will not help them. We are in the business of making a profit.' That is fine; I cannot blame them for that because this government set up that precondition. Again, Minister, I would be very interested if this government would give a commitment that every single person who is long-term unemployed and not necessarily on benefit will be given access to employment services to the same extent as those people who are long-term unemployed and on benefit. That is what we want.</para><para>Access to employment services for the retrenched worker who is living off his or her redundancy payments is denied. We still have not had an assurance to free services for 
 defence force personnel spouses because they are not on benefit. Minister, I would be very pleased if you would give a rock-solid commitment—not a core or non-core commitment—that you will guarantee that these people will be given access to employment services. Women wishing to re-enter the work force with partners who work—the ones who can actually afford child care these days, given the cuts to child care—are denied access to employment services. They cannot get it. This really is an outrage. People know it is an outrage, and I would suggest that you are not going to get away with it. Tom Connors from the <inline font-style="italic">West Australian </inline>said on 11 March:</para><para>Jobless Australians deserve a free employment service. Only the heartless would say otherwise.</para><para>Only the heartless would say that. This government is heartless and mean spirited.</para><para>You could go on and on about this disaster. Let us have a look at the resource allocation. How were FLEX 3 resources allocated, Minister? Were they allocated on the basis of long-term unemployment? They were not. FLEX 3 resources were not allocated on the basis of long-term unemployment. There is no nexus between FLEX 3 allocation and long-term unemployment rates. Do you know what you have done? I know what you have done. You have done actually allocated resources on the basis of job opportunities, not where long-term unemployed people actually are. Let me explain what you have done because I know what you have done. It is very simple. It is allocated on the basis of job opportunities. That means that you—the government—have given more resources disproportionately to those areas where people have more chance of getting a job. That is why the major factor in relation to FLEX 3 allocation is job opportunities.</para><para>What does that do? It means that long-term unemployed people who are lucky enough to live in areas where there are jobs will get them—let us hope that they do—and those long-term unemployed people who live in areas where there is not enough FLEX 3 allocated will not. What will they get? They will get work for the dole. What will we have? We will have jobless ghettos. If this 
 government is serious about saying to the Australian people that the allocation of FLEX 3 for long-term unemployed people—that is, intensive assistance—was done on a fair dinkum basis, show us the modelling. Show us how you did it. Show us how you actually got the figures and show us how it was allocated. I, for one, would be extremely interested to see it.</para><para>How did the minister, Dr Kemp, deliver the so-called good news about this new service? I think I have already indicated that there were some real doubts about the allocation of FLEX 3 in relation to the tender documents. Did the minister say that there are X number of FLEX 3 places—that is, intensive assistance—for here and there are X number of places for there? No, he gave ticks. If you have a look at his papers, you will see that there are ticks—FLEX 3, tick; FLEX 1, tick. He did not indicate how many places. It was quite deliberate. In the press conference he obfuscated when asked that question by journalists. He would not give that response. Why? The reality is that the resources have diminished. There is a cut. We will find out about this.</para><para>When Dr Kemp made the announcement, he set himself some benchmarks, which is very interesting. It is good that we have benchmarks, but it is a pity that we do not have a jobs target. One benchmark is that during the first 19 months 840,000 will be matched vacancies. What does that mean? Does it mean that 840,000 people will get jobs or does it mean matched? Perhaps you can clarify that, Minister Ellison. Does it mean they will get the jobs? I do not think so. Here again are weasel words.</para><para>The second lot says that 540,000 will be given intensive assistance—that is, FLEX 3. Do you know what that means? It means they will go along to a provider and get registered. It is $1,500 in the provider's pocket. That is what Dr Kemp means when he says that 540,000 will be given intensive assistance. That is why they are called FLEX 3 commencements in the tender documents. I suggest you read it, Minister. These so-called benchmarks and targets are arrant nonsense.</para><para>What happens to the long-term unemployed job seekers who go along to the provider and get put on the books and remain on there for 52 weeks? If they are really hard cases, after 52 weeks they are put off the provider's books. Do you know what they have to do then? They have to wait to requalify for intensive assistance and all they are entitled to is FLEX 1.</para><para>I would like to spend the remaining time looking at what this flawed and biased tendering process delivered. Let us look at what happened to those hardworking, committed people in the community sector and the private sector who missed out. Mary-Louise Petro of Sisters of Mercy, St Mary's—this issue has had a lot of coverage—was quoted in the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline> as saying:</para><para>We are having to close Mamre Employment Services in St Mary's. We have made 10 highly efficient staff redundant.</para><para>Let us look at some case studies. Key Training, established in 1989, has been providing case management services in Tasmania since 1995 and has a placement rate of 43 per cent, which is 6.3 per cent higher than the CES itself and other similar providers in the region. Key Training has received numerous industry awards—too many to mention here—and under the recent round of tenders got nothing. As a result of this, 12 staff are being retrenched at Key Training.</para><para>Victoria's Strategic Training and Employment Placement Services, STEPS, which was established in 1996, has been providing case management services at Broadmeadows since that time. Both the principals of this organisation have been working with the long-term unemployed for over 30 years and were previously CES area managers. It has a placement rate of 34 per cent, which is four per cent higher than EEA and other similar providers. It did not get anything either and is expecting to retrench four experienced staff as a result.</para><para>I conclude by saying that this is a disaster. This is why day after day the government is getting community provider after community provider saying the process was a shonk, the results are a shonk and they will not deliver any genuine services to unemployed people, 
 particularly to the area most in need—that is, the long-term unemployed.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>966</page.no><name role="metadata">Synon, Sen Karen</name><name role="display">Senator SYNON</name><name.id>FQ6</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Considering the experience of 13 years of Labor government, I find it very difficult to believe that we are here debating this motion today. Senator Mackay, since you feel so strongly about the unemployed, you might stay in the chamber for the debate. Today of all days we have had the best job news for over seven years. The ABS announced today that 8,529,000 people are in work in Australia—the highest number ever in Australia's history. There was an increase of 14,800 in February alone and and increase of 140,600 jobs in the six months to February. Listen to this, Senator Mackay: the seasonal unemployment rate is at 8.1 per cent, the lowest since December 1990—more than seven years. Today there are 8,529,000 people in employment in Australia—the highest number in Australia's history.</para></talk.start><para>But this government is not going to rest on its laurels. The coalition is committed to working towards the goal of giving a job to every Australian who wants a job. It is a goal we are proud of. It is a legitimate goal that only a government that genuinely cares for the people of Australia could have. It is a goal which in 13 years the ALP never even tried to reach. Unemployment rates went up under the ALP, and let us never ever forget it. When this government came into office we pledged to reduce youth and long-term unemployment by boosting economic growth. I must say that our record is far better than that of those who sit on the other side of the chamber and seek to trivialise the debate today.</para><para>In the `recession we had to have' the ALP destroyed 338,900 jobs; let us think about that another way: 338,900 people's lives. I hope you are proud of that. When Mr Beazley was minister for employment, long-term unemployment increased by 95,000 people. In the six years from July 1990 to March 1996, when the ALP was in government, only 16,000 full-time jobs were created—in six years. It is laughable that you come into this chamber today and wish to debate the coali 
 tion government's record on employment creation.</para><para>We have created 14,800 places of employment in February alone. You created 16,000 in six years. What a pathetic effort. We all remember when unemployment reached 11.2 per cent in December 1992—the highest level of unemployment in the postwar era. That was under your government: congratulations to you. We all remember when from March 1991 to November 1994, nearly three years, unemployment did not fall below nine per cent; and when in December 1992 youth unemployment reached 31.4 per cent. Incidentally, in today's figures it is down to 26.4 per cent. Under you, it was 31.4 per cent; it is now down to 26.4 per cent.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>7L6</name.id><name role="metadata">HOGG</name><name role="display">Senator Hogg</name></talker><para>—That is nothing to be proud of.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>FQ6</name.id><name role="metadata">Synon, Sen Karen</name><name role="display">Senator SYNON</name></talker><para>—We are not resting on our laurels; as I have said, we will continue to do anything within our power to give a job to every person in this country who wants one.

Who can forget those billboards all around Australia: one million unemployed?</para></talk.start></continue><para>I am not necessarily blaming Senator Mackay for the policies of the Captain Wacky government. Given that the senator was never part of that government, I can only assume that she is as embarrassed by its record as we on this side of the chamber are disgusted, because when Senator Mackay raises the issue of unemployment in this chamber she never mentions Labor's record. She is ashamed of it.</para><para>The Hawke-Keating governments did spend money though. As I have said before and will doubtless say again: Labor governments are very, very good at spending money.

Let the Australian people never forget that, under Working Nation, when you were in a training program, you were considered to be working. What a joke. What a manipulation of the unemployment figures. It is something of which I think you should be ashamed.</para><para>In the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> last year, the attitude instilled by the Labor Party was showcased in an unemployment snapshot of young people living at Broken Head. Johnny Abegg, 17, left school early and is on the dole because `it helps out the oldies'. Matt Chelman, 21, who has not worked since leaving school:</para><para>We're all on the dole. You get addicted to it after a while . . . Look, I'm happy on the dole. It suits me and it keeps you out of trouble.</para><para>These are our young people, the future of our country—and I hold the ALP directly responsible for this attitude.</para><para>But this is not surprising, when you consider the labour market programs that Labor devised. In 1995-96 the ALP spent $2.7 billion on labour market programs, and unemployment rose. But Labor's labour market programs did not work. Take New Work Opportunities, for example, a labour market program which had an outcome of 21 per cent. Not too bad, you might think. But, when compared with a comparison control group of 17 per cent, the outcome was four per cent—four per cent net outcome and $143,000 a place. But, in addition, most of those people had already taken part in a previous training program; that is, more money on labour market programs which did not fix the problem—the training merry-go-round. Is it any wonder that Johnny Abegg and Matt Chelman think it is easier to stay on the dole?</para><para>The Democrats phrased it well—and I regret the fact that Senator Stott Despoja has left the chamber—when they said in their unemployment issues paper, `The Working Nation program is not about creating new jobs but reshuffling the unemployed.' This same paper of the Democrats also concludes, `a goal of every Australian having work is an 
 impossibility'—an impossibility. Well, you have sold out the Australian public too soon.</para><para>In 1994 the OECD made a statement about training programs like Working Nation. After a comprehensive study of developed countries' traditional responses to unemployment and their training programs, such as Working Nation, the OECD concluded that there was `meagre support for the hypothesis that such programs are effective'—meagre support.</para><para>Money is not the answer. We do have an unemployment problem in this country, and the unemployed people out there deserve some innovative creative responses. We cannot continue with the responses of the last two decades which have not worked in Australia and, according to the OECD, have not worked in any other country, just because you are not imaginative enough or courageous enough to tackle new things.

In the past five months under our government, there has been the creation of 141,800 new jobs. As I said before, that translates into a seven-year low of unemployment rate of 8.1 per cent.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Yes, we have replaced the old CES—and, yes, it needed to be replaced. It had a success rate of less than 20 per cent and was not providing adequate service to Australians. So it had to go. And, yes, we have introduced the new Job Network, a system which will be more flexible, more responsive and infinitely more successful. On 1 May Job Network will replace the CES. Job Network is our national network involving more than 300 private community and government organisations, which will specialise in finding jobs for unemployed people. We are going to focus on results, getting unemployed people into jobs, 
 giving people help that actually makes a difference.</para><para>And, yes, we are using a market based approach. We are actually going to pay Job Network members for placing unemployed people in jobs. We are going to provide incentives for job placement organisations to find unemployed people jobs. The more disadvantaged the status of the person, the greater the incentive. This government is not about managing or reshuffling the unemployed. It is about finding them jobs.</para><para>Job Network is a great opportunity for unemployed people. It is going to offer access to thousands more vacancies on a touch screen vacancy database and access to 1,404 sites around Australia, instead of the fewer than 300 sites the CES offered—over 700 more outlets for unemployed people to go to. That is four times the number of points of access to service for unemployed people. We are going to provide them with improved access to free computers, telephones and facsimiles to help them prepare resumes, apply for jobs and find work; flexible assistance—assistance actually tailored to the needs of the individual job seeker; and easier access, most importantly, to apprenticeships and traineeships. Apprenticeships, under the previous government, fell to their lowest level in more than 30 years.</para><para>By offering greater choice to employees and employers we are letting them decide what they want and what services they want to use. It does work. The Westgate Community Initiatives Group in Footscray, Melbourne, a highly successful and professional community based nonprofit organisation, offers personalised service to its clients, who find it has a more comfortable and individualised environment. One of their unemployed people, Despina Sarandogiou, said—I want senators to listen to this:</para><para>Here I feel like a person whereas at the CES I felt like a number.</para><para>Is that how those opposite would have our young people think of themselves—as a number in a bureaucratic machine? Not this government. We are treating these people as people. </para><para>But Senator Mackay's motion also, surprisingly, criticises our tender process—something which I am finding hard to accept in light of its rigour. We put in place an outstanding process to select the best people in Australia to provide Job Network services. Every one of them went through a very rigorous process to test their suitability and financial viability. Every one of them had to devise a strategy to help unemployed people in their area, and every one of them had to undertake satisfactory access for unemployed people to their services. They all had to demonstrate their experience, and they all had to compete.</para><para>Senator Mackay and others were at estimates and heard this process discussed and have a copy of Mr Sedgewick's statements outlining the terms covering the tender process. They know that experienced departmental staff assessed approximately 5,000 bids for six service types within 29 labour market regions against stated selection criteria. The ALP know that the principles established in allocating levels of business to tenderers included competition, client choice, diversity, value for money and coverage for as many job seekers in the market as possible. They know that to meet these principles a wide range of providers were selected—over 300 of them.</para><para>They also know, and have been told repeatedly, that Blake Dawson Waldron, a highly respected law firm, was appointed to independently monitor procedural integrity throughout the tender, and they know that they gave this process an unqualified sign-off on 24 February. Their statement reads:</para><para>On the basis of our observation and inquiries of the Independent Observers we are satisfied that . . . the tender has been conducted in accordance with the probity requirements. We consider that the procedures outlined in the published tender documentation including the Probity Plan, have been followed . . . we have not identified any evidence of systematic bias, lack of objectivity by assessment teams, pattern of scoring or ranking which advantaged or disadvantaged any particular bidder.</para><para>The independent observers are happy. Of course, each tenderer has also been offered the opportunity to be debriefed on how they fared, so it can hardly be called a secretive 
 process. And of course safeguards have been built into the Job Network system. Contracts with Job Network organisations preclude them from charging eligible job seekers for employment services. Job seekers will be afforded protection such as client privacy and the right for complaints to be referred to the Ombudsman. An industry code of conduct lays down standards that organisations must follow, and that code is backed up by a complaints process available to anyone unhappy with the service they receive.</para><para>For the first time in almost 20 years of employment service delivery we are offering unemployed people a choice. Just because that does not sit comfortably with the socialist notions expounded on the other side is no reason to criticise the program. Choice should be available to everyone, even the unemployed.</para><para>As for the comments regarding the long-term unemployed and their exclusion from the employment services market of various groups in the community, they are just another example of Labor's misrepresentation of the facts and blatant twisting of fundamental truths. The long-term unemployed will be specifically targeted and receive intensive personalised case management. If they are going to get a job, they are going to get it under a program like this—not Working Nation, not LEAP, not Jobskills.</para><para>Let me take on another point—that people who are not registered for benefits are not going to be eligible for services. Let me tell those opposite, based on my many years of experience in this area, that people who are not in receipt of unemployment benefits have never been eligible for intensive government assistance—training or otherwise. There were many times when I was managing an employment training program in the western suburbs of Melbourne that I rang the DEET officers and wanted to provide assistance to someone and was told the government—that is the ALP government—thought it was not an economically viable option. So let us put a nonsense to this argument that we keep hearing.</para><para>Again we have the ALP wasting its time and our valuable time criticising our record and our policy on unemployment. We are the 
 ones out there creating the jobs, helping job seekers find jobs and providing a responsive, flexible system to assist them. Our government cares enough about the unemployed to try to help. We do not just throw money at them. We do not just reshuffle their numbers. Our government cares enough that we have done something about unemployment, and the record speaks for itself. Today 8,522,000 people in Australia are in work—the highest level in the history of this country; an increase of 14,800 jobs in February alone. Over six years the ALP created just 16,000 jobs. We have created 140,600 jobs in the six months to February. The trend unemployment rate in this country today is 8.1 per cent—the lowest level for seven years.</para><para>The ALP should be ashamed of themselves. They are obviously ashamed of their record, because they never discuss it; they never open themselves up to scrutiny. This government does not need to shuffle numbers. This government does not need to shuffle the unemployed. This government is about getting jobs. This government is getting jobs and will continue to do so.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>969</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise on behalf of the Australian Democrats this afternoon to support the general business motion before us. We on many occasions and again today express our concern about the seemingly, at times, intractable problem of unemployment in this country, in particular our youth unemployment levels, as Senator Mackay has noted in her motion before us. I acknowledge some of the points that Senator Synon has made to the chamber and today we welcome any increase in job participation; we welcome any increase in employment statistics in this country.</para></talk.start><para>I think we all are very nervous and at times rather cynical about figures put before us. I just hope that increased employment opportunities and positions continue. But I also get concerned about those figures which reflect those people who are dropping out of looking for full-time work. I also get very concerned when we fail to analyse that a number of new jobs created have been generally, and in 
 particular since the beginning of this coalition government, in the part-time and casual area—that we are seeing a reduction in the number of full-time jobs being created. It is that increased casualisation of the work force which is of grave concern.</para><para>I do take issue, though, with a point of Senator Synon's. She referred to the creative, the new and the innovative ideas of this government when it came to addressing the issue of employment. I could happily sit here all day—not necessarily all day, but for some time—and listen to Senator Synon expand on those new ideas. I did not get any new ideas, however. I think one of the strongest criticisms that many people in the community and certainly the Australian Democrats would make of this government is its absolute failure to invest in new industries—sustainable high-tech industries of the future; the kinds of industries where long-term, meaningful and sustainable jobs will come from, not just for young Australians but for a range of people in the community.</para><para>We know, too, that the link between job placement and increased employment opportunities in the future is with education and training opportunities. One of the biggest bugbears that the Democrats have with this government is the government's failure to recognise that link, or at least underestimating that link and the important role that education and training at any level plays in this process. Jobs of the future will be in these highly skilled industries. That is why Australians, but in particular young Australians, need access to education and training opportunities. They do not need disincentives, be they psychological or financial, put in their way. In relation to education and training opportunities, they do not need barriers such as fees, high levels of unmet demand and, as we have seen today, changes to income support arrangements, in particular for students and young unemployed people, that make it at times almost impossible to enter into those institutions.</para><para>I will confine most of my remarks this afternoon to where Senator Synon left off, and that is in relation to the employment tendering processes under this government. I am glad that Senator Synon expressed her 
 satisfaction with the probity and accountability of these particular processes, because the Democrats are not satisfied. In fact it is with deepening concern that the Democrats have watched, if you like, the unfurling and now unravelling of the government's privatisation of the employment services market. We believe that this service is fundamentally flawed, both in operation and in implementation—the losers being the unemployed and the established and committed service providers for whom this government continues to display an appalling lack of regard.</para><para>We believe it is the sad truth that the more one looks into the operation of this scheme the more flaws one finds. At every level there is evidence of poor policy and poor decision making, and every day more comes to light. Today I have to add to this ever-growing list. I wish to highlight in particular the government's contravention of its international treaty obligations and its apparent lack of probity. The International Labour Organisation convention was ratified by this country in 1949; yet it appears that the current government either has forgotten about these provisions or hopes that the rest of Australia has forgotten. An examination of these provisions show that the employment tendering scheme certainly contravenes the spirit and the letter of that convention. I draw the attention of the Senate to article 1 of the convention which provides:</para><para>Each Member of the International Labour Organisation for which this convention is in force shall maintain or ensure the provision of a free public employment service.</para><para>When we look at the proposed operation of what remains of this public service, Employment National, we can see that it has been established on a commercial basis. It is to compete with other service providers and, as such, will be bound to maximise profits at the expense of the service it offers.</para><para>I note the minister has been very keen to assert that facilities will be available for those who need them, yet the facts are that the intensive FLEX 3 assistance will only be available to the long-term unemployed and other facilities will only be available to those on unemployment benefits. That leaves an 
 estimated 420,000 people, such as those in part-time and casual employment—a growing proportion of our work force as I have pointed out—and the spouses of employed persons re-entering the job market without free access and assistance, in clear contravention of this article.</para><para>The minister is wrong in his view—and it is a view to which only he and his government appear to adhere—that the provision of touch screen services at Employment National, and Senator Synon referred to this, and other service providers will equate with one-to-one assistance. Furthermore, it is important to remember that Employment National has been set up on a commercial basis and of course it is going to be expected to operate on this basis. What incentive will exist for it and other service providers to list vacancies on their databases for universal access when they will not receive any payment when they are filled? These organisations will only be paid for the positions which they fill themselves, and it is an accepted view within the industry that the degree to which the positions will be listed will be very limited indeed.</para><para>Furthermore, the minister has claimed repeatedly, in lieu of formal safeguards to protect difficult to place unemployed persons, he will rely on `verbal assurances' given by providers. We heard the following comment from the minister on yesterday's AM program:</para><para>Drake have said that if they come to us we'd consider taking them for that job along with everyone else who was the best person for the job.</para><para>This is clearly no assurance whatsoever.</para><para>As these organisations will be operating on a for-profit basis and will be paid only for the people they place, what incentive exists for them to provide services for the disadvantaged or the long-term unemployed whom they may not consider to be the best person for the job? They are the hard people to place. There is nothing to stop these organisations from culling the people who come to them and providing services only to those whom they believe will be attractive candidates for employers.</para><para>Again we see the government in breach of its obligations under this convention, because part 2 of article 1 provides:</para><para>The essential duty of the employment services shall be to ensure, in cooperation where necessary with other public and private bodies concerned, the best possible organisation of the employment market as an integral part of the national programme for the achievement and maintenance of full employment and the development and use of productive resources.</para><para>The minister is certainly adept at making grand assertions, but I would defy even him to continue to claim that the outcome of the tender processes actually fulfils this part of the article. The most cursory glance will reveal serious anomalies and, unless action is taken to rectify this, the ramifications for those requiring the services will be all too severe.</para><para>Examples abound of established, experienced organisations—particularly community organisations and those with community links—losing out to organisations with little or, in some cases, no capacity to deliver the services for which they have been contracted. Organisations such as the National Skillshare Association have been decimated—an absolute tragedy—under this tendering process. Their years of expertise in service provision has been deemed of less worth than individuals with new ideas and approaches. I take on board Senator Synon's concerns about some of the former Labor government's projects—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>O15</name.id><name role="metadata">TIERNEY</name><name role="display">Senator Tierney</name></talker><para>—Too right!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3I6</name.id><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name></talker><para>—Do not get ahead of yourself, Senator Tierney—in particular the Working Nation programs. There were flaws. However, what this government did was not only cut $1.8 billion over about three years out of labour market cetera programs, but it did not even give any credence to the notion that well-targeted labour market programs do assist and that there were organisations that had very good track records in the provision of places and the placing of those people who were unemployed, be it for short or longer periods of time.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The Democrats have always acknowledged that that process needed time to be not only properly established, but evaluated. Then the 
 idea of evaluation is to keep the good bits and get rid of the bad bits; not to get rid of the whole process altogether. We are fans of targeted labour market programs and that is why we were absolutely stunned and outraged when this government made such sweeping cuts to labour market programs in the 1996 budget, together with just about anything that involved education or training.</para><para>The minister is wrong when he claims that the previous system failed the unemployed. Skillshare is a great example of a successful program and successful placements in a very difficult sector. It managed to place more than half the people registered with it. I believe in its last year of operation it placed around 60,000 people. Since 1989 the association has placed more than one million unemployed people. That is a staggering amount when we think of the number of people who have been unemployed in this country.</para><para>Yet this was not good enough for the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs or the minister, and 250 of their 300 providers did not win contracts under the new scheme. When we look at how the new scheme is set to operate, we see examples such as Lismore which has one of the highest rates of youth unemployment in the country, as Senator Tierney would know. Yet, instead of ensuring that services are maintained in that area, they have been cut. Innovative, successful programs—some provided by ATSIC and designed to assist the indigenous population in the area—have also been cut.</para><para>Prior to the adoption of the new scheme, there were 56 clients per case manager in the area. Now there is only one case management provider, Employment National, and each case manager will have around 200 clients. This is unworkable, unfair and, even more sadly, it is a situation replicated throughout the country.</para><para>Article 2 of the convention provides:</para><para>The employment service shall consist of a national system of employment offices under the direction of a national authority.</para><para>The Australian Democrats would like to know why organisations with proven expertise lost out to those with little or no experience and 
 why Employment National in particular was awarded a disproportionate amount—42 per cent—of the most lucrative work available, often at the expense of the smaller providers.</para><para>The outcome of the tendering processes has seen the creation of an anti-competitive market in which Employment National, with its huge market share—which stretches to a monopoly in some places, such as Lismore, which I mentioned—is poised to clean up. It has been handed the employment market on a plate. So we are seeking an assurance from the minister that the government has not handed Employment National the employment market on a plate so that it can be privatised at a future time. It is fattening up Employment National so it can be sold off, an act which would be in direct contravention of the provision that I just described in article 2 of the convention.</para><para>Moving through the convention, article 3 is yet another provision which the government has chosen to ignore. It states:</para><para>The system shall comprise of a network of local and, where appropriate, regional offices, sufficient in number to serve each geographical area of the country and conveniently located for employers and workers.</para><para>The $1.4 billion worth of cuts in funding to this sector has resulted in a decimation of the public provider. In May 1996 in my home state of South Australia, the CES operated a network of 31 offices and had 700 staff. Despite the fact that today's employment figures—Senator Synon was happy to talk about today's employment figures—reveal that the rate of participation in the labour market in South Australia is the lowest for years, with almost 5,000 people having given up looking for work, as of 1 May Employment National will have less than 100 staff in 17 locations. A number of these will be merely office shopfront locations and operations. Of particular concern is the effect that this will have on rural and regional areas.</para><para>The commercialisation of the market has seen a parallel urbanisation of service provision with providers choosing to establish themselves in the more lucrative urban locations. The result of this has been that places such as Coober Pedy, Ceduna, Naracoorte in 
 the south-east, rural areas and some regional areas with high levels of unemployment, will no longer have employment service providers.</para><para>Given the contempt with which the government has approached this whole process and the contempt that it has displayed in its obligations towards the unemployed and the service providers—the list goes on—it is perhaps not surprising that an analysis of the tendering process has thrown up a few other anomalies.</para><para>The Democrats have discovered something that we consider perhaps a serious breach of due process. I am advised that Drake International, which, of the private tenderers, received the most lucrative contract, has strong links with the former leader of the Liberal Party, Dr John Hewson. I am advised that Drake International has as its managing director a Robert W. Pollock, who was also the top executive of ABN Amro Holdings, a company listed as the global ultimate name of Drake International Inc. This company is also the principal shareholder of ABN Australia Ltd, which lists Dr Hewson as its chairman.</para><para>What we are asking for, Senator Tierney, is an explanation from the government as to the links between the receipt of this contract worth millions of dollars and the former leader of the government's party.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>EU4</name.id><name role="metadata">O'CHEE</name><name role="display">Senator O'Chee</name></talker><para>—You've been taking lessons from Senator Faulkner.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—Order!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3I6</name.id><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name></talker><para>—We actually consider this quite a serious matter, quite a serious anomaly. When this anomaly is added to the list, part of which I have already outlined, the need for this government to justify its election process grows even more pressing. We will no longer be satisfied with vague assertions provided by the minister because his verbal assurances have been shown to be empty. The claim by his department today that our concerns and those of the community at large are `irrelevant nonsense' just add to the growing body of evidence that this government, far from demonstrating any real commitment to addressing the unemployment problem, chooses instead to show its 
 contempt for the people who are hurting the most from its reforms.</para></talk.start></continue><para>There have been a number of comments made here today about the difficulty of addressing the unemployment issue. Nobody fails to accept that that difficulty exists but I do find it very hard to take when someone like Senator Synon stands up and says that her government has implemented new and innovative measures. Far from it. We have seen a return to some of the oldest and most antiquated, outdated measures in the book. When a government legislates for a compulsory work for the dole program, it even legislates the word `dole'. For the first time so far as I know—not only in the history of this nation but perhaps internationally, as senators may be able to advise—it legislates the word `dole'. It enshrines that in the legislation, with all its negative connotations. That is not a new response. That is not a response to what is a new problem in many respects.</para><para>Unemployment may be old but the newness is that our work force has changed. We know that traditional entry level jobs, especially those occupied by young people, have disappeared. Our work force has been fundamentally restructured, and people have to accept that. That is where labour market programs come in. That is where we accept that skills and training and access to education at all levels is mandatory. It is necessary to ensure that people do have the skills with which they can compete in a work force and, increasingly, a global work force. As for these new ideas, I cannot see any forthcoming from the government.</para><para>To make one final point, when I talk about stereotypes surrounding the word `dole', Senator Synon in her contribution could not leave it alone. She could not resist the chance to perpetuate some of the negative stereotypes that we hear about young people. I swear that I get so sick and tired of the dole bludgeoning that goes on in this place by some decision makers and some members of parliament who find it much easier to use young unemployed people as scapegoats for the fact that their failed, miserable, outdated policies to solve 
 unemployment in this country are just not working.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>974</page.no><name role="metadata">Crowley, Sen Rosemary</name><name role="display">Senator CROWLEY</name><name.id>ZF4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—There are many points that need to be taken up in this very important debate brought into this place by my colleagues Senator Carr and Senator Mackay.

 see every Australian who wants a job to be able to get one and to work. That is what we know Australians want.

Those women went to work, and they were able to do that because they were backed up by a government committed to and insisting on seeing they had the support—for example, child care. An article in the <inline font-style="italic">Herald Sun</inline>  of Tuesday 10 March, entitled `Women give up on the hunt for work', shows that women are giving up. They are one group of the discouraged jobseekers. They are one group that no longer have that high participation rate which made it so difficult for the figures to come down for the Labor Party when it was in government. But it certainly meant that many people enjoyed the opportunity of working in this country. As  David Luff writes:</para></talk.start></continue><para>Almost 120,000 job-seekers, mostly women, stopped looking for work last year believing there was no hope of finding a job.</para><para>But the Federal Government yesterday chose to ignore the figures, preferring to concentrate on a rebound in job advertisements last month.</para><para>About 3.7 million adults were not working compared with the 9.2 million people in the labour force . . .</para><para>About 1.2 million said they were not actively looking for work or not available for it even though more than half wanted work.</para><para>The number of discouraged job-seekers—people not doing anything to find work and people not receiving unemployment benefits—stood at 118,400, with women accounting for two-thirds.</para><para>This is one of the things that is not obvious in those figures but is a critical part of the story that needs to be told. Whatever else we do, we ought be telling the truth here; we ought be telling the whole story, the complete story. We should be aware of how many people are discouraged and not being counted any more. Women are very high in that category.</para><para>You have had a policy since you came into office of encouraging women out of the work force because you know that is one way in 
 which you can drop the figure for unemployment, and it is beginning to happen. It is happening, in particular, because of another mean-spirited decision by your leader to take away the operational subsidy for community-based child-care centres and to peg the assistance as the fees rose. In most centres those fees have gone up about $20 per week per child and many families cannot afford it any more. Women who use child care are now dropping out of the work force. Those women are not able to be counted here. They have given up; they are discouraged.</para><para>There is another group of people associated with child care whom you do not count. I heard yesterday—though I always qualify these figures as to whether they are exactly the latest and most accurate—that 48 community-based child-care centres around this country have now closed under your government. If you allow an average of 10 women working in each child-care centre, that is 480 women who are on the unemployment list because of your policies to see the closure of community-based child-care centres. It is not only the families who use child care, but it is also the workers who provide the child care. They are not counted in your list. They are discouraged. They are not out there either.</para><para>There is another very important group that is not being counted. These are the people who are 55. We have got a lulu of a challenge for them: if they want to be on unemployment benefits, they have to run down any savings, in particular superannuation. I wonder why, if you became unemployed at 55, you would want to say, `Right, that's it; I'm out of work for the rest of my life. Nobody will take me on. I might as well give up now.'</para><para>Most people at that age expect and hope that they will be able to come back into the work force and would prefer, as they could in the past, to go on to unemployment benefits and seek further employment. These days, if they do that they are going to be eligible for unemployment benefits only if they run down their superannuation and retirement benefits, so many of them shrug their shoulders and become retired so they can actually have access to and maintain the nest egg they have 
 worked all their lives for. They are not counted anymore. They are off the list. That is a very interesting little way in which you score how many people are unemployed.</para><para>That goes for the 55s who are now retired so as to save the nest egg that so many of them have been working 20 or 30 years for—taxpayers of this country putting their pennyworth in and saving for their retirement now being forced to retire at 55 if they want to have full access to it. You are a mean lot over there, a mean, nasty lot.</para><para>What is interesting is, this is the government that said it would be the government to make people's lives comfortable and relaxed. Any time you go into the community that is not what they tell you. I heard one of my Liberal colleagues saying the other day that you should not worry too much about unemployment in Canberra and about all those public servants who have lost their jobs because over a year and a half or so almost all of them will have got some other employment—as though that has fixed that.</para><para>Have they ever stopped to speak to somebody who has lost their job? Do they understand what lack of confidence, what kind of anxiety and what kind of pressure that builds on their families and that, when these people finally do get another job, they are actually not the same kind of assured and capable people they were before they lost their jobs? It is as if there is a transition with no measurement of the gap, no measurement of the pain and suffering, no measure of the loss of income and no measure of the anxiety—and that is the word I keep hearing in the community. `We're not sure where we will be, Senator.' `We're not sure we will still have a job.' `We're not sure that we will be able to keep on paying for the mortgage or the borrowings.' You know that.</para><para>Senator Natasha Stott Despoja also talked about the increasing and dramatic casualisation of jobs and the move to contracts—12-month contracts in particular for many people. Senator Tierney and I are in the process of concluding an inquiry into the status of teachers in this country. One of the things that was raised with us time and time again was the difficulty of being a first year graduate 
 teacher, if you are lucky to score a 12-month contract to become a teacher. You know and I know—and they certainly told us this in bucketloads of evidence before the committee—that a 12-month contract is no way to move into your new profession with some kind of optimism that this year you will be really learning as you go, but that will be all right because the year after and the year after that you will be able to build on and improve those skills.</para><para>No, what they say is, `We are very concerned about whether we will even have a job as a teacher in 12 months time.' Worse than that, many of the people who would be a mentor for those young teachers have been saying, `It is hard to get too enthusiastic for a young teacher who may not be there next year and who may not even be a teacher at all next year.' It is a double if not a triple whammy. That is the impact of these short-term contracts, as just one example from the comprehensive evidence we have taken over the last few months of the negative impact of that.</para><para>Many of those people may be counted as employed this year but they do not have any confidence that they will be employed for the longer term. They are the sorts of people who are frightened to get into major investment. The figures show there has been a very significant drop in confidence not only in the business community but among the purchasers of this world. We saw those figures just the other day—I notice Senator Synon was not quoting those at us today—a massive drop in business confidence and consumer confidence, and I have just stated one of the reasons.</para><para>Even the people in the work force do not have the confidence they will be there with any long-term prospects; they are anxious about the on-going security or income that they can expect. It is more so if they are in casual work. We saw this, too, all through the evidence brought before child care inquiries; not only from the child care point of view but from the the viewpoint of families and particularly women who are working casually Monday, Tuesday this week and Thursday, Friday next week.</para><para>How on earth are they going to manage their lives on that? The difficulty of those rotating hours are tough enough; the casualisation and the lack of security about even being able to have to rearrange your life in a couple of months is also pressurising those people. The stress and anxiety builds up and more and more those women, in particular, are retreating from the work force. They are discouraged; they are not counted.</para><para>I would urge a caution about wild celebration of today's figures. We know that what they reflect is a very significant drop in the participation rate of women. You know it, and what is more you cannot actually boast it because it would make clear your unspoken agenda to remove women from the work force. I have been saying this for two years. I was laughed at when I first said it; slowly the picture becomes patently clear. There is no denying it. They are out of the work force, they are discouraged from looking for work and now they are not even being counted. You cannot acknowledge it because, first, as I say, it would indicate your mean, miserable, limited, mean spirited agenda and, secondly, you would have to acknowledge the success we had in our term in a large part of our government—</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Government senators interjecting</inline>—</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Crowley, Sen Rosemary</name><name role="display">Senator CROWLEY</name></talker><para>—Oh, laugh.

 ber Senator Newman who said last year in answer to a question from Senator Ray, I think it was, that if women behaved like the Defence Department did in being wasteful it would be right for her husband to push her out of the home. We know the Lyons Forum's approach to women. We know what some of your colleagues have said on the record. We know the problem you have about women who are not at home looking after children. You have never really celebrated it, and here it is: women are out of the work force. Women are not being counted because they are discouraged. You have cut back child-care centres. The work force is reduced by those 480 to 500 women who do not have their jobs any more. There are all those thousands of families who can no longer go to work or participate because they do not have access to the wide distribution of quality child-care services that were instituted under our government.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Those are the major points that I wished to raise in my contribution to this debate. The points raised by Senator Synon have been more than dealt with; particularly her point about the tender process. I do believe that you should be very cautious about the success of that. You can be assured that we will be watching very closely. Senator Synon said that all the unemployed people would have touch screen services. That will be the thrill of their lives. What people want when they are looking for a job is somebody to talk to. It is nice to know, as a first stop, where you might be able to find a job but they are not going to find full satisfaction and assistance from touch screen services. What is this? An up market way of reading the newspaper? If the list of job vacancies is improved, then that is a good thing.</para><para>Your proposals for helping people get jobs are really scandalous, particularly the proposal that if you are not on an unemployment benefit you are not going to be eligible for that kind of assistance. Your claims have been refuted very comprehensively by Senator Mackay. They have been refuted again by Senator Natasha Stott Despoja. Unemployment remains a major concern. We are seeing many people discouraged, defeated and 
 retreating from the work force. They are no longer counted.

We have spent several days in this parliament listening to issues that do not concern this nation. We have spent several days muckraking because of this policy vacuum in the ALP—these policy airheads on the other side who have absolutely nothing to say on the issues that concern this nation, and the most important is unemployment. We have been on this debate now for 1½ hours. Has anyone in this chamber or anywhere else heard in that debate an original idea from the other side, from Senator Mackay or Senator Crowley or any of the other apologists for their failure for 13 years to do anything about this problem?</para></talk.start><para>Their failure is shown up by the fact that, on average, unemployment over 13 years was 8½ per cent. That is their brilliant record. And that is only the official rate; it does not include the underemployed—the part-time people who wanted a full-time job and could not get it. It did not include the ones who had given up altogether. Senator Crowley was talking about the participation rate. Of course there were a lot of people who were not participating who would have liked to. To put them all in, the evidence from the long-term unemployment inquiry that I chaired three years ago was that you have to roughly double your rate. So your record over 13 years was about 17 per cent unemployment in reality in this nation.</para><para>Don't let us start on youth unemployment. If you go to your figure it becomes horrendous. You left government with 29 per cent youth unemployment. I remember reading in a book in 1985 about the terrible state of youth unemployment in this country—25 per cent in 1985. You were in government for 11 years beyond that and what happened to it? It went from 25 per cent up to 29 per cent. What a great record. And Senator Mackay comes in here today and raises the issue of unemployment—after 13 years of miserable failure. What did we hear from the Labor Party? Did we hear a grand plan for solving 
 this problem? I do not think anyone in this chamber on this side did. We were all straining and listening for solutions from the ALP to unemployment in this country.</para><para>What are your options? Are you going to continue with our program? From what you are saying today, probably not. Are you going to go back to the failed Working Nation program, where you wasted $1.7 billion, where your placement rate was one-third? You took the others, the two-thirds left, all those hundreds of thousands of people, trained them and there was no job; trained them, no job. Are you going to do that? Is that your option? There is a third option, isn't there? There is a grand new vision of the ALP for unemployment in this country. Well, where is it? We have had in this chamber all your shadow ministers and your leader here going on for days on issues that are irrelevant to the people of Australia. I looked up into the gallery today and saw all those people looking down as you were just muckraking, destroying people's reputations, and they must go away thinking, `What on earth is happening to this country if these people have anything to do with the running of the country?' You are not focusing on the serious issue.</para><para>Congratulations, Senator Mackay, here you have actually returned to the serious issue, but you are a bit on the back foot with it, given 13 years of failure. You are also on the back foot because of the record of this government over the last two years. When we came into power, unemployment in this country was 8.7 per cent. It is now, on today's figure, 8.1 per cent. That is a steady drop over that time. You obviously put up this motion this morning on the basis that the unemployment record was going to be bad.

Today's figures prove that those very sound policies in what it has done with the budget and what it has done with interest rates have set the business climate to actually reduce unemployment. So there is your secret. It is not going back to your failed Working Nation policies; the secret is to set the policies in such a way that you actually get unemployment coming down. Does it work? Look at what has happened over the last two years: 8.7 per cent down to 8.1 per cent sounds like a success to me. The policies of this government are working.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Let us look back at some of the failure of your record. I do not think we can emphasise these points too strongly. We need to keep telling the Australian public again and again about the way you failed over 13 years. The one who really leapt to your defence today, greatly to my amazement, was Senator Stott Despoja, who started quoting international conventions; incorrectly, as it turns out. She was claiming that under the 1949 ILO convention you had to provide public providers for the unemployed. She was actually mixing up `publicly provided' and `public provided'. It does not necessarily have to be run by the government but it has to be public and open. She was confusing those terms and trying to mislead the Senate into thinking that we are breaking some ILO convention. We are not.</para><para>She also went on to defend the CES. What a brave senator, defending the record of the CES. What was the success rate of the CES, the centrepin of the previous government's unemployment policies? Didn't they do well. It was 20 per cent. There are the jobs up on the board: go and have a look and go out and find one. It was just not a successful approach. Moving into case management was a good move. We have always supported that. Moving on to what we are doing now is even more successful. I think Senator Stott Despoja should perhaps come back sometime and acknowledge that.</para><para>I said I was going to remind the Senate of the record under the last Labor government. If we go back and look at what happened to the long-term unemployed, we see that the Labor government really tried to put a lot of effort in and put a lot of money in. That is what it was all about, putting in money and being showy. Calling something Working Nation: what a joke, calling it Working Nation. What irony. What an insult to the unemployed, making out that, if you institute such a program, people are actually going to be working. We know that after the program, with $1.7 billion down the drain, two-thirds of them were not working at all.</para><para>As a matter of fact, Wollongong, under Working Nation at its height, had a very famous visitor, Kim Beazley. He went and spoke to the youth of Wollongong—a very 
 brave man for doing that, I thought. It was publicised and it was televised nationally. Kim Beazley was up there saying, `We have got these training programs for you to get work.' The audience replied with one voice, `But there are no jobs.' What they said in Wollongong at that time was that they had the best trained dole queues in the world. They get into a training program and try to find a job—no job. Another training program, try to find a job—no job. Then another training program. The best trained dole queues in the world.</para><para>That was what the fault of Working Nation was; it was assuming that if you trained people there would be jobs around. The whole thing failed. What we have instituted with the economic policies that I mentioned before is an approach that actually creates real long-term jobs.</para><para>The disillusionment with the former Working Nation program was brought home very starkly to our committee that was inquiring into long-term unemployment. I quote from one of the unemployed, who said:</para><para>It is more comfortable to remain lying in the gutter than to be picked up and dropped back in it again.</para><para>That is what he said. That is what happened to him. They picked him up and gave him some training, but there was no job so he was back where he was before. He found that a shattering and disheartening experience. As we went around the nation we found the phase of this program was just a matter of churning people in the dole queue. What we really should look at are the outcomes of this program.</para><para>What was the employment growth in full employment under Working Nation and under the Labor government in its last years? Between 1991 and 1995 there were 6,000 net new full-time jobs. What happened in the recession was a collapse in full-time jobs. We came out of the recession and full-time jobs started to increase again, but if you look over those four years, the great achievement of the Keating government was the creation of 6,000 new jobs—net. What a disgraceful record. With $1.7 billion that was the outcome. That is why, in March 1996, two years ago, you were tossed out in such a devastating way. It 
 was because of the failure of a whole range of programs but, in particular, programs like this one.</para><para>When we look at the fine grain of the programs under Working Nation we see that the story gets worse. Senator Mackay did say that some of the programs worked particularly well and I am sure some of them did. But there were appalling examples of failure and waste. Probably one of the worst was `new work opportunities'—$170,000, on average, per successful placement. Money was pumped into this right until the federal election, particularly up in my area. The member for Paterson, Bob Baldwin, and I went out to a graduation ceremony for one of these groups. They had been working for six months in this new work opportunities program. Bob Baldwin asked them at the end, `Hands up those who have found a job after this scheme.' Out of the 25 people in the program, one hand went up. That was a terrible failure. It was very disillusioning for the people involved and it was a terrible waste of government money.</para><para>What we have done is move away from that sort of program. California based research looked at how those Working Nation type programs were operating in one county and compared them to another county where work for the dole type programs were operating. What they found in that research was that the work for the dole type program was working better because you were putting people straight into work. Instead of training where there are no jobs you put them into work, they build up the confidence and they get new skills. When they compared the two groups at the end of this time they found that the people who were in the work for the dole type programs were more likely to go on to training or more likely to find work.</para><para>We have had a very successful initial start to this pilot. The party opposite opposed it fiercely, set up an inquiry and came down against it, and then suddenly did a backflip when they discovered that the vast majority of the public out there supported it, seeing it as something very necessary and something that would give young people hope. For that 
 reason, this government is expanding this program.</para><para>The people opposite today have spent a lot of time doing some sort of analysis of the new programs we have adopted. They have gone on from work for the dole to Job Network, spending a lot of time spreading gloom and doom, saying that terrible things are happening under Job Network. It is funny that they keep bringing up this example in western Sydney.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>8O6</name.id><name role="metadata">O'BRIEN</name><name role="display">Senator O'Brien</name></talker><para>—We don't think it's funny.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>O15</name.id><name role="metadata">Tierney, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator TIERNEY</name></talker><para>—In this chamber and also up in the estimates I think I have heard this example brought up five times.

Maybe this poor fellow out there, whose name you have absolutely blackened, will fail now after what you have done to him on the public record. This fellow has not even started. He cannot start until 1 May, yet you are condemning him before he starts. He has had experience in the area and he is setting up a new business. What a terrible thing to do—set up a new business! He is setting up a new business to give the unemployed in western Sydney the chance for a job. You should give him a go. You should give this program a go, because your program totally failed. This one, which has incentives in it for people to work and incentives to employ people, is one that I feel, having looked at this area very thoroughly for seven years, has a great chance of success. You should give it that chance and stop trying to condemn it before it even starts.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>981</page.no><name role="metadata">Hogg, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HOGG</name><name.id>7L6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise regularly when this issue of unemployment comes up because it is an issue dear to my heart. It is an issue that should be on the table, but when Senator Tierney says that the government policies are working I do not think Senator Tierney has looked at the figures or understands what is actually going on.</para></talk.start><para>While Senator Tierney quoted the 8.7 down to 8.1, he did mention, as did others, the issue of the long-term unemployed people in this nation. Let us now look at the record and let us look at it through the ABS statistics of January 1998 on the labour force, from which we can get some comparative idea of what is really happening—not something that is fudged or fictional but something that is actual. If you look at long-term unemployment—and that is where the greatest problem is in this nation—the problem is getting those people who have been out of work for a long period of time back into the paid work force, because it is getting them back into the paid work force that will give them dignity.</para><para>If one looks at the table headed `Long-term unemployment', which is table 26 at page 33 of the ABS labour force survey, January 1998, one sees what is happening in reality to the long-term unemployed people. It is worthwhile to compare what has happened from December 1996 to December 1997. If one looks at the seasonally adjusted figures, one will see that there has been a change in that period of time for people who were unemployed for between 52 weeks and 104 weeks—that is, between one and two years—from 99,400 to 125,600. So what we see is a substantial increase in the number of people who were long-term unemployed between one and two years.</para><para>If what Senator Tierney and other speakers from the government said was correct, then we would be seeing their policies reducing that level, but there is now a burgeoning increase. If one looks at the long-term unemployment figures over 104 weeks—that is, two years or more—one will see that there is a slight reduction from 129,200 to 127,700. But the reason for the slight reduction is that many women who were in that area have left the job marketplace. That comes out quite clearly in the ABS statistics—that the people who have left the marketplace are women. Of course, there is an improvement in that area, but it is worse for men. You find therefore that the government's policies of trying to address long-term unemployment are not working at all; they are at the margins. They are affecting those people who are unem 
 ployed for the under 52-week period. Whilst I am glad for anyone who gets a job, and I would applaud anyone who can find employment, the real problem that is confronting this nation is not being addressed.</para><para>If one then turns to page 34 in the same document, one finds, again, an age break-up of the unemployed persons. It is table 27, `Unemployed persons: duration of unemployment by age, marital status and full-time/part-time status, January 1998.' If one looks there—and there is no year to year comparison—one finds that there were 157,000 men who were unemployed for 12 months and over throughout this nation. However, when you go to the figures for two years and over, you find that there are 84,900. When you put it in raw statistics such as that, we are talking about a major problem.</para><para>When one looks at the figures for the females, one will find that the figure for those who were unemployed for 52 weeks and over is 81,200, and the figure for those unemployed for 104 weeks and over is 39,200. So we are seeing substantial numbers of people who, in reality, are out there unemployed, and the policies of this government have not, in any way, placed any dent in those statistics. If one looks at the collective statistics there, one finds that we have a figure for people who were unemployed for 52 weeks and over totalling 238,300 and for 104 weeks and over, 124,100. Those figures cannot be denied, and the government has to do something about it.</para><para>That was its promise to the Australian people—to do something about the evil called unemployment. These are the people who have been struggling the longest and the hardest and all we see are increasing numbers—not for the time of the previous Labor government but increasing numbers that have come about during the current term of this government. We are not talking about something that is an invention on my part; we are talking about something that is in black and white, and that shows the problem we have in this nation. I only wish that this problem would be addressed by this government and not treated in the flippant way that I believe it is on many occasions.</para><para>The second thing that I wish to address this evening is the issue of the employment services program. There are some real problems with what has happened in the tendering process for the employment services program. Senator Tierney expressed dismay that he has heard only one story, so I think it is only fair that we broaden the number of stories surrounding this issue of the granting of the tenders for the employment services program.</para><para>I am going to look at three areas. I am going to look at the area of small business—and, of course, the government claims to be the champion of small business—at community organisations where they have missed out, and also at the feelings of some of the church organisations which were equally involved in this area and have missed out.</para><para>It is interesting that the first case arises from a person whose company was unsuccessful in the tender process. I am talking about a company called About Service, which is a small business. It had nine years experience being a private provider and employed 11-plus employees. I am told that it had a placement record in the order of 65 per cent, when its direct competitors had a placement record of 40 per cent. By any test, one would think that this was a reasonable provider, an experienced provider, run by a small business operator in the area of the employment services market.</para><para>This company had high hopes in the tender process. It had experience, credibility and background in the area. If one had looked at an article in the January 1998 publication of <inline font-style="italic">Southern Star</inline>, a local press based in Brisbane, one would have seen that there was a little bit of hope from this company about the future. The article said:</para><para>People seeking work now have a choice of applying for jobs through a CES or private job brokerage.</para><para>Remember that this is pre the tender. The article went on to say:</para><para>About Service senior case manager Christine Polzin said the number of unemployed that the centre dealt with had trebled since the changes had been implemented with about 400 jobseekers now on its books. 
</para><para>The company had a track record in this area. So much so that the local federal member, the member for Griffith, Graeme McDougall, was supportive of it—understandably and rightfully so. He wrote to the principal of the company on 21 January this year in respect of the tendering process that was going on at that stage because it was emerging that the process was not necessarily kosher. He said, `The minister is aware of the problems associated with the tendering process.' So the federal member for Griffith has admitted that the government, through the minister, was aware of problems associated with the tendering process. At the end of the letter he said:</para><para>We share a joint goal, which is to place job seekers into positions which are rewarding to both the employer and the employee.</para><para>There is no doubt that there is a great deal of sincerity in supporting this small business operator within the seat of Griffith.</para><para>Let us look at the employment service record of About Service and the jobs notified over the last four weeks at About Service at their office at Browns Plains. Let us look at jobs filled over the last four weeks as opposed to jobs notified: jobs filled, 20; jobs notified, 30. Their track record is very good indeed. For the About Service Coorparoo office: jobs notified over the last four weeks, 11; jobs filled over the last four weeks, eight. Their placement record was impeccable. It was up with any of the other private service providers and community service providers in that area.</para><para>And what happened? What happened was this company failed to get anything out of the government tender process. Let me assure you: the principal of the company was definitely not a supporter of our side of politics. We are looking at a company of which 11 of its employees were affected—not one or two. It was a small business that had been built up and operated over a number of years.</para><para>I will tell you what the principals of the company had to say on 23 January in respect of the process. By this stage, there was a veil of secrecy; there was a cone of silence. Not even the Chief, 99 or 86 could find out what was going on. In the letter to me, they wrote:</para><para>Our research and our own investigations and enquiries have revealed that other companies have 
 been offered contracts in areas where we are currently providing employment services. These companies have not been operating in our geographical location before, yet we, as an existing, established, long-term and effective provider of these services, have heard nothing.</para><para>We had a process at this stage where those who had the knowledge, the understanding and the ability were seemingly going to be denied the right to access the market that they had previously well serviced. They went on to say:</para><para>In all of our dealings relating to Government tenders over a 9 year period, we have never experienced such a situation before.</para><para>This was a small business trying to play their part out there and they were getting this treatment. It further said:</para><para>It appears that the larger organisations, and those perhaps with some political affiliations, seem to have been notified of their success first and if they decline to accept the offers submitted to them, then and only then, will other tenderers be advised and offered the leftovers.</para><para>This was a company trying to plan their future. It gets better—or worse, depending on which way you look at things. It said:</para><para>We are certainly aware that there were no guarantees of gaining acceptance of our tender, but naturally we are bewildered and confused simply due to the total lack of any formal advice regarding our tender outcome.</para><para>It went on to tell of the sort of uncertainty that has been created by the government in this process. It said:</para><para>. . . we still have 3 months left of existing contracts to fulfil and we can do nothing about this potential loss of our experienced staff.</para><para>The fear for these people was that they would lose their staff as a result of not knowing whether they were successful or unsuccessful in the tender process. Everything at that stage had led them to believe that they were unsuccessful, and ultimately they were proved to be correct. They had existing contracts which went to May that they would not be able to fulfil. It is an example of small business being attacked by this government. The letter continued:</para><para>If we have been totally unsuccessful and were advised on a fair and level playing field, this we could accept. 
</para><para>They could accept a fair and level playing field, but they did not feel they were in that situation. The letter continues:</para><para>We believe that what is happening currently, needs serious investigation and must be rectified immediately to remove the unnecessary uncertainty that exists.</para><para>That is, because they did not know whether or not they were going to be successful. The letter continues:</para><para>Our company will be laying off 4 of its Administration staff on Tuesday 27th January, again through no fault of their own, or that of our Company but we do need to take some pro-active measures, in anticipation, before it is too late.</para><para>Because of our excellent past track record with employment outcomes, we would find it extremely difficult, if not unbelievable, to accept that we were not successful in any way.</para><para>So there is not just one out there; there are more.</para><para>We go then to a later fax that I received from that very same company—and by this time they had some idea of the tender process outcome. The fax states:</para><para>I could not work out, now that successful tenderers have been announced, why, with the exception of Employment National, 95% of existing providers were not granted their current geographical sites.</para><para>The fax continues:</para><para>Existing small providers, like ourselves, who only contracted for their original sites and no others, are out altogether and have received no sites whatsoever—</para><para>It goes on:</para><para>In effect, what we now have is a brand new start in the employment market at the expense of the unemployed and the 1000 existing providers. This new initiative will not be totally effective for some 4 to 6 months and statistics on performance will not give a clear indication of its success or otherwise for perhaps 12 months by which time there is only 9 months of the tender period to go until it all goes to tender again. It defies logic! If the Government wanted radical change to assist the long term unemployed better, why should you opt for something like this which is so risky and unproven!</para><para>That is from a provider—a provider who had been in the industry and who had suffered the decimation of losing their business right from under their feet. The fax continues:</para><para>Every current training provider expected that Employment National would get approximately 
 40% of the Flex 3 tender, but of the 700 companies and community organisations that were excluded they certainly did not expect that only 200 organisations would get the rest. Let alone that most of these 200 organisations would have no previous track record at all—</para><para>None whatsoever. So the disappointment is real, and it is out there.</para><para>Just briefly, I will mention the skillshare down at Wynnum. The skillshare at Wynnum was a community based organisation. It had done a marvellous job in that area of helping the unemployed, as can be seen by the statistics alone—and I have them here: for 1989, 261; 1990, 334; 1991, 369; up to 1996-97, 310. The statistics show that this organisation was active out there in the marketplace, helping. Of course, what we will see there now, because of the demise, will be 11 jobs gone. Then you have the Catholic social response: 20 jobs gone. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>985</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Madam Acting Deputy President, I wish to make a personal explanation.

I think it is rather ironic that just over three to four years ago we were on the other side of the chamber leading a similar charge, if you like, trying to prove that there were better ways to deal with unemployment. But the difference between then and now is that, under the coalition government, there have been very significant improvements to the rates of unemployment. For a while, I just want to deal with that trend. So let us look at the figures.</para></talk.start><para>I do think this debate requires a little bit of balance, rather than the political point scoring that continually goes on in this place. Unemployment is a serious problem. It is something that most, if not all, Australians have been seriously touched by through their family or friends—but certainly most of us, from time to time, have been touched through our families.</para><para>We find that there has been a certain theme in unemployment going right back to the 1980s coming into 1981, before the previous Labor government got into power—it got particularly bad in 1983 when they came into power—and then we had those horrific years 1992-93-94, when it was consistently stuck at over 10 per cent and went to 11 per cent.</para><para>I believe that the difference between our approach and that of the Labor Party really and truly is one of philosophy. We believe that the best way to deal with unemployment is to make sure that we have a strong economy, successful businesses and stimulus for small business; and in time—and I think the facts are starting to prove this—job availability will go up.</para><para>I particularly want to look at this aspect—because I believe it is important. We can see that from 1994 to 1995, before we came to power, unemployment dropped from 10.5 per 
 cent to 8.9 per cent. We can all quote figures to suit ourselves; we can take a month, we can take two months. That is not my intent.</para><para>The point I want to make here is that the drop in unemployment at that time was almost entirely due to what occurred in Western Australia after the Court government came in. Looking at the figures during that time, and anyone can analyse them very carefully, we went from having the highest level of unemployment when Carmen Lawrence was the last of a series of Labor premiers—it was at well over 11 per cent; I think it got up to 12 per cent at one stage—but, by the end of 1992 and going into 1993, Western Australia's unemployment rate had dropped to the lowest in the country. That was almost the total take-up of the jobs that were created during that time for all Australia. That was stimulated almost entirely by the opening of some great mining projects in Western Australia and getting some of the red tape out of business's way and allowing business to expand and employ people. That is what our philosophy is.</para><para>I want to work through some of these issues. I have been on inquiries and wrestled with these problems, as Senator Tierney mentioned. I wish to comment particularly on a couple of contributions made here today: firstly, that by Senator Rosemary Crowley, who referred to the very unfortunate comment, she claimed by a Liberal, about there being only one place for women—barefoot, pregnant and back in the home, or words to that effect.</para><para>Senator Crowley has not thought very hard about that. She obviously is not aware of what happened on 11 March in the other place. Apparently Janice Crosio, the member for Prospect, interjected on Minister Moylan, saying, `Go back to the kitchen.' It went a little further than that. Minister Moylan came back and spoke on indulgence—and I do not understand all the detail of the standing orders of the other place and how they operate. Mr Beazley, the Leader of the Opposition, Australia's alternative Prime Minister, got himself involved. He said:</para><para>The minister is known on our side of the House as `Go back to the kitchen Moylan'.

We have set about endeavouring to do something about it through sound economic policy and management. Had the previous government not run up that enormous $10.3 billion deficit, we could have made even more remarkable inroads into unemployment than we have. It is my very strong view that, with sound policy and development of initiatives as the Australian accounts come back into balance, unemployment will fall even more.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Let us look at a few of the issues which are very important in dealing with these things. One of the principal reasons we had that sustained period where unemployment ranged from nine to 11 per cent is that during the 1980s our average inflation rate was eight per cent. Today that rate is down to nearly 1.4 per cent. Business, the people who employ—small business in particular—know that they are now in a very sound inflationary position in terms of expanding their businesses and making good economic decisions which will create sustainable long-term jobs—not mickey mouse jobs.</para><para>The next point I would make relates to the impact interest rates have had—again, a very important point—and what is happening in that arena. Looking at the current situation as against that when we came into government, mortgage rates were 10.5 per cent and today they are around 6.5 per cent. For a $100,000 mortgage that is a saving of $80 a week. Taking another measure which I think is very important and will allow people to invest more and help the business community, the average mortgage is around $120,000. That represents a saving on interest rates of about $100 per week or the equivalent of a wage increase of $150 a week. It is these policies that I believe will allow Australia to be in a 
 sound economic position to continue to, albeit slowly, make inroads into unemployment.</para><para>One of the other initiatives which is very important and which will protect Australian jobs and create them—this needs mentioning, because it did not get much coverage at the time—is our new anti-dumping measures. Those on the other side and in the other place had some 13 years to deal with anti-dumping. I have a document which I will read so that I get the facts absolutely right. It states:</para><para>Under the new arrangements interim duties can be imposed after 60 days. The time taken to reach a final finding will be reduced to 150 days and the Anti-Dumping Authority, ADA, will be abolished.</para><para>That means it will be put under one roof. That is absolutely crucial in terms of protecting Australian industry, both in dumping and in countervailing situations, from subsidised imports coming into this country. There is no doubt at all that some of the products that have come into this country have hurt Australian businesses greatly and they have created situations where there have been a job loss, a very sad and unfortunate job loss. So we are seeking, in terms of dealing with that particular issue, to get that impediment out of the way and secure Australian jobs and increase the number of Australian jobs.</para><para>I will now go through a couple of other points that I think are very important in terms of protecting Australian jobs and making sure that we get our equal share of what is available around the world, in particular in Asia. I repeat what I said in here last week: I am not one of the doomsday merchants about Asia and what has happened there. I think it is quite tragic the way some of the journalists have decided to write it up. Maybe that is a little unfair on the journalists. It is some of the commentators who talk to the journalists about the situation in Asia. At the end of the day, we are going to see two things in Asia. The first is a much stronger financial system, which is absolutely crucial to those people doing business with Asia. The other is that, although it will be a slower growth rate, it will still be in the four per cent to seven per cent area, which will be close to leading the world as we move beyond the year 2000.</para><para>These things are all very good indicators in terms of the employment position. Australia's part in this, and I must highlight this, is our support with the IMF in terms of assisting those particular countries not through gifts, not through grants, but through loans and currency swaps, assisting them at this time through their financial difficulties. These are the types of initiatives we require in this country to sustain—and I emphasise that very strongly—the slow improvement that we are attaining as far as unemployment is concerned.</para><para>I particularly mention a little bit about training. I have my office in East Victoria Park. Parts of that electorate have some of the lowest socioeconomic areas of any electorate in Australia. It is the Swan electorate. The member is Don Randall. It was formerly held by the current Leader of the Opposition, whom I mentioned earlier. We were sick and tired, and so were the young people coming in, of the fact that they repeatedly said, `I've been trained once; I've been trained twice; I've been trained three times.' Some of them had been trained up to seven times and still did not have a job. All the training in the world will not get them anywhere unless there is sound economic policy behind it.</para><para>Having said that, I firmly believe that the more training, the more assistance and the further we can upgrade our education processes around the country, the better. It is absolutely essential that we do that. But at the end of the day there must be some hope. There is nothing more soul destroying than to be trained two or three times and still have no hope of getting a job because you have been trained in the wrong areas.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Senator Neal interjecting</inline>—</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>UW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Crane, Sen Winston</name><name role="display">Senator CRANE</name></talker><para>—You were the absolute specialists at it. You trained them without a job at the other end. It is absolutely crucial in terms of this that the two are matched. There is a very important initiative in terms of that, and I will quote from a press release. I was going to make a little comment with regard to one component of Senator Stott Despoja's contribution today when she was critical of the work for the dole scheme. My experience with the people involved with the work for 
 the dole scheme is that they are very proud to be able to do something in return for the assistance they are getting from the Australian taxpayer. That is my experience with the people I have talked to about it. I quote from an article today in the <inline font-style="italic">Advertiser</inline> . It is headed `Work for the dole scheme: a stepping stone to success. Youngsters break into the jobs world'. I will just read the first paragraph. It states:</para></talk.start></continue><para>A north-eastern suburb's work for the dole scheme has been so successful that three of the 14 young participants building bus shelters have landed jobs within three weeks.</para><para>It then goes on to talk about the training in terms of their ability to build the bus shelters; their ability in joining, sanding, welding, design and all the various other things they are learning. That is a very good endorsement of the fact that there is a place in Australian society today for a work for the dole scheme, and that proves it. It is not the be all and end all. It is not the only answer. That is why we have introduced some flexibility into the system for people seeking jobs.</para><para>Regardless of what anybody in this place might think, not all CES offices worked as well as they might have. During that unfortunate period when we had a lot of over-45-year-olds lose their jobs, the last place they wanted to go or be seen to go, because of the psychology of it, was to a CES office. Whether we like it or not, that is a fact of life. Whether you think it is right or wrong, that is a reality. In introducing some competition, some alternatives, you are going to allow a much wider scope of people to have varying opportunities and hopefully—and I believe there will be—increased opportunities.</para><para>I want to come back to where I started in the remaining two or three minutes I have. There is no question that unemployment is a very difficult issue for Australia. It is coming down, albeit slowly. It is a very difficult problem for most Australians. As I said earlier on, they have been touched by unemployment through a partner, their family, in some instances their parents. It is very traumatic. But there is one last thing that I wish to leave in terms of this particular debate and how we can effectively assist in this process, and that 
 is a piece of legislation that is coming up here very shortly. I refer in particular to our 10-point Wik plan and the importance of getting that legislation through this parliament. Once that is through and we can get rid of some of the deficiencies—and I am not talking about the High Court decision here; there is nothing being removed in the 10-point plan Wik legislation that was delivered by the High Court—it will get rid of some of the inventions that were created by the former Prime Minister, Mr Keating, and the then Senator Gareth Evans, who is now in the other place.</para><para>The most appalling of those inventions is the right to negotiate and the way that has been handled. I heard from one of my Aboriginal friends the other day who said, `It sounds all right on the surface, but it is the overlapping claims, the extortion, the fact that whoever happens to negotiate gets all the money, buys their four-wheel drive vehicle and then skips town.' I am sure Senator Chris Evans over there has heard these stories in terms of what is happening on the ground. It has held up project after project throughout much of Australia, and particularly in my state of Western Australia.</para><para>There are many economic opportunities there if they are allowed to be opened up and developed. The 10-point plan is part of doing that. It will increase the opportunities for jobs; it will increase exploration, mining and exports—these are the things work will come from. Finally, it is also absolutely crucial in terms of investment on an existing property that we get certainty back into title. This issue exists and has made a lot of people very cautious about what they do at this particular time as far as their investment and expansion are concerned. Where titles for exclusive possession have been granted, that should be made absolutely crystal clear in the legislation. We should get rid of this nonsense of claims over private land and claims over land where exclusive possession has been granted.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>989</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator CHRIS EVANS</name><name.id>AX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I wish to make a couple of quick points in the five minutes available to me in this general business debate. I am pleased to join the debate because it is about an issue that is crucial to the future of this 
 country. I want to say that I think it is important that we stress what has happened in terms of the new employment services market that the government has sought to establish. The point I want to stress is that the government introduced a bill into this parliament last year to set the framework for the new market that they hoped to establish. That bill was debated and passed by the House of Representatives and was then debated in the Senate.</para></talk.start><para>But before the debate in the Senate had finished, the government withdrew the bill. The government was not prepared to accept the amendments already passed by the Senate and, rather than allow the Senate to complete its work and review what had occurred and take on board the opinions of the other senators in this chamber, it essentially spat the dummy, withdrew the bill and said, `We don't need you. We can set up our new employment services market without you; therefore, we're not going to accept any amendments, any criticism, any critique, any improvements to this bill.'</para><para>I want to make it very clear to those listening and put on the record that the government will wear this market. The government established this market without parliamentary approval and without accepting the parliamentary processes in shaping that market. We made a range of criticisms about the government's proposal. We accepted in principle the move to a more competitive market. It reflected a development that had started under the previous Labor administration of allowing private companies to be involved in the employment market. But we had a range of concerns about the new market arrangements, about how it treated the long-term unemployed, about the role of what is now the old CES and very important issues that went to privacy and freedom of information concerns—a whole range very serious public policy issues.</para><para>The government would not accept the scrutiny of the parliament. The government said, `No. We want to do it our way; we won't accept any parliamentary scrutiny.' So it withdrew the bills and proceeded down this path of establishing a new employment service market in a quite reckless manner. At 
 the time, this was in the hands of Senator Vanstone, who was the minister at the time. But I understand that it was driven straight out of the Prime Minister's office. She took her instructions from the Prime Minister's office. They had reimposed learner's plates on her office and her activities as the minister then, and they deliberately decided, straight from the Prime Minister's office, that they would go without any parliamentary processes into this new employment services market.</para><para>The government will have to wear this grand experiment because the parliament was not given the opportunity to scrutinise the bill as it was. It was not given the chance to debate the issues pertaining to this new employment services market. The criticisms that will come home to roost must be worn and accepted by the government and the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Dr Kemp) because they refused to have any parliamentary input into this market. I want to make that very clear. At the moment it may not seem such an important point but, when this whole thing unravels, I think Dr Kemp in the other House and Senator Ellison in this chamber are going to have to wear the responsibility for what will be a gigantic failure, a real let-down of unemployed people and something that will lose the Commonwealth millions of dollars because the whole thing is a shambles.</para><para>The new employment services market has been organised without parliamentary approval. It was foisted upon a department that has had its staffing and leadership culled so that it is not in a position to undertake this sort of experimental development. I think we face a real disaster that will reflect, firstly, on the unemployed people in this country and will have much wider ramifications as well.</para><para>The other point I want to make is that there are serious legal concerns about this market because of the lack of parliamentary legislation underpinning it. I think the whole thing will collapse under legal challenge. I think the government will be severely embarrassed when this whole thing crumbles. In the couple of seconds left to me, I seek leave on behalf of Senator Denman to have her speech in 
 corporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>. It has been checked with the other side.</para><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The speech read as follows</inline>—</para><para>Senate Speech—11th March 1998</para><para>I wish to rise and speak in particular on the issue of the difficulties faced in the region in which I live in getting unemployment down.</para><para>I want to speak generally with regard to Tasmania and a little more specifically at times, of the Mersey-Lyell statistical division which includes a lot of the West and North West Coasts and includes the cities and towns of Burnie, Devonport, Zeehan, Queenstown and Strahan.</para><para>I mention the Mersey-Lyell region because that has the highest unemployment rate in Tasmania. In the last labour force data released in March 1998 the unemployment rate was 15.1 per cent representing 8500 unemployed while Tasmania's rate was 12 .5 per cent. So there is a significant difference in the North West &amp; West Coast figures compared to the rest of the State.</para><para>It was revealed this week that seasonally adjusted job advertisements for Tasmania fell 8.6 per cent opposed to a national increase of 5.1 per cent. With the release of those figures there was also some positive news that the underlying trend for Tasmania was for slow continued growth.</para><para>Unfortunately the rate of growth is too slow and not fast enough to offset contraction in the areas such as engineering and paper making to industries that are located on the North West Coast. As an example those areas are struggling to compete or to have had significant decrease in demand because of factors such as the Asian meltdown or the fall in the global price of gold.</para><para>It is important to realise that I do not believe our Tasmanian businesses as a whole are inefficiently managed.</para><para>I believe, from discussion with many in the Tasmanian business community, that we are equal to our mainland counterparts in capturing markets in an increasing competitive market. Many Tasmanian businesses have had to remain lean and mean because of our geographical isolation. We have for example some very competitive building contractors who are constantly winning tenders in Melbourne and Sydney.</para><para>It's not surprising that Tasmania is in a prolonged recession.</para><para>Tasmania has lost in the order of $160 million from the State economy since the Federal Liberal Government took power.</para><para>It is difficult to reconcile that loss of revenue with the comments of the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, 
 when he said he was committed to looking after the special needs of Tasmania.</para><para>This shortage of money has not assisted in what is the most critical issue for the nation and for Tasmania that of unemployment.</para><para>Tasmania is not benefiting from this crusade by the Federal Government to balance the books.</para><para>Not only has the State Government had costs shifted to it by the Commonwealth without the compensation in return but it is the individual Tasmanian who has been personally stung. Be it by a decreasing of benefits or increasing of costs or even by the decreasing level of service provided by their local community funded organisation.</para><para>Those individual increases in costs includes things like increased child care charges, increased individual contributions for legal aid, and increased nursing home fees.</para><para>As we know Tasmania does rely heavily on federal grants with 53 per cent of all Tasmanian public sector income being provided in the way of federal grants.</para><para>With this cost shifting as part of the deficit reduction strategy there has not been, in my view an adequate reciprocation of the obligation by the federal government to reduce proactively and urgently the high levels of unemployment that is crippling Tasmania.</para><para>There has been a neglecting in my view of introducing positive measures that could assist Tasmania.</para><para>Especially when some traditional areas within the economy are significantly without those holes in the economy being adequately filled by those growth areas.</para><para>In saying that Tasmania, has had, some recent successes over the last decade that have flown in the face of a slowing and stagnant economy such as our seafood industry. I have a very high regard for the entrepreneurialism of Tasmanian business men and women that have led to those successes, such as our vibrant seafood industry.</para><para>I just don't believe this Federal Liberal Government even recognises the extent of the unemployment problem in Tasmania.</para><para>Tasmania is experiencing poor economic growth, but I do not believe that Tasmania's economic structure is any worse than some of the Mainland states.</para><para>In saying that I also believe Tasmania has some unique problems that impede our aim to possess an expanding economy.</para><para>Tasmanians are being told that benefits will accrue, once all the reforms are in place in the areas such as competition, the financial system, industry policy and industrial relations. 
</para><para>What's hard for the unemployed of Tasmania to stomach is that the economic and industrial reforms agenda being followed by the Federal Government may to some degree lead to a raising in productivity and living standards in the Mainland cities but that they and the rest of regional rural Australia suffers.</para><para>Now is the time for the Federal Government to reciprocate in providing greater levels of direct public investment with a full engagement of local government and regional bodies to select projects.</para><para>I do not believe that a program of infrastructure should have to be of national significance but rather should have clearly defined objectives that are linked solely to Tasmania and tackles unemployment.</para><para>I have received a letter recently as no doubt all my Tasmanian colleagues have received from The Master Builders' Association of Tasmania regarding an infrastructure project seeking funding under the Federation Fund. It is for an AFL stadium. I understand very well the significance of such a project to the building industry but do not believe with all the political involvement in the decision making process that such a project has on the face of it a demonstrated capability to be a balanced, sustainable development.</para><para>That is probably a harsh view because the aim of the fund is to generate employment and stimulate development in the lead-up to the centenary celebrations of federation. The building of such a stadium would probably do that but then how can we be assured that it will generate employment once it is established and especially soak up those unemployed in the Mersey-Lyell region.</para><para>There is certainly a strong sentiment in the North West of the State that an infrastructure project of such magnitude like an ALP Stadium deserves to be located in the region with the	 highest unemployment rate.</para></speech></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>991</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Patterson)</name></talker><para>—Order!

I was not able at that time to speak at length because of the pressure of business at that time of year.</para></talk.start><para>I would like to start by using the words of another and more famous Democrat, former US Attorney-General Robert Kennedy. In 1966, he spoke the following words that have been frequently quoted, reminding us that:</para><para>Each time someone stands up for an ideal, or acts to improve the lot of others, or strikes out against injustice, he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope and crossing each other from a million different centres of energy and daring, those ripples build a current 
 that can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance.</para><para>I hope this report is part of those ripples and that current that will help reduce and remove the oppression that currently exists in the Australian community. I address this report as the Australian Democrat spokesperson on sexuality and transgender issues. It has responsibility for the piece of legislation that was the central focus of this committee report. I hope to see that legislation debated in the Senate at some stage soon to build on the good work that this committee did and that this report does.</para><para>As a political party, the Democrats have been pro-active in championing the rights of lesbian and gay Australians since our inception in 1977. The very first branch meeting of our party was held in the lounge room of Christopher Byron Carter—an openly gay man who was also a founding member of the party and who later served on the staff of former Senator Don Chipp and someone who has a strong legacy in the Democrats.</para><para>It is important to remember that 1977 was only 21 years ago, but Australia was a very different place in lots of ways. With the exception of South Australia, at that time, consensual same sex activity was a criminal offence in every state and territory of this nation. Prosecutions were relatively common as was the regular pastime of police randomly raiding gay and lesbian social venues and blackmail, humiliation and intimidation of patrons was a common occurrence.</para><para>It is important for the Senate to note that within the last 15 years in some places we are still imprisoning mainly gay men for being simply who they are. It took the riots at the first Mardi Gras in 1978 to set gay law reform firmly on the political agenda in Australia. I acknowledge the hard work and dedication of activists everywhere in pursuing reform. I was very proud to be part of the very large and enthusiastic Democrat contingent that helped commemorate the 20th anniversary of that civil rights movement with 700,000 other people in Sydney on 28 February this year.</para><para>Regardless of the reforms and the advances that have been made in the last 20 years, complacency is certainly not warranted, as 
 this report so strongly indicates. As recently as August 1994, Victorian police raided the Commerce Club in Melbourne—a well-known gay and lesbian night club—and unlawfully strip searched 463 of its patrons. To our great shame, the Tasmanian parliament only decriminalised same sex activity last year, with the Western Australian parliament still to catch up with the rest of the country. It still remains the fact that your human rights will be different if your are lesbian, gay or transgender depending on where you live in this country. I would like to take the opportunity to mention the work of my state colleague the Hon. Helen Hodgson MLC, who has introduced decriminalisation and anti-discrimination measures in Western Australia.</para><para>If Australia is to retain its rightful place amongst the community of nations as a country which promotes human rights, then we must do so in a clear, unambiguous and universal way. Amnesty International has documented the international position in their publication <inline font-style="italic">Breaking the silence</inline> last year by illustrating that torture and political imprisonment are not uncommon in many countries of the world simply on the grounds of sexuality.</para><para>It remains a source of some puzzlement to me that some people are perfectly comfortable with the notion of anti-discrimination on the grounds of race, gender and disability but seem to get all up in arms when we talk about applying the same principles on the grounds of sexuality or for people who are transgendered. No doubt many senators will, like me, have been inundated in the last week or so by letters claiming that the Sexuality Discrimination Bill, which was the main focus of this inquiry, constitutes everything from an endorsement of paedophilia to a concerted attack upon religious teachings. It is clear from the tone and phrasing of these letters that a smear campaign or a misinformation campaign is under way. It is also clear that the writers of these letters have, at the very least, been told some very severe misinformation about this legislation or have failed to read or understand its contents or its scope.</para><para>One of the most important things about this inquiry, and its report, was the opportunity it gave lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender 
 people to put their case—for them to have a voice—and that is one of the great roles that Senate committees can play. Those people overwhelmingly informed the committee that their experience was one of significant disadvantage in many aspects of their daily lives. In areas of employment, more than 45 per cent of lesbians and gay men have experienced discrimination in the workplace including the loss of jobs because of their sexuality. Almost one-third report harassment in their schools and universities. One-fifth report inadequate and inappropriate medical treatment, while a staggering 70 per cent have had some experience of being verbally abused, threatened or bashed in a public place. In the Sydney area alone, over 35 men have been murdered in the past 10 or so years because their assailants thought they were gay. Clearly, this is an issue that must be addressed.</para><para>Some concern has been expressed over the inclusion of transgender people in this bill. The status of being transgendered is a medically recognised condition known as gender dysphoria. It does not include transvestitism or what is often called cross-dressing. I am sure that senators would agree that it is inappropriate and unfortunate that some people have chosen to ridicule persons who are receiving medical treatment for a medical condition, and the report recommended that the bill's aim be to protect those people who are gender dysphoric. After all, who amongst us would like to be treated the way we as a society treat gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender Australians every day of the week? The sort of treatment that those people are subjected to came out very strongly in much of the evidence that was given to the committee.</para><para>It is important to emphasise that the bill that the report addresses does not force the Christian or other religions to change their beliefs or to employ gay, lesbian or transgender people. As with other equal opportunity laws in Australia, the bill includes certain exemptions including religious organisations and churches. It does not place children at risk. It does not make unlawful acts lawful. It does not require that homosexuality be taught in schools. It does not force anyone 
 to accept anyone else's lifestyle. It does not legitimise any specific sexual practices. It does not allow people to cross-dress in schools or at work, or allow biological men to compete in women's sport. It does, at a basic level, allow people who have been unfairly discriminated against on the basis of their sexuality or their transgender status to achieve a level of justice.</para><para>In essence, it seeks to protect all Australians, including heterosexual people, if they have been wrongfully dismissed or refused employment, accommodation or access to goods and services, or have been disadvantaged while attending or applying to educational institutions on the grounds of their sexuality. At its core this bill is basically about ensuring that all Australians are given a fair go through universal legislation common across the country to enable that to occur.</para><para>I am quite proud of the Democrats' role in this report and in the legislation that it examines. It is a serious look at the conditions faced every day by gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people in all parts of Australia. I will close by noting a 1986 statement from the Catholic church issued by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith entitled <inline font-style="italic">The pastoral care of homosexual persons</inline>. It stated:</para><para>It is deplorable that homosexual persons have been and are the object of violent malice in speech or in action. Such treatment deserves condemnation from the church's pastors wherever it occurs. It reveals a kind of disregard for others which endangers the most fundamental principles of a healthy society. The intrinsic dignity of each person must always be respected in word, in action and in law.</para><para>When enacted, the sexuality and gender identity bill, which this report deals with, will implement that very important principle. I commend the report to the Senate and to the Australian public for their consideration. I know it has been a very popular report as there have been a lot of requests for copies and for information about its contents. It is a great report, and I hope everybody takes the chance to examine it.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>996</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Chee, Sen Bill</name><name role="display">Senator O'CHEE</name><name.id>EU4</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I was intrigued by the comments we have just heard from Senator Bartlett because 
 it seemed like he was talking about a completely different report from the one that was, in fact, handed down. To be fair to him, Senator Bartlett is new to the chamber and would not be familiar with much of the work that was done by the committee, but let me point out that the bill is principally about people who are described as transgenderists. That means they are usually cross-dressers or transvestites; that is the language that most people normally understand.</para></talk.start><para>What Senator Bartlett omitted from his very eloquent and moving speech was the fact that, in the course of the proceedings before the committee, a number of transgenderists and transgender organisations complained that they were the subject of discrimination from lesbians and homosexuals because lesbians and homosexuals refused to accept people who were cross-dressers. So I think Senator Bartlett ought to get some of his facts right when he gets up to address this matter next time, if indeed he does so.</para><para>I want to take a few minutes to address the report because it was a matter of some interest to me, and I know it is a matter of considerable interest to my constituents in Queensland. In the last two weeks my office has counted 330 letters that have been sent to me from all over Queensland complaining about the possibility that this bill could be carried. The complaints were not just about the bill. The complaints were also about the majority report of the committee, and Senator Bartlett has gilded the lily here a little bit.</para><para>Senator Bartlett says that the bill does not provide that a religious institution should be obliged to employ a transvestite, or transgenderist, in an educational institution. That is correct. The original form of the bill did require that; the then Senator Spindler withdrew that—that is correct. What Senator Bartlett did not tell the Senate—and obviously does not want my constituents to know—is that the Democrat representative and the majority Labor senators on that committee argued that, in fact, the provisions of the bill should be extended and should oblige religious schools to take on people who are transgenderists even though that is contrary to the religious foundations of that school itself.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WP6</name.id><name role="metadata">LIGHTFOOT</name><name role="display">Senator Lightfoot</name></talker><para>—We're not getting the whole story.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>WP6</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Chee, Sen Bill</name><name role="display">Senator O'CHEE</name></talker><para>—We are not getting the whole story from Senator Bartlett.

It is just typical of the fact that the Democrats like to have their way and their say but do not like a debate. It is the hallmark of democracy, Senator Bartlett, that you can have a debate in this place. Senator Bartlett, you were listened to with considerable forbearance on this side of the chamber and I would have thought that, as a new senator, you might at least have the decency to exercise the same forbearance even though you may not agree with the arguments I put. You might at least have the forbearance to listen to them as I have listened to you. But isn't it interesting that some of the people here seem to have different standards on tolerance when it comes to points of view that they do not support.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Let me move on to another very contentious area of this report; it relates to sport. It is very important to get the facts right here. Biologically a person who is born a man has considerable physiological advantages in most sports over women. It is to do with the fact that testosterone is produced in substantially higher quantities in a biological male than in a biological female. Everybody accepts that fact. I do not need to go into the anatomical reasons why that is so. It is just a fact.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>9L6</name.id><name role="metadata">MACKAY</name><name role="display">Senator Mackay</name></talker><para>—Some more than others!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>EU4</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Chee, Sen Bill</name><name role="display">Senator O'CHEE</name></talker><para>—Some more than others. That is a very helpful interjection from Senator Mackay. Senator Mackay, even women with excessively high testosterone levels do not get a testosterone level anywhere near like you would get in a man. Testosterone does a number of things. It changes the density of muscle fibre and the shape of the pelvis, for example. Another thing that it does is enhance muscle growth. If a person is born a biological male, even though they want to be a female, they cannot escape the fact that by dint of their birth they have substantial physiological advantages over women in most sports—power sports in particular, but a whole range of sports. That is why women's world records in just about any event you mention are much lower than men's world records. Men have all the physiological advantages.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Let me give you an example. Susie O'Neill, when she won the Olympic gold medal in Atlanta in the 100 metres butterfly, did it in a time of two minutes and 9 seconds. The highest ranked Australian male in the same event—I think it was Michael Klim but it may have been Scott Miller—did it in one minute 59 seconds. He was third and there was a 10 second difference. Allowing a person who is a biological male, even though he may feel himself to be a female, to compete in female sporting events gives that person an unfair and unnatural advantage. Most people involved in sport recognise that and have condemned that part of the report that suggests that people who are transgender should be allowed to compete in sport.</para><para>I see Senator O'Brien shaking his head. He is probably under the misapprehension that the report did not say that. The report said that they should be allowed to do it. In fact, the report believed that those provisions of the bill should be applied to sport. Senator Bolkus, were he here, would say that that is not correct because there is a provision that says that a sporting organisation could apply for an exemption. They would have to apply to court for an exemption.</para><para>Senator Bolkus has also said on other instances things which were not correct. For example, he said that they have been auto 
 matically exempted. That is not the case. The sporting body that regulates the sport would have to apply for an exemption and incur considerable legal expense to present their case and they would have to keep on doing it every five years. Sport in this country has never been well funded. Every sporting organisations will tell you that they are hard pressed for cash. Think about all those women's sporting organisations—and women's sport gets less money from sponsorship than men's sport does, and I think that that is  reprehensible—going along every five years to the lawyers to kick in more money to keep applying for exemptions so that women can have a decent chance to compete against women.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5L6</name.id><name role="metadata">FERRIS</name><name role="display">Senator Ferris</name></talker><para>—Sounds like native title.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>EU4</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Chee, Sen Bill</name><name role="display">Senator O'CHEE</name></talker><para>—Senator Ferris, it may create as many opportunities for lawyers as native title does.

We said that we did not believe in discrimination and where there is violence we abhor the violence. We believe that all you have to do—and what has not been done in many circumstances—is to say that where you have a hate-motivated crime of violence the hate should be considered an aggravating circumstance. It should result in a mandatory higher penalty being imposed on the perpetrators. That is how you should deal with all hate-related crimes, be they racial, religious or sexual.</para><para>But we do not agree with the more outrageous provisions of the report and the bill and that is why I still have hundreds of constituents writing to me. If they continue to write to me and if Senator Bartlett continues to take this point of view I might start to send the letters to him so that he can see that there are a lot of people who are very concerned about this. I do not believe the bill deserves a reading in this place, certainly not in the form in which it is at the moment. If it does come up for reading I will certainly be voting against it. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>998</page.no><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name><name.id>SF4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The report that Senator O'Chee talks about is a very important report.

In the recent round of estimates there was certain additional material which I think needs to be put on the record in relation to this matter. On 22 January last year the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy announced a final round of tests designed to confirm the cooking parameters required to enable the safe importation of cooked chicken meat. The minister was in fact forced into undertaking further research by the findings of the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs, this committee, on the risk assessment undertaken by AQIS. The Bureau of Resource Sciences was commissioned by AQIS to supervise the trials and selected the Central Veterinary Laboratory in Weybridge, England. This facility has a very high international reputation with the scientific community and has acknowledged expertise in both Newcastle disease and infectious bursal disease. I understand that the Waybridge facility has access to virulent strains of both these diseases and has high security facilities to enable proper trials to be carried out. I also understand that the protocols for these trials were agreed by the Bureau of Resource Sciences, AQIS, the Weybridge scientists and the Australian industry. So we had arguably the best scientists in the world and we had a process agreed by the BRS and AQIS itself, and cleared by the Australian industry.</para></talk.start><para>The work found that the protocols recommended by AQIS were inadequate for infectious bursal disease. As a result, AQIS commissioned a special scientific working group to evaluate the Weybridge results. The terms of reference stated in part that the group should `advise as to why the results differ from previous heat inactivation trial results on IBDV.' </para><para>This was no ordinary group of scientists; they were the best available. The group was chaired by Dr Gardiner Murray from AQIS and included Dr Bill Geering from the Bureau of Resource Science, Dr Trevor Bagust from the University of Melbourne, Dr Bob Steele from the CSIRO, Jeff Fairbrother and Margaret McKenzie from the industry, and Dr Andrew Turner who is Victoria's chief vet. I understand the group reported to AQIS in early January and advised that the Weybridge tests were soundly based and accurate. The group said the Weybridge results differed from the earlier AQIS work because of the virus strains used and the medium in which the virus was tested; that is, the testing carried out by Weybridge generated different and more appropriate data because it was more relevant to the nature of the product being assessed.</para><para>It appears that, despite this process being accepted by AQIS and despite the fact that this laboratory has an international reputation for its expertise in Newcastle disease and infectious bursal disease, AQIS is now questioning the results of the trials. This approach by AQIS does not augur well for the post-Nairn appropriate risk assessment process; that is, the use of independent panels to undertake controversial assessments.</para><para>I repeat that this work was carried out by arguably the best laboratory in the world in this field. Its results were reviewed by a panel selected and appointed by AQIS, but AQIS apparently is still not prepared to accept these findings. The scientific working group also found that the time temperature regime, I assume constructed by AQIS based on the Weybridge data, is flawed.</para><para>I was advised in estimates by the executive director of AQIS, Mr Paul Hickey, that issues about the construction of the time and temperature parameters were raised by this group. Mr Hickey confirmed that, subject to further input from the Weybridge scientists, the time temperature regime released in November by Minister Anderson was inadequate. The times, it appears, were too short and the cooking temperatures may well be too low. This outcome does little to improve the confidence 
 in the quarantine import risk assessment process.</para><para>This is an outcome that must be of considerable concern not only to the chicken industry but also to those other industries that currently face exposure to imported product if the markets are relaxed or access to our markets is relaxed by determinations by AQIS. They include the salmon industry; the pork industry, which has been the subject of some recent relaxation of controls on the importation of pork products; and the apple and pear industry, on which I note there have been articles in the newspaper about the renewal of the consideration of applications by New Zealand to introduce those products into Australia. I think this is a matter of great concern and this is a matter that will be watched closely by the opposition.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>1000</page.no><name role="metadata">West, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator WEST</name><name.id>1X4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I have just learnt the facts that were discovered at estimates—that AQIS made a mistake.

With what AQIS and the minister responsible have nearly done there is still the potential, unless it is sorted out, to undermine and erode this very important industry to Australia and particularly to New South Wales.</para></talk.start><para>It is essential to remember that the chicken industry is the largest employer in the Hunter Valley. This government has done very little for the Hunter Valley. We have seen the retrenchment of steelworkers and we have seen the impact of their industrial relations upon the mines. But now we see that they are continuing to not care about the Hunter Valley and they are continuing to put at risk the largest employer in that area. You move up the Hunter Valley and up the New England Highway to the Speaker's electorate of New England and there you have another significant chicken industry. That area is a major employer also. The central coast of New South Wales, the north of the Illawarra and the MIA are other significant chicken industry areas in this state. They are significant employers. We know that Bartters in 
 Griffith has just announced plans to employ an extra 1,000 people.</para><para>This is a government that has done nothing for regional development—nothing at all. They gutted the regional development part of their department. They got rid of it. They got it from 230-odd employees down to about six. Now they are not prepared to bite the bullet and say, `We were wrong about what we were going to do. We should not be allowing imports of cooked or other chicken meat into this country because the danger of disease is too great.'</para><para>This government just does not seem to be able to comprehend that AQIS has not been able to get it right. They do not seem to be able to comprehend that a decision needs to be made to give certainty and assurance to this very important industry, and that it needs to be able to continue. The investments need to be able to continue. People like the Bartters at Griffith need to be certain that the current government is not going to allow the importation into this country of diseases that will not only decimate the chicken industry but will also decimate the bird population of this country.</para><para>I think it ill behoves the government to sit here and continue to do nothing. A number of us have been making pleas for some considerable time. We have sat on committees, moved around the state and taken evidence and, if the government does nothing, it will be on their heads that they have chosen to ignore the work of the committee, which has been a bipartisan committee and the findings have been bipartisan. We are now having expert evidence being brought to the estimates committee to indicate that the concerns of the industry which were brought to our attention are correct. I think that it is disgusting. It needs to be remedied and the government has it within its power to do so, instead of going around saying, `Oh, we need new research. We need new evidence.' The evidence is actually there. It actually got Dr Alexander to do specialist work on the specific issues and the specific diseases that they were trying to extrapolate from his original research that would apply to the other organisms.</para><para>The fact that Dr Alexander's work does not prove what AQIS thought was right is significant. It proves there are the dangers, and we cannot afford to see further attacks on rural Australia, particularly rural New South Wales in this particular situation. As I have said, this is a major employer of people in areas of this state. When we are talking about the introduction of any of these diseases, we are talking about the loss of thousands and thousands of jobs, we are talking about the possible safety of people who eat the product, and we are talking about the decimation of the avian population in this country.</para><para>It really concerns me that a number of the green groups have not actually looked at this particular issue and do not seem to be cognisant of the danger to the avian species in this country, to the biodiversity of this country, and to the uniqueness of our avian population. We have a number of birds in this country that are only found here, and it would be absolutely criminal, in an environmental context, to run the risk of destroying that very beautiful and very special unique population that we have. I certainly urge the green groups to start to take an interest in this. This is the sort of devastation of our native fauna that, once it happens, it is too late—it is gone, we will have lost it. We will not have just lost one or two species, we could lose whole genera.</para><para>It is a very sad situation. I think it behoves the government to very speedily make a decision, for a number of very valid and very important reasons that I have outlined here. It is an important issue. There is a major industry in this country that is put under threat. The longer this government goes on not taking into consideration those points, the greater at risk this industry will be. The government must do something quickly and make the announcements so that the industry has certainty and surety and people are sure that their jobs will remain.

The city of New York—the Big Apple as we know it—conjures up all sorts of visions in people's minds. We have seen it on film and we have 
 seen it on television. There is no doubt it evokes quite powerful images for many Australians and, in fact, for many people all over the world.</para></talk.start><para>I think one of the aspects of the city's urban mythology focuses on Central Park. It is known as the lungs of the city and it is probably the focus of the city for many millions of people, both residents and visitors. When I went to New York in 1992, I was warned about Central Park: it was off limits if you went there alone; you should not take a handbag there; you should not visit late in the afternoon; and you certainly should not go near the park after dark—although, of course, it is actually closed to the public after dark. It was certainly seen as an area of particularly high crime and a good deal of violent crime. These days millions of people are using that park for family activities and doing so in quite amazing safety, just a couple of years after it was one of the most dangerous parts of the city.</para><para>This has happened because the police in New York, under the guidance of the Police Commissioner Howard Safir, have taken on the responsibility of making the city and, in particular, the park, safe for families. The police go into the park on foot, on horses, on scooters and on bicycles. They go in uniform and they go in plain clothes. They are everywhere in that park, and that park is now known as an area which is policed to the extent that it is safer now than it was 30 years ago.</para><para>Howard Safir briefed the delegation about the ways in which he has taken on this challenge together with the mayor of New York and how he has made New York one of the safest large cities in the world and certainly in the United States. They have done quite an astonishing job. It is now a pleasure to walk the streets and the parklands of New York. You see small children playing without apparent close supervision, and the streets are noticeably free of panhandlers and beggars, which are things you see in some of the other larger cities in the United States. There has been a 60 per cent decrease in murders in New York and 165 fewer murders just during 
 the last year alone. In fact, it is back to the levels of the late sixties.</para><para>Howard Safir told us about the strategy that he has implemented to bring about this remarkable change. I would like to share it with the Senate tonight. It is a concept known as the broken window strategy. It is based on the idea that taking no action on minor crimes such as graffiti, broken windows, panhandling, bag snatching, and so on, gives a very clear message that the community at large is prepared to tolerate this sort of crime, that it really does not matter all that much. People would think, `Oh well, there is already one broken window, another one will not make much difference at all,' and, `I have seen some graffiti on that building, but it is not too bad, so I will not worry about it.'</para><para>The broken window strategy targets police efforts with the small core of criminals, both hard criminals and petty criminals, who are responsible for the major crime on the streets of New York. This quite fresh approach of what I would call zero tolerance of crime has deterred quite an amazing amount of crime from the streets and parklands of that city. It targets crime before it gets out of hand, before it gets to be big crime and before it gets to be serious, violent crime.</para><para>These efforts to fight the city's crime rate have been a remarkable success. If only we could say the same for Australia. Our cities are a visual disgrace. Graffiti appears on some of our more historic and beautiful buildings. Then there is the bag snatching, the assaults on the elderly, the shoplifting and the house break-ins, and so on. Most of all, there are the assaults on, and even murders of, the very men and women whom we employ in this country to enforce our laws—our police officers.</para><para>Our cities have become a terrifying prospect for people who are alone at night on the footpaths, in the car parks and in the quite beautiful park lands, where as soon as it begins to get dark you cannot go to them. After dark, our cities become dangerous ghost towns. They are run by the lawless, the gangs, the dealers, the pimps and the standover bullies. </para><para>Criminologists have identified the cost of this upsurge in crime. Motor vehicle theft is now costing the Australian community over $1 billion a year. There were 351 murders in Australia in 1995, and 334,000 Australians were victims of assault or threats of violence. Many of them were elderly and many of them were in their own homes at the time. In one year alone 300,000 burglaries had cost us almost $1 billion. What a tragic set of statistics and what a tragedy for Australia.</para><para>Howard Safir, the New York police commissioner, is an impressive man. He is a police commissioner who has accepted and implemented the challenge of returning the city of New York to its people and to the tourists who go there. There is no doubt our police do the very best they are able, but resources and the sheer weight of the bully boys has even daunted them. We saw the terrible evidence of that in Sydney just this past week.</para><para>Our community, the same as the community of New York, wants safer streets, cleaner cities and less dangerous parklands. So do the people of New York, and Howard Safir has delivered it. He has shared his broken window strategy with us, and I would commend that everybody read the document and think about the suggestions that he has made in it.</para></speech></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ADJOURNMENT</title><type>Adjournment</type><page.no>1003</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Hogg)</name></talker><para>—Order!

Over the next few minutes, I wish to discuss a matter which, when you look at the issues in detail, raises a number of questions about the commitment of this government to our regions. In doing so, I will highlight the hypocrisy of the government, who for years have claimed the small business constituency as their own and who went to the last election promising to give small 
 business a bigger slice of the government procurement cake through changes in purchasing policy and practice.</para></talk.start><para>The matter I wish to raise tonight is the decision of the Australian Taxation Office to terminate a contract with a small Tasmanian security firm in favour of a national contract with an international security services provider. Senator Newman should be well aware of this case because, as I understand from the constituents concerned, the firm has forwarded to her all the relevant documents. However, we have not heard anything from Senator Newman, so I intend to take up the matter directly with the Minister for Finance and Administration (Mr Fahey) myself. It is his responsibility to ensure that the government's promise to small business on purchasing policy is delivered.</para><para>I would like to begin by telling the Senate a little bit about the security firm concerned, which is Pelham Security. Pelham Security are a Tasmanian owned and operated company. The directors, Kevin and Gail Pelham, advised me they employ directly and indirectly 75 Tasmanians. It has provided 75 jobs in the state with the nation's highest unemployment rate. I am also advised that all profits from this business are spent in Tasmania.</para><para>Pelham Security have been providing security services to the Australian Taxation Office at their Collins Street offices since 1995. The original contract was for two years, and it was renewed last October for a further 12 months. This all may seem pretty straightforward to most senators, except for the fact that the government has decided to terminate this contract with effect from 31 March—a decision which is all the more outrageous, given that Pelham Security have neither breached, nor been accused of breaching, their contract at any time. Whilst the contract provides for early termination, what is particularly concerning for me is that, for Pelham Security to seek just compensation, in accordance with section 9.1 of their contract, expensive and resource intensive legal action will now be required.</para><para>This now takes me to the substance of my concerns: the failure of the government to understand the connection or nexus between 
 decisions such as these and their inevitable and exponential impact on employment in regional Australia. The issue of costs associated with seeking compensation is an important one for small business. Pelham Security have advised me that, on the basis of this contract, business decisions were taken to increase investment in capital equipment—investment that is critically important to regional Australia; investment that, in turn, delivers the jobs growth that regions require to continue to be viable in social and economic terms.</para><para>The decision to make significant investments is a difficult one for most businesses, but it is particularly difficult for small businesses. A situation where a small business can have its contract cancelled—the carpet pulled out from under them—at any time does not augur well for future investment and employment growth. It is important to remember that, when we look at employment growth, the small to medium business sector is the key contributor.</para><para>So, in a nutshell, what we have here is a government which is gushing in its rhetoric with respect to small business, employment growth and regional development. But it is a government that fails to understand the important role that its expenditure plays in this cycle of development.</para><para>In conclusion, I would like to return to the plight of Pelham Security. It is critical that the government resolve this matter quickly and with minimal inconvenience to Pelham Security and its staff. Quite apart from the fact that this problem should never have occurred in the first place, it is important that the government learn from this case study in small business insensitivity.</para><para>As I mentioned earlier, the contract concerned allows for early termination, but it does so in conjunction with clause 9.2, which allows for `fair and reasonable compensation'. I urge the government to abide by this clause, and to do so swiftly. I also urge the government to move beyond rhetoric and deliver on its commitment to give small business a fair go—and to particularly sort the situation out with regard to Pelham Security. If it fails to do so, it will—as far as Mr Pelham, his security firm and myself are concerned— 
continue to demonstrate its complete contempt for regional Australia.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Film Industry</title><page.no>1004</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>1004</page.no><name role="metadata">Payne, Sen Marise</name><name role="display">Senator PAYNE</name><name.id>M56</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This evening I rise to bring to the attention of the Senate some of what I believe is the very good news in the Australian film industry and arts community, in particular. I think even we allegedly out of touch parliamentarians manage to recognise that Australia has a thriving film industry.</para></talk.start><para>In the last two years we have had several top Australian films competing at the Cannes film festival. In 1996 we were represented by the <inline font-style="italic">Quiet Room</inline>, <inline font-style="italic">Love Serenade</inline>, and <inline font-style="italic">No Way to Forget</inline>; and two short films, <inline font-style="italic">My Film is a Dog</inline>, and <inline font-style="italic">Noir</inline>. Again in May of last year, <inline font-style="italic">The Well</inline> and the short film <inline font-style="italic">Final Cut</inline> were featured at Cannes, while many films were launched there, including <inline font-style="italic">Blackrock</inline>, <inline font-style="italic">Doing Time for Patsy Cline</inline>, <inline font-style="italic">Kiss or Kill</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Thank God He Met Lizzie</inline>. The next few weeks will see the launch of the second film of <inline font-style="italic">Children of the Revolution</inline> director and university contemporary of mine, Peter Duncan—<inline font-style="italic">A Little Bit of Soul</inline>.</para><para>There are many Australian films in the international market which reflect the exciting range of skill and talent in our film industry. Many of our film makers and actors have now established outstanding international reputations, and a growing number of Australian productions are earning valuable export income for this country in a hugely competitive industry.	I think it is worth noting that women, in particular, in the Australian film industry have been very successful in leading the way in recent years. At the highly commercial end of proceedings, Australia has seen the success of Mel Gibson at the 1996 Academy Awards with <inline font-style="italic">Braveheart</inline> winning the best film and best director; and also, of course, the highly popular <inline font-style="italic">Babe</inline>—which was filmed in my family's local area, the Southern Highlands—being awarded an Oscar for best visual effects.</para><para>It is a sign of the growing successes of our film industry that last year Australian films and film makers received more Academy Award nominations than ever before in the 
 history of our participation in the industry. The crowning glory for many in 1997 was, no doubt, Geoffrey Rush's achievements in <inline font-style="italic">Shine</inline>, emerging from both the Academy Awards and the Golden Globe awards with the Best Actor award. I note that Geoffrey Rush is also a star of <inline font-style="italic">A Little Bit of Soul</inline>. John Seale was also awarded an Oscar for cinematography in <inline font-style="italic">The English Patient</inline>.</para><para>In December last year, the Australian film <inline font-style="italic">Road to Nhill</inline> won the Best Film category at the Sebrika Film Festival in Greece, following on from our own AFI award night where <inline font-style="italic">Kiss or Kill</inline> scooped the pool. Australia had four `road' movies which particularly featured in last year's AFI awards—and they could have been stories from any corner of the globe. But critics recognise that why they stand out is because of a boldness of vision, at times an almost feral quality, and a confidence in telling the stories that rejects gimmicks and studio compromises. This underscores the reality that our film industry is, by its nature, very independent. Our contemporary films consistently display richness and diversity, great self-confidence, and industry depth.</para><para>The knowledge that our film makers can take a risk, can be true to their original vision, means that passions are not left in the bottom drawer for want of money. Coming from Sydney as I do, aircraft noise is often a major issue on our front pages—but the film <inline font-style="italic">The Castle</inline>, financed largely by the <inline font-style="italic">Frontline</inline> team, was brought to international prominence on front pages in that it was made in only six weeks, for $700,000, and grossed $10.3 million at the box office. It also picked up a 1997 AFI award for best original screenplay.</para><para>Industry investors such as producers, distributors, exhibitors and broadcasters are increasingly sharing the faith, and I think the passion, of the industry. According to the Australian Film Commission, investment by these players rose significantly as a proportion of budgets in 1996-97. This is an important sign that we have an industry that can attract increased revenue from domestic and export sales. One must also recognise the role of the Film Finance Corporation in facilitating increasing levels of industry investment.</para><para>Our film and television industry is a powerhouse. Indeed, in the last 12 months it has gone from strength to strength, and there is no doubt that the Australian film and television industry currently enjoys great international recognition. Australians are being sought for their skills in every field of film making—from editing to cinematography to the brave new world of multimedia.</para><para>While international recognition is important, and in fact crucial, we must never lose sight of the importance of the industry to Australia, especially to our future on both cultural and economic fronts. We all know how much pride we take in seeing our nation celebrated at film festivals around the globe. We like to read of high praise for our actors, like <inline font-style="italic">LA Confidential</inline> stars Russell Crowe and Guy Pearce in Hollywood; and see script writers like Laura Jones in so much demand overseas. We do have something unique to offer. The world knows it and wants it.</para><para>Last year a Roy Morgan poll found that 88 per cent of Australians believe the Australian film industry is important in raising both the general image of Australia and awareness of our country overseas. More importantly, the poll also found that 75 per cent of Australians believe that films produced by our film industry are equal to, if not better than, those made overseas. So faith in the industry and the arts world is solid at home.</para><para>But it is not an overnight success; it comes from years and years of creative toil. Australia, many would say, is approaching its finest hour in terms of international profile at least. Our foray into the next millennium will be a very public one, as the world's eyes focus on Sydney during the 2000 Olympics and later our centenary of federation celebrations. It is during times of national reflection such as the centenary of federation that we will appreciate more than ever the role film plays in capturing key moments in a nation's life.</para><para>I well remember the film showed earlier this year at the beginning of the women's constitutional convention—a film about federation, which at the time was intended to depict the process of federation itself but was shown at the women's constitutional convention to show the involvement of women in the 
 process. It was a very telling and a very interesting reflection on that period.</para><para>Our ability to critically analyse our history is enhanced by the preservation of the work of previous generations of film and television creators. Clearly, the National Film and Sound Archive and Film Australia are key players as we celebrate the turn of the century and, in particular, the documentary will prove to be an ideal vehicle for telling our stories. But the reality is that the social documentary is the least commercially viable but one of the most culturally relevant film genres. Ongoing market failure and occasionally lack of government support could have meant that programs such as <inline font-style="italic">Rats in the Ranks</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">The Year of the Dogs</inline> might not have been made. For either football or political followers, we would have been the poorer.</para><para>The government wants as many Australians as possible to enjoy the insights, reflections and often unique perspectives that the documentary provides. To this end, the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts (Senator Alston) announced in November last year, as part of the government's response to the Gonski report, that we will continue Film Australia's national interest program at current levels of $6.4 million per annum from 1999-00 to 2002-03.</para><para>Film Australia is the jewel in the documentary crown, through not only the management of the national interest program but the marketing and the distribution it undertakes on behalf of other producers; its archives, described often as Australia's photo album of more than 80 years of film making; and its Lindfield site.</para><para>I am also actively pursuing the question of continued funding of SBSI, the production arm of SBS. SBSI is in the rare position of being a government funded production arm looking for a specific network and audience. Because it is audience and topic specific, as well as dedicated to broadening the base of storytelling on our screens, its programs often find a much wider audience.</para><para>Our industry infrastructure, while still being finetuned, is working well enough to attract international production to our shores. The government recognises the capacity of that 
 production undertaken in Australia to assist local industry through skills development and employment, particularly of technical crews.</para><para>We are working towards achieving a mature, dynamic and sustainable film industry. To this end, we initiated the Gonski inquiry, which investigated the operations of the film industry in Australia. The report called for new measures to increase private investment while retaining direct funding as a principal mechanism of government assistance, refinement of current Commonwealth film agencies' functions and a changed role for Film Australia.</para><para>The report was responded to last November. The details of that response are well known, but I do want to stress its main points, including the retention of Film Australia as Commonwealth owned—a vertically integrated company—and retention of their Lindfield facilities; retention of Film Australia's archives; extension of their national interest program until 2003; and the introduction of a new pilot scheme—the film licensed investment scheme—providing a 100 tax concession to investors in companies which are licensed to invest in a slate of film and television productions. This will raise concessional capital of up to $20 million a year for two years from 1998-99.</para><para>The Gonski model offers an innovative approach to balancing the needs of government for efficiency and accountability with the needs of investors for incentives to invest in Australian film and television. Any opportunities to increase the efficiency of support to industry should be pursued. The FLIC model offers a number of advantages in this regard, in particular in terms of transparency, accountability and certainty of funding.</para><para>Our response to the report was well received as a whole. This is as a reflection of the government's approach to the arts community and as we see the role of government not to dictate or impose cultural norms but to create an environment which fosters—<inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Mr Edgar Williams</title><title>Mr Maurie Rudd</title><page.no>1007</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>1007</page.no><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name><name.id>656</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Tonight I rise to say a few words about the passing of two great figures of the trade union movement. The first person whom I wish to refer to is Edgar Williams, who passed away in December last year. Edgar was a renowned figure in the Australian trade union movement, particularly the Australian Workers Union, and the Australian Labor Party.</para></talk.start><para>My colleague Senator John Hogg made a most moving and eloquent speech yesterday in which he recorded the achievements of Edgar. I compliment John on his remarks. John, like me, had the great pleasure of knowing Edgar for many years. I certainly endorse Senator Hogg's remarks yesterday, but I just want to add a few of my own.</para><para>I first met Edgar Williams in 1976, when I commenced employment with the Australian Workers Union as a junior industrial officer. I was pretty green but I learned quickly, as you have to in the world of trade unions and industrial relations. You often find that there are more jobs to be done and causes to fight than you have time for.</para><para>Edgar Williams was an inspiration to me, as he was indeed to all the officials of the Australian Workers Union for well over 40 years. When I met him, he was the federal president of the AWU and the AWU's representative on the ACTU executive. I attended annual conventions each year after that at which Edgar presided as the federal president of the union, up until his retirement in 1982.</para><para>One of Edgar's great strengths was his ability as chairman of the AWU's conventions. As I am sure honourable senators would be aware—if they have not heard it or read about it, they could certainly imagine—conventions of the AWU, given the long history of that union, were often very interesting and very fiery occasions. But Edgar had this incredible ability to earn the respect and the admiration of all of the delegates at those conventions, whether they supported him or opposed him. This was so much so that I think Clyde Cameron carried on for many 
 years a struggle in the union against Edgar. Even when Clyde entered this parliament, he carried it on. He, nevertheless, I am sure, would pay tribute to Edgar's strength of character, strength of purpose, and dedication to working men and women.</para><para>Edgar was honoured with life membership of the AWU, with life membership of the Australian Labor Party and as one of the great figures of the Australian trade union movement. I, as I said, learnt much from Edgar and I certainly pay tribute to his lifelong dedication to his union, the AWU, and to its members.</para><para>I also want to record the passing of and make some comments about another great trade union official who was very much like Edgar, and that was Maurie Rudd. Maurie Rudd was an official of the Federated Ironworkers Association, which in 1993 amalgamated with the AWU. When Maurie passed away on 7 February this year, he also was an official of the AWU. I think it is probably best if I quote from an article that appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> written by a lifelong friend of Maurie Rudd's, because it sets out far better than I can Maurie's achievements. It states:</para><para>Maurie Rudd was born in Goulburn, NSW, in 1942, the son of a working-class rural family with strong labour-movement links.</para><para>He left school at an early age and was largely self-taught, being an avid reader. He held many jobs, mainly unskilled; he was working in a shearing shed when he first became a member of the AWU.</para><para>The similarities with Edgar are very relevant there. It goes on to say:</para><para>He became a beltman's assistant in the sinter plant at BHP Newcastle steelworks in July 1970. It was a hard and dirty job. He said he took it because it involved so much overtime and he needed the money for his family. In his time there he saw four men killed at work. The need for safety on the job and improved working conditions and wages were the motivating factors in his becoming a steelworkers' delegate. In June 1985, he became an acting organiser of the Federated Ironworkers Association. Later that year he became a national organiser, was elected as a branch organiser and then became acting assistant secretary.  
</para><para>He was elected branch secretary in 1989, a position he held until his death.</para><para>Like Edgar, Maurie had the opportunities to become a member of parliament and accept higher offices. But Maurie, like Edgar, spurned those opportunities and spent his entire life working in the trade union movement for his fellow working men. He also was active in the Australian Labor Party and played a notable role in that regard, particularly in the Newcastle region.</para><para>The sad part about Maurie Rudd, but nevertheless it is something that demonstrates his strength of character, relates to the fact that, when BHP announced last year that it would close the Newcastle steelworks, Maurie was once again called to action. He took up the challenge and led the campaign by the workers at BHP in Newcastle and the citizens of Newcastle to face that shock announcement by BHP. It came very much like an earthquake to Newcastle. He led delegations down here to Canberra to lobby the Prime Minister and other politicians to do something on behalf of Newcastle so that we would not see that great industrial city die.</para><para>But, whilst he was doing that, whilst he was spending 24 hours a day seeking to represent his members and the people of Newcastle, he was dying of lung cancer and was receiving chemotherapy treatment. He carried on throughout that campaign, notwithstanding the great illness that he was suffering. I know that the workers of Newcastle and the members of his union are proud of his dedication and his work on their behalf in that dispute.</para><para>Both Edgar Williams and Maurie Rudd were big men in size. They were big in heart and they made big achievements throughout their working lives. They were big Australians. I think it is appropriate that we record in this parliament their achievements on behalf of their fellow working men and women.</para><para>Whilst I note that quite often members of the coalition take great delight in attacking the trade union movement and trade union leaders, I would ask, in closing, that maybe they pause a while and read and examine the stories of people like Edgar Williams and Maurie Rudd—people who started their lives in poverty or in hard times; who saw that 
 there was a need to represent workers and did so; and who also strongly believed in democratic trade unionism, something which ultimately is a protection for all citizens whether they be trade union officials or not. As I have said before, when tyranny raises its head, it is very often the trade union movement, along with the churches, that are first attacked and silenced. People like Edgar Williams and Maurie Rudd were great Australians who achieved much for their fellow Australians. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Senator Bolkus</title><page.no>1008</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>1008</page.no><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator ABETZ</name><name.id>N26</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Yesterday, the Senate passed an historic censure of a shadow minister—the shadow Attorney-General, Senator Bolkus. The censure was based on Senator Bolkus knowingly and deliberately revealing to members of the media the contents of a confidential Federal Court document, putting at risk the taxpayer-funded pursuit of Mr Skase's assets. This action is in breach of any code of acceptable conduct. The shadow Attorney-General—the would-be first law officer of this country—deliberately and knowingly revealed sensitive information from a confidential court document.</para></talk.start><para>In the unlikely event that Labor wins the next election, we now know the standards Mr Beazley will set for his ministry. If Senator Bolkus were to become Attorney-General, he would deal with confidential and sensitive matters every day. Indeed, he would have carriage of the Skase matter as Attorney-General. He would thereby become privy to the actions being taken against Mr Skase. And what would he do? If he saw a short-sighted political benefit in revealing certain information, Senator Bolkus, by his actions, has revealed he would have no compunction about revealing it to the media. And Mr Beazley, by allowing Senator Bolkus to remain in the Attorney-General portfolio, is also saying that he would condone such behaviour.</para><para>This lack of commitment to any standards by Mr Beazley has exposed Mr Beazley's weakness as leader which, in itself, is another issue of standards aside from the scurrilous activities of the rusty pipe opposite. It is in 
 that light that Labor's attack on the Minister for Resources and Energy has been so duplicitous. It is also in that light that I express my regret that the media has seen fit to publicise and peddle the Labor-orchestrated campaign against the minister for resources and largely remain silent in relation to the overwhelming vote of censure against a shadow minister for his unacceptable conduct, his failure to resign and his failure to be sacked.</para><para>These are matters of genuine public interest. The public do have a right to know and the media has failed in its duty. In saying that the media failed, I trust this silence was not to protect a person who has gained an unenviable record around this place for giving unauthorised information to the media. As one member of the media is reputed to have said, `We won't bite the hand that feeds us.' That type of cynicism is regrettable and, I trust, is not widespread, let alone the reason for this strange silence.</para><para>I ask my friends in the media to look through their records and then their consciences, and see how much coverage they gave to the Senate's vote of condemnation—not censure—of a Liberal opposition backbencher three years ago for his inadvertent—and I stress inadvertent—disclosure of a tax file number—something he did, might I add, by leave granted to him by a Labor senator. Or they might search their records and then their consciences as to their actions when a Liberal frontbencher in opposition unwittingly divulged confidential information in the Hindmarsh Island matter.</para><para>Yesterday's vote was not only historic in itself; it was an overwhelming vote of censure for the unparalleled and unprincipled release of confidential court documents by the alternate Attorney-General. This breach of standards, on any objective analysis, was worthy of at least equal to, if not greater than, time and space in the media as the scurrilous accusations being made against the minister for resources.

 and incorporate into <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>  an anomaly, as I see it, within the diesel fuel rebate scheme. There was at first a tax on petrol in 1929 that had nothing to do with the Depression but certainly did not assist it. The first diesel fuel tax was imposed in 1957, and it was imposed as a measure against road-using vehicles only. It was never intended for that to be used for any vehicles or engines or other mode of consumption of diesel off road. It was always envisaged that mining, agriculture, forestry and the fishing industries would be exempted. Without that exemption, some businesses would surely close and would close in the immediate and medium term.</para></talk.start><para>The survivors would endure some hardship—and there is no argument against that. Australia would experience a significant short-term drop in income, plus a diminution of expenditure outlays. Australian shares and stocks would certainly drop. Future exploration, on which this country so vitally depends for its standard of living, would be inhibited, and low-grade mining ventures would also close or at least be curtailed. Certainly, we would lose overseas markets and an imposition of excise would, by all reasonable economic measures, be revenue neutral in those cases.</para><para>Western Australia is the biggest per capita user or consumer of diesel and heavy fuel in the nation. It is, paradoxically, the biggest producer now of petroleum and petroleum and gas products. National export income totals about 30 per cent from Western Australia. So that ties the economy of Australia in very real terms to the health of Western Australia.</para><para>Western Australia is by far the biggest mining state in the nation. It happens to have within its boundaries the biggest diamond mine in the world, mining some 38 million carats in the last complete fiscal year. It mines 80 per cent of Australia's gold. It has the biggest iron ore mines in the world. It is the biggest producer and exporter of alumina powder in the world. It produces more heavy mineral sands, particularly ilmenite, from which it produces synthetic rutile, in the world.</para><para>If we recognise that, we must surely recognise that other aspects of mining in Western 
 Australia are very important to the mining industry. I speak specifically of the mining of limestone in Western Australia. Limestone throughout Australia is a fundamental part of mining and a fundamental part of the steel and building industry. Some of the producers of limestone in Australia are Swan Portland Cement Ltd, Adelaide Brighton Cement Ltd, Blue Circle Southern Cement Ltd, Lime Industries Pty Ltd, David Mitchell (NSW) Pty Ltd, Cockburn Cement Ltd, Pacific Lime, Northern Cement Ltd, BHP Steel, Queensland Cement, Amalg Resources of Kalgoorlie and Westlime (WA) Ltd.</para><para>Limestone, regrettably, initially did not attract the diesel fuel rebate. An appeal was made to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and it found, not illogically, that the mining of limestone was, in fact, mining, and they reinstated the diesel fuel rebate to the limestone miners. However, with bureaucracy gone mad, I believe, in this instance, the Australian Customs Service has now appealed that decision and the limestone producers in Australia are now awaiting the outcome of that decision. Justice, it would seem, is not quick and is certainly not cheap. I do not want to take the issue too far but I do appreciate the time and the forum of this chamber to bring it to the attention of members here—those members who are diehard and left here. I appreciate the three who are in the chamber tonight.</para><para>In the few minutes left, I wish to give an example of two areas that I believe are wrong. The mining of marble in Australia is considered to be mining, yet marble is predominantly, if not exclusively, calcium carbonate. Limestone is calcium carbonate, yet the Australian Customs Service, which I think is an anomaly—the last word is anyway—has said that it is not; it is an extractive industry. Extractive industries in the United Kingdom, for instance, are classified as miners or miners are classified in the United Kingdom exclusively as extractive industries. Why there should be a distinction drawn between the mining of marble and the mining of its cousin, its very close relation, limestone, I do not know, but I would be very interested to find out. </para><para>Dampier Salt is also in Western Australia. At the risk of bragging once again, it is the biggest solar operation in the southern hemisphere. Although it harvests the salt, Dampier Salt is subject to the diesel fuel rebate scheme. It is not a tax that they should pay. It was never imposed and never meant to be a tax and it should not be seen as such. But Dampier Salt is allowed to windrow its sodium chloride. It is allowed to pick up the sodium chloride in mechanical harvesters, load it on to trucks and take it to a stockpile where it dries out, because it is quite wet. That part of the operation is subject to the rebate. But once the stockpile is taken from the same mining lease to the wharf for export, that is not subject to the diesel fuel rebate.</para><para>These are some areas in our mining industry on which this country depends for its standard of living, for its wealth, for its value added and for its employment. We should look to enhance that, not to inhibit it. Any tax on the mining industry is a tax on exports. That is something that I find convoluted and not in the best interests of Australia.</para><para>Thirty per cent of diesel is used on roads but 70 per cent is used off roads in the mining industry, the farming industry and the fishing industry, et cetera. We should make this uniform within the mining industry. I believe it is an anomaly to attempt to exclude the limestone extractors. I appreciate having the time to draw this to the Senate's attention. I trust that those people who are responsible for the Australian Customs Service will let a little logic apply and consider the mining of limestone mining.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>FY5</name.id><name role="metadata">DENMAN</name><name role="display">Senator Denman</name></talker><para>—Madam Acting Deputy President, I just ask for a point of clarification.

Principal Committee of the National Health and Medical Research Council. The Expert Committee was established by the SRDC to oversee all aspects of the research process. The SRDC, at its meeting in July 1997, selected two SRDC members to co-Chair the EME Expert Committee.</para><para>The first step in the nomination process for the Expert Committee was to determine health and professional fields relevant to the issues identified in the document developed by the Committee on Electromagnetic Energy Public Health Issues titled "Strategy for an Australian research program into possible health issues associated with exposure to 
 communications radiofrequencies".

Meetings to date have been held in October and December 1997, with a further meeting anticipated around May/June 1998.</para><para>(5) The NHMRC has well established conflict of interest guidelines for a range of situations. These include a requirement for "Disclosure of interests" section 29 (1-5) of the NHMRC Act 1992. In addition, each Committee develops its own, more specific guidelines designed to optimise the range and level of expert advice while removing influences from conflicts of interest in committee members. For example, these principles may include that—no scientific collaborator or departmental colleague of an applicant is called upon to assess a grant application.</para><para>The SRDC has developed conflict of interest guidelines for the NHMRC EME Expert Committee. The guidelines apply to all members of the NHRMC EME Expert Committee. All members have declared their actual or potential conflicts of interest. This is an ongoing requirement for the term of the membership. An excerpt of the EME procedures regarding conflict of interest follows:</para><para>-	 In the case of direct pecuniary interest, members may not take part in any decision to which the potential conflict of direct pecuniary interest applies, and must physically absent themselves from all or any part of a formal meeting or other discussion at which the matter in question is being discussed.</para><para>-	 Where there is a potential indirect pecuniary or non-pecuniary interest, the Chair of the 
 Expert Committee, in consultation with the other uninvolved members of the Expert Committee, will determine the extent to which a member may be involved in the discussion or decision concerning the matter involving the potential conflict of interest.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Australian Grand Prix: Tobacco Advertising</title><page.no>1013</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 1067)</subtitle><id.no>1067</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>1013</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator Allison</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Family Services, upon notice, on 9 February 1998:</para></talk.start><para>With reference to the report in the Age on 28 June 1997 that the Federal Government would continue to exempt the Melbourne Formula One Grand Prix from section 18 of the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act 1992:</para><para>(1) Was this an accurate report of the Government's intention; if so, was the Government at that time satisfied that failure to specify the event would be likely to result in the event not being held in Australia.</para><para>(2) (a) On what date was an application made to the Federal Government by the Australian Grand Prix Corporation for an exemption from section 18 of the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act 1992 for the purposes of the proposed event in March 1988; and (b) can a copy of the application be made available.</para><para>(3) (a) When will the exemption be granted; (b) what conditions will apply to the exemption and can a copy be made available; (c) will tobacco companies be permitted to use the image of a kangaroo in their advertising at this event; (d) on what basis exactly was the Minister's opinion formed that the event would be lost; (e) whose views were canvassed in forming that opinion; and (f) can copies be provided of relevant material in forming this opinion.</para><para>(4) Is the Minister aware that Oxford University will be sponsoring a team in the British Silverstone Grand Prix in place of tobacco advertising.</para><para>(5) (a) What evidence is there that alternatives to tobacco advertising revenue are not also available in Australia; and (b) can such evidence by provided.</para><para>(6) Is the Minister aware that Belgium has, in the past 12 months, refused to allow tobacco advertising at its Grand Prix.</para><para>(7) Has the Government acquainted itself with the latest status of tobacco advertising permissible at such events in other countries; if so, can the data be made available.</para><para>(8) Has the Government collected data on the conditions set by other countries which permit to
