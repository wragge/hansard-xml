 Australian economy and a fairer Australian society.</para><para>They are priorities which provide incentives for individuals and enterprises to succeed within a framework of a strategic but limited role for government.</para><para>They are priorities centred on stronger families, stronger workplaces and stronger communities.</para><para>The government's priorities balance fairness and incentive—promoting innovation, choice, opportunity and competition at the same time as ensuring compassion and care for those in genuine need.</para><para>They are priorities which maximise the potential of Australia's position at a unique intersection of history, geography, economic opportunity and cultural diversity.</para><para>They are priorities clearly focused on delivering practical and beneficial outcomes for all Australians.</para><para>Above all, the government is committed to implementing the priorities for its second term on the basis of its unequivocal commitment to the Australian values of decency, openness, tolerance and a fair go for all.</para><para>Economic challenges</para><para>The government is committed to enhancing our national economic performance and providing a policy framework in which more jobs are created and the living standards of Australians are improved.</para><para>The government's sound economic policies have been crucial in minimising the impact of the Asian financial crisis.</para><para>The Australian economy has continued to grow rapidly in the last 12 months despite the financial turmoil in our region and the slide into recession that has been experienced by many of our major trading partners.</para><para>The Australian economy is forecast to remain one of the best performing in our region, and is expected to grow faster than most of the world's major advanced economies over the next two years.</para><para>The financial turmoil that initially affected a number of Asian economies has spread more widely in recent months. It directly affects Australia's interests. That is why the 
 government has been an active participant in international efforts to contain the crisis, minimise its impact, and provide support for countries in our region afflicted by it. The government will pursue these objectives in APEC and other international forums to advance Australia's broad national interests.</para><para>Australia's interests are also affected by the recent high level of instability in international financial markets. The government has therefore assumed, and will continue to assume, an active role in efforts to reform and strengthen the international financial system.</para><para>To ensure the best possible input from both the public and private sectors on what is a vital national interest for Australia and the greatest economic challenge facing the international community, the government has established a task force on international financial issues which combines the expertise of senior public and private sector representatives. It will report by the end of 1998.</para><para>The stability of the Australian financial system is testimony to the underlying strength of our economy and the world-class reforms to the financial system introduced by the government in its previous term.</para><para>The government will continue to actively develop and promote Australia as a regional financial centre. The demonstrated stability of our financial system and the incentives created by the government's new tax system will be important factors in achieving that objective.</para><para>A new tax system</para><para>The government has made it clear that reform of Australia's taxation system is the single most important item of unfinished business in building an economic infrastructure that will enable Australia to compete and prosper in an increasingly competitive world economy.</para><para>The government has strengthened Australia's economic foundations and enhanced our international competitiveness through a policy framework that has delivered sound fiscal management, low interest rates, low inflation, effective workplace relations reforms and high levels of business investment. </para><para>Tax reform will build on, and complement, these achievements.</para><para>The government went to the Australian people in the last election with a plan for a new tax system that will provide the basis for stronger, more sustainable economic growth, higher productivity, more jobs and higher living standards.</para><para>The government will move quickly to put its bold new plan in place.</para><para>The new tax system will dramatically reduce the taxation burden on Australians. It will slash business costs, thereby creating scope for more jobs growth. It will reduce fuel excise by around $3.5 billion a year. It will ensure that tax cheats and tax avoiders pay their fair share of taxation by reducing opportunities to operate in the cash economy. It will improve incentives to work and save. And it will be simple and transparent.</para><para>Under the government's new tax system there will be:</para><para>	 personal income tax cuts totalling over $13 billion from July 2000;</para><para>	 cuts in income tax rates for about 95 per cent of all individual taxpayers so that around 81 per cent of all taxpayers will face a marginal tax rate of no more than 30 per cent, compared with only 30 per cent of taxpayers now;</para><para>	 reductions in business costs of over $10 billion a year, and in particular reductions of $4.5 billion a year in the costs facing Australian exporters;</para><para>	 a $2 billion family package, including a simplification of the assistance provided to families to make it easier for them to understand and access their entitlements;</para><para>	abolition of provisional tax; and</para><para>	 an up front increase in income support payments so that the aged and other pensioners are more than compensated for the price impact of tax reform.</para><para>The government's new tax system will modernise the financial basis of Australia's federal system as it prepares to enter its second century. The states and territories will receive all of the GST revenue to replace the most burdensome and inefficient state and 
 federal taxes, as well as the existing Financial Assistance Grants. As a result, the states and territories will have a secure and growing source of revenue to fund essential public services in the future.</para><para>The end result of the government's reform plan will be a world class taxation system which delivers fair and equitable outcomes for all Australians, and which enhances Australia's economic prospects into the next century.</para><para>Reform in a community context</para><para>While the government is determined to maintain the impetus of economic reform to expand Australia's opportunities in an increasingly competitive world, it will continue to be sensitive to community concern, particularly in regional Australia, about the impact and pace of change. It fully recognises the need to ensure that the benefits of reform are fairly shared and that adjustment costs are taken into account in framing policies. </para><para>Reforms are not ends in themselves. The government's commitment to strategic objectives such as a more productive economy, more effective markets, greater competitiveness and fiscal responsibility is a means to achieving faster jobs growth, more opportunities, rising living standards and a more competitive and dynamic Australia. This commitment is underpinned by the government's strong support for a fair and decent society, including an effective social safety net.</para><para>Jobs and the workplace</para><para>The government will maintain its efforts to generate strong and sustained jobs growth through sound economic policies and fiscal management, workplace relations reforms, and initiatives to support small business and strengthen the competitiveness of Australian businesses generally.</para><para>The creation of the Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business portfolio emphasises the importance of the right workplace relations framework and a dynamic small business sector in securing future jobs growth.</para><para>The Workplace Relations Act will be amended to include the promotion of youth employment as one of its objectives, and 
 provide for junior wage rates on a continuing basis to protect youth employment.</para><para>Legislation to reduce the burden of unfair dismissal laws, including the exemption of small businesses from the unfair dismissal provisions of the Workplace Relations Act, will be introduced in the parliament at the earliest opportunity.</para><para>The government's workplace relations reforms will continue to build on the principles of a direct and simplified relationship between employers and employees, a fair go for all, and genuine freedom of association. </para><para>The government will also continue to pursue a better system of delivering job services for all Australians. The provision of assistance for the long-term unemployed will remain a priority along with ensuring appropriate assistance for young people, indigenous people and people in rural and regional areas.</para><para>The Job Network is an important and successful initiative, focused on performance and results, for helping disadvantaged unemployed people to compete effectively for jobs. It will continue to be developed to achieve better outcomes for job seekers.</para><para>Measures to remove barriers to self-support and create work incentives through the income support and tax systems will be implemented. The government will build on the success of its mutual obligation programs including an expansion of the Work for the Dole program. Ensuring that young people remain connected to the community and develop job skills continues to be a key priority for the government.</para><para>Our future generation</para><para>Education and training are fundamental to achieving our vision for Australia in the twenty-first century. Skills and knowledge of the highest order are essential to maximise job opportunities for Australians in the future and to underpin innovation, technology and competitiveness in Australian enterprises as they compete in the global economy.</para><para>The government will work to ensure that all young people, whatever their career aspirations, will have access to a strong basic educational grounding and a quality pathway 
 from school to further training and employment.</para><para>The government will provide additional resources to improve literacy and numeracy standards in all schools and to boost the National Asian Languages Program. It will upgrade funding for schools within the Catholic education system to address identified cost pressures. Furthermore, the government will</para><para>support a Quality Teacher Program to improve teachers' skills and lift the status of teaching in schools.</para><para>The government will build on the reinvigoration of the traineeship and apprenticeship system achieved during its first term by boosting new apprenticeships in rural and regional small businesses.</para><para>Higher education policy will focus on expanding access and improving the quality of teaching and research.</para><para>Families and the community</para><para>Families will again be a key priority for the government in its new term. This is particularly reflected in the $2 billion package of enhanced family measures in the government's new tax system.</para><para>The government is committed to increasing opportunities for families to build on and strengthen their own resources and networks of support. The new Family and Community Services portfolio, by drawing together—for the first time—the many different programs of assistance provided to families, will play an important role in achieving this outcome.</para><para>The new portfolio recognises the central role of families within communities and will assist in developing partnerships between communities, community organisations, business and governments to tackle problems identified at the local level and to strengthen networks of support within communities.</para><para>Helping families under pressure before they reach the point of crisis is important for the quality of life of families, and for avoiding the consequential costs of family breakdown including youth homelessness, drug addiction, suicide and crime.</para><para>In its second term, the government will maintain its momentum on the fight against 
 illicit drugs, and will continue to implement its Tough on Drugs initiatives which attack the demand for drugs through education, rehabilitation and active community involvement. These efforts will be backed up with great vigour by effective law enforcement measures to reduce the supply of illicit drugs.</para><para>The government will build on its achievements for women, with special focus on opportunities for economic independence. It will work to assist women re-entering the work force after a break for parenting or caring responsibilities, and address the health needs of women, including those in rural and remote areas.</para><para>1999 is the International Year of Older Persons. This will heighten recognition of the enormous contribution older Australians make to the community and the economy. Through the National Strategy for an Ageing Australia, the government will continue to consult the community about the policies and programs which will help older Australians to meet their needs into the next century. The government has made important reforms to ensure the long-term sustainability of aged care services and to improve choice and access to services, including allowing people wherever possible to be cared for at home if they wish. Where residential care is the best option, the government will ensure it is affordable and of a high quality.</para><para>The government will continue to strengthen the security of veterans and war widows by heightening recognition of their service and improving health and financial assistance. The commemoration program will be boosted to ensure that veterans' courage and sacrifice are honoured and that our proud history is celebrated.</para><para>Health</para><para>The government will work to improve the health and medical care of all Australians under the Medicare framework.</para><para>The government is committed to a balanced health system, and to strengthening both the public and private sectors. It is moving quickly to promote the role of private health insurance with the introduction of a 30 per cent rebate on insurance contributions as part 
 of its tax reform package. This initiative—designed to take effect in just over seven weeks on 1 January 1999—will be supported by measures to help funds to keep costs and premiums down, while offering a broader and more attractive range of products to private health insurance clients.</para><para>The government will work with the states and territories under the new Australian Health Care Agreements to continue to improve the efficiency and quality of services in public hospitals. A major focus will be to ensure that Australians living in rural and remote areas have access to high quality health services.</para><para>Addressing the huge disparity in the health of our indigenous people will continue to be a priority for the government. Indigenous people need to be able to access good local primary health care services at a level more commensurate with their high level of health need.</para><para>Regional Australia</para><para>The government is strongly committed to rural and regional Australia, and recognises the hardships which country people have endured in recent times. The new ministry now has a Transport and Regional Services portfolio, headed by a senior cabinet minister, to focus specifically on the needs and concerns of country Australia.</para><para>The government's new tax system will contain significant boosts for regional and rural Australia, particularly through the $3.5 billion per year reduction in the cost of fuel.</para><para>The government will help strengthen the economic and social fabric of rural and regional areas. Priority will be given to establishing Rural Transaction Centres in smaller rural towns as a means of restoring access to services lost over more than a decade. An injection of funding for road, rail, telecommunications and environmental infrastructure, and for flood mitigation, will also deliver substantial benefits to regional Australia.</para><para>Transport and industry policy</para><para>An efficient and integrated transport sector is vital to underpinning economic growth, creating investment and export opportunities, 
 and providing services to people in both urban and regional Australia. The significant reduction in the cost of fuel to all businesses provided under the government's new tax system reflects that priority.</para><para>The government will continue the revitalisation of the rail industry, including by facilitating major projects such as very high speed train links, and is providing additional funds to improve our road network. The government will maintain a strong, efficient and safe aviation sector, and will address the issues of a second airport for the Sydney region and management of aircraft noise. It will also continue to address issues in the maritime sector to deliver the benefits of a viable Australian shipping industry and a more productive waterfront.</para><para>The government is committed to the development of industries of the future. Partnership with industry will be strengthened through the development of action agendas in key industries, including biotechnology.</para><para>Communications and information technology</para><para>Improved communications and continuing advances in information technology are fundamentally changing the way we work, live and socialise. To ensure that Australians fully realise the extraordinary potential of these advances in terms of job-creating and other opportunities, the government has established a new portfolio of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts to secure effective information technology cohesion and co-ordination within the Federal Government, and maximum co-operation with other levels of government and industry.</para><para>In the area of communications, the first priority is the sale of a further share of the government's equity in Telstra. This will bring benefits to Australian taxpayers by paying off public debt and reducing interest payments. There will also be other benefits through initiatives funded by the further sale to improve communications infrastructure and reduce disparities between services to urban and non-urban Australia.</para><para>The government will continue to boost competitive pressures in the telecommunica 
 tions sector to ensure better services to consumers.</para><para>As promised before the election, the government will establish an independent inquiry into Telstra's service levels around Australia. Unless and until that inquiry certifies that service levels are adequate, the further sale of Telstra beyond majority government ownership will not be permitted.</para><para>The approach of the millennium gives pause to consider the critical influence that information technologies will have on economic performance in the twenty-first century. These technologies are already an integral part of Australians' lives and are a key driver of economic and employment growth. Priority will be given to implementing a national strategy for the information economy and continued efforts to address the Year 2000 computer problem.</para><para>The environment</para><para>The government remains committed to the ecologically sustainable development of our natural resources for the benefit of all Australians.</para><para>The government will enact the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Bill as a matter of priority to put in place a streamlined and more effective environment approvals process, and to establish, for the first time in our environmental history, a genuinely integrated approach to biodiversity conservation.</para><para>The Natural Heritage Trust is now in its third year of operation and represents an unprecedented national commitment to the continued protection of our unique natural environments. The government will build on the proven success of the Trust, and will provide an additional $250 million from the second phase of the sale of Telstra.</para><para>Australia also has one of the largest and most diverse ocean resources in the world. The government will finalise a national oceans policy that will bring together the interests of all governments, industry groups and the broader community.</para><para>Australia and the World</para><para>The first responsibility of government is to provide for the security and defence of the nation and its people.</para><para>The government will ensure that the Australian Defence Force maintains its capability during a period of great strategic change in our region.</para><para>The government will strengthen key alliance relationships and expand defence links in the Asia Pacific in order to contribute effectively to regional and international security.</para><para>The government's commitment to engagement with Asia is unequivocal. So is its determination to strengthen Australia's profound and enduring links with the United States and Europe.</para><para>The government will work hard at all levels—bilaterally, regionally and multilaterally—to pursue Australia's trade liberalisation objectives and to increase market access for Australian exporters.</para><para>In our region, the government remains committed to working closely with Indonesia as that country moves forward with its economic recovery and political reform programs. The government will also maintain strong support for the Papua New Guinean Government in its efforts to achieve lasting peace on Bougainville.</para><para>The government's aid program will continue to focus on poverty alleviation and sustainable development in the region. The government will also continue to promote human rights and democratic institutions, and to ensure greater involvement of the Australian community in the aid program.</para><para>Australia and the new millennium</para><para>The government will conduct a constitutional referendum by the end of 1999, so that the Australian people can decide whether or not Australia will become a republic. As the Constitutional Convention in February 1998 demonstrated, the nation can debate this issue in an open and constructive manner.</para><para>In 2001, Australia will celebrate an historic milestone—100 years of nationhood. The Australian achievement is an extraordinary one worthy of great pride and genuine cele 
 bration. It will be a time to recognise the benefits of our unique Australian values, our economic stability, the rule of law and our proud record in both defending and promoting freedom. The centenary celebrations provide a great opportunity for Australians to take stock and look forward to a confident, harmonious and prosperous new century of national achievement.</para><para>As we approach the new millennium and our Centenary of Federation we also face the challenge of reconciliation between indigenous and other Australians.</para><para>The government will work to achieve the goal of reconciliation over the next two years. It will do so in the knowledge that the great majority of Australians want true reconciliation to be achieved and will support a co-operative approach to achieve that outcome.</para><para>The government continues to believe in the importance of achieving practical outcomes for indigenous Australians—particularly in terms of improvements in their health care, their education, their housing and their job opportunities. In its second term, therefore, the government will be looking to secure ongoing progress in these key areas.</para><para>Conclusion</para><para>The strategy to which the government is clearly committed, and the priorities and goals which it has set, directly relate to the challenges which Australians face as we prepare to enter the twenty-first century.</para><para>In implementing its plan for a stronger Australia, the government recognises the clear responsibilities with which it has been charged by the Australian people. Its driving purpose will continue to be the fulfilment of those responsibilities in a way that achieves practical benefits for all Australians and that enhances Australia's national interest in a unifying way.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">His Excellency the Governor-General and members of the House of Representatives retired.</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Sitting suspended from 3.39 p.m. to 5.00 p.m.</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">THE PRESIDENT</inline> took the chair at 5.00 p.m., and read prayers.</para></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>GOVERNOR-GENERAL'S SPEECH</title><type>Governor-General's Speech</type><page.no>9</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—I inform the Senate that I have received a copy of the opening speech which His Excellency the Governor-General was pleased to deliver to both houses of the parliament.</para></talk.start><para>Ordered that consideration of the Governor-General's opening speech be an order of the day for the next day of sitting.</para></interjection></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS</title><type>Ministerial Arrangements</type><page.no>9</page.no></debateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>9</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—As Senator Hill is absent overseas attending the fourth meeting </para></talk.start><para>of the Conference of the Parties to the Framework Convention on Climate Change, I have the honour to inform the Senate that, following the election held on 3 October 1998, the Governor-General commissioned the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, to form a government.

Over 100,000 students study in Australia each year on such visas, and the current period is when the bulk of these students apply for visas and commence their study. DIMA's legal advice is that they would not be able to issue overseas student visas in compliance with the Migration Regulations, without passage of the Bill.</para><para>Apart from that major difficulty, there would be no requirement for registration on the Commonwealth Register for Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students (CRICOS) and so no quality assurance for overseas students. Education and training providers would not be bound by the requirements of the legislation to place students' pre-paid course fees into trust accounts, and assure students' courses through membership of Tuition Assurance Schemes.

</para><para>(c)	 the guidelines should enunciate principles that are capable of sensible, consistent and predictable application;</para><para>(d)	 the Attorney-General's Department should monitor the strategies being pursued by Ministers in legal proceedings for which assistance has been provided;</para><para>(e)	 extravagant or unnecessary strategies, as determined and advised beforehand by the Attorney-General's Department, should not be funded by the Commonwealth;</para><para>(f)	 if, as the Government proposes, assistance is to be funded from the standing appropriation in section 11 of the Parliamentary Entitlements Act:</para><para>	 -	 the Attorney-General should be required to inform the Parliament of each decision to pay a Minister's legal costs at the earliest opportunity, including the initial reasons for the decision and any limitations placed on expenditure;</para><para>	 -	 a consolidated statement on current cases, including progressive levels of expenditure, should be tabled in the Parliament. However, for the reasons in paragraph 10 below, the Government considers such a statement should be tabled once each financial year and not every three months.</para><para>3. The scheme will also provide for assistance in relation to inquiries relating to the performance by a Minister of his/her ministerial duties. There will be no assistance for legal challenges by Ministers to inquiries.</para><para>4. The scheme will also further extend to subpoenas issued to Ministers, in circumstances where there might be difficulty in providing assistance to Ministers under existing normal arrangements.</para><para>5. The scheme will apply to existing and former Ministers.</para><para>6. In relation to damages claims against a Minister, the basic criteria for Commonwealth assistance will be that the proceedings have arisen out of the performance of ministerial duties and that the Minister acted reasonably and responsibly. These are, in essence, the same criteria as apply under the current administrative guidelines.</para><para>7. The Government does not share the Senate Committee's views that:</para><para>(a)	 all decisions concerning assistance in relation to a personal claim against a Minister should be made by Cabinet;</para><para>(b)	 the guidelines should include indicative limits on costs payable and on the level of professional legal services that are considered appropriate; 
</para><para>(c)	 a consolidated statement on current cases, including progressive levels of expenditure, should be tabled in Parliament every three months.</para><para>8. In relation to the level of the decision maker, the Government will be proposing different levels depending on the circumstances in which assistance is being provided, with only some circumstances requiring Cabinet consultation. The Government considers that a requirement for Cabinet consideration in all cases would be unnecessarily cumbersome and wasteful of resources.</para><para>9. In relation to indicative limits on costs and levels of professional legal services, it is not practicable to contain such limits in guidelines covering the whole range of possible legal proceedings in which Ministers may be involved. However, to the extent practicable, there should be such limits in relation to specific cases. This should be part of the Attorney-General's Department's role in relation to monitoring strategies and expenditure.</para><para>10. In relation to the period within which reporting is to occur, the Government considers that tabling a consolidated report on expenditure in respect of every financial year, in addition to reporting each decision at the earliest opportunity, will provide sufficient information to meet the aim of providing appropriate transparency and accountability .</para><para>11. As recommended by the Senate Committee, the Government will maintain its policy of not using public funds to assist Ministers to institute defamation actions.</para><para>12. In summary, the purpose and effect of the scheme will be to place on a firm legal basis the provision of Commonwealth assistance to Ministers in relation to matters covered by the scheme, to provide transparent criteria and procedures capable of sensible, consistent and predictable application, and to provide for appropriate monitoring and control of expenditure and reporting of expenditure to the Parliament.</para><para>13. I add that the scheme is intended to cover situations where there might be difficulty in providing Commonwealth assistance to a Minister under existing normal procedures. Those procedures include, for example, assistance in relation to administrative law challenges to Ministers' decisions. Also, the Government does not wish to preclude the possibility that, in special circumstances. a Government might wish to provide legal assistance to a Minister outside the scope of the proposed scheme. Accordingly, the regulations establishing the scheme will make it clear that the scheme supplements existing arrangements and is not intended to exclude the provision of Commonwealth legal assistance to a Minister in other circumstances where it can be lawfully provided.

In what I think was a very clear signal from the Auditor-General as to what should be done, Mr Barrett, the Australian Auditor-General, noted that his New Zealand counterpart ruled that a government should not disseminate material that is designed to secure or has the effect of attempting to secure popular support to the party political persuasions of the members of that government. If you apply the New Zealand Audit Office test to what occurred before our election campaign and our election on 3 October this year, the government here has miserably failed the probity test.</para><para>The government's pathetic claims to precedent applying in this situation were swept aside by the Auditor-General in his report. You only have to look at the table on page 29 of the Auditor-General's report to compare the three months prior to the 1998 election campaign with the three months prior to the 1996, 1993 and 1990 election campaigns. The truth of the matter is: the coalition, the Liberal Party, were running a 14-week re-election campaign, but they—the parties of government—were only paying in their own right for five of those weeks. In fact, you had a situation where the national secretary of the Liberal Party skited about the fact that the Liberal Party spent less on its national advertising budget than the Labor Party did. The only reason he was able to skite in that way was because Commonwealth taxpayers funded the Liberal Party's re-election campaign in the weeks leading up to the calling of the election.</para><para>The graph, published on page 29 of the Auditor-General's report, reveals the extent of what was a massive rort—a massive misuse of taxpayers' money—that took place prior to the calling of the recent election. The graph completely refutes the government's claim that such advertising expenditure had a 
 precedent in Australian politics. There is no precedent. We have never seen an advertising campaign of such extent and we have never seen an advertising campaign paid for and conducted by government to promote a policy for which a government was seeking support in a general election. It is unprecedented. This particular graph, contrary to the claims of the government, shows that the former Labor administration actually dropped its level of expenditure on advertising campaigns in the lead-up to the 1996 election.</para><para>Most importantly, the Auditor-General has called for a parliamentary review of the rules surrounding government advertising. He has also called for—as either part of that review or as a separate parliamentary inquiry—an investigation into the use of the Advance to the Minister for Finance and the use of Commonwealth copyright. Both those calls by the Auditor-General are welcomed by the opposition. In fact, we will be progressing in the Senate itself the issue for a parliamentary review of the rules surrounding government advertising.</para><para>We have here before us a report which really does expose the government's chicanery in relation to its own advertising. I must say that we still do not know what the responses will be to some of the inquiries and complaints that the opposition has made. We await the report of the Privacy Commissioner on what we believe is a flagrant and possibly criminal misuse of the Centrelink database for party political campaigning. That matter is currently being reviewed, and we will hear more about it when those inquiries have been completed.</para><para>As I say, we welcome the Auditor-General's expose of the coalition's misuse of Commonwealth taxpayers' funds for the advertising in the lead-up to the last election campaign. The government stands condemned for this blatant misuse and massive rort, the like of which is totally unprecedented in Australian politics.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>41</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Madam President, it looks as though we are off to a bad start.

If there was ever a monumental mistake made in relation to the election campaign, it was your decision to get rid of Singleton. Every time those ads ran, we cheered.

Otherwise, I think the Auditor's report, as I have quoted, says it all.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>41</page.no><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator ROBERT RAY</name><name.id>UI4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is a pity Senator Alston started with a cricket analogy because we are seeing the captain of the Australian A-side over there in 
 Senator Hill's absence. One of the more interesting things in this is the way language is used. What was this advertising campaign? Senator Alston said it himself: a community education and information program. What a terrible distortion of the English language that is. The campaign was rorting taxpayers' funds for partisan political purposes—nothing more than that.</para></talk.start><para>Why did we go to an election six months early? We went to an election on the timetable of a Prime Minister who wanted to have his tax proposals released, the advertising paid for by the taxpayer for two weeks, and then five weeks of the campaign. He did not want real scrutiny of these proposals. But, to make matters worse, he got his lackeys from the Business Council of Australia to tip another $4 million in at the start of the campaign to advertise for tax reform.</para><para>I hope every businessman who put that $4 million in knows that under the Electoral Act they have to declare that as electoral expenditure in this cycle. Otherwise, we might find some of the Business Council of Australia types making a trip down to their local gaol and enjoying some free hospitality there. They have to declare that $4 million as political expenditure.</para><para>If this was a community education and information program—what a wonderful euphemism that is—why did we have to have Senator Minchin and the late, lamented Mr Miles authorise the ads? We have seen government advertising stretching back over the last 10 years that has not required authorisation—and therein lies the definition of whether it is a genuine government advertising campaign or whether it is a partisan political campaign.</para><para>As Senator Faulkner has indicated, we have never seen a campaign of this scale paid for by taxpayers. It is basically four times higher than any past expenditure in the three months prior to a federal election. The only reason that it got capped off at $15 million or so is because the Prime Minister called an election and saved the taxpayers another $5 million. If you want to know why that happened, just have a look at TV advertising rates: they went up after 3 October. The Liberal Party wanted 
 to pay right through its campaign the rates that were cheaper than the pre-Christmas rates which started almost immediately post 3 October.</para><para>One of the least noted changes made in the administrative orders is the removal of OGIA from the Department of Finance and Administration and the sneaking of it across into the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. One wonders why that was done, why they have moved it under the direct control of the Prime Minister. I am always the optimist—maybe they have done that to clean this area up because of the embarrassment it has caused them over the last 2½ years.</para><para>Let me remind the Senate of the government's first major advertising campaign. We had the tragedy of Port Arthur. We had the strong political leadership of not only Mr Howard but Mr Beazley and others on gun control. There was an enthusiasm to advertise various aspects of that bipartisan political approach.</para><para>So what did we get? First of all, we got an advertising firm that was not on OGIA's register put on the list of firms to be chosen from. Even though it was not one of the 1,000 firms on the register, it was put on. It did not make the short list, so the chief political adviser to the Prime Minister intervened and had it put on. Guess who actually got the firm up even though OGIA said it was by far the weakest bid? It was a political committee which included Senator Minchin, in particular, who pushed this particular firm through. When we had a look at the firm, guess who was on the firm? Toby Ralph. All the team that was involved in the Liberal Party's 1996 election campaign won the contract.</para><para>And Senator Alston makes reference to poor advertising. There was never a worse campaign run. There was never a more unprofessional campaign than the gun buyback advertising. It was absolutely abysmal. It was a terrible campaign—and all their professional associates through the industry described it as such.</para><para>Not content with rewarding them, the Liberal Party then had to reward one of their own with their PR contract. It again did not make the short list. The Attorney-General, Mr 
 Daryl Williams, intervened, and the political fix was put in yet again. So in the first two tests of this government when it came to advertising, the fix went in and the good old boys from the team got the contracts—and they have got several since. That means: when you come to an election campaign, you get a good discount from the boys. They will go and work for you for virtually nothing because they are getting paid by the taxpayer through a politically rorted process where clapped out Liberal Party apparatchiks—you in the National Party do not even get a look in—choose these contracts. They clear the officials out of the room so that they cannot be sprung on these particular proposals.</para><para>So we were not particularly surprised when we saw in the budget papers an allocation of money to advertising. But they could not even get that right. They had to go to the Advance to the Minister for Finance for what they described as unforeseen expenditure. Of course it was foreseen—it was foreseen because it was in a previous set of budget papers.</para><para>So, as the Auditor-General has outlined, this is one area that needs examination, this misuse of the Advance to the Minister for Finance. The government should take that seriously, otherwise they will find that, every time the advance is put in this particular chamber, we will have to start itemising and questioning the items. That is not a good process of government. We all acknowledge that the Advance to the Minister for Finance is a necessary and valuable tool to the executive government, but their misuse and abuse of it on this occasion will lead us to question it in future.</para><para>The second thing the Auditor-General has basically said in the code that Auditor-General's talk is that this decision by the government is technically legal and he will not judge the morality of it. But implicitly, by calling for an inquiry by a parliamentary committee, he believes this is an area that should be looked at. Guess what? The Acting Treasurer of the time came out of his burrow just long enough to say, `I don't think that's a good idea.' Of course not. Of course they do not want that particular element examined.</para><para>You do not have the Treasurer do it; it is one of the minor flunkies in the ministry who has to come out. The only sort of stuttering response we got was, `We wouldn't like a parliamentary inquiry into that.' In other words, they will accept as rolled gold everything else in the Auditor-General's report, but what happened to his serious recommendation that parliamentary scrutiny be given to this sort of advertising, especially advertising of this scale requiring this political endorsement? Those on that side of the chamber rejected it automatically. That is not for them because what is turned up might be embarrassing.</para><para>There is a lot more to come out about this advertising campaign and the way Treasury has handled it. We know that, and that will be pursued in other avenues. We do not want to delay proceedings today too long. But it is probably the most blatant political exercise ever conducted in this country, the most cynical and the most blatant misuse of funds that has happened since Federation.</para><para>The dichotomy between Mr Howard's professed standards and the reality of the operation of this government is absolutely drawn in this case, as it is in many other cases of standards. The words flow, the pomposity and the sincerity come out but, when you actually look at the way this government operates, poor old ex-President Nixon must be turning in his grave in envy.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>43</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I will just respond briefly to a number of the comments that Senator Ray made.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3L6</name.id><name role="metadata">CONROY</name><name role="display">Senator Conroy</name></talker><para>—We want you on the record for this rort, Kemp.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name></talker><para>—If you want to get up and speak, you speak, Senator Conroy, but I am going to have my go now.

The government had five overall objectives, two of which are pertinent to this discussion and I wish to address only those two. Those objectives were, firstly, to achieve an optimum financial return from the sale and, secondly, to secure a timely sale process, conducted to high standards of probity and accountability.</para><para>I must say at the outset that the government failed and failed miserably to achieve anywhere near maximum possible return. Consider the following sequence of events: the gross proceeds from the Telstra sale were around $14.2 billion; the price set on issue day was around $3.30 to $3.40 per share; at the close of business on the first day, the receipts were at a premium of 67c per share, the largest initial premium of any Commonwealth public share offer on record; in the 11 months since listing, the trading price of Telstra has increased more than 160 times the increase in the all ordinaries; and, at the close of business yesterday, Telstra shares were trading at $6.70, more than double the initial 
 retail price. So in the space of a bare 11 months, the government has given away, or failed to collect, nearly $14 billion of money properly owned by the taxpayers of Australia.</para><para>We do not argue that Telstra shares should have been priced at 200 per cent of the issue price, but we do point out that Telcos are in a boom sector. There is an acknowledged significant international demand for Telco shares, and we appreciate this huge domestic retail interest in purchasing Telstra shares. The government certainly had knowledge of all of those factors, considering over 2½ million Australians registered for a prospectus before final sale price was announced. We point out that the government had knowledge of the institutional and likely retail demand for Telstra shares. We say that the government and the relevant ministers failed to act responsibly in the planning process, failed to provide sufficient oversight of the float process and failed to take sufficient expert independent advice on the scale of likely investor interest in the Telstra sale.</para><para>In the race to sell off the farm—to get rid of the family silver—the government and Minister Alston failed to maximise the return to the true owners of Telstra, the taxpayers of Australia. If the issue price had been priced more accurately—somewhere between the then price of $3.30 and the current price of $6.70—we may not now be facing the issue of a $6 billion GST on food and the government may have been able to retire more debt to save interest repayments and hence cut less from the outlay side of the budget in recent years. The $14 billion give-away by the government is simply an example of incompetence, wilful ignorance and lack of work, planning and supervision of the entire process. The findings in paragraph 13 on page 14 of the ANAO report state:</para><para>ANAO's review of the institutional book suggests the bookbuild process and allocation criteria did not provide sufficient incentive for bidders to reveal their individual price elasticity of demand for Telstra shares.</para><para>That is cute language and economic jargon, but it means quite simply that the government has given Telstra away—it has set the price far too low—and that the bidders of Telstra shares provided a con and the government fell 
 for it. ANAO said that there was insufficient `incentive for bidders to reveal their individual price elasticity of demand', and the government did not press them hard enough for a higher price. This government is responsible for losing up to $14 billion of taxpayers' money.</para><para>The following analogy is apt. For example, a couple in Toorak, Melbourne, going through an acrimonious divorce, possess a house worth something in the order of $3 million. The Family Court orders the husband to sell the house and give half the proceeds to his wife. He sells it to the first bidder for $1 million. The wife only gets half a million dollars instead of $1½ million—half the market price. It is the same with this government. It deliberately, or with great incompetence, chose a low price and failed to gain for taxpayers up to $14 billion from the sale of Telstra.</para><para>Unfortunately, things get worse. We leave the path of incompetence and ignorance to go down a different trail. The trail, as always, is the money trail. This time the government has been overly generous with taxpayers' money. It has been greatly generous to its mates in the broker community and investment banks in Australia and around the world. The budgeted cost of the international roadshow blew out from $1 million to $3 million. Footnote 65 on page 56 of the report outlines the detail.</para><para>Two million dollars was wasted in the United States on private aircraft charter, costing $466,000, and private chauffeur and limousine services, costing $136,000. Luxury hotels, costing $1,000 per day per person, were booked ad nauseam. Limousines, costing $6,100 per day for those persons involved in the international roadshow in the United States, were booked up. As if the Hilton hotel in major cities in the United States does not charge $200 or $250 for a room. As if cabs to airports or minibuses cannot be hired for $50 to $100 per session in big United States cities. As if scheduled commercial flights do not fly regularly between New York, Los Angeles, Philadelphia and the rest. The full details are listed on page 55 and 56 of the report.  </para><para>In summary, the budget blew out from $1 million to $3 million. Huge amounts of money were paid for private limousines, private aircraft charter and luxury hotel rooms. Payments were not independently verified and an audit trail was not established. But the money trail story gets even worse. At paragraph 3.24, ANAO concludes:</para><para>. . . certain expenditure did not appear to relate to organising and conducting the Telstra roadshow; certain travel expenses exceeded entitlements by a significant margin; and some expenditure did not reconcile to the roadshow itinerary.</para><para>This code language of the ANAO report begs the following questions. Firstly, what was the $2 million expended on? Secondly, why was it reimbursed without receipts or checking? Thirdly, who made the claims and is it fraud? Fourthly, when and how will the money be recovered by the government? Fifthly, will the relevant personnel and firms if engaged in fraud be barred from future floats? Sixthly, what action has the minister insisted upon to ensure that there will be no repeat of possible fraud in the future? Finally, will the minister instruct the department to ensure that charges are laid to recover these hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not millions of dollars, wilfully spent on fraudulent activities?</para><para>In this Telstra float process the government had two objectives: to maximise a financial return from sale and to secure a sale process conducted to high standards of probity and accountability. How did it fair? It received $14 billion. It could have received $28 billion. A reasonable figure would be somewhere between $19 billion and $22 billion. That extra $5 billion to $8 billion, reasonably capable of being gained, could have been used to retire debt and save outlays of that amount having been cut from the budget for the last two years.</para><para>The sale process, particularly the international roadshow, was just a big party for dozens of wealthy individuals—hired, retained and instructed by this government—all around the United States. Luxury hotel rooms were used and abused at a premium. Fancy chauffeur driven cars were on tap to the tune of $6,000 per day. Big fat meals and lots of wine were on tap and are receipted, and 
 private aircraft jaunts around the United States appeared to be the norm through this process.</para><para>There was no independent verification of the receipts. There were few, if any, receipts provided by the coordinators to Telstra management and, in turn, to the government of Australia. There was unauthorised expenditure tantamount to fraud on a large scale. We can certainly draw one conclusion from the two objectives: the government failed to maximise the sale price of Telstra and use the money appropriately within the law. The government did not even approach the margin with its own high standards of probity and accountability. From beginning to end throughout the United States, from city to city, tens of thousands of dollars of taxpayers' money was spent on luxury hotel rooms, on big fat meals and on private aircraft jetting from city to city, from LA to Philadelphia.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—Order!

Ceb, as he was called, was educated in Sydney. His family moved to their Canning Downs property near Warwick in 1917. Ceb left school in 1918, aged 17, and gained employment with the Union Trustee Company. Ceb bought the Canning Downs property from his father after World War II and lived there until his death.</para><para>Canning Downs is a horse stud where Ceb and his family have bred fine race horses including `Tails' who, on his third attempt, finished third in the 1971 Melbourne Cup. In fact, Ceb credited one horse, Basha Felika, the 1951 Caulfield Cup winner, with winning him an election when his constituents found out that he owned him.</para><para>During World War II, Ceb served in the Royal Australian Air Force. He enlisted in 1942 and was discharged in 1944, having reached the rank of Flying Officer after serving in Australia and New Guinea.</para><para>Ceb was elected as the Country Party member for McPherson in 1958. His maiden speech in the House of Representatives was full of praise for the farming industry in Queensland. He commented on how Queensland had gone from importing flour to growing some of the best wheat in Australia and how Queensland had changed from relying on its mining industry to sustaining a thriving agricultural sector. His parliamentary career was distinguished—serving for 14 years, eight as a minister.</para><para>Ceb's association with New Guinea did not end with his war service but continued through his parliamentary duties. As Minister for External Territories, he will be remembered for his dedication to the economic and political development of Papua New Guinea and its progress toward self-government. He had responsibility for a difficult and controversial portfolio which would have tested any minister, but he fulfilled his duty honourably.</para><para>During Ceb's 14 years in this parliament, he contributed to the work of parliamentary committees. He was a member of both the Select Committee on Voting Rights of Aborigines and the Select Committee on Grievances of Yirrkala Aborigines, Arnhem Land Reserve. He also attended the inauguration of the Papua New Guinea House of Assembly in 1964 and led a parliamentary delegation to the South Pacific in 1971.</para><para>Ceb retired from federal politics in 1972 and returned to Canning Downs and breeding horses. He has been quoted as saying that he gained so much from his years in parliament and would not have missed them for anything, but in the end was a farmer at heart.</para><para>Ceb will be remembered by all who knew him as a man whose honesty, integrity and dignity were but a few of his virtues.</para><para>On behalf of the government, I extend to his wife Barbara, his daughters, Patricia and Jill, son John and their families our most sincere sympathy in their bereavement.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>49</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On behalf of the opposition, I associate the opposition with this condolence motion on the death of Ceb Barnes, a former Country Party minister.

I am told that he had a straightforward style about him, that he was a person who fought hard for his convictions, that he gave no quarter and that he sought none.</para><para>He entered federal parliament quite late in life. He was in his late 50s when he first won the seat of McPherson in Queensland in 1958, and he held that seat until he retired from parliament in 1972. He was appointed Minister for Territories in 1963, which at the time included a responsibility for Papua New Guinea. In 1968 his title and portfolio responsibilities were changed when he became Minister for External Territories. It was that portfolio that he held until his retirement from the Commonwealth parliament in 1972. It was a difficult and, at times, controversial portfolio which he held for eight years.</para><para>As Minister for Territories he was responsible for the introduction of equal pay for indigenous Australians in the Northern Territory. He also played a major role in the campaign to give indigenous Australians the vote. During his time as minister, he was also responsible for advancing the cause of self-government for what we now know as Papua New Guinea. By 1970 he, along with others, had steered the process to the point where the Papua New Guinea House of Assembly was able to take over management of many of its affairs along the process towards full self-government. He strongly wanted to see Papua New Guinea prepared for self-government by 
 ensuring social stability and sound economic development. Of course, full independence for Papua New Guinea was achieved in 1975.</para><para>I am told that Ceb Barnes was a man of strong character. We have learnt that he turned a knighthood down after his retirement as he modestly judged his own achievements to be unremarkable. I think he had substantial achievements and, as Minister Kemp and I have indicated, they are there on the public record for all to see. Madam President, let me say on behalf of the opposition that we offer our most sincere condolences to his family and friends.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>50</page.no><name role="metadata">Boswell, Sen Ronald</name><name role="display">Senator BOSWELL</name><name.id>YE4</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to extend the condolences of the National Party to the family of our former National Party colleague Charlie Edward Barnes, known as Ceb Barnes. I can remember that he addressed some of the meetings in the earlier part of my association with the National Party. I have also met him personally.</para></talk.start><para>Ceb Barnes was the National Party member for McPherson from 1958 until 1972, succeeding in the seat of McPherson another admirable Queenslander, the Hon. Sir Artie Fadden. At the time the electorate covered a huge part of Queensland—from Warwick, Boonah, right down to Southport and to what is now known as the Gold Coast.</para><para> Ceb Barnes was always described as a true gentleman. He was a man of many achievements: a miner, an aviator, a thoroughbred breeder, a politician and a farmer. His rural interests and knowledge were tremendous assets to the Country Party. He was particularly well known as a dedicated horse breeder on his family property, Canning Downs, at Warwick. As a government minister, he had the distinction of receiving newspaper headlines for his horses' racing successes, which included his famous chestnut colt Tails that he bred at Canning Downs. In fact, on the day Ceb retired from politics, Tails retired from racing.</para><para>As a breeder of thoroughbreds, he was a pursuer of colonial blood as the principal source of breeding lines for Canning Downs—as had his father John H.S. Barnes 
 been before him. In the foreword to his biography, <inline font-style="italic">Ceb—exploits of an uncommon man,</inline> it is said:</para><para>As a breeder of thoroughbred racehorses Ceb Barnes can take his place as a master of both—a scientist and a craftsman—a man whose knowledge and understanding of bloodlines combined with his ability and sensitivity as a horseman has earned him a place as a nobleman of the bloodstock industry in Queensland.</para><para>In 1963 Ceb Barnes was appointed Minister for the Territories in the Menzies government, following Sir Paul Hasluck. In 1968 he became the Minister for External Territories—covering Papua New Guinea, the Northern Territory, Norfolk Island, Cocos Island, Christmas Island and Nauru—which he held until January 1972. Ceb Barnes held portfolios under four prime ministers: Menzies, Holt, Gorton and McMahon.</para><para>His achievements were considerable. He gradually introduced equal pay for Aborigines in the Northern Territory, a right which was extended by the vote to right through referendum. As minister, his focus on Papua New Guinea was to achieve economic development and social stability. It was a difficult period leading a country to nationhood and a time when he received criticism from many quarters. During this period leading into self-government—immediate independence was the catchcry of many, including the then Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Mr Gough Whitlam—Barnes as the responsible minister saw this as a matter for the people themselves and should not be imposed upon them. His involvement as minister with Papua New Guinea echoed his time there during the Second World War as a flying officer in the RAAF, responsible for radar installations at Milne Bay and the Trobriand Islands.</para><para>Ceb Barnes could reply ably to his critics, citing the achievements during his years as minister. These included the trebling of territory spending, a trebling of education spending, a doubling of health spending, an increase of nearly 50 per cent in school enrolments and the opening of the university and other tertiary educational institutions which endure as proud and valuable contributors to Papua New Guinea today. On his retirement, his contribution to Papua New 
 Guinea was paid tribute through the words of the President, Tuit To Kubak of the Gazelle Peninsula Local Government Council, who said:</para><para>The people of this territory have highly admired the marvellous and splendid work you have carried out . . . Now the time has come that you have to retire but the council will not forget you.</para><para>What you have done for the improvement of our territory of Papua New Guinea will always recall your name back to the people.</para><para>The life of Ceb Barnes, 20 days short of 97 years, reveals a full life of public service and a valuable contribution to primary industry and family life. His biographer, Lorraine Nott, concludes his autobiography with the words:</para><para>One cannot help but wonder to what greater heights Canning Downs might have climbed had Ceb Barnes not given those years to government. Ceb Barnes is quoted as saying, "But I gained so much from those years—I wouldn't have missed them for anything."</para><para>I extend the condolences of the National Party to his widow, Barbara, and children, Patricia, Jill and John, and his sister, Mrs Adelaide Bell.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative, honourable senators standing in their places.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><adjournment><adjournmentinfo><time.stamp>18:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>51</page.no></adjournmentinfo><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senate adjourned at 6.16 p.m.</inline></para></adjournment><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>51</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tabling</title><page.no>51</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following documents were tabled by the Clerk:</para><para>Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act—</para><para>Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (Conditions of Payment to Organisations) Direction 1998.</para><para>Augmented review panel convened by the Minister—Final boundary recommendations under section 141N.</para><para>Regional Council Election Amendment Rules (No. 2) 1998.</para><para>Aged Care Act—</para><para>	 Determination under subsection—</para><para>	 44-3(2) ACA Ch. 3 No. 1/1998.</para><para>	 44-6(4) ACA Ch. 3 No. 2/1998.</para><para>	 44-12(3) ACA Ch. 3 No. 3/1998.</para><para>	 44-13(6) ACA Ch. 3 No. 4/1998.</para><para>	 44-14(6) ACA Ch. 3 No. 5/1998.
