He leaves to take a position with the Australian National University. He has been with the unit since 1991 and I think all of us have benefited from the skills of the unit, especially during the time of his leadership. He takes pride in his work and the unit has a unique capacity to be able to produce a committee report in the extraordinarily short time from when it has been settled and agreed, to when it is tabled in the Senate. On behalf of senators I express our gratitude to Gordon and wish him well for the next stage of his career at the Australian National University.</para></talk.start><para><inline font-style="italic">Honourable senators</inline>âHear, hear!</para></speech></debate><petition.group><petition.groupinfo><title>PETITIONS</title><page.no>4031</page.no></petition.groupinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10001</name.id><name role="metadata">CLERK ASSISTANT</name><name role="display">The Clerk</name></talker><para>âPetitions have been lodged for presentation as follows:</para></talk.start></interjection><petition><petitioninfo><title>Higher Education Contribution Scheme</title><page.no>4031</page.no><no.signed>21</no.signed><name.ids><name.id>XI4</name.id></name.ids><names><name>Reynolds</name><name> Sen Margaret</name></names></petitioninfo><para>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate assembled in Parliament.</para><para>The petition of certain citizens draws the attention of the House to the damaging impact of the Government's changes to post-secondary education.

Today, I propose to highlight issues about which the Committee has the most concern.</para><para>First, I wish to make some comments about <inline font-style="italic">Audit Report No. 5 Performance Management of Defence Inventory.</inline></para><para>The issues canvassed by the Committee with respect to this report included:</para><para>.	 best practice in supply chain performance management;</para><para>managing inventory as an asset;</para><para>.	 clearer performance targets;</para><para>.	 integrated and effective performance management;</para><para>.	 the impact of performance management on Defence's inventory management culture;  and</para><para>the availability and retention of inventory management expertise.</para><para>The current Defence inventory of spares, consumables and repairable items (excluding explosive ordnance) is valued at approximately $3.9 
 billion. Extra procurement and maintenance of repairable items by external contractors costs an additional $1 billion annually.</para><para>The Committee welcomes the comprehensiveness of the audit and the Defence Department's agreement to all of its recommendations.</para><para>However, this Committee has long-standing concerns with the performance management of Defence inventory and assets and the inability of Defence to fully address recommendations from previous reviews and audits.</para><para>The Committee appreciates that the legacy of three separate logistics organisations has contributed to fragmentation, isolation and lack of inter-Service communication. This has resulted in significant duplication of effort in logistics performance management in Defence.</para><para>The Committee therefore supports the establishment of a single performance management organisation and welcomes the formation of Support Command Australia, established in 1997.</para><para>At the same time, the Committee believes that a watching brief should be maintained on the ability of this new organisation to ensure the success of an integrated information system across Defence. The Committee recommends that the Department of Defence should conduct annual reviews of the strategies used by Support Command Australia, to ensure rationalisation of duplicated functions across Defence are successful.</para><para>The Committee appreciates the unique nature of inventory management in a defence context. However, the Committee considers that managing Defence inventory as an asset, particularly in the accrual accounting environment, should focus attention on the level of stock needed to meet Defence contingency planning.</para><para>Contingency and strategic planning is central to the effective management of any major organisation, whether in the public or private sector. The Committee recommends that Defence should arrange to examine the methods adopted by overseas defence organisations and should benchmark its inventory performance management against comparable inventories in the private sector.</para><para>The Committee agrees with the audit findings that Defence should increase the use of clearly identified performance targets in order to provide meaning and direction for the development of performance measures in the supply chain.</para><para>The Committee does not accept Defence's argument that within its distribution chain, performance targets are difficult to measure and expects that Defence will implement the audit report recommendations to which it has agreed.</para><para>The Committee considered the question of training and education in the area of inventory management. 
 The Committee accepts the audit findings that there is a significant shortage of inventory management and supply chain professionals. The Committee is concerned therefore that Defence has not sufficiently addressed the problem of attracting suitably qualified personnel into its organisation.</para><para>The Committee does not accept the proposition put forward by Defence that staff loyalty to the Defence Force alone will retain highly qualified personnel. Without specialised staff it is unlikely that the large savings anticipated from the performance management of Defence inventory will be achieved.</para><para>The Committee recommends that Defence should seek to identify ways by which it can attract and retain staff qualified in the management of inventory and supply chain.</para><para>Madam President, I now turn to the second audit report examined by the Committee, <inline font-style="italic">Audit Report No. 10, 1997-98, Aspects of Corporate Governance: The Australian Tourist Commission.</inline></para><para>The Australian Tourist Commission is a statutory authority that operates under the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Tourist Commission Act 1987</inline> . A ten-member Board governs the ATC which, with the exception of the Managing Director, is appointed by and reports to the Minister for Sport and Tourism.</para><para>The Committee appreciates the timeliness of the audit and its thoroughness in highlighting the need for a range of reform measures. Foremost amongst these is the need for the ATC to ensure that it achieves its statutory objectives and that links are developed between these and the ATC's corporate objectives.</para><para>The Committee's hearing focused on the audit report findings that the ATC is currently unable to demonstrate that it is fully meeting all of its statutory objectives. In particular, the objective which relates to the protection of Australia from adverse environmental and social impacts of international tourism, and to aspects of the objective relating to maximising the benefits to Australia from international tourism.</para><para>The ATC has three statutory objectives. These are:</para><para>.	 to increase the number of visitors to Australia from overseas;</para><para>.	 to maximise the benefits to Australia from overseas visitors; and</para><para>.	 to ensure that Australia is protected from adverse environmental and social impacts of international tourism.</para><para>The Committee notes that the ATC recognises the benefits of the audit, has agreed with all of the recommendations and has taken action to implement a number of them. 
</para><para>The Committee understands that the ATC has won a number of national and international marketing awards and welcomes the recognition it has been given by the World Tourism Organisation as one of the most efficient tourism authorities in the world.</para><para>However, the Committee is concerned that areas of weakness identified in various audits and reviews have not been addressed because of a lack of effective and ongoing processes to monitor and implement recommendations.</para><para>The Committee recommends that within the context of a corporate governance framework, the ATC should introduce effective and ongoing processes to monitor the implementation of recommendations made in previous audits and reviews.</para><para>The Committee agrees with the audit findings that the ATC faces particular challenges in interpreting and addressing the broader implications of its statutory objectives. In particular, the objective relating to the protection of Australia from adverse environmental and social impacts of international tourism.</para><para>The Committee appreciates that a lack of regulatory power is inhibiting the ATC from meeting this objective and recommends a two-pronged approach.</para><para>First, the ATC should enter into an extensive dialogue with relevant State and Territory authorities for the purpose of developing a cohesive strategy to ensure that Australia is protected from adverse environmental and social impacts of overseas tourism.</para><para>Secondly, that the Board of the ATC should propose to the Minister for Sport and Tourism that the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Tourist Commission Act 1987 </inline> be amended to clarify the ATC's role.</para><para>The Committee considered the ability of the ATC to measure its performance against its statutory obligations. In the area of visitor numbers, for example, the Committee believes that the ATC has been unable to assess whether tourists have been attracted by its marketing campaign, are avoiding current world trouble spots, or are reacting solely on beneficial exchanges rates.</para><para>In the Committee's view, the ATC's performance under its statutory objective to increase arrivals has been uneven. The Committee agrees with the audit findings that, the extent to which the ATC's investment in international tourism promotion has contributed to the increase in visitor numbers is unclear from the ATC's performance information.</para><para>In order to ensure the ATC has sufficient controls and process in place to monitor its performance and report on outcomes, the Committee recommends the ATC should seek the employment of a professional consultant to work with program managers 
 for the purpose of developing a sound corporate governance framework.</para><para>The Committee, against the background of the current Asian economic crisis, discussed the impact on Australian tourism from Asia. The Committee understands that visitor numbers from South-East Asia are falling, but agrees with the view of the ATC that to walk away from the Asian market at this time would be foolhardy.</para><para>It is too early to say precisely what the economic outcomes in the region are likely to be. The Committee welcomes the ATC's plans to continue exploring a number of strategies to help revitalise the business because the signs are both positive and negative. This relates particularly to the relative weakness of the Australian dollar to the US dollar and the UK pound.</para><para>In the Tourism forecasting Council's assessment, the outlook for growth from the markets in the USA and Canada remains positive and Europe will continue to be an important source market, although tourism from that region is expected to increase at a slower rate than most other markets.</para><para>While the Committee does not expect the ATC to lessen its efforts in developing Asian markets at this time, it is clear from statistics cited in the Committee's report that the North American and European markets have further potential for development.</para><para>The trend in visitor numbers from 1994-95 to 1995-96 shows a slight increase in tourist numbers from several countries in North America and Europe. For example, the United States of America shows a modest increase of 5%. However, there has been negative growth from Germany, while France and the United Kingdom have decreased by 9% and 3%, respectively.</para><para>The ATC has a continuing statutory obligation to increase the number of international visitors to Australia. To ensure the ATC meets its objective,</para><para>The Committee believes it is timely for the ATC to develop strategies which aim to reinvigorate the North American and European markets.</para><para>May I conclude, Madam President, by thanking on behalf of the Committee those people who contributed their time and expertise to the Committee's review hearings, upon which this report is based. The Committee appreciates the cooperation it has received from the agencies involved.</para><para>I am also indebted to my colleagues on the Committee who have dedicated much time and effort to reviewing these Auditor-General's reports. As well, I would like to thank the members of the secretariat who were involved in the inquiries, Dr Margot Kerley, the Committee Secretary, Ms Marie Kawaja, Ms Jennifer Hughson and Ms Tiana Gray.

This matter is of some importance, so I would like to go through it in an expeditious way. The Senate referred this matter to the committee on 3 September 1997. The reference was prompted by debate in this chamber about the penalty provisions which had been included in the Productivity Commission Bill. Senators might recall that that bill created a number of offences such as failing to provide information to the Productivity Commission, or refusing to answer questions or produce documents. These offences were expressed to be punishable by six-months imprisonment.</para><para>The committee's report looks at the penalty provision in the Productivity Commission Bill in some detail. It then looks at the penalty provisions in comparable Commonwealth legislation. The committee observes that imprisonment is often imposed as a penalty for information offences where someone is claiming a financial benefit, or where an organisation such as the ASC or the ACCC is attempting to investigate a possible breach of the law. Statutes which create quasi-judicial bodies such as the Administrative Appeals Tribunal also often provide for imprisonment as a penalty. However, many research and advisory bodiesâsuch as the Productivity 
 Commissionâhave no power to compel others to provide them with information, and many of those which have been given this power cannot enforce it with the threat of imprisonment.</para><para>The committee's report goes on to discuss the principles which govern statutory penalty provisions. Penalties must be fair and appropriate. As I say, if they are similar concepts, the penalties must be consistent. For bodies such as the Productivity Commission, penalties should be chosen to ensure that the organisation can operate effectively, rather than simply to punish people. Imprisonment should always be a penalty of last resort.</para><para>Ultimately the committee concludes that there is a need to review and clarify the criteria which govern penalty regimes for Commonwealth legislation. The committee recommends that the Attorney-General develop more detailed criteria in this area. These criteria should ensure that penalties are more consistent, more appropriate and make greater use of a wider range of non-custodial penalties. The Attorney should make these criteria available to ministers, drafters and the parliament. Only in this way shall we ensure that an appropriate and consistent penalty regime is established covering all Commonwealth legislation.</para><para>In closing, I thank James Warmenhoven, the secretary of the committee, Margaret Lindeman, and the Attorney-General for providing us with people to give us information about these matters. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para><para>Leave granted; debate adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ORDER OF BUSINESS</title><type>Business</type><page.no>4038</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Census</title><page.no>4038</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bourne</inline>) agreed to:</para><para>That general business notice of motion No. 1146 standing in the name of Senator Bourne for today, relating to the retention of census data, be postponed till 30 June 1998.

In presenting the report, I acknowledge the assistance of the many staff of the committee's secretariat who assisted the committee over the two years of the inquiry. Regrettably, because of the many changes to personnel, they are too numerous to name but I do thank them all. I also thank my committee colleagues for their cooperation during the course of the inquiry.</para><para>Next financial year, the Howard government will spend $46.8 million less on legal aid than if 1995-96 funding levels and commitments had been maintained. With no commitment to index the legal aid agreements, that situation is likely to get worse by an additional cumulative $3 million a year. In total, the forward estimates disclose that the Howard government will spend $231 million less in real terms over its first six years than if 1995-96 funding levels had been maintained.</para><para>The committee received ample evidence that the cuts are having a devastating effect in the community. My own constituents of Western Australia are most affected. It is, at the very least, disappointing that the Western Australian Attorney-General, Mr Peter Foss, was not able to convince the Commonwealth Attorney-General, who is from WA, that Western Australia should be funded on a basis equitable with the rest of Australia. WA has been the hardest hit of all the states and territories, with 41 per cent cuts in today's 
 terms. Both persons have been deservedly condemned by all Western Australians. Apart from the regional impacts, the cuts have been particularly devastating to people from non-English speaking backgrounds, indigenous Australians, those living with disabilities and the aged.</para><para>The cuts have also been a failure in their administration. They have been implemented by an incompetent Attorney-General, who used the wrong year's figures, who put in place inadequate guidelines, who could not get the agreements signed on time despite having more than a year to do so, and who still has not put in place effective mechanisms to monitor the impact of the cuts.</para><para>The cuts have seen the abandonment by this government of its responsibility for domestic violence matters. These are matters which the Prime Minister has claimed are of national importance but which he is unwilling, in over 95 per cent of cases, to provide funding for.</para><para>Evidence before the committee demonstrated that the funding caps are cutting off cases mid-stream and there is insufficient discretion to be able to extend funding in deserving cases. Funding caps should not be used to deny justice in individual cases.</para><para>Evidence to the committee was that the legal aid commissions have little ability to meet the costs of the exceptionally expensive criminal cases that occur unpredictably from time to time. The committee does not regard it as acceptable that funding to other legal aid cases is being squeezed to pay for these cases. It recommends that the Commonwealth provide additional funding to meet the extra costs involved in these exceptional cases.</para><para>Legal aid in these cases has become increasingly threatened. Funding for virtually all immigration matters has been removed and severe restrictions apply to veterans, social security, product liability and discrimination cases. The new requirement, that there be a substantial benefit to the public or a section of the public before legal aid is provided in discrimination cases, ignores the community interest in preventing all forms of discrimination.  </para><para>The present law allows tax deductibility for litigation related legal expenses by businesses, but similar deductions are seldom available to non-business litigants. Evidence to the committee disclosed a widespread belief that Australian taxpayers are subsidising business litigation regardless of the merits of the case or the fee paid to the lawyers. In a climate where public resources are scarce the committee has called for a review to ensure that the taxation treatment of litigation related legal expenses is equitable.</para><para>The committee concluded that the government's failure to understand the importance of legal aid in our community demonstrated a clear lack of understanding and consultation about the needs of the community. Accordingly, the committee has recommended that the Commonwealth and the legal aid commissions should enhance their consultation with the community through the formation of linked national, state and territory legal aid councils.</para><para>The committee report contains 192 tightly packed pages of evidence and analysis, all of which are extensively referenced from the submissions and the evidence given at public hearings. A further 80 pages of attachments are also included. The report is very clear public evidence that some members of the committee were interested in the subject of the inquiry, that the submissions were read and that the voices of concern were heard. The report makes 22 very reasonable and very sensible recommendations.</para><para>By contrast, the government senators provided an addendum of over 100 pages of double spaced commentary that refers to only one of the 284 submissions to the inquiry. Government senators have stopped listening to the people. The addendum is riddled with typographical errors which demonstrate a very slip-shod approach to the inquiry. This is indicative of the government's handling of this issue.</para><para>Government senators in their flawed paper ignored the reality that current levels of legal aid funding make it extremely difficult for large numbers of those who have meritorious claims to receive assistance. For example, they argue in paragraph 7.28 that a person alleging discrimination should be entitled to 
 legal aid only where the discrimination can be shown to have a broader public interest effect beyond its effect on the individual. They boldly assert that to permit people to receive legal aid in other than these circumstances would `leave the system open to spurious claim'. How on earth is a claim by an individual relating to discrimination inherently spurious, particularly when it is the subject of the same merits test as other applications for legal aid?</para><para>It is typical of this government's contempt for those who have to overcome some form of discrimination or disadvantage and it is disappointingly similar to the rhetoric of the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson). It is the politics of envy, blame and division. It is yet another example of the vicious use of wedge politics by the Howard government to set Australian against Australian.</para><para>The addendum simply ignores the overwhelming weight of evidence that points to the fundamental failings in what is left of our national legal aid system. In short, not only are government senators blind to the problems created by the slashing of legal aid funding by the Howard government but they advocate wilful ignorance of the ongoing effects of the cuts. Instead, they advocate two possible alternatives to legal aidâincreased assistance through community legal centres and the increased usage of legal expense insurance. For the reasons explained in the committee report, neither of these is a suitable replacement for legal aid funding.</para><para>Government senators ignored the fact that in the first two budgets the Howard government cut funding for community legal centres. They simply do not seem to understand that a crisis in the community legal service sector had already been created prior to the legal aid cuts and that this in turn had resulted in massive increases in demand for these services. Instead, the government senators pathetically rely on the announcement of a $2.85 million per year funding increase in the 1998-99 budget, which is supposed to make up for the legal aid cuts that are worth $46.8 million in real terms next financial year.</para><para>The reality is that the community legal centres are increasingly unable to help middle Australia that they were designed for because their scarce resources are overwhelmingly being used to help these worthy people who have been denied legal aid as a result of the Howard government's cuts. Government senators have forgotten the many stories told to the committee about the revolving door syndrome. Worse still for middle Australia, the government's massive increase in court and tribunal fees have ensured that these people are being shut out of the legal system in droves.</para><para>The committee did examine legal expense insurance and noted the problems that have been encountered with the implementation of these schemes in Australia. Whilst not discounting the possibility that it may be useful among those who can afford it, the committee noted that it is unlikely to be a viable mechanism for delivering assistance to legal aid recipients, who were overwhelmingly government pension recipients.</para><para>The committee noted in paragraph 7.57 of its report that the Law Council had approached the government for assistance in relation to employer related legal expense insurance schemes, but the government had refused to provide that assistance. Notwithstanding this, the government senators suggested that the committee should have conducted a detailed six-point reference inquiry into legal expense insurance. The committee saw these terms of reference for the first time when they appeared in this addendum. It seems that the left hand of this government does not know what the right hand is doing.</para><para>In conclusion, the government senators' addendum is blind to the problems caused by the slashing of legal aid, seeks to blame the alleged inefficient management of legal aid commissions for the problems and is not interested in tracking the problems identified in the future. In paragraph 9.39 of their paper, government senators have the audacity to claim that the legal aid cuts have actually enhanced access to justice. All this just supports what everyone in the community has known all alongâthat is, that this government 
 simply does not listen. I commend the report to the Senate. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>4041</page.no><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator COONAN</name><name.id>2M6</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe government senators' report seems to have hit its mark to have resulted in such an impassioned performance from Senator McKiernan, who has shown himself completely incapable of really addressing the criticisms of the dissenting report on legal aid in some sort of dispassionate way. He failed to see that the government senators really did offer some very constructive criticism of the approach, the flawed methodology that was adopted throughout this report, the mishmash of anecdotes that were relied on in the absence of any data, the untested assumptions and the flawed conclusions.</para></talk.start><para>If he had done that, he would have been grateful that the government senators took the troubleâalbeit double spaced, I must admitâto go through and identify where this report seriously fails the Australian people as an attempt to evaluate the problems that have been experienced from time to time in the legal aid system over the years. For many years some of the difficulties faced with burgeoning legal costs and funding have been addressed in various reports.</para><para>The government senators approached the inquiry in the recognition that this was an opportune time to critically examine new proposals for the efficient and cost-effective delivery of legal aid to those who need it most. That is why the majority report is such a disappointing document. It confines itself to the basics of legal aid. It looks at legal aid exhaustively. It does not open its mind at all to the fact that there are so many people in Australia who do not qualify for legal aid. We have to look at new and innovative ways to look after those Australians as well as the very poorest people who do qualify for legal aid.</para><para>The legal aid report primarily squanders this opportunity. It was a great opportunity to examine some solutions to the problems that have beset the legal aid system in Australia. The Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee presented a good platform to examine the system, to find the areas of efficiency and deficiency, and to generally 
 gather information from which to move forward.</para><para>Instead, the opposition majority report tabled this morning takes the debate backwards rather than forwards. It offers no viable solutions, it is based on pretty watery logic and it simply fails to address the issues. It is a great disappointment because the opposition refuses to look beyond bandaid solutions. The opposition has made the flawed assumption that simply throwing unlimited funds at legal aid will solve the problemâand, of course, it will not.</para><para>As I said a little earlier, the report fails to address the issue that many Australians are precluded from access to the justice system. A great number of Australians fall just outside the threshold for legal aid and, therefore, if they want to litigate, they must risk their own funds. I would have thought that this was a pretty fertile area to use to look at how the legal system might better address the needs of those people. Many Australians do not have the resources to risk and very often meritorious cases are simply not able to be proceeded with. The report pays very scant attention to vehicles such as legal expense insurance which, when combined with conditional fees, offers the opportunity to open access to justice to a great many more Australians.</para><para>The reason that this report is so disappointing is that it did not even look at the recent developments in the United Kingdom where the vehicle to take the pressure off legal aid funds has been a very successful combination of conditional fee arrangements with lawyers plus `after the event insurance'. I am sure the members of the opposition have never heard of this because they did not bother to go and look or seek any submissions from people who might have been able to provide some evidence about this. After the event insurance is an innovation in legal service delivery which enables people who otherwise would not undertake litigation because they are not in position to risk their own funds, to do so. These people are certainly not in a position to pay costs and possibly even indemnity costs, if they lose, yet they often have a proper case 
 that ought to be ventilated and ought to be allowed to go to court.</para><para>The after the event insurance scheme enables litigants to take out this insurance after their cause of action has matured and after they decide to litigate. It does not even require people to anticipate that they might have some need for access to the courts at some stage and be prudent and take out insurance against the event. This is after the event insurance. It has been part of a quite extensive overhaul of legal aid in the United Kingdom, yet this report does not even mention it, let alone examine it as a possibility to take the pressure off the legal aid budget. No, this report simply goes back to the old mantra that, if there is more money, then everything will work betterâwave a magic wand.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>N26</name.id><name role="metadata">ABETZ</name><name role="display">Senator Abetz</name></talker><para>âLike the $10.3 billion deficit.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>2M6</name.id><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator COONAN</name></talker><para>âYes, that is exactly right. That might have been the solution under Labor, but it is certainly not the solution that this government sees as being a sensible and prudent way to ensure that there is a proper delivery of legal services in this country.</para></talk.start></continue><para>It is not as if there was no evidence that might have indicated this during the course of the inquiry. A principled approach to the evaluation of the legal aid system requires a careful appraisal of the need for legal services and a decision as to the level to which taxpayers' money should fund that need. It is a perfectly unexceptional proposition. It also requires a balancing of interests between the community as a whole and individual rights and a rigorous approach to directing money for legal services so that it actually hits the target where it is most needed. The majority report fails to address this balance. It also does not address the issue that much of middle Australia is precluded from access to the justice system because of the expenses of the court system.</para><para>I would have thought that was something that would have concentrated the minds of the opposition well. Mr Robert Cornall, the Managing Director of Victoria Legal Aid identified this major issue in his evidence. He said: </para><para>The criticism you have made also assumes that the only issue here is between people who can afford trials and people who qualify for legal assistance. It fails to recognise the fact that middle Australia is largely excluded on both these counts.</para><para>The majority report must stand condemned in the eyes of the Australian people in that, despite the opposition having had a great opportunityâhaving trawled around the country a couple of times, having spun out this inquiry for over a yearâit does not even address the basic justice needs of the majority of Australians. It must stand condemned on that count alone.</para><para>A cursory look at the report shows that it is long on complaint but virtually devoid of any reasoned solutions supported by any data. It fails to provide a basis for any rigorous evaluation of the legal aid system. It is disappointing because the opportunity to identify and discuss imaginative proposals to modernise legal aid delivery systems in Australia has been overlooked in the political expediency of simply trying to score points against the government. I think that, with a topic as serious as legal aid, that is pretty important.</para><para>We have commended the efficiencies of the Queensland Legal Aid Commission. We have suggested that there is a fertile field in which to at least examine legal expense insurance. The opposition did not even look at the new reforms to criminal law cases that I spoke about in the adjournment debate a couple of nights ago: the sorts of efficiencies that mean that the legal aid dollar goes further and that people who do need access to legal aid get a better deal because the legal aid they get is more focused on providing an achievable outcome.</para><para>In summary, what I really want to say about this, particularly in answer to Senator McKiernan, is: do not look at whether our criticism is double spaced; look at the sensible suggestions it provides.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>4043</page.no><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name><name.id>SF4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI commend Senator McKiernan on the Legal and Constitutional References Committee report on legal aid.

One of the issues we have to face in the future is whether to keep calling what we are talking about, the legal aid system, or whether we have to start talking about the legal justice system. A lot of the problems that arise in this area come about because legal aid is seen as an addendum to the social security system rather than as a justice system. Senator McKiernan has given me a press cutting from the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline>  of Tuesday, 23 June 1998 which says that the Attorney-General of New South Wales has made available to the Director of Public Prosecutions extra funds. The last paragraph of the report reads:</para></talk.start></continue><para>The government has granted Mr Cowdery'sâ</para><para>May I say that Mr Cowdery is a man of outstanding ability and integrity and he has helped this committee with the issue of legal aidâ</para><para>request for more money with a $1.713 million increase in the 1998-99 Budget to $44.6 million.</para><para>He did that correctly because the justice system must work. But if the prosecution of offences is essential to the justice system in this community, so is the defence of those matters that are brought before the court by the DPP.</para><para>That is what Senator McKiernan is talking about, that issue of justice, in terms not only of the criminal law but of the law generally, whether it be civil or otherwise. If one of the core responsibilities and duties of a society and one of the reasons we have a society is to see justice done, then that society should ensure that people are able to put their case as well as they are able. They cannot do that if they are not properly defended. It is very difficult to defend yourself or to bring a case on your own behalf. At the last estimates 
 committee hearing Mr Brian Martin, the Federal DPP, said in response to a question about the emotions people have when they go to court that that is why the statement that anybody that defends himself has a fool for a lawyerâa classic statementâis correct, because of all the emotions that are involved. That is a reason, amongst many others, as to why people should be properly defended.</para><para>One of the things the government have to look at is the amount of law they make. It is all too common these days for governments of whatever colour to talk in terms of the need for law and order where in fact Australia is not a country that is threatened in any overwhelming sense by a lack of law and order. It is threatened by law and order but it is not threatened by crime in the way that the law and order people say it is. That is not to say there is not crime; of course there is, but it is nowhere near as extensive as is made out. One of the ways to solve the issue of legal aid is to make sure that there is less law to occasion the need for legal aid. That is one of the problems we have to face and Senator McKiernanâI hope he stays onâis sure to look at that issue in the future.</para><para>This is a good report. It shows a great understanding of what the need is for legal aid. There clearly has to be more spending on legal aid. Perhaps I ought to indicate an interest here. My daughter-in-law, Emma Hunt, as I have declared before in this place, is a community lawyer affected by the amount of legal aid funding that is available. But, in addition to being the occasion of my declaring an interest she is also a source of information about this area. I would just like to close by paying tribute to all those dedicated people who are community lawyersâand I think Senator Abetz would agree with me on this point. They do great, generous and underpaid work in a situation where they are up against the odds because they are not as well resourced as those opposed to them, and I would like to use this occasion to pay tribute to them.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>N26</name.id><name role="metadata">ABETZ</name><name role="display">Senator Abetz</name></talker><para>âI agree with you.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>SF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name></talker><para>âThank you, Senator Abetz.

Finally, I again pay tribute to the work and intellectual capacity of Senator McKiernan.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>4044</page.no><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator ABETZ</name><name.id>N26</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI commence my comments by complimenting the secretariat and staff for their hard work in the preparation of this legal aid report of the Legal and Constitutional References Committee. I also compliment Senator McKiernan on his chairmanship of the committee; unfortunately, I will not compliment him on the report. But the chairmanship and the running of the committee I think has been a tribute to the way in which this Senate committee system operates, and I want to put my thanks to Senator McKiernan on the record. I also place on record my thanks to Senator Helen Coonan, who with this report largely took the running on behalf of the government senators, and I compliment her on her very well reasoned commentary in the government senators' response to the third report.</para></talk.start><para>The report itself, however, is somewhat disappointing. The committee, I believe, used a lot of words to say nothing much at all. Senator McKiernan gave us a very impassioned speech about legal aid funding, but there seemed to be as much vim and vigour about it as in his railing against the injustice of $4 cappuccinos in the parliamentary dining room. If we are to take Senator McKiernan seriously about injustices within the community, I think he has to target those issues that he wants the community to believe him on. If he wants to be so concerned about $4 cups of cappuccino in the parliamentary dining room, with that being such a big justice issue, when he comes in here with the same vim and vigour complaining about legal 
 aid, I have to say to him that there is a bit of a credibility gap.</para><para>I have a few comments to make in relation to legal aid generally. When this government came into power, we faced a substantial budget deficit left by the previous government. Part of social justice is to ensure that this generation does not leave a legacy of debt for the next generation to pay offâa very important social justice issue, especially for the young people. I would like to think that, when I leave this parliament, there will be an inheritance, a positive inheritance, to pass on to the next generation, rather than a legacy of debt. So that is one very important point.</para><para>The other point is that even the previous government was starting to analyse legal aid contributions by the states and the Commonwealth to determine whether the states were paying their fair share. It appeared that they were not and, therefore, the Commonwealth embarked upon a decision to try to separate out Commonwealth legal aid matters from state legal aid matters. I think that was fair enough in all the circumstances.</para><para>The undertaking of this review of legal aid funding has brought together this country's directors of public prosecution and legal aid commissions, to sit them down and have a proper dialogue as to the way criminal cases ought be run in this country. Both sides have acknowledged that a lot of savings could be made, if a commonsense approach were to be taken to the running of criminal cases. With directors of public prosecutions being paid for by the taxpayer, legal aid being paid for by the taxpayer, I think the Australian taxpayer has a right to ask both sides of those criminal cases to try to come together, resolve the cases as much as possible and, thus, minimise trials and also minimise costs to the taxpayer, whilst still ensuring that justice prevails.</para><para>On the issue of justice and legal aid funding, the very real difficulty with legal aid is that, in itself, it does create injustices because it is not a bottomless pit. I am sure that many a time all senators in this place have had reports from constituentsâthe truck drivers, the factory workers of this countryâwho, because they are employed, are not entitled to 
 legal aid. Those on the other side in, let us say, a matrimonial matter are not working and, therefore, they are entitled to legal aid; they are basically able to dictate the outcome and the shots because they have the legal aid dollar available to them. The others who have to set up new homes on minimal wages are unable to afford the sort of legal representation that is provided to the person without employment. I think we need to keep that in mind as well.</para><para>In relation to discrimination cases and other matters of that nature, which were touched on by Senator McKiernan, it needs to be recognised that the vast majority of lawyers now will take those cases `on spec'âon speculation. The client comes, in the lawyer looks at the case and says, `Yes, I think you've got a good genuine case and, because I believe that, I will take the case right through to the end, and you can pay the costs at the end when we have won it.' I think that is a fair and reasonable system. Therefore, the poorest person can come into the office with a case and, if it is a justifiable and sustainable one, it will be run for them by the private profession.</para><para>It is appropriate that legal aid be made available for the class type actions that Senator McKiernan referred to, and that is allowed and continues. The report at pages 191 and 192 makes conclusions and recommendations in relation to the tax deductibility of legal expenses; it seeks to draw the conclusion that only big companies get the benefit of tax deductibility.</para><para>If I were up on a charge of trespass, for example, and I sought to defend that case, my legal costs would not be tax deductible, but if you are a Green senator you can get tax deductibility for your defence of charges. I refer senators to a speech I gave in this place on 20 June 1996 about a fundraising campaign that was undertaken to provide assistance to Senator-elect Brown. The document I read out said:</para><para>Court defences are very costly and those who place themselves in this position by standing up for the environment need our fullest support. The best way you can assist is to provide cash donations (any amount, $20 or more, whatever you can spare) to the fighting fund. Please forward your donations either direct to the Tarkine National Coalition orâ 
</para><para>and this is the important bitâ</para><para>for tax deductibility through the Tasmanian Conservation Trust Incorporated, marked for the Tarkine campaign.</para><para>So Senator Brown's defence was funded by donations, or part of it at leastâwe do not know how many donations he gotâby tax deductible donations. There was no real mention of that in the report, was thereâthat there is the other side to the question of tax deductibility? Why should a Green senator-elect get the benefit of tax deductibility for donations for him to run a defence when anybody else within the community is unable to get tax deductibility? Without putting too fine a point on it, Senator Brown and his supportersâor, if not Senator Brown, at least Mr Peter Sims, who was the coordinator of the Tarkine National Coalitionâwere basically running a bit of a scam.</para><para>There are always two sides to every story and, unfortunately, the majority report was very careful to ensure that only the one side was put down. Another example was in relation to Dietrich applications. Without going into all the detail as to what a Dietrich application is, the reality is that there have only been four such cases, yet the majority report would have us believe that the whole legal aid system has been brought to its knees because of the Dietrich application. But there have only been four of them, so, with respect, I think the report does not do full justice to the situation that is in front of us. I conclude, as I started, by complimenting the secretariat and Senator Coonan for the excellent work in preparing this report.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murray</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT ISLANDER HERITAGE PROTECTION BILL 1998</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>4046</page.no><id.no>r483</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>4046</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill received from the House of Representatives.</para><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ian Campbell</inline>) agreed to:</para><para>That this bill may proceed without formalities and be now read a first time.</para><para>Bill read a first time.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>4046</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>4046</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI table a revised explanatory memorandum and I move:</para></talk.start><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para><para>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> .</para><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The speech read as follows</inline>â</para><para>The introduction of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Bill 1998 (the bill) comes after a long process of consideration and review of the current regime for protecting indigenous heritage areas and objects in this country and will replace the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984 (the 1984 Act). While the 1984 Act was intended to be interim legislation which would operate as a forum of last resort when State or Territory processes were inadequate, this aim has not been realised, and considerable difficulties have been experienced with the Act as illustrated in the long running dispute over the proposed Hindmarsh Island bridge. Apart from the repeal of the sunset clause in 1986 and the insertion of Part IIA in 1987 which applies only in Victoria, the 1984 Act has not changed in the last 14 years, and reform of this legislation is now long overdue. Indeed a review commissioned by the previous government was already under way when this government came to office in 1996 with an election pledge to reform the Act. There is common agreement on the need for reform.</para><para>Indigenous Australians are often in a situation where places that hold particular cultural significance for them are located on land that is either privately or state owned. Sometimes these places are in remote and relatively undeveloped areas where they are safe from disturbance and no specific protection of them is required, nor indeed does the location of the significant area necessarily need to be revealed to anyone. However, there are times when new activities can pose a threat to a particularly significant area. Indigenous people require that where the integrity of such an area is under threat, there is a means available by which they can seek protection of that area. For the parties who are proposing to undertake an activity that may disturb a heritage area or object it is necessary that any claims for protection are dealt with in a fair, transparent and timely manner.</para><para>In order to achieve a fair and effective process for indigenous heritage protection a number of important changes are being introduced in the bill. In particular the Commonwealth heritage protection 
 regime will be reformed to address a number of difficulties with the operation of the 1984 Act and to clarify the respective roles of the Commonwealth and the States.</para><para>One of the major problems with the 1984 Act was the requirement that the Minister personally satisfy himself about the significance of areas or objects to indigenous people. The bill establishes a Director of Indigenous Heritage Protection, a statutory office holder who will advise the Minister on heritage protection. In particular the Director, rather than the Minister, will make assessments of the importance of areas or objects to indigenous people.</para><para>Another improvement in the operation of the Commonwealth's regime arises from our recognition that most heritage protection cases have more than one solution, and that with goodwill and a spirit of compromise on all sides, problems can often be resolved by the parties sitting down together and negotiating through the details of the case. The Commonwealth will therefore attempt to resolve cases through negotiation and mediation whenever possible. Furthermore, to meet a concern expressed by indigenous people, all activities undertaken by the Commonwealth under the bill will be subject to an improved process for protecting culturally sensitive information.</para><para>A significant objective of the bill is to strengthen State and Territory heritage protection regimes and to reduce the potential for confusion between the roles of the Commonwealth and the States and Territories. State or Territory regimes that meet a set of specified minimum standards will be accredited by the Commonwealth. While some State or Territory regimes may already come near to meeting the minimum standards, in others the move to accreditation will bring with it significant improvements in those regimes.</para><para>Let me now turn to the detail of key aspects of the legislation.</para><para>Madam President, the 1984 Act was reviewed by the Hon Elizabeth Evatt AC who reported to the government in 1996. Her report recommended a number of changes to the current heritage protection regime. One important recommendation was that the role of assessing the significance of an area for which protection was being sought should not be undertaken by the same person or body that would make the final decision about whether protection should be afforded or not. In order to implement this recommendation, the Director of Indigenous Heritage Protection will be the primary administrator of the Act, and will undertake a wide range of tasks in support of the Minister who will be the final decision maker in relation to long term protection of areas or objects.</para><para>The bill applies in the same way to both significant indigenous areas and objects, however, for simplici 
 ty I will just refer to areas. The scheme of protection where a State or Territory has not achieved accreditation is as follows. If an indigenous person has unsuccessfully pursued all possible remedies under an unaccredited State or Territory regime for protection of a significant area, then that person will be able to apply to the Commonwealth for protection of the area. The Commonwealth may provide emergency protection if the area is under immediate threat, and interim protection while the application is being considered. The Minister or the Director of Indigenous Heritage Protection will be able to reject an application that is judged to be frivolous or vexatious.</para><para>To ensure that all other potential applicants are aware of the applicationâand to preclude belated applications once an issue has been resolvedâthe Director will advertise seeking further applications at an early stage in the process. Once all applications have been received, the first step the Commonwealth will take is to facilitate negotiation and/or mediation to try and resolve the situation. Where an agreement is reached, the parties will be able to register the agreement under the new Act.</para><para>If mediation or negotiation is unsuccessful, the Director will prepare a report for the Minister that includes a finding about whether the area under dispute is significant in accordance with indigenous tradition and whether it is under threat. The Director will have at his or her disposal the means to investigate the veracity of claims, including through the engagement of expert consultants. In addition, the Director will seek submissions from other parties on the likely effects of protecting the area. The findings in the Director's report on significance and threat will be binding on the Minister, and will not require the Minister to view any information that is culturally sensitive.</para><para>Madam President, this process will rectify a significant flaw in the 1984 Act, namely the need for the Minister to be personally satisfied as to significance and threat. These issues will no longer be matters for the Minister to determine. Accordingly, any judicial review of the Minister's decision on whether or not to protect an area will not require indigenous people to `prove' the issue of significance in public.</para><para>If the Minister has grounds to believe the Director's findings are flawed through an inadequate process having been undertaken or through new information that has subsequently emerged, then the Minister may appoint an independent reviewer to make further findings, which in turn will bind the Minister.</para><para>In the interests of efficiency the Minister will be able to delegate many of the operational powers in the Act to the Director, but the Minister will always retain the final decision in relation to making long-term protection orders and the deci 
 sion to accredit a State or Territory regime. The power to issue a seven day emergency protection order in an unaccredited regime will be able to be delegated to specified officers, not only the Director. This will allow people on the spot to assess a possible emergency situation with the benefit of local knowledge. However, as a check on this delegated power, any extension of the seven day emergency protection will have to be approved by the Minister.</para><para>Consistent with the 1984 Act, the discovery of indigenous human remains in an unaccredited regime will be required to be reported to the Director. Where remains are delivered to the Director he or she will consult with the relevant indigenous community about their appropriate handling.</para><para>In order to ensure that any of the processes undertaken under the bill do not require indigenous people to unnecessarily reveal confidential indigenous information, such information will be exempted from demands for public release under both the <inline font-style="italic">Freedom of Information Act 1982</inline>  and the <inline font-style="italic">Archives Act 1983</inline> .</para><para>Madam President, given that the States and Territories are generally responsible for planning and development decisions in relation to land management, we are prepared to accredit State or Territory regimes that meet the minimum standards in the bill. The incentive for States and Territories to achieve accreditation will come from the Commonwealth absenting itself from involvement in State or Territory decision-making once a State or Territory is accredited, except in cases when protection may be in the national interest.</para><para>Honourable Senators should note that these standards are a minimum, and they will in no way prevent States or Territories from going further if they wish, or retaining their existing legislation if it already represents best practice. In recognition of the importance of the decision to accredit a State or Territory it will be subject to disallowance by the Parliament. In addition, where an accredited State or Territory changes its legislation in such a way that it no longer meets the standards, the Commonwealth Minister will consult with that State or Territory, and may then revoke the accreditation.</para><para>In order for a State or Territory to achieve accreditation it will need to include a number of features in its heritage protection legislation. Firstly the State or Territory will need to provide protection of significant indigenous areas and objects, and that protection must be backed up by adequate penalties. Indigenous people must be recognised as the main source of information about the significance of those areas and objects. Secondly, to ensure that indigenous people can speak freely and, if necessary, in confidence under the State or Territory 
 legislation it must provide protection for confidential indigenous information and prevent it from being publicly revealed if such a revelation would cause harm or distress. However, while these restrictions are necessary, other parties must still be treated fairly and be given an opportunity to put their views and be told the reasons for decisions to protect areas or objects.</para><para>In relation to indigenous human remains, the minimum standards will require State or Territory legislation not only to protect those remains where they are significant to indigenous people, but also ensure that any remains that are found must be reported to the relevant State Minister so they can be dealt with appropriately.</para><para>Alongside the processes for protection of heritage areas and objects there must be a system whereby other parties can seek approval to undertake activities in relation to such areas or objects. This will ensure that unnecessary delays or Court battles, such as we have seen at Hindmarsh Island, can be avoided. Therefore the minimum standards require that a State or Territory promote negotiated outcomes between those who want to undertake an activity and the indigenous people concerned to protect an area. In addition, the minimum standards require the provision of a process whereby a developer can seek early approval for a proposed activity. This may include relevant indigenous people and an appropriate State authority assessing the proposal and determining whether there are any heritage sites at risk.</para><para>Once a State or Territory has a legislative system in place reflecting the minimum standards, the Commonwealth Minister will be able to accredit that State or Territory regime for the purposes of the Commonwealth Act.</para><para>Where a State or Territory has achieved accreditation, all indigenous heritage protection will be dealt with by the State or Territory. However, in rare cases there may be a need for the Commonwealth to step in where, at the State level, a decision not to protect an area reflects the local interests in the case, but does not recognise that the area is one that should be protected in the national interest. Given the significance of such a case it will be handled by the Minister who may facilitate negotiation and require a report to be made by the Director. However, these processes will not be mandatory, given that an accredited State or Territory regime will already have undertaken a thorough assessment of the case. The only requirement on the Minister will be that he or she consult the relevant State or Territory Minister about the case and the consequences of protecting the area in question.</para><para>Transitional provisions are included in the bill in relation to Part IIA of the 1984 Act which applies only in the State of Victoria. The Victorian 
 Government plans to pass new State indigenous heritage protection legislation, and to ensure that that legislation will be able to operate, Part IIA will be repealed simultaneously with the enactment of the State legislation.</para><para>In conclusion, I would like to say that reform of indigenous heritage protection legislation is long overdue. The 1984 Act was introduced as a temporary measure only and has presented many difficulties for indigenous people, other interests, and governments administering the Act. I am pleased that we will be able to address these problems through this new more comprehensive legislation. This bill will ensure that a fair and transparent process is established for the protection of indigenous heritage at both the Commonwealth and State levels, that duplication and overlap is diminished and that nationally significant areas can be protected.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Conroy</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>VETERANS' ENTITLEMENTS AMENDMENT (GOLD CARD) BILL 1998</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>4049</page.no><id.no>r550</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>4049</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill received from the House of Representatives.</para><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ian Campbell</inline>) agreed to:</para><para>That this bill may proceed without formalities and be now read a first time.</para><para>Bill read a first time.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>4049</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>4049</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI move:</para></talk.start><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para><para>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> .</para><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The speech read as follows</inline>â</para><para>It is almost eighty years since an armistice restored peace after the war that the entire world thought would end all wars. Sadly, peace did not last. However the Australian repatriation system, born at the same time, to care for those who returned from the Great War, has not only endured but evolved to meet the ever changing needs of the veteran community.</para><para>Today, we remain true to the goals of repatriation. More importantly, after eighty years we continue 
 to improve the benefits provided to those Australians whose service deserves our ongoing recognition and practical assistance.</para><para>This bill contains the most significant expansion of veterans' benefits for many years.</para><para>From 1 January 1999, eligibility for a Repatriation Health CardâFor All Conditions, better known as a Gold Card, will be extended to Australian veterans aged 70 or over, who faced danger from hostile forces of the enemy during World War 2. This will provide these veterans with the certainty and comfort that comes with knowing that their health needs will always be met.</para><para>Full health care benefits were extended to World War I veterans fifty-five years after the end of that conflict. In providing this further extension of the Gold Card, Australian World War II veterans aged 70 years and over with World War II qualifying service, will receive the same benefit fifty-four years after the end of that war.</para><para>The criterion on which this extension of eligibility is based, is the "incurred danger" test, formally known as `qualifying service'. This qualifying service must have occurred during the `period of hostilities' as defined in the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. This covers the period from 3 September 1939 to 29 October 1945, inclusive.</para><para>Qualifying service is also a criterion for Service Pension. Service pension was introduced in 1936 for those veterans who served in a theatre of war. It was intended to recognise that these veterans faced danger from hostile forces of the enemy, and endured the deprivations, the horror and the hardship of battle.</para><para>World War 2 veterans with qualifying service are now an average age of 76. Their health care is a very high priority for this Government.</para><para>This initiative extends to an estimated additional 50,000 veterans a comprehensive range of health care services, including private patient hospital care.</para><para>Other health services provided through the Gold Card include:</para><para>.	 choice of doctor;</para><para>.	 pharmaceuticals at the concessional rate;</para><para>.	 optical care;</para><para>.	 physiotherapy;</para><para>.	 dental care;</para><para>.	 podiatry care and products; and</para><para>.	 chiropractic services.</para><para>Eligible veterans, that is those aged 70 or over, with World War 2 qualifying service, will be eligible for these benefits regardless of their level of income or assets and irrespective of whether they have war-caused disabilities or conditions. 
</para><para>They will join an estimated 260,000 veterans who already have a Gold Card. Of the 50,000 additional veterans expected to become newly eligible for a Gold Card, approximately 17,000 are current holders of a White Cardâthat is they are only eligible for health treatment for their war-caused disabilities and conditions.</para><para>This initiative, costing around $500 million over four years, is an important means of recognising the willing sacrifice made by veterans in Australia's time of need and of expressing our profound gratitude for their courage and dedication.</para><para>Extension of the Gold Card has been a top priority of the Government and also of the Returned &amp; Services League and other ex-service organisations.

I do not favour the Democrat amendment because it seems to me on a plain reading of it that it is not as comprehensive as the change we would seek to make in our amendment. What we are dealing with here is whether company reports to shareholders, which are then open for public examination by anyone in the community, should disclose the remuneration of the top five executives of a corporation. It is a matter of notorious reporting that we now have in Australia many senior executives who are paid in excess of $1 million a year.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3L6</name.id><name role="metadata">CONROY</name><name role="display">Senator Conroy</name></talker><para>âPlus options and extras.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>RF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name></talker><para>âPlus a series of options in shares, plus a whole series of other fringe benefits. To calculate the real remuneration of the total package is complex in any case. The contention being put here by the Democrats, shared by us and by the Greens, is that the actual figures of the remuneration of the top five executives of listed corporations in Australia should be reported in the annual report, that all the elements that make up the package should also be reported, and that the principles which a company has arrived at to decide that they are the appropriate levels of remuneration should also be set out. It seems 
 to me, with greatest respect to the Democrat amendment, that that is more comprehensively done in our amendment. That is why I would prefer our amendment.</para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>4052</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI will be as brief as possible. Senator Murray is right; this debate has already effectively been had. I did come up with a draft resolution, which I have circulated to people involved in this debate, which would be the government's preferred position. I will quickly outline that. If the Democrat and Labor amendments were to fail, I have foreshadowed that, added to the things that we have already agreed and that the government has blessed in terms of going to the parliamentary committee to inquire into in relation to these corporate governance issues, the Senate would formally requestâI will quickly summarise this for the sake of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> âin terms of passing a resolution to do so that the committee on corporations inquire into and report, as part of its inquiry into the Corporate Law Economic Reform Bill, on the enhancement of mandatory disclosures of the remuneration of directors.</para></talk.start><para>I have gone on to say that that same working group that is doing the work on MD&amp;As be asked to make a submission. So that would be the parliament asking themâvery nicely, because we are not paying themâto do some work on the best way of exposing directors' remuneration. I think Senator Cook has just sparked a good debate about how you do it best. The Labor amendment sits fairly easily with me because it talks about each element of remuneration. That may well be the right way to skin the cat. I am not expert enough to know whether it is. The government believes in transparency and believes in this sort of disclosure. That is why we are very keen to have it looked at seriously.</para><para>The parliamentary committee on corporations, even though it had a submission saying that we should do this and recommended that we should, did not have it as part of its terms of reference in either of the inquiries into this bill. It was not formally part of its terms of 
 reference because it was not in the bill; it was an add-on. I have always said to people publicly and privately that I would like to see this looked into by a serious inquiry.</para><para>I go on to say that the committee would look at the best form of disclosure and report on the ASX listing rule requirementâand I differentiate the MD&amp;A thing, which is a best practice under a listing rule, which isn't a requirement; it is not mandatory. And I say look at a listing rule that would make it a requirement to make this disclosure. So it would achieve the same end as the Labor Party amendment because it would apply to all listed companies. It is a matter of whether an ASX listing rule requirementâactually a listing requirement; if you don't do it, you get delistedâwould be the best way to achieve enhanced disclosure for listed companies or whether an amendment to the Corporations Law is preferable. So it is saying: can the ASX require it of all listed companiesâwhich is what the Labor Party seeks to do with its amendmentâor should it be in the law? So report on that issue, which is the core issue we are really talking about.</para><para>The committee would also seek the views of small business representativesâI guess we are telling them how to suck eggs by telling the committee to do that; I hope they would do that anywayâin relation to whether enhanced mandatory disclosure should apply to unlisted entities. That would specifically ask them to look at the Democrats' proposal, which I understand would go to all reporting entitiesâany company in Australia with more than 50 members. Specifically the committeeâwhich I know they would do anyway; even if they didn't, they would receive them anywayâwould seek the views of the shareholder and consumer representatives in its deliberations.</para><para>So that is the idea I am putting on the table. Rather than just talking about it, I have drafted it in a resolution. I think that has been distributed to people interested in the debate. I foreshadow that if both amendments were to fail, I would move that on behalf of the government as a resolution of the Senate. My officers have discussed with the Democrat advisers the concept of putting into this 
 motion those other matters we had agreed to have referred formally so that it was a direction to that committee from the Senate in relation to all the other matters.</para><para>That is my proposal in relation to directors' remuneration. I indicate that, in any event, we would be voting against the Democrat amendment because I believe the Labor amendment is preferable. In those circumstances, I would prefer the Senate to pass the Labor amendment. I also suggest that Senator Harradineâ</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>DX5</name.id><name role="metadata">MARGETTS</name><name role="display">Senator Margetts</name></talker><para>âSo you are voting for the Labor amendment?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name></talker><para>âWhat I am saying is that we would prefer the Labor amendment.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>DX5</name.id><name role="metadata">MARGETTS</name><name role="display">Senator Margetts</name></talker><para>âThis is ridiculous.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name></talker><para>âNo, it is not ridiculous, Senator Margetts. My vote will not matter because, if the Labor amendment gets up, the Senate will pass it. If Senator Harradine votes for the Labor amendment it will become the amendment. I will be voting against the Democrats amendment and the Labor Party have indicated that they will be, so the Democrats amendment is likely to fail. The government's preference between the two is the Labor amendment.</para></talk.start></continue><para>For the record, I would like to respond to a small point that Senator Conroy made yesterday, and this is an appropriate time to do it. He referred to Stan Wallis and his remuneration. I do not want to misquote you but you said something along the lines that people should know what Mr Wallis earns. I got my officers to ring the Stock Exchange to get a copy of the relevant pages of the annual report of Amcor. On page 38 it shows that Mr Wallis hasâand this is a point that Senator Conroy made by interjection just thenâ373,439 fully paid ordinary shares of $1, another 200,000 partly paid 1c shares, 200,000 partly paid shares of 5c and 400,000 options.</para><para>I do this to illustrate that we are not standing here saying that we do not want more disclosure; we are saying that there is already disclosure. The government thinks that is good but that there should be a good public debate and a detailed inquiry into that disclos 
 ure, which have not taken place. No-one here can say that there has been an inquiry at any level or by any expert committee in this country about directors' remuneration, at least in the last decade. That is the government's view and I am willing to see that debate.</para><para>The government believes that the Labor amendment is probably the sort of thing that should happen in Australia. It is a question to us as to whether that should be done through a listing rule requirement or whether it should be done in the Corporations Law. I have an open mind about that and I know the Treasurer does.</para><para>Just to conclude on Mr Stan Wallis, if you turn to page 58 of Amcor's current annual report, it shows up the break-up of the remuneration of directors and executives. I think it is illustrative of the disclosure we have at the moment. Senator Cook, Senator Murray and Senator Margetts, I have not done you the courtesy of showing you these documents but they are public documents and they are on the ASX and ASC databases. It is the annual report of Amcor; you will have to trust me on that.</para><para>This is illustrative of where remuneration disclosure is at the moment. It shows that there is one executive in the band between $240,000 and $250,000. One could reasonably assume that that might be Mr Wallis. That is a worthy part of the debate. If you look at the schedule on page 58, which I will also incorporate, there is one executive between $240,000 and $250,000. I may have undersold Mr Wallis, because that is the lowest band.

The parliamentary secretary did us the courtesy this morning of circulating to us the motion that he was proposing which would refer this matter to a parliamentary committee for further inquiry and report. I thank him for that courtesy. I understand the reasons why the government might wish to do that. It is 
 my understanding that the joint parliamentary committee has talked about this matter before on two occasions, but it may well be true that no explicit term of reference has been given and so explicitly they have not been charged to do so.

Okay. I accept that interjection and let it appear in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> . Notwithstanding that, we would want to press this amendment quite strongly.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I do not think this is a complicated matterâand I say that, of course, having had a career in industrial relations of some 17 yearsâwhen you are talking about disclosing executive remuneration, the principles upon which executive remuneration are being determined, and each element of executive remuneration. I say that perhaps from the arrogance of someone who has spent so long in the field of industrial relations. In any case, for the man and the woman in the street I do not think this is a complicated matter that requires that type of shelving, although I accept the government's view that it is not trying to shelve it. But the effect would be to shelve this thing and get it out of the way for a time.</para><para>Having explained my position, I will come to the merit of this amendment. We have in Australia a situation in which the wage levels of most people who are in the employed work force are publicly known, either through awards or disclosed terms of agreements. We have a situation where the wage levels of senior executives, many of whom earn in excess of a million dollars, are not publicly known and are reported on only because of some investigative journalist trying to work out what their levels are.</para><para>The state of the law is such that companies are not compelled to disclose the full extent of executive remuneration; they are obliged only to disclose in what salary bands their executives are placedâand we do not know the full extent of executive remuneration. I say `remuneration' because it is not just a 
 matter of how much money they receive; it is a matter of how many shares they are given in their company, how much access to share options they are given, and how many other fringe benefits make up the total salary package.</para><para>Taking for the moment the point of view of shareholders, I think shareholders who are the owners of a company are not told what the executives that run that company on behalf of the shareholders receive for doing the job that the shareholders delegate them to do. It should be a basic entitlement, I think, that shareholders should have that information.</para><para>I am bolstered in that conviction because other countries insist that this information be disclosed. Notably, the United States does. I am bolstered in that conviction as well because some major Australian companies do this voluntarily although they are not compelled by law to do it. I acknowledge them and I respect them for, in fact, pursuing an open and transparent policy on executive remuneration and keeping their shareholders informed, keeping them in the loop. One of the most publicly recognised companies that does this is Westpac. It is a major Australian company. All we are saying is that the law should provide that all listed companies do this.</para><para>There are a couple of arguments that I would like to put while accepting that the government has acknowledged that it is not opposed to the principle; it is concerned only about how that principle might best be implemented. But I put these arguments to the government expressly because I think it might, if you like, help assuage the caution that it is expressing on this point.</para><para>The first thing is that, if we look at this situation from the point of view of the Treasurer, we see the figures on wages are running ahead of the figures on the inflation rate. Pretty soon, if my experience in this field is any judge, we will start hearing a clamouring by captains of Australian industry that workers in Australia are getting paid too much and they ought to exercise wage restraint. Without going into whether that is a right or a wrong call, it is morally reprehensible that those calling on people to exercise wage restraint 
 have their own remuneration mysteriously hidden and inaccessible to the public.</para><para>When I was a minister in the Hawke and Keating governments, and Minister for Industrial Relations during the period 1990 to 1993, through the wages accord with the ACTU we agreed on voluntary wage restraint by unions in this country and kept wages down so that we could grow the economy at a faster pace and, presumably, that would create more jobs. The trade-off was lower wages and more jobs for everyoneâan egalitarian trade-off and a laudable one.</para><para>But what thwarted that at every turn was that we also kept our eye on executive remuneration. The respected consultancy, Cullen Egan Dell, regularly surveyed the level of executive remuneration. The same people who were telling workers to draw in the reins and tighten their belts were getting remuneration at levels two and three times greater than the people they were lecturing. If there was not an example of hypocrisy in that, there is never an example of hypocrisy. It is one thing to say,`Do as I tell you, but do not do as I do.' That was what was happening and no wonder workers on the job were saying, `If we are being told to exercise restraint, why don't those people who run this company do the same?'</para><para>Looking at the general situation, if anyone wants to preach about wage restraint in the futureâand I certainly am not going to be in that camp, but if anyone on the conservative side of politics wishes to do itâthey had better make sure that all wages of all employees, because a managing director is no more than that, are known. The same restraint should apply to everyone irrespective of their station so that it is not a hypocritical situation of `Don't do as I do, do as I tell you.' That is an absolute and basic right and entitlement. If things are going to be fair in the work force, that is basic and absolute.</para><para>The second point I make about this is the extraordinary bases upon which executive remuneration is determined. There are many cases of major public companies in Australia where the senior executives get wage increases or salary package increases at the very time that the value of the shares of those com 
 panies are declining and the value of the companies, in fact, are contracting. In plain language and in plain scrutiny, you would say that these companies are failing while the executives are getting higher rewards for presiding over that situation. It is incredible that that is the case.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>C16</name.id><name role="metadata">HEFFERNAN</name><name role="display">Senator Heffernan</name></talker><para>âThe same as the AIDC.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>RF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name></talker><para>âYou have got a bugbear about that, Senator Heffernan.

Let us keep with this issue. Shareholders, who are seeing the value of their shares decline while executive remuneration increases, are entitled to know on what basis these decisions are made and washed through meetings of shareholders. What are the criteria by which you access managerial performance and, beyond that, managerial reward? Shareholders are certainly and definitely entitled to know that. This amendment will require that to be reported in the annual report so that there can then be an argument as to whether those executives have met the criteria.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">CAMPBELL</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Campbell</name></talker><para>âI am going to concede this now.

Can I 
 reinforce that? I said to Senator Murray privately that one of the problems with this way of legislating company law is unintended consequence. One of them has been pointed out to me and it is going to require that the company committee report on this anyway.</para></talk.start><para>One of the problems with your amendment, which I do not think can be fixed here, is that the terminology is wrong. There is no definition of remuneration in the Corporations Law. The best advice I can get on the run is that the word should actually be `emoluments', because that is what the definition is, and I refer you to section 9 of the Corporations Law. The definition of `emoluments' there is:</para><para>. . . the amount or value of any money, consideration or benefit . . . </para><para>Then it goes on to say that it does not include `reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses'. So there is some discussion of all of this and some confusion. My advice is that if you put in this amendment it may not have the desired effect. But it is just an example of not knowing what the effect of it is because it has not been looked at, and the formulation of the words may not achieve the result because it has not been consulted onâyou have not had a public inquiry.</para><para>But we will now allow this to go through. If we can try to fix it up in the other place to make it work we will do so. We have had to do that with an amendment that was made to the  Managed Investments Bill 1997  by this place. We have been told by the legal people at the Securities Commission that the amendment we made in relation to the capital adequacy requirements is ineffective because of poor drafting and will have no effect. It is not able to be implemented because of the same problem. It is not an unusual problem; it occurs with lots of legislation. But to speed the debate, because we want this bill through and we want to start the scheme by 1 July, I am going to not to oppose and we can have the vote put now.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>4062</page.no><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name><name.id>RF4</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIn view of your explanation, I seek leave to amend further my amendment by removing the word `remuner

It began life as a technical bill and there were a minimum number of important amendments put to it. However, events are 
 overtaking the Senate in the sense that the second amending bill to the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 is unlikely to see the light of day before an election. That is the latest opinionâmaybe I am wrong. If that is so, this will be the only time the Senate within this electoral cycle will be able to address the Commonwealth Electoral Act, and it is vital that a number of matters be dealt with, in the view of the various participants in the electoral process.</para></talk.start><para>I note in particular the Labor Party's amendment on trusts and I note our own amendments on trusts. As a result of discovering that this bill is our only opportunity, we have brought forward some further amendments which we believe are relevant and important to the continuing reform and improvement of the act. Some of those amendments derive from AEC recommendations, some derive from recommendations which we put in our minority report in June 1997 on the 1996 federal election, and some of them derive from events which we regard as deserving immediate attention.</para><para>In the second reading debate I wanted to pick up on the issue of truth in advertising. The Australian Democrats have actively campaigned since the early 1980s to introduce truth in political advertising legislation in Australia. I am aware that the Special Minister of State, Senator Minchin, is sympathetic, possibly because he comes from South Australia, where they have had such legislation in place for over a decade. Frankly, it works very effectively. It has not acted to hinder proper political debate and discussion but it has acted to improve the nature of truthfulness in the way political advertising is conducted there.</para><para>The South Australian legislation has been tested in the full court of the Supreme Court of South Australia, where it was found not to impede the implied right of freedom of speech and was therefore held to be constitutionally valid. Given the success of that legislation, the Australian Democrats have consistently urged similar legislation be adopted by the Commonwealth. Former Australian Democrat Senator Michael Macklin was a very strong proponent of this and such a provision did 
 briefly make it into Commonwealth law in 1983âbut it was repealed, I think in 1984.</para><para>From our point of view, we have always thought that is a great pity. As long-term senators in this place know, on every occasion that the electoral act comes up, we take that opportunity to return this to the agenda. I do know that there is some cross-party support amongst various senators for this concept. Accordingly, we will be putting that matter before the chamber again in the debate.</para><para>I pre-advise Senator Minchin, who at present is in the chamber, that, with regard to the debate, I will attempt to speak very briefly on issuesâunless considerable debate is engendered, in which case I will respond. But I think most of the issues would be well understood by the participants, since they are all very familiar with the act. I think a large number of them have been or are members of the JCSEM, as I am at present, and they therefore would be on top of the issues. Senator Minchin, although I do have a fair string of amendments, as you would have identified, I do not intend to make a meal out of it. I therefore pre-advise you accordingly.</para><para>I have circulated the amendmentsâsome of them over many weeks and others very recently. I apologise now for some of them having been circulated only recently. As I have said to you, it is a consequence of our discovery that this probably will be the only bill on the act to be dealt with prior to the election.</para><para>The other concern I will put briefly before the Senate in my speech during the second reading debate refers to a submission I made to the Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee on the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill (No. 2) in which I dealt with the further regulation of political parties. It is my belief that that is a vital and critical area. We have prepared some extensive amendments in draft to pursue that agenda. But we recognise that all parties need the opportunity and time to consider them.</para><para>I have referred my submission to the joint committee for consideration and, therefore, I will not be moving those amendments at this time because I think it would be too difficult and too involved an issue to debate. But I do 
 draw them again to the minister's attention. I hope that all parties and all Independents will look at them with some interest and see whether there is any merit in the ideas we have put before you. I do not intend to do much more now in my speech on the second reading debate. I look forward to the committee stage.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>4071</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThere is no greater temptation for political parties to show their worst colours than when it comes to electoral legislation. In this piece of electoral legislation, the <inline ref="r408">Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill 1998</inline> , we can see, serially, advantage being given to incumbents, and disadvantage being dished out to people who are aspirants to political office.</para></talk.start><para>I have and will flag a number of Green points of opposition to this legislation. The first is the increase in nomination fees from $250 to $350 in the House of Representatives, and from $500 to $700 in the Senate. That is a monetary barrier being put in the way of candidates standing for office. It makes it more difficult for new candidates who are less likely to be elected.</para><para>The big parties are aware that electoral funding will see them, by and large, get their nomination moneys returned. But they are very well aware that, for people who want to stand particularly as independents and for the quite large number of small parties around the country, this ends up being a penalty. If you are standing for the Senate on the presumption that you will get 1,000 votes and that 1,000 citizens deserve the right to be able to vote for you, you will have to put up $700 knowing that you will lose it. Incumbent politicians know that this is a good way of keeping out other intending persons from election nomination.</para><para>Under this legislation, hand in hand with these increases is the requirement for an increase in the number of signatures for independent candidates from six to 50. If the mayor of a rural city wants to stand, she or he no longer has to get only six signatures from other people good and true in the community; they have to traipse around and get 50. I believe that, if a person wants to stand for 
 parliament, they should be able to stand for parliamentâand that should be good enough. But, with an increase in the number of signatures that must be obtained from people within the community to endorse your right to stand, this legislation increases by eightfold the difficulty of standing for parliament. Once again, it is making it harder for independents.</para><para>I do not have to draw the Senate's attention to the fact that, with their placement on ballot papers, independents are discriminated against in a most unfair fashion. Whereas the parties line up for a vote as to where they are placed on the ballot paper, all hoping to get the No. 1 position to take advantage of the donkey vote, the Independents are relegated to last place, whether they like it or not. The parties in this parliament have made this law to keep Independents from having the same chance of electoral advantage that they get; in other words, the incumbents have used their power in parliament to discriminate against intending candidates who are independent. The parties have used the advantage they have to advantage themselves further in the election nominating process or the placement on the ballot process.</para><para>It is quite unfair that nomination fees are being increased by 40 per cent, and the number of signatures required for Independents to get a valid nomination is being increased by 800 per cent. It is all the worse that this legislation is being brought in on the eve of an election.</para><para>It is unfortunate that there is not greater clarity of mind in this place and a sense of fairness which says, `Our political opponents who are Independents should not be discriminated against at all, let alone on the eve of an election.' But I do not expect we will see such a sense of fairness coming to the surface.</para><para>The Greens also oppose the tendency to give out information on electors. People are compelled to be on the electoral role. The legislation intends that, for example, the gender and date of birth of people on the electoral role may be given to health screening and medical research groups. Where does this end? Who has consulted the Australian electorate as to whether they want their 
 gender and date of birth distributed to unknown health screening and medical research groups?</para><para>If that is not bad enough, this broadening range of information is to be given out to political parties and parliamentarians. Why is that? To give them the drop again on people who are aspirants to parliament but who are not in here; to again weigh the tables in favour of incumbents. It is so that, once unsuspecting electors abide by the law and give the information to the electoral office, that information will be passed on to politicians so that they can approach them with a false sense of familiarity to inveigle them for their vote in a way in which non-parliamentarians cannot. So, again, it is weighing the odds in favour of incumbents against aspirants. It is democratically unsound to support such an unfair process. But it appears it is going to get support in this place.</para><para>I have flagged legislation in this place to enable the holding of a referendum to amend section 44 of the constitution to enable the 1Â½ million Australians who are currently prevented by section 44 from standing for parliament because they are employed by the Crownâin other words, because they are public servantsâor because they have dual nationalityâfor example, Australian nationality along with Greek, New Zealand or Chinese nationalityâto do so. And that is not going to get the tick. On the eve of an election, were we fair democrats, we would be trying to ensure that we were moving towards giving citizens their rights. So I have moved to have 1Â½ million Australians who are deprived of a basic democratic right to stand for parliament because of their jobs given that right through referendum. But the government says, `Oh no, we can't do that. It is too late. It would take too long. We want to bring in more comprehensive legislation.' We have more comprehensive legislation before us now and the whole tenor of that more comprehensive legislation, far from increasing the democratic rights of Australians, is to narrow those rights, constrict them, and give advantage to self-seeking politicians who are already in the parliament. </para><para>But, if there is one thing that I think caps this off, it is the provision in this legislation to abolish the Australian people's right to take what is called `the Langer option'âto repeal section 329A of the act which makes it a formal vote to vote for someone of your choice but to deny your preferences to people you do not like. As we all know, the Langer option, for example, gives somebody who wants to vote for the Democrats, the Greens or an Independent the opportunity to put 1 next to a candidate's name and, if they do not like the big parties, to then put 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, so that none of the big parties get a preference. Or it could be the other way around. At the last election, nearly 50,000 Australians took that option because they were alerted to it by Albert Langer, who was prepared to risk going to jail, and finally pay for his democratic principles by going to jail, because he defied a court order which said, as is in the current act, `That is a valid vote, but you cannot advocate it.'</para><para>It is worth noting that, because of Albert Langer's stand, the number of people taking this option, which allowed them to escape giving preferences to people they do not like and do not want to give preferences to, increased from some 7,000 or 8,000 in 1993 to 49,000 in 1996. You can guarantee that, were we not on the eve of an election moving to disqualify the votes of people who intelligently take that option, the number could have gone well into the hundreds of thousands this time around.</para><para>Here is a classic case of the Labor, Liberal and National parties getting together to withdraw a valid voting option from the Australian people because they want to advantage themselves. At a time when more and more Australians find that the two-party system does not hold any advantage or attraction to them and are voting for other options, here we have the big parties getting together and saying, `We will force you to vote for us. We will force you to have the two-party preferred option because we have to shore up the two-party system.'</para><para>I will point to what is happening in Tasmania at this juncture. There all three parties hold what is called the balance of power, but 
 Labor have decidedâcurmudgeons, as they areâto stand out of their responsibility on behalf of their voters to take office as a minority government. For the first time in the world, a labor party has said, `We will not take office until we get it totally to ourselves, because we are not able to reflect in office the diversity of views that there are in the electorate.' As a result, the responsible Greens led by Christine Milne in Tasmania, have supported budgets of the conservative Rundle Liberal government in the Tasmanian parliament.</para><para>What is the response to this in Tasmania where the Hare-Clark system is the fairest voting system of any house of government in Australia? It is for the Labor Party to say, `We will not respond to the electorate's vote; we will not accept the electorate's vote. We will move in to change the voting system. We cannot accept the way the electorate votes for us. We will change the voting system, so that, instead of having five electorates with seven people coming from each electorate into the parliament with candidates needing to win one-eighth of the vote to become representatives, we will change it to five seats of five people. We will raise the bar for candidates from some 12 per cent to some 16 or 17 per cent in the hope that we get rid of the Greens. The people have shown repeatedly that they want the Greens in Tasmanian parliament. The only way we can trample over the democratic wish of the electorate in Tasmania is to change the rules.' It is just the same as us here in the Senate changing the rules to disadvantage those people who want to vote for independents or the smaller parties.</para><para>The Liberals in Tasmania have responded with a four by seven option. The extraordinary thing is that in Tasmania the Fourth Estate, which you would think would be in favour of supporting democratic principles come hell or high water, are supporting, not those democratic principles, but the Labor Party in its move to try to get rid of the Greens.</para><para>And they are frank about it. Editorial columns in the <inline font-style="italic">Examiner</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Hobart Mercury</inline>, Wayne Crawford's column last weekend and the opinion pages of the <inline font-style="italic">Hobart 
 Mercury</inline> are saying in effect that we have to get the Greens out of thereâthose voted for validly by the Tasmanian electorateâbecause big business wants it; that is my interpretation. And the best way to do this is to degrade the best, most democratic system of voting anywhere in Australia.</para><para>Let me sound a warning to my friends the Democrats in this place. Caving in to this form of restriction of the voters' rights is a presage to pressure from the big parties to change the democratic way in which this Senate is elected. We have heard both the coalition and the Labor Party disparaging the Senate. We have heard the different formulations from both big parties for trammelling the democratic way in which this chamber is elected.</para><para>What do we have here? The Democrats are not only saying, `We will support the abolition of the Langer option,' which 50,000 Australians deliberately sought out and followed at the last election; they are saying, `It is not strong enough. We want to extend it.' The Democrats are coming in over this tawdry exercise by the big parties and saying, `We want to go further and ensure that we screw down the options of Australians voting in the Senate below the line by denying them the Langer option.'</para><para>I cannot understand it. If there ever was a defining moment between the Greens and the Democrats, this is it. The Democrats, in saying, `We want to get rid of this democratic option,' are being totally untrue to the name of their party. I do not understand the logic of Senator Murray saying that Labor and the Liberal and National parties have not gone far enough in curbing the right of the very thoughtful voters who deliberately say, `We want to vote Green, Democrat or Independent, but not give our preference to the big parties.' They are moving amendments in here to make sure that those people who want to vote that way for the Senate will have their votes not counted and disqualified. What sort of faith is that in thoughtful Australian voters?</para><para>The test in this place when it comes to democracy is that we defend it, even if it is to our own disadvantage. I would have thought that in this situation the Democrats 
 would be advantaged by the Langer option. I would have thought that their courageous interpretation here would be that they should go for democracy anyway. It might give them a warm feeling and might be in their interests as a smaller party to support people who want to take the option of voting for independents or small parties and not be forced to cast a preference for the policies of the Labor, National and Liberal parties, because they so often line up the same. If we look at uranium mining, they are all in favour of export of one form or another. If we look at woodchipping, Labor in Tasmania wants to woodchip even further into world heritage forests. Then there is the coalition. If we look at economic rationalism and privatisation when they are in office, we can see why people do not want to give support to the big parties.</para><para>But here we have the Democrats saying, `The big parties are not going far enough. They are not restricting voters' choice enough. We want to go further.' They part company with the Greens at this juncture. We will be voting against this effort to curtail the proper democratic rights of the Australian people. What we should be doing in here is validating both the Langer option and the right to advocate it. There is a fair deal of gutlessness and self-interest involved in this. Obviously, we do not have the numbers and this will go through.</para><para>Last night I had a call from a person who follows these matters very thoroughly who did not even know that this matter was before the Senate and the Langer option was about to be trodden under by a combination of the Labor Party, the coalition parties and the Democrats. I cannot do anything more than to express my disapproval. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>4074</page.no><name role="metadata">Minchin, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator MINCHIN</name><name.id>JX4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State;Minister Assisting the Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âin replyâTo sum up the debate, I thank other senators for their contributions. I thank Senator Murray for the indication of his cooperation in the reasonably speedy passage of this legislation. I hope that will be reflected in other parts of the chamber.

 these issues have been around for several years. It is important, with the prospect of an election in due course, that we get these measures passed into legislation.

I will refer to that throughout this debate.</para><para>Recommendation 52 of that majority report sought to provide gender, age and salutation details to MPs and registered political parties. The Australian Democrats believe that the provision of electoral information such as the gender and age details of constituents intrudes unnecessarily into the privacy of constituents, given that this information is not necessary for official purposes and would serve no public interest benefit. We believe it is not the Australian Electoral Commission's role or the public's role to provide this level of campaigning detail to sitting members of parliament or their political party.</para><para>The majority report's recommendations will have the effect of providing public resources to boost incumbency.

The question of date of birth being supplied to those categoriesâmembers, senators and partiesâarises in bill No. 2, which is not before us. This only relates to gender insofar as members and senators are concerned. This was, again, a provision debated back in 1995. We see it as unexceptionable that the entries on the roll supplied by members and senators and parties should indicate whether someone is a male or female. The primary purpose of supplying that information is to enable the appropriate salutation.</para></talk.start><para>It is increasingly difficult to identify whether you are communicating with an elector who is a male or female.

That is increasingly the case. We welcome, of course, the increasingly multicultural nature of society. The parties got around this, as I said, back in 1995, by 
 putting in place computer programs which enable them by and large to identify gender in most cases. So, in a sense, preventing the parties from having access to this has not served whatever purpose it was originally designed for. But given that it is information that it does not make any sense to prevent elected members of parliament from having, we do not understand it. With a whole range of different people now appearing on our electoral roll, it is getting harder for members and senators to know accurately whether they are communicating with a male or female.

These amendments were first circulated two days ago when I realised that the second electoral bill would be unlikely to reach us before the election and I decided to bring these forward and ask for your forbearance. However, most of the issues that I am dealing with under revised sheet 852 are matters which have been dealt with at various other times and in various other forums. In particular, amendments 1 to 3 that I have proposed here relate to remarks I made in my minority report to the 1996 election report.</para><para>I had said that it was a pity that this section of the report did not deal with measures to ensure the integrity of official party registration with the AEC. We would like to ensure that the requirements in the act for minimum party membership obligations are re-examined and that appropriate protections are provided through the registration process. I have sought here to ensure that the AEC takes a more proactive role than it has in the past in terms of dealing with the matters of registration and 
 the manner in which political parties on the AEC's register are assessed. There are a number of registrations which, in our opinion, are probably nearly defunct. Certainly, it is an area which we think has to be better improved.</para><para>If you run your eyes down through amendments 1, 2 and 3 you will see that what we have attended to is the commission having to review the register at least once every electoral cycle. Secondly, we believe the act should be improved with regard to section 126âand I presume you all have your acts to handâin relation to the number of members who should be involved in the application for registration for a new political party. We believe that, at section 126(2), an application for the registration of an eligible political party should be accompanied by evidence of the membership of the party.</para><para>We have suggested at 64D that the constitution of a party, referred to in paragraph (2)(f), should include the name of the party and procedures for the amendment of the constitution as a bare minimum. At 64E we have suggested that any proposed abbreviation should be attended to where that abbreviation is not included in the name of that party. In that same vein, we have dealt with the question of abbreviations which are an acronym or a shortened version of the party's name.</para><para>At 64G, paragraph 134(1)(b), we have lifted the number of members who can amend the constitution from three to 25. We think the idea that any three members of a party could amend a constitution is a bit of a worry, given the importance that constitutions have in political parties' lives. At (3A) we have also recommended that the commission must determine `whether the party on whose behalf the application has been made continues to be an eligible political party'. So it is in that vein that we have attempted to sharpen this area of AEC jurisdiction.</para><para>Minister, if you are of a mind to object to or oppose these amendments, I would ask youâif you do think it is an area which is worthy of reviewâto perhaps consider referring it to the joint committee as an area which is appropriate for them to look into.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>4077</page.no><name role="metadata">Minchin, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator MINCHIN</name><name.id>JX4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State;Minister Assisting the Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âSenator Murray has pre-empted me.

I think that Senator Murray is dealing with some issues here that have very great significance not only to registered political parties but also to the electoral process more generally.</para><para>That is the spirit with which I am now going to say to Senator Murray that it is within that context that I do not find I am able to commit the opposition to support these amendments at the moment. Apart from any prospective reference to the joint standing committee, I think there is a capacity to work these issues through, certainly in the committee stage of the debate on the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill (No. 2), which is what I had intended to suggest.

I simply have not had an opportunity to do that.

</para><para>To make it clear to the committee, the Greens are opposing three sections of this amending bill which make it more difficult for independents or small parties to establish and field candidates. The first of them is a requirement to increase from six to 50 the number of signatures required for an independent to get a valid nomination for the election. If you look at previous debates you will find that the number six was picked on as a fair requirement for an independent to stand. Suddenly, out of the blue, we are asked to increase that eightfold to 50. It may seem a small point that I am taking umbrage with, but where do we stop it? Could the minister or anybody else who supporting this change please explainâto use the new political parlanceâwhy we have gone from six to 50?</para><para>What has happened in demography or in the Australian community to suddenly require 50 signatures for an independent to stand rather than six? I can only think it is a fear the government has that there are going to be more independents standing; a concern that there are six Independents in the House of Representatives as it is, as well as two in this place, and that that number might increase. As far as I am concerned, if the voters want to put more independents into parliament, they ought to be facilitated. Clearly, while this is a marginal differenceâI do not think it is going to be an absolute impediment to people standingâit is simply making things more difficult for independents.</para><para>Where is the equivalent added difficulty for the big parties to field candidates? I do not see it here. I see an impost or a barrier being put up to independents nominating for and therefore entering the parliament, and I am opposed to it.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>4078</page.no><name role="metadata">Minchin, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator MINCHIN</name><name.id>JX4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State;Minister Assisting the Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThese three issues respond to recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters that both the number of nominees required and the amount of the nomination fee for candidates be adjusted. With respect to the number of nominees required for a candidate not endorsed by a registered party, we have accepted the recommendation from the com 
 mittee that that be increased from six to 50. On the face of it, I understand Senator Brown's reaction in the sense that it is a big increase. On the other hand it is remarkable that a candidate can nominate with only six nominees.</para></talk.start><para>Insofar as the major parties are concerned or any registered political party, the fact is that you only get registration if you have got 500 members, a pre-condition of being registered. You have to have 500 before you can nominate if you are going through the registration process. To require a candidate who is not a member of a registered party to have 50 signatures still means that you have to have one-tenth of the members that a registered party has to have before they can nominate any candidates at all.</para><para>It is our view that six is anomalously low. Fifty is not an unreasonable requirement if you are to participate in this process. After all, if you cannot get 50 people to sign a nomination form you have got absolutely no chance of getting elected or of even appearing on the radar screen in terms of the election itself. We think it is reasonable that, to be on the ballot paper, you demonstrate that you have the support of at least 50 out of 80,000 voters in a federal seat.</para><para>So far as the nomination fees are concerned, again we are responding to committee recommendations that there be an increase in the nomination fee for both the Senate and the House of Representatives. These fees have not been adjusted since 1983, I am advised. So it has been 15 years since there has been any adjustment. I have not looked at it closely against the CPI, but I would hazard a guess that in real terms the increases will do no more than maintain the real level of the nomination fee as it was in 1983. Of course, these deposits are refundable if you get a certain percentage of the vote.</para><para>Again, I put it in the context of participation in this process, and of being party to the election process, that if you cannot raise $350 to nominate for the House of Representatives or $700 for the Senate, then you have absolutely no hope of being considered a halfway reasonably serious candidate for election. It is reasonable for the parliament to regard a 
 campaign where someone cannot even raise that amount as nothing more than a frivolous campaign. It is not an unreasonable amount if you are to mount any sort of campaign for the House of Representatives or the Senate. You would certainly need to be able to raise well in excess of either $350 or $700. Given that if you do attract even a most minimal level of support these deposits are refundable, it seems a reasonable adjustmentâafter 15 yearsâof the nomination fees.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>4079</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI do not think the minister answered my first question at all. Besides saying that it seems reasonable to increase the number of signatures required for a nomination from six to 50, he has not explained why that is reasonable. Why was it unreasonable to have six nominations? If it was an encouragement to frivolous nominations before, why has that been the practice for so many years? It does not stack up.</para></talk.start><para>The minister also has to be aware that while voting is a private matter for Australians, putting your signature to nominations is a public matter. It goes on the public record. It is not as easy as just getting six people or 50 people to sign a nomination. There is no rationale for this. It will raise the bar for people wanting to stand as independents. This is at a time when more people, who are sick of the big parties, are wanting to do just that. And that is why I oppose it.</para><para>As far as the nomination fees are concerned, what the big party majority is looking at here is raising the impost on small parties who want to field candidates in the 144 seats in the House of Representatives and in each of the eight jurisdictions for the Senate by adding a couple of hundred dollars for each of those across the board. It translates into tens of thousands of dollars. It is a neat way of trying to repress the electorate's mood to invest votes away from the big parties. That is all this is about. We can talk about CPIs and so on. I have always believed that the nomination fee is too high anyway. I am in favour of lowering the barrier, not increasing it. I know I am not going to prevail on this, but I simply have to put the argument and be on the record about it.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>4080</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI will not be supporting Senator Brown on this, but I want to make it absolutely clear that it is not for the reasons that he has outlined.</para></talk.start><para>We in the Labor Party take the view that, if you cannot find 50 signatures, your chances of seriously contesting a seat are extraordinarily remote.

I do not consider an increase from $500 to $700 in the Senate or $250 to $350 in the House of Representatives to be extraordinary increases, given that there has not been an increase in the level of these deposits for some 15 years. The point made by Minister Minchin that CPI increases would have seen these deposits increase by a greater amount than what is being proposed by the joint standing committeeâand what is now contained within this billâis actually valid.

Basically the <inline ref="r538">National Firearms Program Implementation Bill 1998</inline>  is a sensible arrangement. It seeks to extend the buy-back arrangements for the owners of particular types of firearms banned as a result of the 10 May 1996 meeting of the Australian police ministers. It seeks to extend this to the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Norfolk 
 Island and other jurisdictions that have so far not come into play on this. I do, however, want to take one part of this bill and use it as a vehicle to express some concern with respect to the way one part of this legislation and other corollary bills have been implemented, and that is to do with the dealer buyback. This bill before us not only empowers jurisdictions to buy back semi-automatic and all forms of now banned firearms in this country and pay just compensation, but also provides for dealers who had before made an income from selling and servicing this type firearm to be paid just compensation.</para></talk.start><para>That is the point I want to come in on because I hope that the people on the islands are going to do better than some of the dealers in some of the other jurisdictions. I want to make a few comments, which I have been sitting on now for the last three months in the hope that I would not have to make them, in respect of my own jurisdiction of South Australia. Everybody in politics who agreed with the police ministers' conference on May 10, 1996 and all the terms that were encapsulated in that, agreed that a speedy buy-back arrangement was necessary to solve this problem. Indeed, once the decision was made by the various parliaments in Australia that there was no longer a place for the widespread ownership of semi-automatic firearms and that a buy-back scheme would be put in place, it was agreed that it needed to be executed expeditiously.</para><para>I want to make it crystal clear that that, in general, was done. It was done a bit quicker in my state of South Australia because a state election was coming up and the government was concerned about the implications of this. It was done speedily and efficiently. The firearms destruction unit did an excellent job in South Australia. I have no experience of what happened in the other jurisdictions. I took a close interest in South Australia and was very satisfied with the speedy, efficient and fair operation. The terms of compensation were reasonable. However, that is where it stops.</para><para>I do not blame Senator Vanstone who, I understand, administers this particular piece of legislation. I am not sure whether that is so 
 or not. I understand that it went through the House of Representatives with the Attorney-General so I presume that it would have been under Senator Vanstone up here. I want to alert whichever minister is implementing this legislation to a problem that is developing. It is developing because the buy-back arrangements in South Australia for the dealers over there have been stalled for over seven months. They were a long time being put in place and the government is now starting to cop some of the flak for a bureaucracy that has developed around the accounting firm Price Waterhouse.</para><para>Seven months ago the dealers who decided that they were going to opt out of the systemâin other words, who decided that there was no longer an income for themâmade application, as they were entitled to do, for fair and just compensation for their business and, indeed, fair and just compensation for the various parts of the semi-automatic weapons that had been banned. Currently enormous stocks of these items are still in the hands of dealers. I want to reinforce this point to the Senate: it was never the intention of these dealers to get out of the system but it was suggested to them that they would no longer be able to sell this particular type of firearm and that maybe the other interests they had in the firearms trade would not be sufficient for them to have a business that would survive the current climate out there. So they opted to sell all of the various parts and, in some instances, almost wholly completed semi-automatic and, as I understand it, fully automatic firearms.</para><para>The government then handed to Price Waterhouse the job of making sure that proper compensation was paid. At the first meeting, seven months ago, the bloke from Price Waterhouse who came to South Australia, an officer called Robert Kus, suggested that the whole problem would be solved in a week. It has been said that a week is a long time in politics. It is a long time for Price Waterhouse. The government has appropriated the moneyâit is sitting thereâthe community wants these things taken and melted down, the current owners want to hand them over so they can get on with the rest of their lives and 
 Mr Kus flies in and out of Adelaide from one meeting to the next.</para><para>I do not lightly name an officer and a company in the Senate, but I want to tell them to get on with the job. I want to tell the government that there is a problem. I want to alert the government to the fact that the agency it has picked for this has not understood that this is an urgent matter that needs to be resolvedânot only for these people who want to get on with their lives and move into other businesses and retrain or retire or whatever they want to do, but also for me as an average member of the community who, having seen these firearms banned by parliament, wants to see them melted down, off the street, out of circulation, and no longer available out there for someone to break in and screw together a dangerous firearm that may do what was done at Port Arthur. As a consequence of this, I want to tell the Senate here today that I hope the government take my remarks and I hope that they ring Price Waterhouse, speak to this fellow and tell him to get on with his job.</para><para>My understanding is that the cutting edge of this is the problem of documentation. I am probably going to be told that I do not know what I am talking about, because there are a number of dealers that have a lot of parts that they cannot account for, that they have not got written valuations for, that they have not got receipts for or that they have not got this, that and the other. They had better not use that defence because there are a few dealers who can document everything from the smallest firing pin all the way up and they have not been paid either. I can give the names and addresses of these people because a few of them are mates of mine.</para><para>I also want to make it pretty crystal clear here that, in the spirit of the buyback, the one smart thing the Howard government did, which we agreed with, was speedy just compensation before tribunals that were independent, that bought certain banned firearms, destroyed them and paid the compensation to the public out there. Had the same process that is being used now with the dealers been taken, then 90 per cent of these things would still be on the street and Mr Kus 
 and his friends would be flying from one state to the next all the time. What the Howard government didâand it was a smart moveâwas do it quickly, fairly and, where necessary, not get tied up with bureaucratic red tape.</para><para>Unfortunately, the firearms dealers, at least in my state, have been treated with much less courtesy. I am not blaming the government for it; I am blaming Price Waterhouse. If I am blaming them wrongly, then maybe the government is responsible. I want to see two things out of this. I want to see the government have a very close look at how the dealer buyback is working and to get it working, to get it functioning, to get these things melted and to get them out of circulation so that people can get on with their lives.</para><para>Over two years ago we made the determination that this is the way we are going to go. Two years and three months later, at least where the dealers are concerned, very little or nothing has happened. I understand that has happened in other jurisdictions as well. It is something the government ought to take on board and sort out. I also suggest that, when this legislation here today is brought in, a much more speedier approach should be developed to sort out every downstream issue of the buyback in the particular jurisdictions that this bill is appropriate to.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>4083</page.no><name role="metadata">Minchin, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator MINCHIN</name><name.id>JX4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State;Minister Assisting the Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe <inline ref="r538">National Firearms Program Implementation Bill 1998</inline>  deals with the question of the Commonwealth providing funds for the territories of Norfolk Island, Cocos (Keeling) Islands and Christmas Island in implementing the territories surrender and buyback scheme.

We are happy to support the bill.

The objective of the CTBT has been pursued by Australian governments for a very long timeâthat is, a total global ban on nuclear weapons tests and all other nuclear explosions in all environments and for all time. Australia was, of course, the site of 12 British nuclear tests at the Monte Bello Islands, Emu Field and Maralinga in the 1950s. These nuclear explosions and the many so-called `minor trials' have left enduring scars on our land and lingering health concerns for the thousands of Australian and British veterans who participated.</para><para>Negotiation of the CTBT was a major diplomatic priority for Labor in government as part of our activist approach to nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation issues. This approach was underpinned by both the goal of achieving a nuclear weapon free world and a hard-headed assessment of Australia's security interests.</para><para>Australia was a central player in this process. Australia's technical experts helped develop the stringent CTBT verification regime and our diplomats made key contributions to the text of the draft treaty, especially article 1 setting out the basic obligations of state parties never to carry out nuclear test explosions or any other nuclear explosion in any environment. 
</para><para>India and Pakistan have between them recently conducted no fewer than 11 nuclear tests in the space of little more than two weeksâthe most intense burst of nuclear testing since the lead-up to entry into force of the partial test ban treaty, all of 35 years ago.</para><para>Carried out in total defiance of the overwhelming international consensus against further nuclear testing, the actions of India and Pakistan have attracted strong condemnation, including from both sides of the political mainstream in this country. India's open declaration of a thermonuclear weapon capability and the declared intention of both India and Pakistan to proceed with weaponisation of their nuclear capabilities has sent the most appalling signal to other states interested in acquiring nuclear weapons.</para><para>All sides of politics in this country have called on India and Pakistan to join the global consensus against nuclear testing and to sign the CTBT without delay.</para><para>I earnestly hope that both India and Pakistan will soon see the absolute foolishness of their actions; though, for the moment at least, rabid and extreme nationalism appears to be the dominant theme of public expression in both New Delhi and Islamabad. India and Pakistan are no longer so-called nuclear threshold states; they are now self-declared nuclear weapon states. But they should be accorded no respect and they should be accorded no status whatsoever. They should be treated for what they are nuclear pariahs.</para><para>Efforts to Stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction are an area of foreign and strategic policy characterised by strong bipartisan support. As I have said a the beginning of my remarks Labor supports this bill. We look forward to the negotiation of further measures which will both enhance our national security and move the international community towards the objective that we all share: a world free of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles; a world free of the shadow of the mushroom cloud.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para><para>Bill read a second time, and passed through its remaining stages without amendment or debate.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CARRIER LICENCE CHARGES) AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>4084</page.no><id.no>r461</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>4084</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 28 May, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Alston</inline>:</para><para>That this bill be now read a second time.

 indicate that we support the bills. I would like to make a few remarks. Firstly, the bills implement the Willett review of Australia's anti-dumping and countervailing administration. There were four key recommendations of this report entitled the Willett Review: firstly, that there should be a reduction in the maximum investigation time of anti-dumping complaints to 155 days or 175 days in complex cases; secondly, that provisional measuresâthat is, measures that require the payment in duty terms of the equating priceâcould be imposed after 60 days of an investigation commencing; thirdly, that a single stage investigation process be undertaken by customs; and, fourthly, that a more stringent approach be adopted to seeking and verifying information from importers.</para></talk.start><para>As I said, these bills implement the Willett review, particularly in regard to those recommendations. Whilst supporting the bill, however, we would like to point out that it is essentially Labor's policy that the government's own position is closely matching that which was announced by us three months earlier. There has also been a lengthy period of inaction on the government's part in respect of this issue. Labor will closely monitor implementation to ensure that the new review body, the Trade Measures Review Office, does not become a de facto anti-dumping authority.

The Taxation Laws Amendment (Company Law Review) Bill 1998 is an important piece of legislation, specifically in respect of anti-avoidance provisions. The amendments principally relate to situations where amounts are paid as capital rather than dividends to confer 
 a tax advantage on the person receiving the benefit and the company paying the amount. The legislation deals with matters relating to the capital gains tax, and I think it is important, in the context of tax reform, which this is part of, to deal very briefly with some underlying issues that relate to the current tax reform debate, which is an important debate to have.</para></talk.start><para>I take the opportunity to put on record the situation in respect of personal income tax rates that existed when Mr Howard, the current Prime Minister, left office on the defeat of the then Liberal-National Party government in 1983 as compared with the situation that we had in 1996. It has been claimed in the current tax reform debate that no reform in fact took place under a Labor government. I draw the Senate's attention to the fact that in 1983, when Labor gained government, the marginal tax rate for people earning between nought and $4,595 was nil; the rate for people earning between $4,595 and $19,500 was 30c in the dollar; for those earning from $19,500 to $35,788 the marginal tax rate was 46c; and for those earning over $35,788 the marginal tax rate was 60c in the dollar.</para><para>It is not correct for Mr Howard and Mr Costello to claim that there was no significant tax reform. When Labor left office, it had made significant changes to the marginal income tax rates. We have a situation now, as a result of Labor reform, where those earning taxable income between nought and $5,400 have a nil marginal tax rate; those earning between $5,400 and $20,700 have a marginal tax rate of 20c in the dollar; those earning between $20,701 and $38,000 have a marginal tax rate of 34c in the dollar; between $38,001 and $50,000 it is a 43c marginal tax rate; and in excess of $50,000 it is a 47c marginal tax rate. I draw the attention of the chamber to the reduction in the top rate from 60c to 47c and the reduction in the middle range tax rates from 46c to 43c or 34c marginal tax rate. That was very significant reform of the income tax system.</para><para>I could speak extensively about other aspects of the current tax reform debate. However, in the interests of ensuring that the 
 non-controversial legislation we have before us is passed expeditiously, I will not deal at length with any more issues at this time.</para><para>The other point that Mr Howard and Mr Costello made strongly prior to their election in 1996 was a firm commitment to no new taxes and no increase in existing taxes. This morning I looked at the list of tax changes in this country since the election of the current government. There is evidence of a tendency to call taxes by other names. We all know about the infamous superannuation surcharge. We have also had a nursing home tax introduced, an accommodation charge for nursing home residents up to $4,380 annually, which is $12 a day. With regard to the infamous superannuation tax, called a surcharge, $500 million a year is expected to be collected.</para><para>There are a significant number of associated problems that I will not go into today; that would require a 20-minute speech in itself. The private health insurance tax, yet another surcharge, is $500 a year. There are also various customs charges, a reef tax and a drugs tax. So there have been a range of new taxes or increases in existing taxes under this government, and that is a significant breach of the commitment given by the Prime Minister at the last election.</para><para>I will conclude on this point. There has been no more significant breach in the tax reform debate than the breach of the rock solid commitment given by the Prime Minister that we would never, ever see a goods and services taxânever, ever. I do not think we should miss an opportunity to remind the Australian public about the commitment given by the Prime Minister. Of course, he has followed it up with a new commitment: if a goods and services tax is introduced by the current government, should they be re-elected, we will never, ever see the goods and services tax increase once it is introduced. If the Prime Minister can redefine his commitment that we would never, ever have a goods and services tax, how can we believe his commitment that it will never, ever be increased should it be introduced?</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para><para>Bills read a second time, and passed through their remaining stages without amendment or debate.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT (FARM MANAGEMENT DEPOSITS) BILL 1998</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>4087</page.no><id.no>r542</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>4087</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 22 June, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newman</inline>:</para><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>4087</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI will make my comments on this legislation, the <inline ref="r542">Taxation Laws Amendment (Farm Management Deposits) Bill 1998</inline> , briefer than my comments on the bills that we have just dealt with. Firstly, at a personal level I welcome this legislation. In my previous position as parliamentary secretary in the area of primary industries and resources, I could see that this issue of income equalisation schemes was a matter of serious concern to primary producers. The legislation we are debating deals with a new scheme that will be operated by the private sector. Deposits under the new scheme will be deductible in the year made and an amount equal to the deduction will be included in assessable income when the deposit is withdrawn. There would be a cap on the amount that will be subject to this concessional treatment. This change will be useful to operators in the primary sector.</para></talk.start><para>I want to make a comment about the primary industry sector. Regrettably, as I think most senators are aware, primary industry producers in this country are low income people. They stand to lose from the never, ever tax, the goods and services tax that this government has foreshadowed and that Mr Howard personally guaranteed would never, ever be introduced. Farmers have low incomes, as I said, and the introduction of the never, ever tax, the goods and services tax, will impact on lower and middle income earners. It is a regressive tax. As low and middle income earners, farmers, as much as other low and middle income earners in this country, will be affected by the regressive nature of a new indirect tax. I certainly hope that they look very closely at any level of support they may choose to give to the 
 introduction of a goods and services tax, or whatever it will be called by this government should it be re-elected.</para><para>There have been valiant attempts by the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, to rename the tax. I think on one occasion he referred to it as a broad-based indirect tax, a BIBIT for short. He then referred to it on other occasions as a BOBIT. I think that now it is being rightly referred to as a NETâthe never, ever tax. The Prime Minister made a commitment that we would never, ever have a goods and services tax. Yet again I remind the Senate of the Prime Minister's commitment that it would never, ever be increased. If we cannot believe his promise before the last election that such a tax would never, ever be introduced, how are we to believe that, once we have the introduction of a goods and services tax, whatever it is called, it will never, ever be increased?</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3L6</name.id><name role="metadata">CONROY</name><name role="display">Senator Conroy</name></talker><para>âNever, ever?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name></talker><para>âNever, ever. This is well illustrated by a list of 23 Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development nations. Of the 23 OECD countries that have introduced the never, ever tax, 21 have increased the rate of the never, ever tax and none have reduced itâsurprise, surprise. Just to pull out a couple of examples from the list, New Zealand's started at 10 per cent and it is now up to 12.5 per cent. Japan's started at three per cent and it was increased to 5 per cent last May. That may explain some of the problems that the Japanese economy has had. The United Kingdom had started at 10 per cent; it is now at 17.5 per cent.</para></talk.start></continue><para>So the never, ever tax that we were never, ever to see or have in this country, according to Mr Howardâand then it would never, ever go upâhas gone up in 21 of 23 OECD nations. Leaving aside for a moment the general regressive effects of this new indirect tax, I certainly hope that primary producers around this country will not believe the Prime Minister's assertion that it will never, ever be increased.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para><para>Bill read a second time, and passed through its remaining stages without amendment or debate.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (PENSION BONUS SCHEME) BILL 1998</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>4088</page.no><id.no>r453</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>4088</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 13 May, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newman</inline>:</para><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>4088</page.no><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name><name.id>656</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI can indicate on behalf of the opposition that we do not oppose passage of the bill. We do have some reservations about the ultimate impact of this legislation. Indeed, when the legislation was considered by the Community Affairs Legislation Committee we did put in some additional comments. In view of the time, I seek leave to incorporate those comments as a speech on the second reading, and with those reservations we support passage of the bill.</para></talk.start><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The speech read as follows</inline>â</para><para>A number of significant issues were raised in relation to this Bill during the public hearing on 15 May 1998. Some of these issues are still of concern and raise doubts about the value of the scheme.</para><para>Perhaps the most significant concern involves the numbers of people who are likely to benefit from the scheme who should have continued in the workforce beyond pension age regardless. These people stand to receive a windfall gain for doing what they would have done in any event. According to the joint Departmental submission it is estimated that 60,090 prospective social security pensioner will register for the scheme in 1998-1999 ant that 52,938 or some 88% of these people would have continued working regardless of the scheme. It is further estimated that of the additional 18,869 prospective social security recipients likely to register for the scheme in 1999-2000, 13,403 or over 70% would have deferred retiring in any event. Of the 20,361 expected to defer retirement in 2000-2001, 12,900 or 63% would probably  have deferred regardless of the scheme (Submission No.3, Table 2).</para><para>It was submitted by the Departments that the savings generated by those who changed their behaviour would offset the costs of those who received a bonus for doing what they would have 
 done in any event (Submission No.3, page 5). The truth of this submission would have to depend upon its underlying assumptions, for example the length of time people are likely to defer retirement as a result of the scheme and hence the percentage of their pension entitlement they might expect to receive as a bonus. It still appears that the cost implications of the scheme are far from clear.</para><para>A further concern involves the likely effects of the scheme upon younger workers. It has been assumed that 30% of those who defer retiring because of the scheme will displace younger workers. In their joint submission the Department concede that there is no hard evidence to support this assumption (Submission No.3, page 7). If the assumption is correct it is an important factor to be taken into account in assessing the scheme. The fact that it is a mere assumption and that the true displacement implications are unknown is also a matter of concern.</para><para>In summary, both the direct and indirect costs of the scheme appear uncertain. It is something of an experiment, the results of which are unlikely to become apparent for quite some time to come.</para><para>With these reservations, the Labor Opposition does not oppose passage of the Bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>4089</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe Democrats also will be supporting this bill. We want to ensure that it does get through but, rather than simply indicating that, I think it is important that anybody that does follow parliamentary debates is assured that this legislation has been given a good degree of scrutiny by the Democrats as well as by the broader Community Affairs Legislation Committee. To outline some of the Democrat views on itâas I would have done if we were not pressed for timeâI shall save senators the torment of having to hear me speak it if they are willing to grant leave for my speech on the second reading to be incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> .</para></talk.start><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The speech read as followsâ</inline></para><para>With this legislation, the Government is seeking to introduce a scheme under which people who defer claiming the Age Pension may be paid a Pension Bonus.</para><para>The amount of bonus they receive will be determined by the length of time they defer claiming their pension. A person who defers for the maximum of five years stands to receive a bonus payment of around $21,000.</para><para>The benefit to the Commonwealth, of course, is that the person hasn't been receiving pension payments for that five-year period. 
</para><para>Through this scheme, the Government is hoping to save around 18 million dollars in its first full year, rising to over 40 million in subsequent years.</para><para>As people being to claim their bonuses, however, there will be a cost to government and in the longer term it is expected that the scheme will actually be revenue neutral.</para><para>As we heard at the Community Affairs inquiry into this legislation, these estimates are based on a number of assumptions.</para><para>Most notably, the government estimates that of all the people that will claim the bonus, more than 80% would have deferred their retirement to keep working anyway. In other words, the majority of people receiving a bonus under this scheme will actually be getting a windfall gain for no change in their behaviour.</para><para>As the Department pointed out, however, the savings achieved from those who are encouraged by the scheme to delay their retirement will, in the short to medium term at least, more than offset those costs.</para><para>Clearly, the level of savings to be gained are dependent on just how accurate the Departmental estimates are of the number of people to take up this scheme and I think we'll all be watching closely to see if those estimates are met.</para><para>At the Community Affairs Committee, some concerns were expressed that people who wouldn't normally qualify for the pension may end up receiving a bonus payment.</para><para>The Democrats believe, however, that the means test at the time of claiming the bonus combined with the social security gifting provisions is as rigorous a test as that currently applied to the Age Pension.</para><para>We also acknowledge that imposing a means test at the time of registration would be unfair as people may not yet have structured their investments for retirement. A For example, someone looking to defer their pension may be reluctant to tie up their money in a long-term "income stream type" investment.</para><para>Of greater concern to the Democrats is the potential for people to gain unrealistic expectations of the bonus. That is, if not given very clear and very accurate advice by the Department or if people misunderstand the advice they are given, they may find at the end of their deferment period they are not entitled to the payment they thought they were going to get.</para><para>Given that people might have deferred claiming their pension for up to five years, this is a situation that needs to be avoided at all costs.</para><para>I note the Department has undertaken that people registering for the scheme will be referred to a Financial Information Service Officer to discuss 
 how the scheme works and, very importantly, how it will apply to their particular circumstances.</para><para>The Democrats believe this is of the utmost importance. People may totally rearrange their retirement plans in reliance of this scheme and, because of that, it is essential that they have full information to make those decisions on.</para><para>The Department will also write to people each year reminding them of the rules and I can only hope that those letters will be in `plain English' and will leave people in no doubt as to their entitlements under the scheme.</para><para>As anyone who has had experience with the social security system knows, a person who doesn't fully understand their obligations for a particular payment or who, for some reason, is prevented from fulfilling those obligations, can often find themselves in great hardship.</para><para>Under the proposed rules for the pension bonus, at the end of the deferment period, a person or their partner must claim the bonus within 13 weeks. This limit has been set to prevent people from dispersing their assets in order to claim a higher bonus payment.</para><para>The Democrats can foresee that this requirement could, in some circumstances, lead to injustice. The particular scenario we are concerned about is where one member of a couple is working and accruing the pension bonus. We believe it would be unfair if, following the death of that person, their widow or widower was to miss out on the bonus because, due to their bereavement, they neglected to claim their bonus within 13 weeks.</para><para>In discussions my office has had with the Minister's office I understand an agreement has been reached whereby the 1 3-week limit will be extended to 26 weeks for people who may find themselves in these circumstances. Can I just take the opportunity to thank the Minister for addressing this issue for us.</para><para>Finally, as with all other social security payments, there may be the potential for people to manipulate their affairs so as to circumvent the legislative requirements of this scheme in ways that are not yet foreseeable.</para><para>If this is to occur, it's likely the Government will be coming back to the Parliament with amendments to close any `loopholes'.</para><para>At this stage, I simply want to signal that, unless there is a particularly convincing reason to the contrary, the Democrats will not be supporting the application of any future amendments to those people who are already registered.</para><para>When people might be deferring their pensions for up to 5 years, it would be totally unjust to change the rules on them midstream. 
</para><para>In conclusion then, the Democrats do have some concerns over the financial impact of this scheme. We recognise, however, the potential savings involved and also the fact that the Government has given undertakings to introduce such a scheme.

</para><para>We have, on many occasions, moved amendments relating to the exemption of the family farm from various assets testsâmost particularly the AUSTUDY assets testâand we were instrumental in establishing two Senate inquiries into the impact of the assets test on farming families.</para><para>These moves have been based on our belief that a number of social security rules have been, and are still, unfairly discriminating against our farming families.</para><para>Because of this concern, we welcome the Bill before us today which seeks to rectify the harsh impact the social security `gifting provisions' have on family farmers.</para><para>The intergenerational transfer of family farms, and the effect this has on a person's entitlement to the Age Pension, has been a concern of the Australian Democrats for a long time now.</para><para>We have always felt that allowing farmers to hand their farms on through successive generations achieves a number of very desirable outcomes.</para><para>Firstly, it means the family's accumulated wealth of farming knowledge and experience can be handed on with the property.</para><para>Secondly, it helps to ensure the viability and structure of many of our farming communities.</para><para>Thirdly, it allows ageing farmers to retire from the industry with dignity.</para><para>And finally, it allows the input of new and innovative techniques of farming to be introduced and incorporated into that accumulated expertise.</para><para>It is for these reasons that the intergenerational transfer of farming properties is, and always has been, an essential component of the Australian farming industry.</para><para>We have farms in Australia that have been in the same family for five and six generations. Indeed, the attitude of most family farmers is that the property they are working is really only their's to be held on trust for the next generation and the generations after that.</para><para>Up until now, however, farmers who have handed their properties on to their sons or daughters have paid a high price in terms of their loss of access to the Age Pension. This has come about as a result of the so-called `gifting provisions' which apply to the Pension.</para><para>These provisions mean that a person who gives away an asset valued in excess of $10,000 is deemed by Centrelink to still hold that asset for the following 5 years and to be earning an income on it.</para><para>These `gifting provisions' play a valuable role in preventing people deliberately running down their assets in order to qualify for the pension. Retiring farmers, however, are unfairly caught up in the 
 provisions meaning that they are usually precluded from the Age Pension for 5 years after retiring.</para><para>The bill before us today provides that, for 3 years from the 1 5th of September last year, low income farmers can gift their farm to the younger generation without losing access to the Age Pension or Veterans' Service Pension.</para><para>The scheme will also be open to those farmers who have transferred their farms in the last 5 years.</para><para>As I've already said, the Democrats strongly support the overall principle of allowing farmers to retire from farming with dignity by removing the social security penalties that currently apply.</para><para>Importantly, the proposed scheme will not only provide a window of opportunity for farmers to transfer their farms but it will also serve to emphasis the importance to farming families of succession planning and the need to undertake business planning generally.</para><para>Having said that, the Democrats do have a number of concerns with this scheme as it's currently proposed.</para><para>It was originally our intention to seek to address those problems through amendments to the legislation.</para><para>A letter we received from the Minister, however, stated that the Government has not been able to allocate sufficient time to this bill to allow a full debate.</para><para>I have to put on the record the fact that I feel this is a very unfortunate position for the Senate to be in given the great importance of this scheme to our farming families.</para><para>Despite this scheme being announced by the Prime Minister back in September last year, it's taken the Government nine months to bring this legislation before the Senate and we are being asked to pass it within an hour and with no serious debate whatsoever.</para><para>One of the very important roles of the Senate is to scrutinise each and every piece of legislation that comes before it. This is a role the Democrats take most seriously and we are disappointed that greater time could not have been allocated to this very important piece of legislation.</para><para>I must say that I was very keen to pursue the amendments I foreshadowed in the Community Affairs Committee report but, at the same time, I recognise the importance of getting this scheme up and running as quickly as possible.</para><para>Having consulted with the farming bodies who appeared at the Senate inquiry, the Democrats have agreed not to move amendments to allow the Bill to be debated in this lunch time debate. I signal now though that we believe the scheme will need to be amended in the future. 
</para><para>Overall, we believe that what should be a very positive scheme is at great risk of being stymied by the restrictive conditions placed on the scheme in order to minimise the cost to the government.</para><para>At the Senate inquiry we heard evidence from Lifeline in Queensland that it had not found anyone able to qualify for the scheme.</para><para>We heard similar evidence from a Rural Counsellor in Queensland.</para><para>And we heard from the National Farmers Federation that it had only been able to find two people that thought they may qualify.</para><para>That having been said, I would now like to briefly outline some of the specific concerns we have with this Bill.</para><para>Firstly, the scheme is only to be available for 3 years from the 1 5th of September last year. That was the date that the Prime Minister announced the scheme despite the fact that the Government did not even have draft legislation ready at that stage.</para><para>What that has meant is that, in reality, the scheme has been effectively non-operational for the past nine months. No applications have been granted and, not surprisingly, rural counsellors are advising people not to transfer their farms until the legislation is passed.</para><para>So, by the time the scheme is up-and-running nearly a year will have been lost out of that three year window of opportunity.</para><para>The Democrats support the views of a number of people who appeared before the Senate Committee that the scheme should apply for at least five years. This would allow more people to take advantage of the scheme and also give more notice to other farmers to begin to undertake their succession planning.</para><para>Our second concern relates to the income test being applied to the scheme. To qualify, the farmer's average income over the past 3 years must be below the maximum pension rateâthat is, around $9,000 for single people and $15,000 for couples.</para><para>The scheme is aimed at farms that are supporting two families but it's very difficult to imagine how an income of $15,000 could have sustained two families for the past three years.</para><para>The Democrats believe that a more appropriate threshold is that suggested by the National Farmers Federation and the South Australian Farmers Federationâthat is, the total amount pensioners can earn before their pension is reduced.</para><para>So, we would like to see the income test levels raised to around $19,600 for couples and $11,600 for singles.</para><para>In this regard I was very interested to read a letter that the Federal Member for Maranoa has apparently been sending to his constituents. In that letter, 
 Mr Scott, whose electorate covers many farming properties, says that he supports an increase in the income test to the level the Democrats are now suggesting.</para><para>Mr Scott is also Minister for Veterans' Affairs and it's expected that around 300 veterans will benefit from this scheme so his views are clearly of great interest.</para><para>The Democrats are also concerned at the requirement that farmers must have owned the farm being gifted for 15 years or been in farming for at least 20 years.</para><para>We believe this requirement is too stringent and may lead to inequities. For example, a farmer who has owned his current farm for 14 years and his previous farm for 3 years wouldn't be eligible to transfer his current farm.</para><para>We believe that an appropriate test would be to simply require that a farmer has been in farming for at least 15 years.</para><para>Another major concern we have with the proposed scheme is that the value of the farm, net of farm debt, must be not more than $500,000.</para><para>ABARE figures show that the average net value of all farms is around $1.05m. At the same time however, ABARE has also estimated that in 1996-97 the average broadacre farm had a business profit of negative $1,400.</para><para>The Democrats believe that the assets limit needs to be significantly increased and that a tapered withdrawal should be put in place rather than the `sudden-death' cut-off that's being proposed.</para><para>Under the current scheme, a person whose farm is worth $499,000 can be eligible for a full pension but a person whose farm is worth just $2,000 more will qualify for nothing.</para><para>This will not only lead to injustices but also encourages the use of artificial means of minimising asset levels.</para><para>The Democrats have incorporated an amendment which will raise the assets limit to $800,000.</para><para>The Democrats have a number of other concerns with the proposed scheme but I don't have time to run through those in any detail in the remaining time allocated for this bill. I simply conclude by saying that we are very pleased to see the Government at least begin to address this very important issue for family farmers. We feel the scheme is being strangled by restrictions at the moment and we would hope that the Government would look at reviewing the eligibility criteria sometime in the near future.</para><para>The Democrats will certainly be watching the progress of this scheme over the next six months and will consider pursuing the amendments I have already foreshadowed at a later date.

When the minister was given the opportunity on Monday to explain why the government's $3.8 million promotion of its youth allowance scheme fails to inform families who earn more than $23,400 that they will have to bear the burden of the cuts to their children's benefits, why did she avoid the issue? Isn't the youth allowance campaign and the minister's answer to my earlier question precisely the sort of thing which is causing so much disenchantment out there in the electorate. Aren't electors fed up with half-truths? Will the minister now come clean and admit that at least 47,650 young Australians will have their benefits either reduced or completely cut under the youth allowance scheme, with their parents being forced to make up the difference? Will the minister explain why their multimillion dollar taxpayer funded publicity campaign completely ignorers these impacts?</para></talk.start></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>4101</page.no><name role="metadata">Newman, Sen Jocelyn</name><name role="display">Senator NEWMAN</name><name.id>BE4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Social Security</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIt is very good of Senator Neal to ask me that question. I am delighted to have the opportunity to once again talk about the multitude of benefits that come from the introduction of the youth allowance on 1 July. Perhaps Senator Neal has not seen the article that appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline>  yesterday reporting on a study which has been done by Professor Bob Birrell. I do hope that senators take the trouble to have a look at this because it outlines the generosity that this government is introducing for students.</para></talk.start><para>The study says that the youth allowance will actually significantly improve eligibility for student financial assistance when compared to the current arrangements for Austudy which we inherited from Labor. That is one of the greatest benefits of youth allowance. For example, the parental means test that senators opposite were so quick to criticise is substantially more generous than it was under Austudy. We believe that the young unemployed should not be treated more generously than students; they should be treated the same. Under youth allowance they are being treated the same. It is wrongâand most Australians believe it is wrongâto pay young people more to be unemployed than to be students.</para><para>The youth allowance parental means test is actually far more generous than is the old parental means test for Austudy. I will give you some figures, Senator, because clearly, after all this time, you still need a bit of education on it. Currently, under Austudy, for one 18-year-old student living at home, income support cuts out when their parents' income is over $37,643. After 1 July, under youth allowance, for one young person living at home, the parental income level will be boosted by nearly $4,000 to $41,579. For an 18-year-old student living away from home under Austudy, the current limit of parental income is $47,079. Under youth allowance, that parental income level increases substantially by nearly $12,000 to $58,791 if they are receiving maximum rent assistance.</para><para>These figures are undisputable. They confirm that youth allowance is more generous than the existing Austudy scheme. While it is 
 targeted to those who are most in need, it will result in increased numbers of students receiving assistance. That is what Professor Birrell's assessment is all about: that there will, over time, be a lot more students studying in one form or another in Australia to acquire greater skills. You know, Senatorâhonourable senators all knowâthat one of the great tragedies, particularly in rural and regional Australia, is young people without any skills that they can sell to get a job. The opportunity to convince an employer that they will be a useful and effective employee is currently denied to lots of young people. In a very important way this will empower young people and help them to get work.</para><para>This is a fair scheme treating all young people the same. I cannot imagine why the opposition is still trying to run a scare campaignâas they are obviously trying to do.</para><para>I understand that their friends in the CPSU are, in fact, planning to use the introduction of the youth allowance as part of the industrial campaign they currently have with the management of Centrelink.

Nothing is surer than the fact that this government is very much committed to moving away from those Sydneycentric policies that the crowd on the other side have espoused for so long and directing arts funding much more to regional and rural Australia. That is why we have had a $7.5 million regional arts fund. That is why we have provided additional funding for touring for Playing Australia, which is the performing arts touring association; and for Visions, which is the visual arts equivalent; and for festivals to regional areas.

 of a number of high priority projects under the national pig industry development program, including a benchmarking study of the entire pork production processing and supply chain; a study of short to medium export opportunities focusing on Asia and high level trade missions to key markets to expand exports opportunities for Australian pig meat; and revised national pig industry development package guidelines to improve industry access to project funding under the NPIDP.</para><para>Together, these government initiatives provide an excellent opportunity for all industry sectors to work together to improve industry competitiveness and develop export market opportunities.

There are some 48,000 young people who will be worse off. The government has not informed these people that they will be adversely affected.</para><para>Senator Newman gave me the rather glib response that these people can look it up on the Internet; that they can find out all this information that the government have not bothered to tell them about with their $3.8 million promotional strategyâtheir TV adsâon the Internet. The difficulty is that the families of young adults who are unemployed 
 and who are adversely affected by this legislationâas I said, 48,000 of themâhave incomes as low as $23,400. Some senators in this chamber, who are earning well in excess of four times that figure, may not understand the position. But such a family of two older adults and at least one adult child over the age of 18 years is in pretty dire financial circumstances. They seem to fail to understand that a family earning $23,400 is not only unlikely to own a computer which is connected to the Internet, but almost certainly does not.</para><para>These are struggling and battling families. By dismissing them so out of hand with the nod of a head, the minister seems to fail to understand that this is not a flippant issue. This is not something that she should take lightly. The fact is that these struggling families on just over $23,000 cannot afford a computer and certainly would not have access to the Internet to look up and find out that they are going to lose somewhere around $87 a week because of a decision made by this government.</para><para>It is all right to spend $3.8 million on telling those people who are better offâand there are some people who are better off, and that is fine. As an opposition, we supported those aspects of the bill. But it is very unfair and we believe a complete shirking of responsibility by this government not to accept that at the same time they must advise people that they will lose out.</para><para>Also, it is very important to note that those families who do not lodge their forms by 1 July may well lose benefit. When the matter was raised by Senator Gibbs, once again Senator Newman responded in the sort of glib and offhanded manner that she often does. Senator Newman seems to believe that the dire financial circumstances of families that are not very well off, who are struggling, who are on incomes of less than a quarter of hersâI would say a lot lessâas well as their concerns and their troubles, are trivial. But they are not. Just because you are one of those families who is only earning just over $23,000 does not mean that your concerns and your problems are any less important than 
 the important matters that Senator Newman concerns herself with.</para><para>It shows that this government have not learnt the lessons of Queensland. They have not learnt that the community are sick and tired of them spending large amounts of public money on self-promotion in anticipation of an election while at the same time failing to be truthful about the negative things they have done, and the negatives are going to be affecting these very low income families that I have already mentioned. There are 48,000 young people who will be worse off because of this legislation, and it is about time that this government came clean and admitted it. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>4119</page.no><name role="metadata">Tierney, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator TIERNEY</name><name.id>O15</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe Australian Labor Party have a colossal hide taking note on this matter given their record over 13 years and what they did for youth over that time in terms of allowances and jobs.

It is a pity Senator Neal has left the chamber. We will not worry about accuracy, will we, Senator Neal? The figure that you quoted on disadvantaged people was 50 per cent out, 
 and you did not mention that 137,000 people are better off under this system. Why are they better off? They are better off because we have replaced the old system of five allowances with one common youth allowance.</para><para>Let me tell the Senate and the people of Australia what was wrong with your old system. People on the employment, education and training committeeâa number are here todayârealise what was wrong with it because we carried out a major study on Austudy and took advice from students and young people right around Australia at that time. They told us that, if you were at university and on Austudy, you were better off if you went off Austudy and went onto the dole, that you could pick up a higher rate and a whole lot of extra benefits if you did that. Under the Labor government there was no incentive to study; people preferred to lie on the beach. And you left it that way for 13 years.</para><para>We are not cutting money from the common youth allowance; we are putting another $25 million into the common youth allowance. They have gone a bit quiet over there at the momentâand no wonderâbecause this is a much superior scheme. Not only can the students who are on Austudy now get more money; there is no incentive for them to go on unemployment benefits, and they can pick up things like rent assistance which they could not pick up before. In other words, we have created a seamless web system. It does not matter whether you are on unemployment benefits or whether you are on some sort of benefit because you are studying; you can actually move between the two without being penalisedâand they used to penalise them.</para><para>People complained time and time again that, when they switched from one system to the other under the Labor government, they would have to pay money back and were fined because when they moved between two systems the computers were in two different departments and, of course, they did not speak to each other. We have administered the new youth allowance system through one computing system. It is a seamless web. They go from one to the otherâfrom training to unemployment or unemployment into train 
 ingâbecause it is a common youth allowance.</para><para>This is a superior system. This is a system which the Labor Party and the people opposite probably wish they had implemented. This government has implemented it. It has put more money into it. It has benefited a greater number of people. Under this system, students and the unemployed, in very large numbers, are much better off. It is time the Labor Party recognised that. It is time they recognised not only the failure of the arrangements they had for youth but also their total failure to the youth of this country in allowing such a high level of unemployment.</para><para>What are their policies to correct this? They got up here today and criticised the youth allowance. What are they going to do? What is your system? I invite future speakers to tell us what Labor policy is in this area. Are you going to keep the common youth allowance, or are you going to go back to your old system and disadvantage those who want to study and better themselves? I invite the next Labor speaker to tell me what their policy is. Are you going to keep up this high level of expenditure that we have implemented under this Howard government initiative?</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>4120</page.no><name role="metadata">Lundy, Sen Kate</name><name role="display">Senator LUNDY</name><name.id>7G6</name.id><electorate>ACT</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIs it not interesting that Senator Tierney spent the large proportion of this contribution to the taking note debate today on Laborâon what Labor have done and what he thinks Labor should do.

This technical aspect of the act and the way that the government are proposing to apply the 
 parental income cut-off demonstrates the poison contained within the rhetoric of this government. This government continually present a positive image of a very flawed policy. The bottom line is that it cuts the funding to youth in this country; it is a reduction. We know this because they keep crowing about the budget surplus. They keep telling us that this is the solution to the youth problems of this country, that this is the solution to youth unemployment. This expenditure cut, which will result in 48,000 young Australians being worse off, is the outcome of this government's overall fiscal policies. This is an example of how they care.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The best clue to when this government has something to hide is how often they repeat their glib statements. Today we saw Senator Newman continually responding to these questions by saying what a fantastic, positive thing the common youth allowance is. What is the other good indicator that the government is ripping off the young people of this country? They spend money on a very slick advertising campaign. That is always a very good signal that they are on their back foot in a policy sense and that they are doing the wrong thingâthey come up with a cute slogan and a multi-million dollar advertising campaign to sell it.</para><para>Given that we have those two things well and truly exposed in this forum and out in the public, let us look at the substance of the issue. Let us look at this campaign and how they are selling their message to young people. We have heard already that the public campaign funded by taxpayers' dollars only tells people about the good aspects of this thing, about the gains for some people and about the families that are going to have more funding coming in as a result. It does not say a word about the ones that will lose. They come up with this lovely response, `It's on the Internet.' Great! Fantastic! How many young people have access to the Internet? If you are a student you are probably in the best position. Let us look at the statistics if you are not: 19 per cent of Australian families earning under $44,000 have access to the Internet. How many who earn over $80,000 have access to the Internet? Sixty-three per 
 cent. We know that Internet access in this country is linked to socioeconomic statusâhow much money your parents earn. So it is an inverse contradiction to stand up and say that parents who earn more will get less support but at the same time those who will subsequently lose can only find out about it on the Internet.</para><para>What is the logic behind that? Forty-two per cent of young Australians between the ages of 18 and 24 have access to the Internet, but 30 per cent of those are still at school. Add that to the socioeconomic breakdown of Internet access and you have a very dismal picture of how this government communicates with those that it needs to. Too bad if it does not want to tell the bad side of the story. Too bad if it undertakes a narrow multi-million dollar positive campaign in the lead up to a federal election. Never mind about those who are going to lose. Not only are they going to lose that money but they are not going to be able to find out about it. The more heavily the government's communications policy with young people relies on the Internet the more at fault they are for not considering directly the implications of access and equity to the Internet.

Senator Lundy, after you hear what I am going to say, I would expect you to get a bell and rush around Parliament House saying, `The youth allowance is here. This is the best thing that has ever happened to Australian youth.' I assure you, Senator Lundy, the news is all good and very positive.</para></talk.start><para>Let us look at what the youth allowance does for the youth of Australia. This is not a savings measure. By introducing the youth allowance the government is helping young people by making income support arrangements simpler and more flexible. The youth allowance actually replaces five payments with one and reduces 13 different rates of payment to five. Customers will no longer be cancelled and have to reclaim different payments for minor changes in circumstances. All of these are very good and positive things, Senator Lundy, and I am sure you are already sending your staff to get that bell.</para><para>The youth allowance will be more effective in responding to the changing labour market by taking into account the full range of training and employment activities available for young people. In addition, the youth allowance removes disincentives to study caused by differences in income support arrangements for young people under 21 years of age. For younger students in particular it creates a real incentive to complete year 12 or equivalent qualifications before they look for work. That is a very good thing because we all know that the people who do not complete year 12 are more likely by a factor of some 2Â½ to go onto long-term unemployment benefits. The youth allowance reinforces the government's message that families should support young people until they have achieved financial independence.</para><para>What I would like to concentrate on more than anything else is the advantages of the youth allowance for regional Australia. Coming from a regional area, I have a particular interest in regional Australia. Students and young  Australians from rural and regional areas will be the big winners under the youth allowance. For the first time, students will be able to access rent assistance up to $74.80 per fortnight. This is currently available only to the young unemployed. Young people from remote areas will benefit from an extra $17.50 per fortnight by way of a remote area allowance. People under 18 years of age living away from home for study or training purposes will have further gains, with their payments boosted to $265.50 per fortnight to bring them in line with the over 18-year-olds.</para><para>The parental means test that is being applied is aimed at helping low income families and in particular low income families in regional areas, which I am sure is a policy Senator Lundy would have to agree with. For the first time young people in the bush will no longer have a financial disincentive to study or to go into some form of skills acquisition. They will have real incentive to further their career opportunities, incentives which never existed during the 13 dismal years when the ALP was in government.</para><para>There is no doubt from looking at the comparative policies of the previous Labor government and the enlightened and positive policies for young people under the Liberal-National coalition government that the ALP would rather see young Australians on the dole than in education or training to improve their career prospects. I think the ALP should tell the 153,750 young Australians who will get more money under this scheme why they think it is wrong to give incentives to young people to take up education or training to improve their chances of getting a job. That, I am sure you will agree, Senator Lundy, is all good news. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>4122</page.no><name role="metadata">Denman, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator DENMAN</name><name.id>FY5</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI want to take note of the same answer, but mainly I want to dwell on the north-west coast of Tasmania where I live. The youth unemployment figure for the north-west coast is 40 per cent. It is one of the highestâ 
probably the highestâyouth unemployment figure anywhere in Australia. Also, up there we have fewer young people staying at school till year 12. In the area where I live it has been very difficult to get young people to stay on and complete their education. There are a lot of reasons for that. A lot of the reasons are to do with the families there. We need to educate the families to encourage their children to stay on at school.</para></talk.start><para>That 40 per cent youth unemployment up there is going to be an enormous burden on those families from Burnie who will be losing their jobs within the next few months. Some of those families are going to find it very difficult because the children will be an extra burden on top of losing their jobs. I believe $50 million has been cut out of the student support service.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>AW5</name.id><name role="metadata">CARR</name><name role="display">Senator Carr</name></talker><para>âFive hundred.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>FY5</name.id><name role="metadata">Denman, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator DENMAN</name></talker><para>âFive hundred million has been cut out of the youth support service, which means 125,000 places.

Having been a teacher, I have taught a lot of those children and on the north-west coast they do not very often go beyond year 10.</para><para>There are a lot of reasons why those young people opt out of education, but we need to look at how the families will continue to support them when they do come out. Their reason for coming out often is that they are not academically minded and the school system does not provide anything to encourage them to stay on.</para><para>One of my other concerns is that, with the influx of students into the secondary system, I am not sure that the colleges in my area will cope. I know they will do their best. If there are extra students staying on, then we need to look at how the colleges are best going to be helped cope with that influx. I am concerned that the resources will not be there to adequately address the needs of these young 
 people who are not academics and who are forced to stay on in the system till year 12 without actually gaining very much. Where I live that is difficult. There are no training programs there either and, with the closure of the Burnie mill, there will be fewer. It is not going to be easy up there.</para><para>The north-west coast is considered in Tasmanian termsâI know not in terms of Western Australia, Northern Territory and Queenslandâan isolated area. Young people who have to move away from there to find work will have difficulty. Their families will find it difficult and stressfulânot to let them goâto not know where their children are going and what support mechanisms are in place in other areas. I would like to see us have another look at this youth allowance, particularly in rural and remote areas. As an island state, Tasmania is again disadvantaged. Let us have another look at the youth allowance and how we can best use it to help some of these young people.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>4123</page.no><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name><name.id>LI4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI want to speak about some of the things that have been mentioned by members on the other side and correct a few things. Senator Lundy made the statement that 48,000 young people were going to be worse off. The opposition keep repeating those sorts of figures and they are not right. There will be 33,000 young people who will receive less.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Denmanâand I know she is concerned about young people on the north-west coast of Tasmaniaâfailed to mention when saying that young people in that area do not stay on after year 10 the reasons why. One of the reasons we developed a culture of young people not staying on after year 10 was that it was better for them and easier for them to go on the dole, to take unemployment benefits, than it was to stay at school. There was no incentive. Young people used to say to me, `Why should I stay at school when I can get more money on unemployment benefits?' For 13 years Labor left that system in place.</para><para>Also, because two different departments administered the scheme, when young people moved between receiving unemployment benefits and Austudy and back again because their circumstances changed, they were 
 sometimes in receipt of overpayments. They were then chased up. As Senator Tierney said, there was not a seamless relationship between those allowances. We have streamlined it, making it easier for young people to understand the situation they are in. They are less likely to be in receipt of overpayments and, therefore, less likely to be in trouble in relation to overpayments.</para><para>Senator Denman did not talk about the fact that we have increased the number of apprenticeships. In 1995 there were 138,000 apprenticeships under Labor. We now have 182,000 apprenticeships. That goes towards meeting the needs of some of those students who do not want to go on to years 11 and 12 at school and those who, after years 11 and 12, do not want to go on to tertiary education and would like to seek training in another form through an apprenticeship. We have the schools to work program: $21 million to encourage and assist young people move from school to work. That program did not exist under Labor. We have an Australian Student Traineeship Foundation: $25 million has been allocated to the foundation to improve young people's access to work after they leave school. We also have the jobs pathway program. They are all initiatives of this government in the last 2Â½ years to assist young people.</para><para>Professor Bob Birrell in his study entitled `Equity implications of the new youth allowance for higher education students' states that the youth allowance will actually significantly improve eligibility for student financial assistance compared to the current arrangements under the Labor Party's Austudy. The parental means test that senators opposite were so quick to criticise is substantially more generous under the youth allowance arrangements.</para><para>As I said before, we believe that young unemployed should not be treated more generously than students. It is something that the community has asked us about over and over. The student community has been asking over and over, `Why are we discriminated against?' We argue that they should be treated the sameâand the youth allowance does just that. It is wrong to pay young people more to 
 be unemployed than to be students. As I said before, the youth allowance parental means test is actually far more generous than the old parental means test for Austudy. There are other benefits under the new youth allowance scheme. For example, students will gain from access to rent assistance of up to $75 per fortnight for the very first time. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>âOrder!

The <inline ref="s164">Employment Security Bill 1998 [No. 2]</inline> , which will amend the Workplace Relations Act 1996 and the Corporations Law, will protect the rights and entitlements of employees. The bill was introduced into the Senate on 26 May 1998 by Senator Mackay and was 
 subsequently introduced into the House of Representatives on 1 June by the Hon. Bob McMullan, shadow minister for industrial relations.</para></talk.start><para>The aim of this bill is to put an end to the Patrick style scams where companies seek to avoid their legal obligations to their employees by manipulating company law. In 1993 Australia became a signatory to ILO convention No. 173, a convention designed to provide minimum protection for worker entitlements in insolvent situations. This longstanding recognition of the need to protect the accrued entitlements of Australian workers remains unsupported by legislation even though 8,000 companies and 5,000 businesses fail each year.</para><para>Unions have over many years sought to have workers' entitlements given priority in insolvent situations. Deliberate scams by companies are a more recent phenomenon. When an insolvent company goes into liquidation an administrator is appointed to distribute what is left of the assets of the business amongst its creditors. The first substantial call upon the remainder of an insolvent company's assets are the secured creditors, in effect banks and lending institutions. Workers lose not only their jobs but also their accrued means of supporting and keeping intact their lives and those of their families during the crisis period following the sudden loss of employment.</para><para>The executive of the ACTU in February this year called upon the federal government to take responsibility for the personal and financial tragedy that has been inflicted upon workers and their families because of the unreasonable operation of current company insolvency laws and corporate scams. In May 1998 the ACTU executive condemned the current government for its ideological attacks on workers and their unions. One of the key issues addressed was the protection of workers' accumulated entitlements in circumstances of employer insolvency.</para><para>The International Labour Conference of the ILO in 1991 released a report entitled <inline font-style="italic">Protection of workers' claims in the event of the insolvency of their employer</inline>. This report shows that, across the globe, the protection of 
 the entitlements of workers upon the insolvency of a company is difficult to achieve without requisite legislative change. From 1966 onwards, employers in Brazil have been bound to deposit in a bank account opened in each employee's name a sum equivalent to eight per cent of the employee's monthly salary. However, this protects only end of service payments and not entitlements owing.</para><para>In Japan, where employees often invest their savings in the firm where they work, an act adopted in 1975 requires the enterprise to adopt necessary measures to protect the money invested. In December 1998 the Australian Law Reform Commission report No. 45 entitled <inline font-style="italic">General insolvency inquiry</inline> recommended that the interests of employees would best be protected by the creation of a wage earner protection fund. Such a fund would ensure that employees were paid in every insolvency. This is what the  Employee Protection (Wage Guarantee) Bill 1998  seeks to resolve. Measures can be undertaken to protect the entitlements of workers, and that is what this bill proposes.</para><para>I will briefly address the changes to legislation proposed by the Australian Labor Party and what these improvements will mean for Australian workers. Firstly, the Workplace Relations Act 1996 would be amended. A new section, 170JI, would allow the commission, when it found that an employee had been unlawfully or unfairly dismissed and should be reinstated, to make the reinstatement order against companies that were related to the direct employer.</para><para>This provision would therefore ensure that companies could not use the Patrick's corporate scam to leave their workers without any effective remedy against unfair and unlawful termination. Further, a new section 178A would allow employees to claim accrued legal entitlements against a related company of their direct employer in certain circumstances, as the New South Wales Industrial Relations Act 1996 does. Secondly, the Corporations Act would be amended through new division 6A which would provide that, where a company was in receivership, the court could make an order requiring a related company to pay the debts of the other company, including 
 accrued entitlements to employees. Through section 1317HD of the Corporations Law, it would give creditors the right to bring proceedings for the recovery of debts against directors of companies acting in contravention of the Corporations Law.</para><para>As the member for Canberra (Mr McMullan) has stated in the other chamber, any government genuinely concerned with security would take these bills out. This is an opportunity for the current government to make the rhetoric of security a reality. Together with the wage guarantee fund legislation that has been proposed by the Member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio), this legislation constitutes a package to advance security for Australian families in the face of the challenges of a modern economy.</para><para>The Patrick scam, however, is not the only example where employers have done a bunk with their employees' entitlements in the case of insolvency. One recent example that comes to mind is the Cobar mine dispute, which was mentioned by Senator Mackay in her speech during the second reading debate. It is estimated that the Cobar workers are owed between $10 million and $12 million in entitlements. Workers at the now insolvent South Grafton abattoir have $3 million in leave entitlements, severance and redundancy payments owing to them.</para><para>In March of this year, 157 employees in two nursing homes in Rockhampton and Yeppoon lost their jobs and were subsequently informed that their employment related entitlements of $1.4 million were almost certainly lost because of the insolvency of their employers. At around the same time, 153 workers at the Woodlawn mine near Goulburn lost $6 million in accumulated lawful entitlements. That is a lot of money that has been taken out of the pockets of workers in this country. In fact, more than 800 workers have lost almost $20 million in entitlements by a variety of scams being employed by employers to avoid their responsibility in the payment of these moneys and entitlements to their employeesâmoneys and entitlements that rightfully belong to those employees; moneys that have been held in trusts by companies, including accrued annual leave 
 entitlements, accrued long service leave entitlements, and accrued leave entitlements generally; moneys that many could argue have been stolen out of the pockets of workers by the mistrust of companies who were trusted with, or given trusteeship over, those moneys, in a situation where those companies have defaulted.</para><para>As is clearly demonstrated, the problems of insolvencies and the loss of workers' entitlements are serious issues that need to be addressed. I have recently had some discussions with some of my former colleagues from the AMWU. They have been able to detail to me a number of other cases, some of which I will discuss today.</para><para>In Western Australia Gibbney Graphics, a state based organisation in Perth, which operated under the graphic arts award, closed its doors in 1991, while the directors of the company allegedly were sailing around the Greek Islands, enjoying the benefits and the fruits of the profits produced by employees of that company. The company was declared insolvent, yet the directors tripped off to the other side of the world, swanning around the Mediterranean, spending the annual leave, long service leave, superannuation, tax payments, health fund contributions and union contributions of their workers. This money, which amounted to over $400,000 in accrued entitlements, was not forwarded by the employers and to this day has never been seen by the former employees. Some individual workers are still owed amounts up to $30,000. These figures do not include interest on the moneys owed, so those amounts today would be significantly higher.</para><para>The case was put before a Western Australian industrial magistrate who in 1994 concluded that wages, which include all entitlements, be awarded to the former employees of Gibbney Graphics at a total of $414,624.80. I do know that my Senate colleague Senator Sherry was very interested in the Gibbney Graphics case, dealing as it did with superannuation. This case apparently was a catalyst for changes to superannuation legislation to make employers accountable for contributions. The Gibbney Graphics matter was referred to the company fraud squad of 
 the Western Australia police, and no conclusion was ever reached. The case was terminated in January of this year as being too difficult and too expensive for those involved to continue with.</para><para>When the Lachlan Valley Food Processors in Cowra, New South Wales, closed their doors in March 1997, 22 employees lost three weeks in pay and accrued entitlements. The owner of the company had problems securing funds and for three weeks his work force of 22 employees, in good faith, worked for no pay, promised by the employer that `Next week, things will be all right.' But that was not so. The company director owed the local council $1 million, with a further $3 million owed to local growers. It was the council that brought in the creditors, locking the gates on the processing plant and on the hopes and happiness of 22 local townspeople and their families.</para><para>In all, these workers lost the three weeks pay owing to them and their annual leave. What is even more disheartening is that the employers had not passed on any of the employees' superannuation contributions or their payroll deducted union dues. When the time came to divide up the assetsâand it is not hard to guess what happenedâthe council and other creditors were paid first. The workers, to this day, still have not reached a settlement, but the council has kindly informed them that they will be lucky to get 10 cents out of every dollar that they are owed.</para><para>This is a real tragedy for a town like Cowra. Unemployment is running at an unacceptably high level and the local townspeople are desperate, relieved when an opportunity for employment such as this one opens up. Yet, ultimately, they were let down, and, in all probability, let down by their own council. The people of Cowra were taken advantage of, and, once again, are resigned to bleak employment prospects in their townâlike everyone else in rural and regional Australia. These examples go to show that, time and time again, workers are the ones who pay the most when companies go insolvent.</para><para>There are other methods, however, of ensuring that workers obtain the entitlements 
 owing to them when the loss of their employment is out of their hands. The Australian Council of Trade Unions has discussed the pooling of employees' entitlements. One example is to collect the entitlements into a central fund. One of the other options within this scheme is to develop a mechanism whereby employees would be allowed to access funds in existing redundancy accounts for the purposes of taking paid leave. In times of downturn, whether it be seasonal or economic, actual redundancies could be avoided by using this sort of scheme. These funds would be ideally suited to the labour hire industries, but could be utilised in other industries.</para><para>One of the most important factors here is that, in the event of receivership or liquidation of a company, those employee entitlements would be guaranteed, as they would be out of the control of the business concerned. These funds could well lead to an improvement in entitlements such as redundancy, as there would be no cap, and additional items such as paid training leave.</para><para>There are some schemes of this nature currently in existence, and they certainly provide positive examples for Australian workers. In my state of New South Wales, the New South Wales Building and Construction Industry Long Service Payments Act 1974 commenced on 1 February 1975, establishing a portable long service leave payment scheme for building and construction workers. On 1 July 1986, the Building Construction Industry Long Service Payments Act 1986 prescribed that funding would come from a 0.5 per cent levy on the total cost of the building and construction work. In March 1993, the levy was suspended until 30 June 1997 as the scheme was funded from interest on investment and surplus funds. As of 1 July 1997, a 0.2 per cent levy has been imposed.</para><para>A similar scheme is in operation in Victoria for the building and construction industry. It operates on a surplus, requiring no levy or contributions from employers or employees. Importantly, a national redundancy trust was established in the building and construction industry. The Australian Construction Industry Redundancy Trust, or ACIRT as it is commonly known, requires employers to contri 
 bute, on average, $40 per week on behalf of each employee. Employees are able to access their funds upon termination with their employer. There are similar schemes operating in New South Wales and Victoria. INCOLINK in Victoria also provides free ambulance and personal accident insurance for all of their members. A scheme that carries over unused sick leave entitlements from one employer to the other has also been established.</para><para>These schemes have six major advantages. The first is the total portability of entitlements, and that these entitlements are guaranteed to be paid out to the employees in the instance of a company collapsing. Further, financial benefits are generated through the funds to be reinvested back into the industry and into worker training. Also, the pooling of entitlements could lead to improvements of the actual entitlements themselves, and there is a minimum cost as the funds potentially become self-sufficient. In addition to these advantages, workers could also be provided with additional paid leave through the funds. In all, the pooling of entitlements can only be of benefit to the Australian work force, particularly the labour hire and manufacturing industries.</para><para>Workers have the right to be protected from the Patrick type scams that have shaken the Australian work force. This bill gives the parliament the opportunity to ensure security for all Australian workers, particularly against unscrupulous employers like Patrick, Cobar Mines and their ilk. The government can join with the Australian Labor Party to protect the entitlements of our workers and to show the Australian community that they are committed to job and income security by supporting this bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>4128</page.no><name role="metadata">Murphy, Sen Shayne</name><name role="display">Senator MURPHY</name><name.id>FX5</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âAs was just pointed out by Senator George Campbell, the <inline ref="s164">Employment Security Bill 1998 [No. 2]</inline>  goes to the very heart of job security and the courses of action that have for some time been available to some unscrupulous employers which enable them to get away with not paying workers their genuine entitlements. I suppose it took the likes of Patrick'sâthe scumbags that they 
 areâto bring this to public attention and focus on the fact that a course of action needed to be taken.</para></talk.start><para>It was interesting how the government suddenly found $250 million to sack 2,000 workers from the waterfront. Interestingly enough, as was pointed out before, they did not find any money for the likes of the workers from Cobar or Woodlawn. There have been many cases of employers taking this course of action. I found myself involved with at least two or three cases in my former role as secretary of the timber workers union. Employers just shut up shop by putting their company into voluntary liquidation or receivership, which makes it very difficult for employers, many of whom are small employers.</para><para>Another point is the unfair dismissal laws that this government has sought to bring in, and the impact on small employers. This further removes something that people do not take for granted. Workers' employment conditions and security of employment are things that they rightly deserve and which ought to prevail in this country.</para><para>That is not the only course of action taken by some employers concerning job security. I listened with interestâalthough I do not know whether I should say thatâto Senator Eric Abetz last night when he talked about the Wesley Vale pulp mill, the pulp mill at Burnie and the potential magnesite mine. Some companies turn to imports rather than manufacturing in this country and the maintenance of manufacturing jobs.</para><para>A very good example of this is Amcor which has chosenâat least at this point in timeâto close the operations of the Burnie pulp mill in October this year. Those jobs will be lost because pulp will be imported primarily from forests in Indonesia or Thailand, or perhaps both. This will cost jobs in my state and ultimately will lead to a loss in jobs elsewhere in the country.

He changed the environmental guidelines; those that the Commonwealth had agreed to and those where the Commonwealth said that, if the guidelines as set by the Tasmanian government at the time were achieved by the company, they would not interfere.</para></talk.start></continue><para>There was a meeting between North Broken Hill and Premier Robin Gray that led to an amendment that significantly weakened those pulp mill emission guidelines. That led to the intervention of the Commonwealth government.</para><para>If Senator Abetz is looking for someone to blame regarding the cost of jobs and employment security, he should look no further than to his old colleagueâalthough I know they did not get on too well togetherâthe former Premier, Robin Gray. Senator Abetz gave the impression that somehow, if we had had the Wesley Vale pulp mill, that would have saved the jobs at Burnie. Nothing could be further from the truth. If we had the pulp mill at Wesley Vale, the jobs at Burnie would have gone a long time ago, and we would have had significantly fewer jobs some time ago.</para><para>When this government came to office in March 1996, I can recall the now Prime Minister, John Howard, accusing the then Prime Minister prior to the election of being the king of export woodchips or the export woodchip champion of the world. That is very important in terms of job security and job creation. During the two years that this government has been in power there has been a 40 per cent increase in the export of woodchips. There has been a significant decline in employment and manufacturing of forest 
 based products in this country and in my state.</para><para>Senator Abetz was congratulating Mr Miles. When we left office in 1996, the unemployment rate in the electorate of Braddon was 11 per cent. According to Senator Abetz, Mr Miles has made that much better. If `much better' is increasing unemployment in Braddon, I am not so sure that the people agree. It now stands at 14 per cent. If Senator Abetz wants to defend his colleague, he at least ought to defend him on groundsâalbeit there are very few and, in fact, I cannot think of anyâthat he can be defended on.</para><para>Employment is not one of them and employment security is not one of them. When the workers were down at the gates of the Burnie pulp and paper mill defending their employment rights, it was none other than Chris Miles who went down there and said, `Go back to work. You blokes should go back to work.'</para><para>This is the same Chris Miles who allowed his Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs, Warren Truss, when the announcement of the closure of the Burnie pulp mill was made, to say: `It's the conditions and the rorts of those workers.' I think he said, `Those workers at the Burnie pulp mill made the MUA and the maritime workers look like a Sunday school picnic.' Did Chris Miles get up and defend them? No. So I say again to Senator Abetz: when you come to talk about a magnasite mine that you say Chris Miles is defending so stoutly and the possibilities of employment that it might generate, why have you not gone up to the current state Premier, Mr Rundle, and said: `Premier, why have you done a deal with Christine Milne to lock up the very area that one of the magnasite mine deposits lies in?'</para><para>Indeed, why hasn't Chris Miles done it? It is in his electorate? If he is so keen for job security and employment generationâthe unemployment rate in Braddon has gone from 11 per cent in 1996 to 14 per cent todayâwhy hasn't he taken up these issues up with the Premier? Why hasn't Senator Abetz gone to the coalition partners, Rundle and Milne, and said: `Listen, we want this magnasite mine'? Labor is on the record as saying that 
 we will support the magnasite mine. There are two sites, but one of them has been locked up by an agreement between the Premier Tony Rundle and Greens leader Christine Milne, and there is a <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> record of that. That matter was debated in the state parliament last year. Chris Miles chaired his meeting the other week with the Minister for Resources and Energy, Senator Parer. They flew over the very place, but they did not fly down and talk to Tony Rundle to see what they could do about it.</para><para>There are a range of areas that this bill will cover. But probably more important is what this government ought to be doing in terms of industry development. It has done nothing. Some workers came up here this week from the pulp mill along with their union representatives and had meetings with various people, including the Prime Minister, Mr Howard. They put a proposition to the government, as they did to the opposition, and the Democrats and the Greens and Senator Harradine. The Prime Minister vacillated, at best. He gave no commitmentâalbeit he said he would consider their proposition with regard to making sure we had a more level playing field in the forest products industry so we could create the 15,000 to 25,000 jobs that he and his minister so proudly announced would result from the regional forest agreements coming into force. I can recall the Prime Minister and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Anderson, saying that we would get 1,000 jobs in Tasmania as a result of the signing of the RFA. I will tell you what the score is right now: 25 new jobs, 600 old ones gone. What has the government done with regard to timber industry policy and development? Zip. Except that we have seen a 40 per cent increase in export woodchips, it has done nothing.</para><para>The Prime Minister had an opportunity this week to give some indication that they were prepared to do something. Senator Abetz, when I again asked a question on employment securityâwhat did the government do when the pulp mill closure was announced?âsaid, `They sent down a cabinet delegation.' Who was it? The Minister for Social Security, Senator Newman, and the Minister for Fi 
 nance and Administration, Mr Fahey! What did they want to talk about? `How we can give you a few bucks in the hip-pocket to get you on unemployment.' Really! That is a great step forward. When they were confronted by the people down there they thought: `Dear, oh dear. We will have to go back and rethink this. We will make another announcement.' I want to know where it is. We haven't got it. The Prime Minister told the guys the other day: `We will make an announcement in 10 days time.' I will watch for that with great interest.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>9L6</name.id><name role="metadata">MACKAY</name><name role="display">Senator Mackay</name></talker><para>âWith bated breath.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>FX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Murphy, Sen Shayne</name><name role="display">Senator MURPHY</name></talker><para>âYes, at least. It is interesting to consider what the coalition have achieved and how their arguments are applied to legislation such as has been proposed by the opposition to bring at least some measures forward to apply to employment security. If you look at what they wanted to do in terms of unfair dismissal laws and in the waterfront area it may be unfortunate that at the end of the day the conspiracy case may never take place. I am sure that conspiracy case would have gone to the full extent of the government and ended up squarely in the Prime Minister's office. I am sure that is why we have heard very little from the government of late on that issue. Peter Reith seems to have almost slipped off the mapâMr Insignificant, Mr Unsighted.</para></talk.start></continue><para>There are many areas where employers have taken the opportunity to use very low acts to avoid their responsibilities to employees. I can remember one, in particular, in Tasmania, where a former member of a state Liberal government had a saw milling operation and just shut up shop. The guys were left wondering where they would get their pay from. I represented all 17 of them at the creditors meeting. They went into voluntary liquidation. The people who owned the place, the likes of Vince Smith, former Liberal member of government, made sure that their shareholdings were sufficient to outvote all of the other creditors, including the workers. That is the step they took.</para><para>Those workers all had families. Probably none of them earned more than $26,000 a year and they had to survive. They all prob 
 ably had car payments to make and mortgages to repay. Not only did they not get the courtesy of being paid, they 	did not even get the courtesy of being notified of what was taking place. Did Vince Smith lose any money? Hardly. Did the other people who owned the place in partnership lose any money? Hardly. But the creditors did, despite the fact that the laws then in place said the workers had to be paid, as did the Industrial Relations Commission. Ultimately they did get some money, some many months later. It just shows how much this type of legislation is needed and how important it is to do whatever we can to ensure that there is a fair system both for workers and for employers.</para><para>There was another example where a plant closed. The people did not get paid; they went on the dole. We chased the money for a period of time and the person who was put in charge by the receivers decided that he would reoperate the plant. He asked the guys on the dole if they would come back and work for nothing. He then said, `You will work for nothing and when I have sufficient wood products sold and I make a profit you will get paid.' Of course, the union was not made aware of this at the time because the blokes probably felt they had little option. They too probably had familiesâmost of them did. There were about 23 of them. Not all of them took up that optionâI am only talking about nine peopleâbut there they were thinking that maybe there was an opportunity for them. The unscrupulous grub not only got them to work for nix while they were being paid the dole but sold the timber and never paid them.</para><para>They are the sorts of things that we should not tolerate in this country. They are the sorts of things that this bill will go, in part way, to fixing. I commend the bill to the Senate. I hope that I will see the likes of Senator Eric Abetz and maybe some other government senators standing up to speak in support of this on the basis that it is a very important part of security for workers in this country.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>4131</page.no><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator COONAN</name><name.id>2M6</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe background to this bill, the <inline ref="s164">Employment Security Bill 1998 [No. 2]</inline> , is that it has been introduced into both houses of parliament by the ALP. It proposes amend 
 ments to the Workplace Relations Act 1996 and the Corporations Law with a view to providing a greater range of remedies to employees whose entitlements are affected as a result of corporate restructuring. Senator Murphy's contribution was, I suppose fairly predictably, long on rhetoric. He did not really look at the bill in any great detail, but it is appropriate that the bill be considered in its particulars.</para></talk.start><para>Proposed section 170JI would empower the Australian Industrial Relations Commission or the Federal Court to order that a body corporate related to the employer is deemed to be the employer for the purpose of a reinstatement order. The practical effect of the proposed provision would be that the related body corporate assumes liabilities and debts that are the same as those of the employer under the contracts of employment between the employer and the employees. I just want to go on to talk about section 178 before I come back to that section.</para><para>Proposed section 178A would apply to the situation where a group company, the related body corporate, contracts with another company in the same corporate group for the provision of services, including labour hire services, and the employees of the latter company are employed under an award, order of the commission, certified agreement or Australian workplace agreement. In the case where the latter company defaults on the payment of entitlements to its employees, whether by insolvency or otherwise, proposed section 178A would make the related body corporate liable for the payment of legal entitlements of employees of an insolvent company, being entitlements related to the contract between the head group company and the labour hire company.</para><para>During my contribution this afternoon I want to put on the record the effect of what is being proposed so that I can put my comments in context. Clearly, without more, both provisions may be invalid on the basis that they either impose a tax or affect the acquisition of property on other than just terms. This is because the provisionsâand I particularly refer to proposed section 178Aâwould require a company with no relevant, pre- 
 existing liability to pay an amount of money to employees of another company. Proposed section 170JI would require the related company to remunerate employees to which it would, but for an order under section 170JI, have absolutely no other liability.</para><para>The constitutional difficulties may be able to be overcome or even minimised if the provisions are actually able to be restructured so that the liability attaches to the related company, as a result of some very specific proven action and involvement with the management of the employer. But, as these sections are currently constructed, one could only have the gravest doubt that they would pass the test of constitutionality or that they would not fall foul of the requirementâa requirement that I am sure all senators supportâthat no entity, no company or no individual suffers an acquisition of property on other than just terms.</para><para>There is yet another proposed section that I think might run into some difficulties. It may, in fact, be redundant. That involves the proposed amendments to the Corporations Law. It proposes that directors can be sued in respect of unpaid wages. I can understand how that might present itself to those sitting on the opposite side as an easy solution, but, of course, it ignores the fact that there is already in the Corporations Law provision for directors of corporations to be personally liable if they trade a corporation while it is insolvent. The test of insolvency is and remainsâso far as I am aware and has been for many yearsâwhether a company is able to pay its debts as and when they fall due.</para><para>In the situation of a company that would wilfully continue to trade and incur a liability to pay wages, knowing that it could not meet those wages, that will give rise to an action against directors that will render them personally liable in respect of those undertakings on behalf of the company. Clearly, what usually happens is that if directors become aware that a corporation is in difficulty and either may not or is not likely to be able to pay all its debts as and when they fall due, including wages, it is usually put into provisional liquidation or a receiver or manager is appointed. This is orthodox law; there is nothing 
 startling or new about it. I would say, prior to this debate progressing much further, that there may well be reason to consider that at least that amendment is redundant, even if it does not suffer from the same apparent constitutional defects as the other two sections may.</para><para>Senator Murphy talked about what is behind all this, and it is a reasonable thing to bring up in a debate such as thisâthat is, the issue of job security, which I want to come to in a moment. But I will finish what I wanted to say in my remarks on the bill. The bill proposes amendments to the Workplace Relations Act and the Corporations Law relating to corporate restructures that affect the employment of employees but which may involve liability of other legal entities. That is really the first point that we have to get our heads around.</para><para>The issue of ensuring entitlements of employees in a case where an employer has engaged in corporate restructuring is, in fact, a very complex one. I can say, as an entirely personal matter, that those who have tried to wrestle with this bill have my personal sympathy because it is a very complex issue to address, and any solution certainly must not be based on a knee-jerk response to a particular factual situation. I think that is really what we have here. There has been predictable outrage by those who sit opposite as to some recent events that I will come to and one has to be very careful that, in trying to address a particular situation according to a point of view that might be taken, you do notâto use that dreadful clicheâoverreach and throw the baby out with the bath water. The government's advice is very clearly that the proposed amendments to the act are of doubtful constitutionality. This, if nothing else, underscores the need for very careful consideration of the issues.</para><para>I should also say that the Corporations Law already contains provisions that allow a liquidator to undo preferential transactions involving related parties in the period leading to the winding-up of a company. Therefore, if a company is proven to be engaged in sham transactions in order to wrongfully terminate 
 the employment of its work force, appropriate remedies already exist.</para><para>I might say, in a gesture of a true bipartisan approach to this, that it is worth looking at whether or not you have already got the remedies. I certainly do restate, on behalf of the government, a commitment to finding a solution to the issue of protecting the entitlement of employees on employer insolvency, but I do caution against any haste or overreaching in respect of this matter.</para><para>As I said before, I do understand that this bill has come before the Senate as a reaction to what is said to be anxiety about job security. I do take issue with the fact that job security has been something that has pervaded the consciousness of all Australians in the sort of way that publicity may have suggested. A range of evidence shows that job insecurity is not increasing under the current government. Survey data collected by the Roy Morgan Research Centre and published in the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> magazine on a regular basis over the past 23 years show that perceptions of job security have not varied dramatically over the entire period, except during Labor's recession of the early 1990sâthat was `the recession we had to have'âwhen they plunged to an historical low. I hope I have time to come back to the data behind these statements.</para><para>It is true there was a fall in perceptions of job security in the latest survey data collected by the Roy Morgan Research Centre, but the specific job security question was asked in the context of a series of questions that directly related to the waterfront and certainly not the work force in general. Other data tell a similar story. In the survey by Clemenger in March last year, which Mr McMullan, the shadow minister in the other place, is so fond of quoting, the issue of job security did not even rate as one of the top 40 issues of concern amongst Australians. A survey by AGB McNair which was reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> on 21 October 1997 also showed a low level of job insecurity.</para><para>Interestingly enough, data from the 1995 Australian workplace industrial relations survey shows that union members were more likely to feel insecure than non-union members, regardless of their occupation or the 
 sector in which they worked. A recent Australian Bureau of Statistics survey result showing a tenfold increase in casual full-time employment in New South Wales since 1991 is not representative of casual employment at the national level. In fact, the most recent ABS data that I have been able to turn upâthe 1997 dataâshowed that the number of casuals as a proportion of all employees has fallen slightly compared with the previous year. In any event, many workers are choosing to take casual employment to suit their lifestyle flexibilities and the higher hourly earnings received as casuals.</para><para>It is not all bad news for casuals, particularly for women, who sometimes find that that flexibility is an absolute godsend if they are looking after children, or indeed looking after other family members such as elderly relatives. The growth in casual and part-time employment is also a generational and international trend. It has more to do with the growth of service industries and the changing complexion of the labour force than it does industrial relations legislation, no matter how much it is reviled.</para><para>The best way to help Australian workers to feel more secure in their jobs is for their workplaces to become more productive and profitable. The Workplace Relations Act gives employers and employees the opportunity to reach agreements at their workplace which will enhance productivity and ultimately improve job security because there will be more for everyone. All the opposition can offer is a return to the centralised system of the past with its one size fits all awards and centralised wage fixing, and its dismal productivity growth and declining real wages. I can understand that that is a model that many in the opposition feel comfortable with, but it has been proven not to work.</para><para>I wanted to relate my comments on job security to the stevedoring levy bills which were introduced into the Senate yesterday. The stevedoring levy arrangements are but one element of the government's reform initiatives to promote improved performance across the industry. They are not aimed at any particular employer or group of employees. The stevedoring levy is intended to fund the 
 costs of redundancies arising from restructuring required to meet the government's seven benchmark objectives.</para><para>The promotion of industry wide reform to achieve international benchmarks is quite different from the circumstances where an individual enterprise is closed due to commercial or other considerations surrounding that particular business. As to the wider question of employee entitlements in the case of employer insolvency, which is a matter of concern, this was raised with the relevant state ministers at the last meeting of the Labour Ministers' Council on 1 May this year. It was agreed to review the issues involved and to consider the matter further at the next council meeting.</para><para>The government believes that it is inappropriate to take a direct role in assisting restructuring by facilitating access to funding for the cost of redundancies arising from genuine reforms required to achieve its benchmark objectives, which are aimed at improving stevedoring performance to internationally competitive standards. The new stevedoring levy will apply to the stevedoring of containers and vehicles in Australia to be paid by the stevedoring company. Both major stevedores, Patrick and P&amp;O Ports, which handle about 95 per cent of Australia's container trade, have agreed to absorb the levy into their existing structure of charges, so there is no overall increase in cost to shippers. As reforms are implemented over time, stevedoring costs can be expected to progressively diminish.</para><para>These arrangements are to facilitate reform across the stevedoring industry and are not aimed at any particular employer or group of employees. The government believes that the promotion of industry wide reform to achieve these benchmarks is different from the circumstances where an individual enterprise, like the Cobar mines that has been mentioned this afternoon, is closed due to commercial or other considerations surrounding that particular business. Australian stevedores are operating viable businesses, providing an income stream that gives the industry itself the capacity to repay the funds provided by the government's redundancy funding arrange 
 ments, ensuring the cost is to be borne by the stevedoring industry and not the Australian taxpayer. Indeed, the reforms will enable the industry to pay them.</para><para>As to the wider question of employee entitlements in the case of insolvency, at the last meeting of the Labour Ministers Council, as I said, it was agreed to review the issue and to consider some of the difficult issues relating to that that I spoke about a little earlier. Labor is threatening the redundancy payments of MUA members who have already voted to accept a negotiated settlement of the waterfront dispute. It is irresponsible not to allow these well thought out and well structured reforms to proceed.</para><para>The opposition is now in the position of threatening these people's future because it is refusing to vote for the bill in the Senate. Now that a settlement brokered by the MUA has been overwhelmingly supported by the rank and file, it is absurd that there be any attempt at all to scuttle it.</para><para>I want to conclude my comments on Cobar. Securityâwhich is really the issue that we are dealing withâgrows out of a productive workplace and a strong economy. This is something that was noted by the former Governor of the Reserve Bankâa great friend to LaborâMr Bernie Fraser, who was quoted in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> as saying:</para><para>The shift away from centralised wage bargaining towards enterprise arrangements reflects the commonsense notion that giving employees and employers more control over wages, conditions and work practices in their own workplaces is good for productive growth.</para><para>I urge those on the other side to pass the levy.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>4134</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe <inline ref="s164">Employment Security Bill 1998 [No. 2]</inline>  has clearly been born from the Patrick-MUA struggle on the waterfront. This situation was a particularly glaring example of the government's out and out attack on workers and the ability of workers to get together and bargain collectively. It is symptomatic of the broader philosophical and ideological agenda that has affected millions of Australians and their job securityâwhether or not Senator Coonan and others will recognise thatâand their standards of living.</para></talk.start><para>I would like to refer to a few of the points that Senator Coonan mentioned in her presentation. Senator Coonan talked about a general international trend. Well, don't we know it. What we are seeing is a race to the bottom. We are seeing large corporations playing off one host country against the other in the race to the bottom. They are playing them off in terms of wages and conditions, environmental standards, rights for indigenous people, corporate ratesâthe ability of large corporations to be able to avoid taxâand so on. They can play off one country against the other. Australia is putting its hand up to get international investmentâespecially from large corporations. We think the way to do this is to be in there in the race for the bottom in terms of lowest standards.</para><para>Senator Coonan also mentioned that people are choosing to perform casual workâa casualisation of the work force. I do not actually think that is the case. I stand to be corrected if there are firm statistics that show that people are choosing to work at night or at odd hours or are choosing to work for one or two hours for only normal rates. I would question whether casual work forces get substantially increased hourly rates. You would only need to ask Comcar drivers what the additional, magnificent extra money is for casual workers compared to full time. I believe it is about $1 or $2 an hourâwhoopy-do! For that you lose various holiday entitlements, sick leave, et cetera, and the surety of knowing that you have a job each week when you need to pay the bills.</para><para>We see this trend of the general undermining of workers' rights and job security. But before I go on to that, I forgot to mention that Senator Coonan said that this bill could not be supported in terms of its dubious constitutionality. Wouldn't it have been nice if the government had applied the principle of constitutionality to its own Wik 10-point plan. If they base their support for a bill on constitutionality, would they have put up a bill like the Wik 10-point plan? I think not. What they tend to do is put a bill up which they have been advised on a number of fronts is likely to be knocked out under the constitution and then blame the High Court when it eventually 
 tells them so. Attack the High Courtâwhat a nice way of running a government.</para><para>Let us get back to the undermining of workers' rights and job security. The general agenda of this government in industrial relationsâunder the Workplace Relations Actâis enterprise bargaining. The so-called flexibility has led to more contract work, to outsourcing and to the detriment of job security and, I argue strongly, to the detriment of lifestyle and to the detriment of families which this government has stood up on so many occasions saying they support. How do you plan for family and houses and holidays if you boss is constantly breathing down your neck waving a one-way contract. What do I mean when I say a one-way contract? I mean a contract which is not enforceable from the side of the workers.</para><para>We have heard on many occasions that there are remedies that employers can access immediately. They can sack people, they can change their conditions, they can require certain conditions, and now we know that they are going on to the 20 allowable instruments. However, there is nothing in reality which gives remedy in the case of bosses who do not keep their side of the contract. So what we are doing is creating a whole lot of people who do not have certainty themselves but have the certainty of knowing that they have a one-way contract that many of them have been forced to sign. Many of those people are also threatened with the non-renewal of the contract if they do not keep their side of the bargain even if their employer does not keep their side of the contract that they have signed.</para><para>We have a one-eyed emphasis on competition policy and concepts such as productivity and international competitiveness. This is part of the whole process of globalisation. Everything we doâall of our laws and all of our local economic policiesâhas to be geared towards the needs of international investors. It is a very large version of the cargo cult. I believe we are creating classes of people who may either be overworked or unemployed. This creates stresses which have real social, economic and health costs.</para><para>In this process we see the government systematically attacking a range of groupsâthose groups that they think might be vulnerable. The government were hoping to divide groups so that they fought against each other. They were finding groups to blame. It was a very convenient scenario to set up workers on the waterfront as being somehow to blame for the situation other workers found themselves in. That was the general idea of bringing out the false figures on waterfront workersâthe hours they worked and what they got paid for on a crane. The idea was to link into people's own feelings of insecurityâthe working poor; those people who are struggling to surviveâand say, `We would like to divert your concern and anger from the government and the policies that are creating this growing class of working poor onto a group of workers whom we believe are getting too much.' That was the processâdivide and rule in Australia. Many people saw through this, I am pleased to say.</para><para>We have had massive government involvement in the whole situation. The government's role in the Patrick scandal is one of the most staggering things that I have seen in the history of government in Australia. This government is in cohorts with a company which has the single aim of destroying a collective body. This conspiracy has occurred without a care in the world for the concept of job security. I believe the government have been boasting to people in business and overseas that they will create a situation of greater flexibilityâby that they mean greater job insecurity within Australia. As evidence of their involvement, the Prime Minister has been exposed as supporting the interventionist strategy proposed by Patrick. The Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business is up to his eyeballs strategising to break the back of the union that is bucking their particular plans. We have the government promising to pay the redundancy. Did that get organised overnight? We have the government financing the destruction of job security and the right to collectively bargain. Many people believe it is an inappropriate role for government.</para><para>I wonder if the government thinks it is an acceptable defence to a charge of insolvent 
 trading or cheating persons in their dealings with a company for directors to claim that they hoped the parliament would vote funds to make up their creditors' losses? If that was an acceptable defence, there would be a few other companies lining up to do the same.</para><para>How does this deep involvement sit with the ministerial code of conduct? Maybe the government would like to explain whether the ministerial code of conduct allows ministers of the Crown to become involved in breaches of their own lawâand pretty new law at that. Even if it did, how would that bind the Governor-General to maintain in office persons acting in breach of the law?</para><para>In light of the fact that we have recently debated the  Company Law Review Bill 1997 , this private senator's bill is rather timely. Half the legal situation is clear. It is clear that the MUA have dropped the legal proceedings against Patrick as part of the deal. What is not clear is why the government has not pursued a prosecution against Patrick. There are many criminal options that the Director of Public Prosecutions could have taken. He could have pursued options under the Corporations Law, the common law or the New South Wales crimes act. But no effect has been put into this option. That would indicate one of two things: either, first, there is a hole in the current law so there is no legal avenue for the Director of Public Prosecutions to pursue or, secondly, there is an absolute lack of political will on the government's part. I suspect it is the latter, and this is quite congruent with the entire involvement of the government in this affair.</para><para>Indeed, I wonder whether the Director of Public Prosecutions has even been handed all the documents in the government's possession in relation to the stripping of assets from the Patrick labour hire companies so that whether charges can be laid in respect of offences such as the above can be examined. If not, why not? I wonder whether the New South Wales Attorney-General, the New South Wales Director of Public Prosecutions or the New South Wales police sought documents related to the asset stripping of the Patrick labour hire companies in relation to possible offences under state law. If this is the reason 
 for the government not pursuing Patrick's prosecution, how can the government be so blase about failing to amend the law as it stands, leaving the loophole open for any other company to undermine their workers' wages and entitlements?</para><para>The Asian meltdown and the potential implementation of a GST adds fuel to the fire. Jobs and entitlements are severely under threat and the government seem to be absolutely ignorant of what they are doing. In either scenario the same message comes out. The government are not interested in workers. They are not interested in providing any kind of job, wage or entitlements security.</para><para>This bill may not be the answer to these significant problems. It is obviously a vehicle by which the opposition can make these points to the government and I am not suggesting that anyone is expecting it to go anywhere. The Greens (WA) support the principle that we need to address and provide certainty over the problems that were so clearly highlighted in the MUA dispute. We are talking about the rights of people in Australia to bargain collectively. We are talking about the right for everyday workers to have some form of security, to know where they stand and where they can go for help and to be able to stand up with other people if they have problems in their workplaceâif they are treated unfairly. That is not unreasonable. The Greens (WA) have been very concerned about this area, and, apart from technicalities, we have not seen a reasonable response from the government.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>4137</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Chee, Sen Bill</name><name role="display">Senator O'CHEE</name><name.id>EU4</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI was not expecting to get the call quite as early as this, but I am stuck with it so I may as well say now what I had intended to say.

That is a fact. There is no way in an economy like ours that you can prevent that happening. A hallmark of our economy is the fact that it allows for failure. When companies fail, the workers are not the only people who lose. There are other creditors as well. I should point out that sometimes the workers are not creditors, but there are people who are creditorsâsecured creditors, unsecured creditors and so on. They all lose.</para><para>Every time a company collapses, a large number of people are affected. My concern is that sometimes one can go too far in attempting to protect one group of creditors or another group of creditors. I know in making these comments that they are as much addressed to another bill in another place as to this bill, but you cannot look at corporate insolvency without looking at the situation in its entirety, and that does require a mature approach to the subject.</para><para>I have regard to the comments made by Senator Mackay on 26 May in her second reading speech on this bill. She said that the effect of this bill would be that, where an employee has been unlawfully or unfairly dismissed and should be reinstated, it would be possible to make a reinstatement order against companies that are related to the direct employer. The effect of this in corporate terms is very simple. You would take all of the companies in a group and effectively treat them as one employer. That is the effect of the proposal in the bill. There are a few exceptions to that, I accept that, but that is the general thrust of the bill: to treat all the companies in a group as a single employer so that people who are sacked from one company could be reinstated to another company within the group. I see Senator Cooney sitting on the other side of the chamber. I think Senator Cooney would accept that that is the general thrust of this bill.</para><para>The problem is: if you do that, there is no point in having a group. There is no point in 
 a group setting up separate operating divisionsâsome companies to handle salary and staff, some to handle wage earning staff, some to handle one part of an operation and some to handle another. That is why groups are set up. The reason why groups are set up in that fashion is very simpleâto minimise risk. It allows a parent company to say when one part of the group starts to lose money, `We are going to abandon that operation,' without necessarily incurring liability to other companies within the group. That is very important.</para><para>One of the consequences of this bill would be to increase the number of companies that are put into liquidation or under administration because, although Senator Mackay's intentions are laudable and certainly laudable from a trade union point of view, she forgot the provisions relating to trading a company while insolvent, which are contained in the Corporations Law. Those provisions are quite onerous. They are onerous because if a director allows a company to trade from a point when he or she knows that that company is unable to meet its liabilities as and when they fall dueâand that includes liabilities to employeesâthen that company director is personally liable for the money.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>NB5</name.id><name role="metadata">CAMPBELL</name><name role="display">Senator George Campbell</name></talker><para>âBut these are moneys that you are holding in trust.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>EU4</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Chee, Sen Bill</name><name role="display">Senator O'CHEE</name></talker><para>âI hear Senator Campbell say it is moneys you hold in trust.

Senator Campbell fails to understand that, in the case of a corporate insolvency, liabilities like long service leave and so on are priority debts in the winding up. In other words, an employee who is owed money for unpaid long service, holidays, et cetera has a priority over every unsecured creditor in the company. They do not have a priority over secured creditors, but they have priority over unsecured creditors.

Who informed them that they had been sacked because the company ownership had changed? The person who admits that he attended the piggery on the day in question is a Mr Al Constantinidis.

Mr Justice Wilcoxâit was conceded that Mr Purdue and Mr Jackson were both employed at the piggery for some years before June 1994, Mr Purdue from September 1989 and Mr Jackson from June 1988. The group is one of three respondents in this case. I should just point out that the respondents are Brown and Hatton Group Pty Ltd, Brown and Hatton Rural Pty Ltd and Parkville Pig Stud Pty Ltd. According to the judgment of Mr Justice Wilcox:</para><para>At 11 May 1993, Group was the registered proprietor of the land on which the piggery was conducted. On that date it contracted to sell the land to Parkville, together with the livestock and the plant and equipment used for the conduct of the piggery.

The Memorandum of Transfer was dated that day but not registered until 29 August 1994.</para><para>The reason these matters came to a head is that Mr Purdue complained that he had, in fact, been underpaid by the former employers.

Shortly after his return, on 28 June, he visited the piggery. He met Mr Kellow and resolved the issue of underpayment of wages raised by Mr Purdue. After that meeting, he addressed a gathering of the employees. He informed them that the wages issue had been resolved, that the piggery had a `new owner' and their employment would cease on Thursday, 30 June.

He decided:</para><para>Unfortunately for Mr Purdue and Mr Jackson, however, harshness is immaterial. Section 170DE of the Act does not apply to this case. It is common ground in the evidence that Mr Constantinidis' offer, on behalf of Parkville, was for casual employment.

This paragraph excludes from the operation of subdivisions B, C and D of Division 3 of part VIA of the Act "a casual employee engaged for a short period within the meaning of subregulation (3)".

Were the union officials arguing for these legislative changes when they had control of the Department of Industrial Relations and when they had their person there in the ministry? The answer is no. Why were they not arguing for these legislative changes? The reason that they were not arguing for these legislative changes was that, at that point in time, there had been only one employer of note who had restructured a company to put off all the permanents, re-employed them as casuals and been able to sack them arbitrarily and, within the evidence of the case before the court, harshly. There was only one employer who, on record, was seen to do that and that, of course, was the previous Prime Minister. That is why these legislative changes before the chamber today never 
 saw the light of day when the Labor Party was in government. They never saw the light of day because the previous Prime Minister would never have allowed it.

 were dealt with in that situation. The general purpose of this bill is to seek to stop situationsâscams is the word that was used, I believe, by members of the oppositionâwhere companies are avoiding their legal obligations to employees, and it is a worthy and a commendable objective. Indeed, it is an objective that has been pursued by the Democrats on other occasions. I know that my colleague Senator Andrew Murray has moved amendments previously to the package of Wallis reforms, specifically to the Corporations Law, in an attempt to prevent the kinds of corporate restructurings that were designed for the very purpose of hurting workers.</para><para>That amendment to the Corporations Law, I remember, had the support of the ALP initially but, I believe, in order to get the Wallis reforms through it had to be dropped. For the purposes of speeding up the process of financial deregulation, that particular amendment was dropped, which is unfortunate. It goes to show that the Democrats and, specifically, Senator Andrew Murray, have pursued this matter in another form.</para><para>We support the concept of this bill and the sentiments behind it. The sustained high levels of unemployment in Australia over many years now have seen extremely adverse effects on job security and, of course, deleterious relations in some cases between employers and employees.</para><para>It is no secret that continuing or sustained levels of high unemployment translate into high rates of increased job insecurity, while those lucky enough to find employment in the extremely tough Australian labour market are faced with increasing demands to work harder and for longer hours, as companies downsize and force their employees to do work which previously may have been carried out by more than one person. This kind of insecurity, this job culture or corporate culture that we are creating, has seriously disadvantaged all participants in the labour market.</para><para>Young people specifically find it increasingly difficulty to find work in this kind of market. Then they are further disadvantaged by cuts to the education systemâthe very area where people are expected to develop, maintain and redevelop their skills so that 
 they can have a better shot in the labour marketâand that makes it increasingly difficult for those young people even to begin to compete for jobs.</para><para>Mature age workers, on the other hand, who also have felt the brunt of structural reform in our work environment, find themselves redundant at 45, being forced to retire because suddenly their jobs no longer exist. We are witnessing the wholesale shedding of vast intellectual capital because this government has not delivered on its promiseâa No. 1 promise, a so-called core promise: to create new employment opportunities.</para><para>This pattern is evidenced throughout the world. Yet, for Australians, the threat of unemployment now carries with it even greater risks. Instead of developing effective job creation strategies, this government has simply decided that to create jobs it will rely on economic growth. I suppose that is why we saw not one job creation strategy in the most recent budget. Certainly we are not seeing additional amounts being put into labour market programs and other job creating mechanisms and opportunities for skill development.</para><para>Organisations such as the Committee for Economic Development of Australia have questioned this kind of hands-off approach, the notion that you should not have any kind of intervention in the economy. Instead, they have advocatedâalong with the Democratsâgreater investment in human capital. This requires increases in funding to education and to research and development, which is another area that has been cut and slashed under this government.</para><para>The government has withdrawn funding from previously existing labour market programs and remaining job creation strategies, such as the highly successful new enterprise incentive scheme. That is a scheme which encourages and assists people of all ages, including unemployed young people, to start up their own small business. That scheme suffered a funding cut in the budget of around $8 million. In total, there has been a reduction in funding of around $25.5 million. This has been done despite the fact that every new business this scheme helps to create provides 
 significant returns to society and the economy through encouraging innovation and active participation in the community and reducing the burden on the social security system.</para><para>The other big strategy that the government has relied upon is not job creation but the complete replacement of the old service oriented employment system with a competitive market. Rather than create jobs, the government hopes that, by introducing desperation into the mix of employment agencies, those agencies somehow suddenly will discover new jobsâoverlooking the fact that fundamental changes have occurred in our work force with certain traditional jobs, entry level jobs, having disappeared and there being the need for us to start investing in new areas, new technologies and sustainable industries. So, remembering that there is this problem of there not being enough jobs out there, we have to actively invest and participate in job creation.</para><para>The chamber would be well aware of the concerns of the Australian Democrats and many others with the new systemâthis new market based system of job assistance. These concerns are echoed through the parliament and through the community generally. I tabled today a survey that outlined specific problems with the FLEX 3 providersâthose people who are providing case management, the most intensive assistance available. Those private job providers listed in this survey some of the concerns they had with this new system. Because there are so many problems that existâand this survey I found comprehensive and universally damning of the new systemâand because of our high levels of unemployment in this country, we call on the government to have a review into that system.</para><para>We have called for that review because this is really one time in Australia's history where workers have every reason to feel insecure about jobs.

If we want to talk about some of the jobs that have been created under this government, let us look at the increased casualisation of the work force.

Perhaps he could give us a list of all the jobs that have been created under this government. Perhaps he could explain to us why participation rates are changing. Perhaps he could explain why youth unemployment is always on the rise.</para></talk.start></continue><para>So the life of a job seekerâand I do not think any side of parliament would dispute thisâhas never been easy, and it has just 
 been made harder. Not only have those 400,000 people been excluded by this eligibility criterion; there are migrants who have been in Australia for less than two years who are experiencing particular difficulties in accessing much needed benefits; there are spouses; there are young people aged between 16 and 18 who do not qualify for the common youth allowance. I wonder how secure a lot of those people are feeling in today's workplace.</para><para>Although the government has been at considerable pains to assure job seekers that agencies will provide assistance to those ineligible for FLEX 1, 2 or 3, this has not been the case. Job seekers are either being told that they cannot receive assistance as basic as, say, preparation of their resume applications or that they will have to pay up to $70 to receive such assistance. I am sure many of us in this chamber have heard stories from a range of providers that some people are being charged in order to get a service that was previously free, previously available to people under the old CES. An unemployed person paying $70 for help with the preparation of their resume application is just astounding.</para><para>Only today, we have seen another move from the government to disqualify another group of job seekers from some form of assistance, and that is the particular plan to cut unemployment benefits for seasonal workers through measures in the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Budget and Other Measures) Bill 1997 , which will actually hit rural and regional job seekers in particularâsomething I am sure that Senator Bill Heffernan is particularly concerned about. I know that my colleague Senator Andrew Bartlett was concerned about many of these rural workers losing their unemployment benefits through this legislation. We have put on record a number of times now, through comments in this chamber, our disappointment that this legislation will be supported by the opposition. While it is commendable to see those who have instigated this legislation today supporting job security in this form, we wish they would extend that concern to people in 
 those rural forms of work. The Democrats would also like to see the ALP review their decision to retain Job Network should they come into office.</para><para>This government has made a series of lofty promises and expansive claims in relation to employment. The Democrats would quite happily like to see these promises come into effect. Not only are we very keen for economic growth but we also recognise that there are a number of other measures that governments have to undertake in order to get not only economic growth but the unemployment rate down.</para><para>Review and reform of Job Network is one of those things that is urgently required. It is not good enough for the government to state that the problems being suffered will be solved in time, that perhaps two months into its operation is too early to call for a review. Criticism of this Job Network was raised much earlier than this; it has been raised all along. It was raised before the system was so-called `up and running', and it has been raised by a variety of sectors, not just the opposition parties, in the parliament. This is not simply some partisan political move.</para><para>I was astounded today that when confronted with the statistics and the evidence in the survey conducted by Jobs Australia, formerly Skillshare, which was universally damning of this government's Job Network program, the minister criticised the people who participated in the survey and dared to adversely reflect on a member of the community, David Thompson, former head of Skillshare, as if he had somehow tainted the results. This was not a survey prepared or conducted by the Democrats, simply tabled by the Democrats; it was a survey conducted by people whom I note that this government was prepared to give money toâthey were successful tenderers, this is the irony of it. These people are not interested in stuffing up this system; they want it to work.

But heâand I understand Dr Kemp did similarlyâpointed out some of the positive comments in the survey. We acknowledge that there are some positive comments, and he used them.

It was not my intention to participate in this debate, but I was, however, drawn into it by listening to the comments of Senator O'Chee a few moments ago. I heard him relate some of the history of the situation that occurred late last year at the South Grafton meatworks when the jobs of almost 300 employees were terminated when the company went into liquidation. Those employees were left stranded a week or two before Christmas without being paid out any of their entitlements.</para></talk.start><para>What disturbed me was the misinformation, the deliberate distortion and, if I was allowed to say the word, `lies'âI would say it, but I am not supposed to say itâthat were put forward by Senator O'Chee. What made it worse was the hypocritical attack that he 
 launched against Mr Harry Woods, the state member for Clarence. But then I thought to myself, `Why is Senator O'Chee doing this?' He is doing it for two reasons: firstly, because he is clearly ashamed of the conduct of his colleague from the other place Mr Causley, the federal member for Page, who did absolutely nothing to assist those workers at that time; and, secondly, to try to cloak himself and his colleague Mr Causley as if they were the saviours of the workers at South Grafton meatworks. Nothing could be further from the truth.</para><para>I wanted to take a few moments to put the truth on the record, as I did initially on 4 March this year. I have to say that I was one of the first people to raise in this parliament the circumstances that had occurred in the South Grafton meatworks. I did not hear Senator O'Chee or any other member of the government jumping up and down complaining about the plight of these workers at South Grafton. No, they all sat over there silently while I made my remarks. Of course, they were prepared to jump up and attack the MUA and support those disgusting, illegal tactics of Mr Corrigan and Patrick when they sacked overnight 2,000 workers on the waterfront. I never heard either Mr Causley or Senator O'Chee's colleagues in the National Farmers Federation standing up for the rights of the workers at South Grafton meatworks, or indeed for the rights of the meat producers and the farmers and the other companies in Grafton that were seriously affected by the closure of those meatworks.</para><para>I raised this issue in the Senate on 4 March. Senator O'Chee and Mr Causley did not raise the issue until I had done so in the parliament. What I raised on that day was the fact that there had been restructuring of companies within the Gilbertson group, the group of companies that owned the South Grafton meatworks, to ensure that, whilst the assets of the company, namely, the meatworks and the associated infrastructure, were owned by one corporate entity, the employees were employed by another. What happened was that there was no asset backing for the employer of the employees. When the company went into liquidation and the bank took steps to 
 recover its debts. There was no money available to pay out employees' entitlements.</para><para>It was Mr Harry Woods, the state member for Clarence, and the meatworkers union that took up the issue. They wrote to the Prime Minister, they wrote to Mr Anderson, they tried to have meetings with Mr Causley, and they were treated with contempt. Mr Anderson said, `Well, if you worked a bit harder, if you did not take so much sick leave, maybe the company wouldn't have gone broke.' That was his initial reaction. Mr Causley's reaction was that he felt a bit sorry for the workers but he could not agree that their entitlements should come before the bank's, because that might cause some problems in the banking system in this country and stop investment in enterprises. He was not in favour of the workers' rights being looked after, as this bill seeks to do, to give them some degree of priority. That is money that those workers have already earned, and that should be banked and should be available for them to access when they leave.</para><para>Today we have Senator O'Chee saying that he and his colleague Mr Causley took up the cause of the workers at South Grafton. Nothing could be further from the truth. Others, including Harry Woods, had already asked that these issuesâsuspected fraud and other illegal activities by the Gilbertson group, the Gilbertson brothers, who were directors of those companiesâbe referred to the Australian Securities Commission. That action had already been undertaken by Harry Woods. It was Harry Woods who worked tirelessly over the Christmas-new year period, in conjunction with the New South Wales government, to enable finance to become available and to enable certain charges to be put on hold so that those meatworks could be reopened. They were reopened last month, with a significant number of the previous employees obtaining their jobs back under a new employer. But we are still chasing their entitlements, and we will continue to do it.</para><para>There is a lot more to the story to come out as it unravels and as the trail of illegal activities is followed through. I am not going to sit here in this parliament and have people like Senator O'Chee and Mr Causley stand up and 
 claim credit for looking after workers, when they did completely the opposite. Senator O'Chee should come into this parliament and apologise for misleading the Senate. He had better do it soon, because he is not going to have an opportunity in a few weeks time when he loses his seat.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>4146</page.no><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator ABETZ</name><name.id>N26</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIn my comments on the so-called employment security bill, the Employment Security Bill 1998 [No.2], I wish to expose the duplicity with which Labor approaches this issue, their failure in 13 years of government and our success in two short years. The bill has been introduced by a Labor senator who told journalists in recent times that she had lately developed an interest in economic issues. That is something which is of interest and which I note. Could I encourage the honourable senator to develop that interest and finesse it somewhat to ensure that she does not introduce bills like this one.</para></talk.start><para>The bill has a number of difficulties.

If there is something that the workers of this country want, especially in regional areas, it is for the Wik legislation to be passed. I suggest to those opposite that, if they were following some of the interaction between High Court judges and counsel in the latest native title case before the High Court, they would see that our view in relation to the constitutionality of the Wik legislation may be somewhat stronger than that asserted by the would-be government opposite. So first we have got the constitutionality difficulty.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Secondly, in relation to the changes being proposed to the Corporations Law, the Corporations Law already contains provisions that allow a liquidator to undo preferential transactions involving related parties in the period leading to the winding-up of a company. In short, appropriate remedies already exist.</para><para>If the Labor Party had done the proper research into the legislation they are propos 
 ing they would have realised this. But what have they done? As a cheap political stunt they whacked together a bill and raced it in here without bothering to check on the constitutionality of the bill, let alone as to whether the Corporations Law needed to be amended. The remedy they want in this bill already exists. That indicates that they did not do their research. It is, I would submit, somewhat embarrassing to them, unless the only reason they introduced it was as a cheap political stunt.</para><para>The Labor Party's approach in this matter is somewhat breathtaking. Their brazen approach is astounding. I look opposite and I see the cheery face of Senator George Campbell, who interjected profusely during Senator O'Chee's contribution. He wants to talk, and to interject, on the issue of job security. Senator O'Chee mentioned the former Prime Minister, Paul Keating. I am going to mention the former Prime Minister Paul Keating as well. Do you know what he said about Senator Campbell? He said that he was responsible for the loss of 100,000 jobs. It was not me saying thatâit was not a Liberal Party person asserting thatâbut the former Prime Minister Paul Keating. He acknowledges that Senator Campbell was responsible for the loss of 100,000 jobs.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>9L6</name.id><name role="metadata">MACKAY</name><name role="display">Senator Mackay</name></talker><para>âWhat's this got to do with the bill?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>N26</name.id><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator ABETZ</name></talker><para>âAnd Senator Mackay says: `What has this got do with the bill?' Your bill is called the `Employment Security Bill'; that's the title of it. And he cost the job security of 100,000 Australians.

That is what hangs around Senator Campbell's neck.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In relation to a former Labor minister, remember when the Labor Party brought in their unfair dismissal laws? They were going to look after the workers. Guess which politician fell foul of that law? The first politician that fell foul of that law was a Labor minister, Con Sciacca. That is their sort of record. The Labor Party are big on rhetoric, but they never deliver when it comes to employment security. </para><para>Under Labor we had unemployment at one million, over 10 per cent. But it is coming down. It is now at about the eight per cent mark. So we have had a considerable decline. You want to talk about employment security, but the best employment security you can give anybody is a job. You can talk about it as much as you like but when you have hanging around your neck the jobs of 100,000 workers, when you have hanging around your neck the sort of behaviour that Mr Sciacca, a former Labor minister, was engaged in, when you have hanging around your neck the sackings that the former Prime Minister's companies were involved in, it is somewhat disingenuous of Labor to come in here and talk about employment security.</para><para>I was particularly fascinated by the contribution of our colleague from Tasmania, Senator Murphy, which mentioned my name on a fairly regular basis. I have to say to you in all modesty that I think that was the only good part about his speechâwhen he happened to mention my name. But apart from that, it was so typical of the trade union rhetoricâlong on wind but very short on substance. In short, it was a very inept performance.

When it comes to job security, especially in my home state of Tasmania, the people of Tasmania knowâand that is what Senator Murphy was seeking to allude to in his comments when he was attacking meâthat the passenger vehicle equalisation scheme has provided job security to many people in the tourism industry. Further, the freight equalisation scheme, another Liberal initiative, has provided good employment security.  </para></talk.start></continue><para>In relation to the timber industry and the workers that Senator Murphy allegedly represented as a trade union official prior to his entry into this place, he spoke against our woodchip proposals, which secured mammoth numbers of jobs in our home state. We have introduced the regional forest agreement in Tasmania. Today we introduced and passed the anti-dumping legislation, which especially you, Mr Acting Deputy President, worked so hard on, as did all your other Liberal colleagues. They are the sorts of things that provide real employment security to the workers of this country. It is not bringing bits of paper into this place; what they are really interested in is a track record of providing employment security.</para><para>Chris Miles, the member for Braddon, has been very proactive in his pro-job stance, whereas Senator Murphy stands condemned because each time he stands up in this place 
 to talk about the timber industry in our home state of Tasmania he denigrates it. Each time he denigrates it he undermines confidence and thereby prejudices the workers in that industry and the communities and families that rely on the incomes generated by those workers.</para><para>In relation to employment security, it is of interest to have a look at what the statistics tell us. It is very telling that, under the Labor Party, the statistics in relation to present job safety declined markedly. In the period from 1975 to 1997, where was the lowest point? Under the Labor government. When it came to power, present job security was at 79 per cent. It declined to 65 per cent in November 1992. It is now back at 77 per cent. We hear chants of unemployment, but guess when the highest rating for that was? Under Labor in November 1992. Yet the Labor Party have the audacity to come in here and give us these gratuitous lectures in relation to employment security when it is their own track record. I know three years ago, according to the shadow Treasurer (Mr Gareth Evans) is not within the lifetime of most Australians, but the fact is that only three short years ago, or a bit longer than that, Labor produced the worst ever employment security figures in this country.</para><para>When we come to employment security, it is also interesting to note that data from 1995 tell us that union members were more likely to feel insecure than non-union members, regardless of the occupation or sector. Why is it that trade union members should feel so insecure in their jobs? There are two possible reasons. The first is that the trade union movement deliberately misinforms the workers to make them feel insecure. The second is that the trade union leadership of this country is so very hopeless that the trade union members do not believe that they will be looked after in an appropriate way by the trade union leadership.</para><para>Why is it that people in the non-union work force feel so secure about their jobs? It is a terrible reflection on the former trade union leaders sitting opposite and it is a terrible reflection on the trade union leaders of today, who only seek the trade union leadership positions because they think it will allow 
 them to somehow get into the parliament and get an increase in salary along the way.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>NB5</name.id><name role="metadata">CAMPBELL</name><name role="display">Senator George Campbell</name></talker><para>âGuard dogs and thugs; that's your approach.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>N26</name.id><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator ABETZ</name></talker><para>âI think that is a self-description by Senator Campbell and it ought to go down in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> .

It is a recurring issue that, thank goodness, is on the decline because workers are feeling more secure about their employment.</para></talk.start></continue><para> Let us look at the genesis of this legislation. Did the Labor Party rush in with legislation of this nature when the unfair sackings that Senator O'Chee detailed to this Senate were highlighted by former Senator Michael Baume in this place? No, the Labor Party saw no need to look after farm workers. When other similar schemes arose, there was no need. When did the need arise? Only when the Maritime Union of Australia came under some challenge. That is what this legislation exposes about the Australian Labor Party. The Maritime Union of Australia has prejudiced more jobs in this country, destroyed more jobs in this country and bankrupted more small businesses in this country than any other union in this country, yet the Labor Party runs to its defence.</para><para>Pig workers in the companies of the former Prime Minister (Mr Keating) are not worthy of protection by this legislation. People who might be earning $20,000 or $30,000 per annum are not worthy of protection according to these former trade unionists opposite, but the waterfront workers, who earn in excess of $70,000 a year, are worthy of this sort of legislation.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>656</name.id><name role="metadata">FORSHAW</name><name role="display">Senator Forshaw</name></talker><para>âThey were protected because they had got their jobs.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>N26</name.id><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator ABETZ</name></talker><para>âThat is what exposes the Australian Labor Party's duplicity in trying to bring in this sort of legislation.

What we had to say was as follows.</para><para>As every participant in the political process knows, it is a vibrant and sometimes dramatically changing environment. There is a problem with persons being official registered by the AEC as nominated candidates but either deliberately or unavoidablyâand I think in most cases it is unavoidablyâmisleading the electorate as to their party allegiance. That occurs when a person who has been accepted as an official candidate is disendorsed and expelled from a party prior to the election but after the AEC acceptance of the nomination.</para><para>That, I believe, is an unfortunate consequence because there areâand we must accept that is the caseâmany voters who are very tribal, who will vote for their political partyâwhether it be Democrats or Greens or Labor or Liberalâon the basis of seeing that party attachment next to a candidate's name. If a person has been disendorsed or expelled, that can lead to a problem.</para><para>The consequence of this amendment simply is that if a candidate is disendorsed by or expelled from a registered political party and the registered officer of the registered political party informs the Australian Electoral Officer for that state or territory that the candidate has been disendorsed by or expelled from a registered political party, then that officer must cause a notice to be displayedâin the case of a candidate for the House of Representatives, at each polling booth in the division for which the candidate has nominated or in the case of a candidate for the Senate, at each polling booth in that state or territory.</para><para>The people who have been in politics in Australia longer than I have will tell me whether a person on a Senate ticket has ever been disendorsed or expelled in that manner, but it certainly happened in the House of Representatives. I recognise it might be a fairly big exercise for the AEC in the Senate, but all I am thinking of is a simple A4 sheet of paper with large writing on it which would be positioned in the polling booth. In the case of a House of Representatives candidate, it would obviously only be in the electorate which is being contested.</para><para>I think the result of such an amendment would be to maintain the integrity and validity of the electoral process. There would be less chance of the electorate being misled that the particular candidate on the ballot paper was a member of the party when they were not. I think that is as clear as I can make it.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>4154</page.no><name role="metadata">Minchin, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator MINCHIN</name><name.id>JX4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State;Minister Assisting the Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe government has had a good look at this amendment and regrets to say that it cannot support it. I appreciate the sentiment. Our party had the most recent experience of this with the disendorsed candidate for the seat of Oxley nevertheless appearing on the ballot paper as a Liberal candidate. One of the consequences of having names of parties appearing on ballot papersâsomething I was not all that sure about when it was first mootedâis that you then have the situation of what happens when they are disendorsed. I am not suggesting that we should have another think about whether names or labels 
 should be on the ballot paper, but that is one of the consequences.</para></talk.start><para>We do not think it is appropriate to place the onus on the Electoral Commission to have to put up posters declaring the disendorsement all over the electorate, and indeed all over the state if we are talking about a Senate candidate. We do not think that is an appropriate responsibility to statutorily apply to the Electoral Commission. If it is mandatory, it leaves open the possibility that, if it does not occur in one or two booths or the posters are ripped down or something, it could be grounds for some sort of appeal against the result. We think it opens avenues for litigation, and it is not something that we feel very confident about.</para><para>I think the responsibility lies with the party that has taken what is a fairly drastic stepâas I know because it is one that we had to takeâby disendorsing a candidate in the middle of campaign. While there is an incentive on the party to ensure that voters in that electorate know that `X' is no longer the endorsed candidate of that party, it is an appropriate responsibility for the party concerned to have to carry out, but not for the authority running the election. On balance, we do not support the amendment.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>4154</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMinister, has the AEC provided any advice on the logistics of this particular proposal of Senator Murray's?</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>4154</page.no><name role="metadata">Minchin, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator MINCHIN</name><name.id>JX4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State;Minister Assisting the Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âWe have consulted the AEC, of course.

One of the weaknesses of the amendment is that although Senator Murray outlined to the committee his view of what would be required, I do not believe that the amendment he has moved necessarily reflects those sorts of constraints. There is a genuine weakness there. I hear with interest what the minister has told the committee in relation to the view of the AEC.</para></talk.start><para>On the evidence that is available to me, I cannot support this amendment in this form. It is, however, a matter that does require some further consideration. This might be something that needs to be looked at a little more closely and exhaustively than we will have an opportunity to do through this committee stage debate, appreciating the logistical issues that have been raised with the minister by the Australian Electoral Commission. Given the spirit of what Senator Murray is trying to achieve, with further consideration there may be a way to deal with this more effectively. I am concerned about agreeing to the amendment in this form and on the run in the committee stage. I am concerned about the advice of the AEC and about some of the constraints that Senator Murray mentions. The spirit in which it is presented is not actually reflected in the amendment before the chair. It might be something that is worth giving further consideration to and perhaps getting some further advice at a later stage on how the spirit of what Senator Murray is trying to achieve might be met within the legislation.</para><para>Amendment not agreed to.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>4155</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI appreciated both the minister's and the opposition leader's response on that because there were some practical points there.

This amendment has been circulated for a number of weeks so all parties have had the opportunity to see it. Again it arises from views we expressed in our minority report to the inquiry into the 1996 election. We think that the how-to-vote position is still less than satisfactory and we have sought to clean it up. Rules and regulations controlling the distribution of how-to-vote material vary between states and the Commonwealth. The Tasmanian Electoral Act, for instance, bans the distribution of how-to-vote cards on polling day. Section 246 of that act provides that it is an offence to do a number of things. How-to-vote cards in that state can be distributed prior to polling day. In the Tasmanian act a person is not permitted to canvass for votes or attempt to sway voters within 100 metres of a polling place.</para><para>The New South Wales State Electoral Office issues guidelines relating to how-to-vote cards. The system of registration in New South Wales seeks to restrict the possibility of bogus how-to-vote cards being issued on polling days and the penalties for breaches are outlined in that act. The issue of how-to-vote cards is probably one of the worst areas where the Commonwealth system is stretched somewhat.</para><para>The Australian Democrats have favoured aspects of law as it stands in Tasmania and in New South Wales, which may sound like a contradiction since one bans it and the other does not.

In my more cynical moments I wonder whether it has something to do with the fact that the Democrats have fewer people available to hand out how-to-vote cards, but I am sure that is not right. I do think how-to-vote cards are a legitimate part of Australian democracy, that it is right and proper for the parties to feel free to have their supporters indicate to their voters how they believe they should complete their ballot paper and that minimal restrictions should be placed on the exercise of that democratic freedom.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Murray raised the question of bogus how-to-vote cards. The Electoral Commission has just very wisely sent out to parties advice on the law relating to bogus cards and made the point that false how-to-vote cards can amount to a breach of existing provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act, which would attract very severe penalties. So the law already provides for a practice which should be abhorred.</para><para>We are not in a position to support this amendment. We do not believe that there are any good, proper and valid reasons in relation to current electoral law and practice to require the very significant step of a registration procedure for how-to-vote cards and the consequential creation of an offence of handing out how-to-vote cards which are not registered. I as a democratâwith a small `d'âhave some difficulty with people being prosecuted, arrested or whatever simply because they exercise a freedom to hand out a piece of paper which has not be registered.</para><para>The Electoral Commission advises me that the New South Wales scheme, on which this appears to be modelled, is not all plain sailing. There are difficulties there. Again it opens up avenues for litigation as to whether cards are properly registered or not and appeals against registration. There are loopholes in the amendment. As proposed, 
 22OC(11)âobviously by designâgives a fairly significant loophole which then puts the Electoral Commission into a difficult situation as to whether something is registered and whether it can be handed out and creates difficulties on polling day. Polling day is difficult enough without the sorts of difficulties that this scheme might propose. This scheme does not deal with what is still a substantial number of votes cast using postal, pre-poll and mobile voting where how-to-vote cards are used. This scheme does not touch on those, so you have that anomaly.</para><para>We are all very conscious of the Democrats' views on how-to-vote cards.

We believe that the right of political parties to undertake that form of activity to advise those people who go to a polling booth who want to vote for the political party of their choice and to provide that voting information is an important part of the democratic process.

You do not have strained faced people in voter hats brandishing wads of how-to-vote cards tripping people up as they try to get up the path to the schoolhouse. Instead of that, as Senator Mackay knows, there is a relaxed atmosphere. People go to the polling place having looked at the newspaper in the morning or having gotten their how-to-vote pamphlet out of the letter box.

Senator Minchin's own party supports there being no how-to-vote cards in Tasmania on polling day. As I said before the dinner break, one of the great things about state polling days in Tasmania where people are not allowed to 
 hand out how-to-vote cardsâbut people are well informed because their how-to-vote cards arrive in the mail or they clip out the how-to-vote slips in the newspaper on the Saturday morningâis that people can go to vote in peace. They do not have to run the gauntlet and face every party jostling to shove how-to-vote cards in their faces as they go up the school path to cast their votes.

We are dealing here with what 
 I think have become colloquially known as the Langer amendments and the Langer issue. The introduction of sections 270(2), 329(3) and 329A of the Electoral Act was intended to protect people who made an inadvertent error in casting their vote. Unfortunately, the beneficial effect of these sections was undermined by the deleterious effects, as we consider them, of special pleadings. As an increasing number of citizens wilfully defied the law by encouraging voters to use a form of optional preferential voting using these sections in the Electoral Act, the AEC has been obliged to launch injunctions and/or prosecutions during an election period. That is plainly unsatisfactory.</para></talk.start></continue><para>At the 1996 federal election, 48,979 exhausted votes of the House of Representatives were saved from informality by section 270. As the Senate knows from the bill, the government has moved to correct that problem in the House of Representatives, but our view is that we retain a problem in the Senate. I did have some correspondence with the minister in April this year about this matter and, with the minister's permission, I will refer to parts of that letter which are fairly straightforward. The letter states:</para><para>I sought clarification from the AEC as to the practical implication should an elector complete their ballot paper along the lines of 1,2,3,4,4,4,4, etc. The AEC was able to confirm that this would be an invalid vote as a result of the new provisions.</para><para>Section 270 of the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918</inline>  allows for certain votes with non-consecutive numbers to be formal. The provision to delete part (2) of section 270, contained in the Bill, will remove that availability in elections for candidates in the House of Representatives.</para><para>It should be noted that there is an additional provision contained in the Bill to require numbers to be consecutive, <inline font-weight="bold">without the repetition of any number</inline> .</para><para>Later on in the letter, these remarks were made:</para><para>With regard to optional preferential voting in Senate elections. It is true to suggest that the availability is still there to exercise an optional preferential vote. However, the provisions of the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918</inline>  in section 270(1) require no less than 90% of the boxes to be completed.  
</para><para>Also, the national average, as reported by the AEC, in terms of electors that exercise the option to vote above the line exceeds, 95%.</para><para>As a result, the incidence of `optional preferential voting' occurring in Senate elections is very low. The Government, therefore, does not believe that amendments to the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 </inline> are necessary in that context.</para><para>I do not know whether the minister still holds that view because, prior to Mr Langer starting his campaign, the same was true of the House of Representativesâthe instance was quite low there, too. Recently, in Queensland, we have seen examples where styles of voting like that can produce consequences which are not necessarily desirable. The problem of non-informal voting was first addressed in changes to the Electoral Act in around 1983-84.</para><para>In my view, the house is now adequately covered by the effects of repealing section 329(3) and 329A, and adding a new item to section 240. That addresses the Langer challenge of encouraging a 1, 2, 3, 3, 3 voting method for the House of Representatives and removing any recourse to optional preferential voting. However, there is no corresponding amendment for the Senate similar in effect to the new 240(2). This, in conjunction with the repeal of section 329(3), leaves it open for any person who wishes to copy the Langer approach to advocate, for example, in a Senate election a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and then 7 all the way down to No. 30 vote for the Senate.</para><para>We, as a party, are supporters of the fully preferential system of voting, and I have understood the minister to say previously that that is the government's position as well. Perhaps the minister could clarify that for the Senate.</para><para>If the Senate is not similarly treated, we think there could again be a campaign in the coming election on this same basis. That campaign could be adopted by a particular political party, as an example, not just by a particular activist. We accept that the history of the incidence of optional preferential voting having been low in the Senate is true, but we do not necessarily accept that that could always be so.</para><para>We think it is undesirable as well, Minister, in terms of consistency of practice, for there to be a different system for the House of Representatives compared with that of the Senate. Surely the two houses should be dealt with in exactly the same way in the method of voting.</para><para>Because of that, I would urge the government and the opposition to give support to these amendments. I would urge the government to reconsider its view that this is unnecessary in the Senateâon the grounds of consistency; on the grounds of the precedent which you believe should be avoided in terms of Mr Langer's activism; on the grounds of a belief that we have, that I think you may have and that the Labor Party may have on a fully preferential system of voting; and on the grounds that there is a very real possibility of this system you are outlining becoming very active in the coming election in the Senate practice. Those are the reasons I have moved these amendments. I urge the Senate to give them favourable consideration.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>4163</page.no><name role="metadata">Minchin, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator MINCHIN</name><name.id>JX4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State;Minister Assisting the Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI will indicate the government's view and then Senator Brown and others may wish to comment. In this bill, as I understand it, we are, certainly with the opposition's support, seeking to restore, with respect to the House of Representatives, the basic underlying principle of the Electoral Act; that is, we have full preferential voting in Australia for the House of Representativesâa system I have always strongly supported and which I and the government believe was being undermined by the provisions that effectively allowed optional preferential or de facto first-past-the-post voting in the House of Representatives, and which then led to the ridiculous situation where people were guilty of an offence if they advocated voting in a way which was formal under the act.</para></talk.start><para>We have dealt with that, and I appreciate both the support of the opposition and the Democrats in correcting that situation in the House of Representatives by restoring full preferential voting and then removing any need for anything to do with the so-called 
 Langer provisions. We are quite open and honest and strong about our support for full preferential voting for the House of Representatives.</para><para>I think Senator Murray in his normal way does present a degree of logic in his argument. But I do think the Senate is different; it has a different voting system. The fact is that, with the introduction of one-in-the-box voting since, I think, the early 1980s, well over 90 per cent of voters now do vote one in the box for the Senate. Around five per cent of votes are cast below the line.</para><para>The Electoral Actâand I think this may come as a surprise even to many politiciansâdoes contain so-called savings provisions for below-the-line voting where there are nine or more candidates for the Senate. The intention is to ensure that honest mistakes in voting below the line do not automatically render the vote invalid and, thus, effectively disenfranchise that Senate vote.</para><para>In the case of the Senate you are typically dealing with many, many more candidates and many more boxes to number, and genuine and honest mistakes can be made. The provisions in the Electoral Act are not wide open; it is a restricted savings provision. But, given that we are dealing with so few below-the-line votesâas I say, around five per centâthere is not really any reliable guide to how many of those might be made informal by Senator Murray's proposals. But, even if it is only one or two per cent, as would be the Electoral Commission's observation on this, I do not think it is appropriate to go down this path without a proven case.</para><para>It may be that the Democrats or others can convince the government and the opposition that there is a case, but we are not in a position to accept these amendments on the basis of the evidence before us. We think the Senate is different in that there is nothing like the degree of difficulty that we face in the House of Representatives. The fact is that around 90-plus per cent do vote one in the box anyway. Because you are dealing with so many candidates, we think, on balance, it is reasonable to maintain the savings provisions for those who do vote below the line in the Senate. </para><para>I do not think our minds are necessarily closed on this. I think Senator Murray puts a good case in logic. But the government is not in a position at this stage to support these sorts of amendments.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>4164</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIf I can interpret that. The government believes that it is advantaged by getting rid of optional preferential voting in the House of Representatives and forcing people to make a preference, if they have voted for the smaller parties or for one or other of the big partiesâbut not in the Senate, where it is likely there would be a disbenefit to the big parties. Due to the complicated nature of voting below the line, a lot of people would make mistakes and votes therefore would be lost which otherwise would pass on as preferences to the big parties. That is how I read that.</para></talk.start><para>I find myself at a loss to believe that, in a compulsory voting system where there has been provision for optional preferential votingâeven though it had been made illegal to advocate itâwe are now having the parliament, and it seems all parties except the Greens, taking this position in the wake of citizens saying, `That is an option we want.' When it became clear to the big parties that they might be disadvantaged by people who feel they want to vote for Independents, the Greens or the Democrats but not be forced to vote for `the lesser of two evils', as they saw the ALP or the coalition, when it was organised to let people know that that option was available, that led to action which sees us in here, ostensibly on the eve of an election, closing that option to Australian citizens, to Australian voters. There was never any action before, but as soon as it threatens the big partiesâBang!âin comes the legislation to cut off that option.</para><para>I believe that in a compulsory voting system where you can be fined and can potentially end up in jail, you ought to have the choice of optional preferential. But here we have got, not for any clear democratic reason but because of the disadvantages to the big parties, legislation which says, `You can't do that any more.' It was okay when it was there to pick up or to validate votes where 
 people had made a mistake on their ballot paper. But when intelligent citizens said, `We want this option because it suits our view of how we should vote,' and indicated that they were going to do it in droves, in comes the legislation to say, `We will cut that off because that is not good for the big parties.'</para><para>It is not the only amendment we are seeing in this legislation because of something that does not advantage the big parties. As I said earlier in the day, the last people who will get a voice on an issue like this are the Independents. It is not to the advantage, generally, of the big parties to make it easy for Independents to either stand for parliament or to be voted for. The big parties use their numbers in the parliament to ensure the passage of legislation that will help them. I think many Australians, if they knew that the `Langer option' which got such publicity at the last elections was being clobbered here tonightâand the Democrats want to actually clobber it in both housesâwould feel like clobbering some of the people in here themselves.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3M6</name.id><name role="metadata">MURRAY</name><name role="display">Senator Murray</name></talker><para>âDon't encourage them.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>QD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name></talker><para>âSenator Murray, you say, `Don't encourage them,' but I think people ought to know that their democratic rights are being trammelled by this legislation going through here in what appears to be the last few days before there is an election.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In 1993, some 7,000 or 8,000 people voted 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, or 1, 2, 2, 2, 2 or 1, 2, 3, 4, 4 or in other ways which did not serially number all the positions on the House of Representatives voting papers. But they were valid votes; they were counted. Albert Langerâhe is a philosopher and activist in Melbourneâand some others decided last election, in 1996, that people had a right to know in a compulsory voting system, particularly when they did not want to vote for some of the options on the paper, that they could vote 1, 2 and then 3, 3, 3, 3 for all the rest if they wanted to. This meant that, if they were voting 1 and 2 for two small parties, their preferences were there and were counted. But, if they did not like the rest of the people from the parties represented, they gave them all the same preferenceâ3, 3, 3 across the boardâand no preference was allocated. What it means, in 
 short, is that people had the option of voting for Independents, Greens or Democrats or some other small party and were not forced to show a preference for the big parties, whom it must be assumed they abhorred.</para><para>The problem was that, in the Electoral Act as it stood, while it was legal to vote in this fashion, it was illegal to advocate that you vote in this fashion. As a result, Albert Langer was instructed by a court that he must desist from telling citizens that they had this valid option available to them. He, being the democrat that he was, did not desist and ended up in jail for quite a period because he was telling people their voting rights whereas the electoral legislation said you could not. We had that extraordinary position where he ended up in jail for advocating a perfectly valid option.</para><para>Because of his activities and those of his associates, the number of votes cast in the optional preferential fashion, `the Langer option', soared from some 7,000 votes to nearly 50,000 at the last electionâthat is for the House of Representatives, let alone the Senate. We can assume from that that, had things stayed as they were or had we done the reasonable thingâand that is remove the restriction on being able to advocate the Langer optionâthere may have been some hundreds of thousands of people taking that option at the next election.</para><para>That was enough to bring sweat to the brow of every big partyâand, as it turns out, Democratâpsephologist or party strategist. Their attitude is, `Give the people that option and they will take it, and we are not going to be advantaged,' although I understand that the Democrats are saying that they have simply decided that optional preferential voting should not be allowed. I am not sure why that decision has been made, but that is party policy.</para><para>The same cannot be said for the big parties. They have entertained this option in the past because it advantaged them. Now, suddenly, scores of thousands of people all over the country are saying, `Hey, there is an option that gets me out of having to decide between the two economic rationalist parties, who so often line up together and do not give us an 
 option. We will take it, because we do not want to have to decide which is the lesser of two evils.' So we have got this legislation before us. What I find extraordinary is that the Democrats are going one step further and saying that not only should we take this right away from voters for the House of Representatives but we should take it away for the Senate as well. This is not a good night for democracy and not a good night for voters' options.</para><para>It is unfortunate that the media has not taken this up with much more gusto. The fourth estate should be watching democratic rights like hawks, and this should have been flagged much more in the media. For some reason or other it has not. We are essentially voting here on this extraordinarily important democratic principle tonight as to whether this nation should have optional preferential voting in a compulsory voting system, and nobody out there knows about it. I think many people are going to feel defrauded by this process. They have had no input into it because they had no warning and no knowledge that it is happening.</para><para>I, for one, feel very aggrieved on their behalf. I feel that this ought to have been the subject of much greater public debate. I know there have been committee hearings and so on, but essentially this is flying past without the debate it deserves. So I stand opposed to the Democrat amendments on this occasion and I stand opposed to the abolition of optional preferential voting, which is what is occurring here.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>4165</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âCurrently, of course, the provisions of the act in relation to below the line voting for the Senate mean that electors must number at least I think it is 90 per cent of the squares on the ballot paper with no more than three errors. My concern at the amendment that Senator Murray has moved is simply that you have got a situation where, if this amendment were to be agreed with, you would effectively eliminate, as I understand it, the option to make errors below the line. The result of that would be an increase in the number of informal votes.</para></talk.start><para>I hear what Senator Brown says when he talks about the motivations of the major political parties. For my part, I say that I do want to see the formal vote maximised. I think that is important. I acknowledge that we have a full preferential voting system in this country, and it is one that I want to support and defend. I do not think it is improper for the parliament to be looking at eliminating the potential for optional preferential voting when that is not in accord with the letter of or the spirit of our electoral system in this country.</para><para>The Labor Party has accepted that, if someone advocates such a course of action, we certainly do not want to see an individual thrown in gaol in that circumstance, which, as Senator Brown rightly points out, is what occurred in relation to Mr Langer. But I would be very concerned that, I am sure inadvertently, what Senator Murray is proposing is going to mean that you will have more informal votes for the Senate. That is something that I think would be a most unfortunate consequence of this amendment. I am prepared to hear and take the AEC's advice on these sorts of issues. The view of the AEC in relation to complex amendments like this is worth serious consideration on the part of the committee.</para><para>I suppose the fundamental issue at the end of the day is whether we should be in the business of protecting the integrity of our full preferential voting system. That is the view of the parliament and has been the view of the parliament for very many years. I am willing to lend the Labor Party's voice, the opposition's voice, to protecting that. I am also not willing to support proposals that might have the impact of seeing the informal vote increased for one house of the Australian parliament, in this case the Senate, where we are giving consideration to the scrutiny of votes for Senate elections.</para><para>It is for those reasons that I do not support the Democrats' amendments. We have a proposition here that may be proposed with all the best will in the world, but it is not going to have the impact that Senator Murray wants it to have. In fact, the consequences of the committee accepting this amendment will be far-reaching and serious ones that will in 
 crease, probably quite dramatically, the number of informal votes cast in Senate elections. I do not think that is acceptable. That would be a most intolerable situation. So, while I assume that the Australian Democrat proposal is moved in the spirit of ensuring the protection of a full preferential voting system, I do not believe that would be the effect and impact of the amendments. It is not for any other reasons but for those reasons that the opposition will not support the amendments that Senator Murray has moved on behalf of the Australian Democrats.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>4166</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI do not want to unnecessarily prolong the debate, but I think it is appropriate to speak further on behalf of the Democrats, in support of Senator Murray's amendments, and also to further outline the Democrats' position on the other issues that this schedule and these amendments deal with in relation to removing the ability for de facto optional preferential voting to be done in the lower house and to respond to some of the slightly uncharitable comments that Senator Brown has made about the Democrats.</para></talk.start><para>Regardless of whether any individual party or person supports optional preferential voting or compulsory preferential voting, I find it a bit strange that the Democrats should be given extra criticism for simply trying to be consistent and ensuring that the principle of compulsory preferential voting, if we are going to apply that principle accurately in the lower house, should also apply as accurately as possible in the upper house. That is obviously what my colleague Senator Murray's amendments aim to ensure.</para><para>It is important to emphasise in relation to this issue that the parliament never chose to introduce optional preferential voting. If the parliament had wanted optional preferential voting it would have introduced amendments to the act to clearly produce very simple, straightforward optional preferential voting such as currently operates at state level in my own state of Queensland, which we saw utilised to some significant impact just a couple of weeks ago. I would suggest to Senator Brown in terms of this approach that, if he genuinely supports optional preferential 
 voting, the so-called Langer approach is an incredibly clumsy way to try to have optional preferential voting. It would be better and more appropriate for him to move amendments to the act to have straightforward, simple optional preferential voting such as exists in Queensland and, I think, in New South Wales at the moment.</para><para>The reasons why the Democrats do not support optional preferential voting is that we believe it is not fully democratic. I know Senator Minchin is a famous proponent of voluntary voting, but we support compulsory voting because we think it is important that people are urged and required as strongly as possible to exercise their democratic responsibility. Similarly with compulsory votingâthat once they actually get to vote they exercise that responsibility as fully as possible. Senator Brown has accused the Democrats of restricting voter choice by supporting the removal of the clause that enabled the Langer vote to occur. In fact, we are not restricting voter choice; we are ensuring that voters express their full choice. I think that is an important point to make.</para><para>The optional preferential system is a de facto first past the post system. The first past the post system is one of the poorest democratic systems that operate around the globe and is one of the worst ways of representing a clear indication of the voters' beliefs and the voters' choices. The Democrats believe that moving towards a system that provides a less clear and less complete indication of the voters' choice is not the best way to go. Again, if we do as a parliament believe it is the best way to go we should simply introduce an amendment to bring in proper optional preferential voting, nice and clear and simple, rather than do it this backdoor way. It is a poor way of having optional preferential voting.</para><para>Clearly, the extraordinary positionâI would agree with Senator Brown and other speakersâof Albert Langer ending up in gaol advocating a vote that was a legal and formal vote is ridiculous. It is for precisely that reason that the Democrats and all other parties here are supporting the removal of this provisionâso that we do not have that ridiculous 
 situation occurring again. It is a shame that we have slightly weakened the opportunity for people who do make an honest mistake to have their votes still counted, but nonetheless the price that we were having to pay for that was having a de facto optional preferential voting system. I re-emphasise the point I have made that that is a less democratic system from the Democrats' viewpoint, and that is why we think the suggestion that somehow it is an affront to the name of the Australian Democrats to ensure compulsory preferential voting is a bit of a non-sequitur, frankly.</para><para>The other danger with optional preferential voting, and a constant source of frustration and irritation to the Democrats, is the myth that gets put around by the larger parties that a vote for smaller party, a vote for an independent, is a wasted voteâ`You have to put your No. 1 straight against us or you are risking electing someone else.' That, quite clearly and demonstrably, is a load of rubbish under a compulsory preferential system, but it does have a degree of truth and a degree of plausibility under an optional preferential system. It allows the larger parties to give credence to the myth that a vote for a smaller party, a vote for an independent, a vote for somebody who you are not sure will win, may end up being a wasted vote.</para><para>We saw a number of people who did just plump for a single `1' in the Queensland election. It varied a fair bit between electorates, but my understanding is that it got up to 20 or 25 per cent in some areas. I would suggest, without having done a full and complete analysis of all the ballot papers in every electorate, that that had quite a significant impact on the outcome. We may well have had a different person as premier in Queensland over the next few years if we had compulsory preferential voting.</para><para>Obviously, that indicates that it would have benefited the coalition parties to have had compulsory preferential voting in Queensland at the recent election. I suppose it shows how noble and non-self-serving they are that they did not choose to amend the Electoral Act while they had the chance and thus put themselves in that situation. It also shows that to suggest that somehow this is all purely to 
 advantage the larger partiesâwhilst I am sure that does happen from time to timeâis a bit of a flawed analysis in this circumstance. Obviously if it would advantage one large party, as I believe it would have done in Queensland, it would have been a significant disadvantage to the other larger party in Queensland, the Australian Labor Party, at the last election. This would perhaps vary from circumstance to circumstance.</para><para>It is something that I think will be particularly important in relation to the other party, which unfortunately is rather larger in Queensland than one would like at the moment. It is a bit of a shame to me, having come from Queensland and having just got over having to listen to many years of Queenslander jokes about Joh Bjelke-Petersen, the former Premier, turning the clock back 100 years and one hour, that suddenly all those jokes are reappearing again at a great rate of knots. I guess that is the price you pay.</para><para>It would be particularly important in relation to the One Nation party at the next federal election if they were to have the opportunity to advocate an optional preferential vote and not nail their colours to the mast in relation to which party they were supporting, as they tried to avoid doing in the Queensland election. They had a variety of different how-to-vote cards depending on what day of the week it was. I think that would leave them much more scope to carry out some of the underhanded activities that they have already demonstrated they are so capable of. It is for that reason as well that it is important not to provide extra leeway for parties such as One Nation, as I believe the move towards an optional preferential voting set-up would do.</para><para>There are any number of reasons, whether you are looking at specific Queensland circumstances or at our broader democratic principles about ensuring people fully outline their choice of who they want to govern them in full order of their preferences. It is an important principle here. It is also important to emphasise that, if we do want to have a debate about optional versus compulsory, we should do it directly with specific amend 
 ments that suggest it rather than defend a backdoor way of having optional preferential voting by maintaining this sort of Langer style of voting that exists currently in the act.</para><para>It is certainly not a threat to the Democrats to have a Langer style of voting in there, and I am not sure it is terribly much of a threat to us to have compulsory preferential voting. It is a matter of basic principles. All parties operate under the same system and shape themselves according to the system that is there. But, again, it is important to emphasise that an optional vote and a de facto first-past-the-post vote do give a lot more scope for larger parties to frighten people away from experimenting with other options while still being able to pull their full vote back across. Anything that gives people pause towards shifting away from voting for the two traditional parties that have failed Australia for so long is something that should be avoided.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>4168</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI would point out for the record that, on the question of informal voting, which Senator Faulkner raised, the percentage of formal votes above the line for the major parties, as he knows and the AEC can confirm, is around 97 per cent. So the danger of informal voting affects the three per cent that vote for the major parties who would vote below the line. Since I do not regard that three per cent as all duffers, the number of those who would add to the informal voting numbers is likely to be relatively small. However, we cannot test that proposition until the system is changed. There is the potential in the coming election for One Nation, for instance, to adopt the Langer method of below the line voting. It will not affect us, but whether it would affect either of the major contestants I do not know. However, I recognise the numbers.</para></talk.start><para>Amendments not agreed to.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>4168</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe Australian Greens oppose schedule 1, item 121, page 26 (lines 10 to 13). This is the other side to the coin, the Democrats having moved to ensure that the optional preferential option was not there for below the line voting in the Senate. On behalf of the Australian Greens, I am opposing the government's 
 effort to ban the Langer option for House of Representatives votingâto ban optional preferential voting. The effect of it will be: let us not gaol the people who advocate this form of voting, let us instead invalidate the vote that people would have made had the option remained on the books.</para></talk.start><para>As I said earlier, we are seeing the banning of this option simply because it has become a threat to the big parties in the House of Representatives. That is no way for  democratic intent to be handled. We would not be in this position if the parliament believed that intelligent voters should have the option of making a choice without being forced to give preferences to parties they equally abhor.</para><para>At the last election, 49,000 Australians voted for some parties of their choice but used the Langer option to refuse to show a preference mainly for one or other of the big parties. That is 40,000 plus people who deliberately sought this option out when they knew it was available and used it. It is much different from the situation in Queensland, where some people might have chosen optional preferential because they inadvertently did not know that they were wasting their vote, as Senator Bartlett was explaining. It is different from the 7,000 or so folk who apparently, at federal elections, make a mistake on their ballot paper. These 40,000 Australians said, `Now that I know this option is there, I want to take it.' That was a very deliberated vote by citizens of this country.</para><para>We have tonight Labor, the coalition and the Democrats saying, `We are going to block off that option to you. We know that each of you deliberately wants to vote to leave out the big parties, and we are not going to allow you to do it.' That is all there is to it; that is what it is about. This does not advantage the big parties, so it is not going to be left as part of the options for Australian voters going to the ballot box. That is the worst of reasons for bringing in an amendment like this.</para><para>People did not only vote with their feet using this option at the last elections; they voted very much with their brains. If no-one else, those 40,000 voters would be very upset to know that the parliament is about to take that option from them for political reasons.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>4169</page.no><name role="metadata">Minchin, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator MINCHIN</name><name.id>JX4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State;Minister Assisting the Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI have previously referred to the government's commitment to ensuring that our electoral act is one dedicated fully to the preservation of full preferential voting.

This system was, prima facie, full preferential and optional preferential votes were counted as formal but you were not allowed to advocate voting in that way. It was really a dog's breakfast of a situation which these provisions correct.</para><para>People will be free to advocate voting 1 and then 2, 2, 2. They will not be put in gaol for doing so, but people who vote that way will not be casting a formal vote. I think this does restore what has always been the great Australian tradition of full preferential voting. It is an electoral system of which most Australians and most Australian politicians have been very proud. As Senator Bartlett said, certainly when I am overseas I am proud to support our full preferential voting system in those countries that have first past the post, which I do think is a very unfortunate system of voting. It is quite wrong for members of parliament to be elected with what might be as low as 30 per cent of the vote, which is what first past the post or optional preferential voting can give you.</para><para>Every member of parliament in Australia should be proud that we have devised the full preferential voting system. It does work well. It does ensure that you are elected only if you clearly have a majority of the voters in your electorate supporting you directly or indirectly, and there can be no question about the legitimacy of the people elected and their mandate to represent their electorates. We are delighted to have this opportunity to restore full preferential voting to the Australian 
 electoral system.

That was taken by their filling in all boxes while making it clear that they did not extend their preferences to all parties.</para></talk.start><para>That is different from the Queensland situation. That is a refinement of full preferential voting in a system which has compulsory voting. We are one of only four countries in the world that have compulsory voting. I think that it is because of compulsory voting that this option should have remained. Those people made it clear by the tens of thousands that they were prepared to take the optional preferential course. They showed that they did it deliberately because they were filling out all the numbers on the boxes. They were going 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3.</para><para>But all other parties except the Greens are saying, `We are not going to allow that option to those many thousands of people who have deliberately sought it and found that that is the best option for them and have indicated, by the way they fill in all the boxes on the ballot paper, that they are deliberately determined not to extend their preferences to all parties.' It was a beautiful refinement of the compulsory preferential system and it has been taken away here tonightâwithout due consideration or, worse still, for pure political reasonsâfrom those voters of Australia.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>4170</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI will not go on terribly much but it is appropriate to respond to a small degree in relation to this issue. I recognise that by doing this the Senate in committee is cutting off the option that 49,000-odd thousand people chose to use at the last federal election. What those people also chose to doâI imagine in the very large majority of casesâwas to opt out of the ultimate choice in having a say about who would represent them in their electorate and in the parliament.</para></talk.start><para>Whilst I recognise it was clearly their choice to do that, it is something that the Democrats believe in, in the same way that we believe that people should be required to exercise their choice and, if you like, be compelled to exercise their choice through compulsory voting. They should be compelled to fully demonstrate that choice through compulsory preferential votingâfull preferential votingâand not opt out of having a full say in who would represent them.</para><para>Again, I would suggest that rather than the current systemâthe Langer type voteâbeing a refinement of optional preferential voting, it really is quite an accidental and bizarre distortion of optional preferential voting. It is a sort of Frankenstein's monster version, I would suggest, of optional preferential voting.

We 
 have here, properly enough, a fundamental difference in attitude in the committee about support for, or otherwise, or opposition to, the full preferential voting system that we have federal elections in this country. It just happens that, as far as the Labor Party is concerned, we support that system. We support it strongly. I appreciate that Senator Brown might not. I respect those who hold different points of view. Senator Brown is saying to us that there is a way to impose optional preferential voting, and support for Senator Brown's amendment is the way to do it. Of course, that would really be a backdoor method of changing our full preferential voting system.</para></talk.start><para>It is fair enough to have a debate about the respective merits of the system. As far as the opposition is concerned, we support full preferential voting in federal elections. Senator Minchin made it clear on behalf of the government that apparently the government does too. I can only say that if we are to have a debate about the respective merits of the system, I suspect it would be better to have a pretty frank one out in the open and in a more forthright way. At the end of the dayâand Senator Brown correctly makes the pointâif we do not have the change to the act, then you can cast an optional preferential vote. That is not the intention of the act. The intention is that we not only have but respect the integrity of our full preferential system. I do not think this is the best way for those who do support optional preferential voting to see a change. I think it would be much better to have the debate out in the open and the benefits or alleged disbenefits of the various systems could be debated more openly and thoroughly. That is my view.</para><para>I accept that Senator Brown has a different view in relation to the respective merits of the system. But, as far as the Labor Party is concerned in federal elections, we do support the full preferential voting system. I am not entirely sure that there is any great partisan advantage to our party in that regard. Some may think there is; some may disagree. I suspect that that can vary a lot depending on the nature of the election campaign. I suspect it varies a lot depending on whether the respective major political parties are in 
 government or in opposition, and a whole range of other factors. But, at the end of the day, the principle we support in federal elections is a full preferential system. If you have a change, it would be better to have a change more generally, more openly, more frankly in the appropriate forum about the respective merits of the voting system.</para><para>I make that substantive point to Senator Brown that this is very much a backdoor method of effectively seeing voting in an optional preferential manner become a formal vote. That is not what our electoral system currently is about and a debate to change them could be had very much more frankly in a very different way if it was the view of some that there ought to be a change. While it is the view of someâand I acknowledge that and I defend their right to argue their caseâit is not the view of the Labor Party and that is why we will be opposing the amendment that Senator Brown has moved.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>4171</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI am not changing the system; you and the other components of this place are changing the system.

I am sure that senators have better things to do than watch Senator Brown and I bicker all night along. To finally respond to a couple of other points that he has made, I think it is important to re-emphasise that the parliament 
 did not choose initially to go for an optional preferential voting system. That was not the intention of the original amendments to the act. I am quite happy to listen to and engage in the debate that Senator Faulkner is talking about as to whether or not we should have an optional system such as in Queensland. That is fine, but let us deal with it specifically as up-front optional preferential voting, not as a backdoor method.</para></talk.start><para>I think it is also important to emphasise that informal votes can be measured as protest votes in certain circumstances. Probably one of the better arguments for optional preferential voting is that under a system such as in Queensland at the moment it is virtually impossible to accidentally vote informal. It is very damn hard, so you can pretty clearly measure most of the informals as a protest vote. People not voting is a pretty clear message that they cannot even be bothered to have a say. I think that sends a message to all of us in the same way as does deliberately voting informal and casting the message that they have no faith in any of us here.</para><para>I suppose that it is possible that some people might not have any faith in any of the political parties or any of the candidates. If we really wanted to measure people's level of disaffection and non-interest in politics and in the job that all of us do, we would move to a voluntary voting system as some advocate. The Democrats strongly oppose that, as I understand do the Greens and others, and I hope they continue to do so.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN (Senator Hogg)</name></talker><para>âThe question is that schedule 1, item 121 stand as printed.</para></talk.start><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>4172</page.no><name role="metadata">Minchin, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator MINCHIN</name><name.id>JX4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State;Minister Assisting the Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âby leaveâI move:</para></talk.start><para>(7)	 Schedule 1, item 136, page 32 (lines 25 to 32), omit paragraph (c), substitute:</para><para>		 (c)	 if subparagraph (b)(ii) appliesâcount each ballot-paper of an excluded candidate to whichever of the first or second ranked candidates is earlier in the order of preference expressed on the ballot-paper.

It is a small move in the right direction, but it is a totally inadequate measure to deal with the issue that has been exposed by the opposition over recent monthsâthat is, the use of the Greenfields Foundation by the Liberal Party to breach the spirit of the disclosure provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act in order to launder huge amounts of money to the benefit of the Liberal Party and for the source of those funds not to be disclosed to the Australian public.

 from the minister about that at a later stage. This particular amendment is a small venture on the part of the government to move a small distance to begin to deal with this issue. I consider it not more than that.

I have no idea what is in the Prime Minister's mind on that matter, but I do commend these amendments to ensure that those election related  provisions identified can take effect immediately.</para><para>Amendments agreed to.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>4174</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI seek leave to move opposition amendments 1 to 5 together but ask that they be put separately if there are some different views in the committee in relation to them.</para></talk.start><para>Leave granted.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name></talker><para>âI move:</para></talk.start></continue><para>(1)	 Schedule 1, page 34 (after line 7), after item 141, insert:</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">141A  Subsection 287(1) (paragraph (b) of the definition of  associated entity</inline> )</para><para>Repeal the paragraph, substitute:</para><para>	 (b)	 operates wholly or to a significant extent for the benefit of one or more registered political parties.</para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">This amendment  replaces</inline>  amendment (2) on sheet 974-Revised</para><para>(R2)	 Schedule 1, page 34 (after line 7), after item 141A, insert:</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">141B  Subsection 305(1)</inline></para><para>Omit "during that disclosure period", substitute "at any time".</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">141C  Paragraph 305(1)(a)</inline></para><para>After "person" (first occurring), insert "during that disclosure period".</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">141D  After subsection 305B(3)</inline></para><para>Insert:</para><para>(3A)	 The return must also set out the relevant details of all gifts received by the person at any time, being gifts used to make gifts the whole or part of which were used to

This is a matter that has been exposed by the opposition. We have a situation where the Liberal Party of Australia have received a $4.65 million loan from the Greenfields Foundation. That is a blatant attempt on the part of the Liberal Party to sidestep the public disclosure provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. This loan from the Greenfields Foundation breaches the spirit of the act. This is an opportunity to ensure that this apparent loophole is closed. The Liberal Party had a $10 million debt to the National Australia Bank, which gave them financial backing for the 1996 election campaign. The Liberal Party's returns to the AEC for the 1995-96 financial year listed their debt to the NAB at $6,762,763. For the 1996-97 financial year the debt to the NAB had been reduced to $158,305, but for the same year a new lender was listed for the first timeâthe Greenfields Foundation, to which the Liberal Party owed $4,650,000.</para><para>I am afraid that the Liberal Party does have a long history of exploiting apparent loopholes in the Commonwealth Electoral Act to launder money from undisclosed sources. We have been able to expose that, while the trustees of the Greenfields Foundation do not appear to be current officials of the Liberal 
 Party, they certainly appear to share an uncanny number of contacts with the Free Enterprise Foundation. The Greenfields Foundation shares two of the three trustees with the Free Enterprise Foundation; namely, Mr Tony Bandle and Sir John Atwell, a former Liberal Party president.</para><para>The 1996-97 disclosure shows the Free Enterprise Foundation, an associated entity, having a postal address at GPO Box 292, Canberra, ACT. However, the trustees of the Free Enterprise Foundation have a postal address c/- Post Office Box 52, Deakin West, ACT. This postal address was also used by the Free Enterprise Foundation itself in 1995-96. It is now used by the Greenfields Foundation and the same postal address is used by Bandle McAneney and Co. That is a company that has been a signatory on Liberal Party cheques. The Free Enterprise Foundation telephone contact on their return is for Bandle McAneney and Co., chartered accountants in Deakin. Stephen McAneney is the third trustee for the Greenfields Foundation.</para><para>The situation in the act is that all donations over $1,500 to political parties must be disclosed. But, because the Greenfields Foundation money at $4.65 million was in the form of a loan to the Liberal Party, the source of the moneyâthe Greenfields Foundationâdoes not need to be disclosed to the AEC under the act. A loan to a political party in itself is not a problem; the problem arises from the fact that the Greenfields Foundation can collect substantial donations from sources which remain anonymous for the purposes of funding disclosure. This will remain the case until the AEC determines the Greenfields Foundation to be an associated entity. Then you get a situation where that money is just forwarded to the Liberal Party in the form of a loan.</para><para>We do not know when the loan will be repaid. We do not know how it will be repaid. We do not know how the funding is secured. We do not know what special arrangements exist in relation to the interest rates for the loan or other arrangements in financing of the loan. We do know that the Liberal Party have made a payment of $100,000 to the Greenfields Foundation. The money may not 
 have been a repayment; we do not know. It might have been a grant to set up the foundation. If it is a repayment on a loan, it is at a very lucrative rate indeed of about 2Â½ per cent. I do not think this could ever be described as a loan on a commercial basis.</para><para>As I have indicated for a long period of timeâI have made many contributions in this chamber about this very serious situationâthe Liberal Party are exploiting an apparent loophole in the electoral act so they can receive moneys through a loan which they may never have to repay. They might never intend to repay it. I suspect they have absolutely no intention of ever repaying this loan.</para><para>Section 287 of the electoral act defines an associated entity as one which is either controlled by a political party or operates wholly or mainly for the benefit of a political party. The electoral act also requires an associated entity to lodge an annual return, including details of all gifts of more than $1,500 received during the financial year. You have to specify the details of the donor. Greenfields have not lodged such a return. We await responses in relation to our suggestions to the Australian Electoral Commission that Greenfields be required to furnish such a return. We await also the outcome of the AEC's regular audit of the Liberal Party to perhaps throw some more light on this issue.</para><para>The amendments now before the committee close this loophole that has been exploited by the government through the Greenfields Foundation. The government has proposed some amendments. While those amendments, which have been accepted, do adequately broaden the investigative powers of the AEC for pursuing suspected associated entities, they do not go to the issue of closing the loophole. That is what the amendments that are now before the committee do. They tighten the definition of `associated entity'. They close the loophole in the event of the loan being forgiven and ultimately becoming a gift and they prevent loans being received from anyone other than a registered financial institution unless certain information such as terms and conditions of the loans are provided. I commend to the committee those objectives that the opposition has.</para><para>Our first amendment goes to the definition of `associated entity'. It is our belief that we still need to pursue a tighter definition of `associated entity'. The Greenfields Foundation currently gets around the definition `operates wholly or mainly for the benefit of one or more registered political parties' by saying that the foundation will also be making significant contributions to unspecified charities.</para><para>It could mean anyone. It could be the Sydney Institute, the National Farmers Federation or the Business Council of Australiaâwho knows? It could be any other conservative organisation. If that were the case, this money could be indirectly channelled into even more pro-government, pro-coalition advertising and campaigning. But, even if they do donate to charitable institutions or organisations, as they claim to do, the sums of money given to the odd charity could be very paltry sums of money. One example is, of course, the $2,000 we know about which was given to the Guide Dogs Association and the Royal New South Wales Institute for Deaf and Blind Children by that other laundering machine of the Liberal Party, the Free Enterprise Foundation.</para><para>Let us acknowledge that it is a good thing if some very small donations have been made to those charities but, while that is happening, the Liberal Party is benefiting by millions and millions of dollars. Our amendment alters the definition to read:</para><para>(b)	 operates wholly or to a significant extent for the benefit of one or more registered political parties.</para><para>It is stronger. We believe that would close that aspect of the loophole that exists in relation to the Greenfields Foundation.</para><para>I am confining my remarks to ALP amendment No. 1, which is before the chair at the moment. I acknowledge that the AEC have some difficulties. They have told us they have got difficulties with the ambiguities of the current definition as some organisations dispute, they actually challenge, the current definition. But I have to say that, if there are current concerns with the existing definition, our amendments will not make those concerns any worse. The definition is discretionary for 
 the AECâit has got to be discretionary for the AEC.</para><para>Perhaps it is true that say that, if it is any more definitive or prescriptive, there will still be problems with rorters like the Greenfields Foundation trying to get around it. But we are not only proposing that tightening. The opposition is also very serious about closing the loophole in the event of a loan being forgiven and ultimately becoming a gift. That is another way to get around the spirit of the Electoral Act. It appears that that is something only the Liberal Party is motivated to do.</para><para>We think that it is essential that the act be amended to change the disclosure periods so that, in the event that the Greenfields loan is forgivenâand thus becomes a giftâits donors must still be disclosed even if the gift is outside the same disclosure period as the original donations. It is our assumption that the Greenfields loan is one that is interest free or has a nominally very low interest rate. As I have said, it could not possibly be at a commercial interest rate. It is a loan that will ultimately be forgiven. That loan would then become a gift. This is an issue that the committee must address tonight. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>4178</page.no><name role="metadata">Minchin, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator MINCHIN</name><name.id>JX4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State;Minister Assisting the Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âDebate on this bill is already taking considerably longer than we hoped, so I am not going to prolong it by speaking at length on these opposition amendments. We do oppose them.</para></talk.start><para>We believe that the current and amended regime is sufficient to ensure that any abuse of the associated entity provisions will be discovered. We have, as I said, already agreed to amend the bill to provide the Electoral Commission with greater powers to ensure that all bodies which could be associated entities are discovered. We have full auditing of the political parties to ensure that any loans which are not in fact loans but gifts are discovered. There is no evidence whatsoever that what transpired between Greenfields and the Liberal Party is anything other than what it is. But, if it is, then that will be discovered and exposed by virtue of the audit which is currently taking place. Any attempt by a body not to register as an associated entity will be 
 discovered by the powers that we tonight granted to the Electoral Commission.</para><para>We think there are drafting problems with the ALP amendments. We do not agree with the change to the definition. We think that it would leave the commission in a very difficult position if they have got to decide what on earth `significant extent' really means. We think it puts them in a very invidious position, whereas the current definition is workable and will ensure that any associated entities are brought within the terms of the act.</para><para>We also have some difficulty with the amendment to 141B, substituting for disclosure period `at any time'. The disclosure period provisions work perfectly adequately. There is no evidence that there is any difficulty there. The expression `at any time' could result in these provisions having a retrospective effect which we could not possibly support. Section 141E about trying to regulate loans to political parties seems, in our view, to be an extraordinary sledgehammer to crack a nut and, again, could involve extraordinary administrative problems. Also, on our advice, there could be real difficulties when a party is granted credit by the use of credit card. That may not be allowable under these provisions.</para><para>We think these amendments are not adequately thought through. They are a gross overreaction. They are just part of a Labor Party political stunt to exploit what they see as a difficulty with the Greenfields loan which, as I said, will be exposed if it is not a loan by the audit that is currently being carried out. I advise the Senate that we cannot support these amendments.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>4178</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI think this amendment is one of the better examples of the benefits of a competitive political system and of the estimates process. I sat in the estimates and watched the fairly formidable team of Senators Faulkner and Ray addressing this matter with a minister who was able to keep both his good temper and his resilience in the face of that team. The fact is that the issue at hand is very serious. It is an issue of accountability. It is an issue of openness. What every Australian wants, whether they are from the 
 extreme right to the far left, is a more open system where we can be sure that whatever moneys go to political parties come from people whom we can identify and in a manner which is open and above board. That sort of thing induces more trust in our system rather than less.</para></talk.start><para>I cannot comment on whether there were any drafting problems with Labor's approach. I cannot identify any, and I think the minister's remarks are fairly generalised. Frankly, if there are drafting problems, I am sure the expert advisers can assist in attending to them. Minister, I must advise youâand you would expect nothing else from my party on issues such as theseâthat we will indeed be supporting the Labor Party on this particular amendment.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>4179</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âSo will we. Transparency here is so vital. I am not waiting for the minister to give us the results of an inquiry into the Greenfields Foundation. We should have had the information readily available, but it is not available. There is trickery going on here to try to hide money going through to the Liberal Party. It could happen to any other party, but it is a blight on our political system.</para></talk.start><para>Everything that can be done needs to be done to discover any source of sizeable donations or benefits going to political parties because there are always strings attached. Corporations, in particular, do not make donations to political parties of whatever hue without expecting a result. There has been in the last decade in particular very good moves in this country to make sure there is openness about the money flowing into political party coffers. Whenever you make such measures, people will resort to trickery and/or fraudulent means to try to hide their intent of gaining advantage through money or other benefits being offered to political parties. Of course, when a wealthy interest gains advantage through donating to a political entity, other citizens lose out. That has to always be remembered. The wealthy are enormously advantaged in being able to put money into political party coffers to the disbenefit of everybody else. If you do not keep a stringent watch on that, you are going to be in trouble.</para><para>In February this year, I visited a number of European democracies as well as Mexico to talk with the Greens there. I was surprised to find that in all those places public funding of political parties does not stop with election campaigns; it goes on every year according to the number of votes received at the previous election. I thought, `Crikey, Australians wouldn't stand for that.'</para><para>The reason given for thisâand this is the case in France, Belgium, Germany and Mexicoâis that it is an offset to the political favours that come from the corporate sector, in particular, in being able to influence political parties through donations. When political parties are being funded from the public purse, they can go about their business without being under such influence. I expect that the best system of the lot would be for public funding with a complete ban on donations to political parties, but I am not foolish enough to think that, with the vested interests there are abroad in our society and with the benefits that political parties gain from donations made to them, such an idea would get any backing outside perhaps the Greens in this place.</para><para>So I support the Labor amendments. I think they are extremely important. Senator Minchin has a worry about somebody getting some credit on their credit card and falling foul of these amendments. I do not think it would be very difficult at all to fix that up. Transparency in the public interest weighs much more heavily in favour of these amendments than does the concern of the minister's.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>4179</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIn relation to opposition amendment No. 2 that I moved, we believe there certainly is a need to amend the act to change the disclosure period so that, in the event that the Greenfields loan is forgiven and therefore it becomes a gift, its donors must still be disclosed. We have made the assumption in relation to this loan from the Greenfields Foundation, based on all the evidence available to us, that this is either an interest free loan or a loan at some nominal, very low interest rateâcertainly, not at a commercial interest rateâand it is a loan that we think, 
 therefore, is ultimately likely to be forgiven. If that is the case, then that loan becomes simply a gift to the Liberal Party.</para></talk.start><para> Under section 305 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act, where persons have made donations to a political party, the required return only has to include details of gifts received by that person from other donors if they were received during the same disclosure period. Greenfields would accept donations from persons who wished to donate secretly to the Liberal Party and then it would make a loan to the Liberals. The loan might provide for interest, but actual payment of that interest might not be required until a future date which would be at least 30 days past the next election. When the due date arrives, Greenfields forgives both the interest and the debtâbut at this stage, of course, the gift has been made. If however Greenfields has received no further donations during the next disclosure period, then the return which it lodges after the following election need give no information about the original donors.</para><para>Our amendments address this very important issue. Our amendments ensure that the donors to Greenfields must still be disclosed, even if the donations were made outside the same disclosure period as the loan became a gift.</para><para>I understand that the manager is keen to report progress on this matter.

He deserves every criticism for the way in which this matter has come to conclusion. He has been utterly defeated and his credibility destroyed with the way he has handled this matter.</para><para>Yesterday in the House of Representatives, letters and other material were tabled, which have not been refuted by the government, which show that, as early as April last year, this government was involved in a conspiracy to destroy the Maritime Union of Australia. The government has denied that on innumerable occasions, despite mounting evidence both being presented by the Labor Party through estimates committee processes and through documents tabled in this parliamentâdocuments which the Senate forced to be tabledâand being leaked to the opposition in documents from others who obviously are concerned about the way the government has handled this issue.</para><para>Yesterday not only did we finally prove that the Minister for Industrial Relations and waterfront reform had been misleading parliament about his knowledge of what had been going on and the government's plans, but also we discovered that this reached into the very office of the Prime Minister of Australia (Mr Howard). Further, we have had no public denial or refutation from the Prime Minister that the material tabled by the Labor Party in the House of Representatives yesterday is other than absolutely correct.</para><para>The document to which I want to draw the Senate's attention is a letter dated 21 April 1997, on the letterhead of the Prime Minister of Australia, with John Howard's signature very copiously, floridly written thereon. We might use that old saying, `He has put his good old John Hancock on this letter'âthat 
 saying having come from one of the signatories of the American Declaration of Independence, John Hancock, who had a very florid signature. Every since then, people have said, `Put your John Hancock here.' Here on this letter the Prime Minister has put `John Howard' in very florid writing.

As discussed with Peter Reith today, we need to build the economic case.</para><para>So this was not a letter that a secretary ran in and slipped in for the Prime Minister to sign with 500 other thank you letters, Christmas cards or whatever. Not only did the Prime Minister read and sign this letter but he took the trouble to annotate and add a further direction, an interest from himself. He said, `we need to build the economic case.' So the Prime Minister is as guilty as the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business in being involved in the conspiracy to sack 1,400 Australian workers, and that planning went back to April of last year.</para><para>Up until yesterday, how many countless times did the Prime Minister and Mr Reith deny that they had any involvement in this campaign to aid and abet the Patrick company in sacking their 1,400 workers? Of course we now know that, quite rightly, under the law of this land, the MUA has got a conspiracy case against Mr Reith, Mr Corrigan and others associated. And won't a lot of us wait for the day that Mr Reith, Mr Corrigan and others have to give evidence under oath in the court to explain how they were involved in preparing this dastardly plan to sack 1,400 Australian workers?</para><para>So we deal with this bill in circumstances the likes of which this government never thought they would have to face; that is, they were not able to destroy the Maritime Union of Australia through their secret planning, through their corporate devices of shelf companies, of shifting assets, and, therefore, saying the companies were broke and they could sack the workers. They thought they 
 would have a significant victory in being able to destroy the MUA.</para><para>Who will ever forget those scenes on television, captured on the floor of the House of Representatives, when it was announced that the workers had been sacked? There is the Prime Minister of Australia grinning, smiling and slapping the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business on the back, saying, `Congratulations, Peter. You have sacked 1,400 workers; what an achievement.' That vision created shock waves in the Australian community because ordinary Australian workers realised, if it was the MUA and waterside workers today, it could be them tomorrow.</para><para>That is the industrial relations policy of this governmentâfear and intimidation against ordinary working Australians. That is something the Labor Party in the forthcoming election campaign will never let this coalition government forget. They cheered on the sacking of ordinary Australians. Fortunately, the Australian people were able to see that disgusting spectacle on that day in the parliament of Australia. That was associated with those awful scenes of security people with balaclavas and dogs in the middle of the night, and the creation of a despicable lockout of ordinary Australian workers from their workplace. That is how this government believes ordinary Australians should be treatedâdisgusting scenes, scenes that some of us thought would never occur in Australia again in this century. After the early episodes of this century, we thought the lockout and that sort of industrial intimidation was no longer part of the Australian culture. But, oh no, Mr Reith and Mr Howard wanted to bring this back.</para><para>Never forget, in the last 10 to 15 years, whether he was leader of the opposition in the 1980s, whether he was shadow minister for industrial relations, Mr Howard always had this view that you had to attack Australian workers, that the present industrial relations arrangements, which most ordinary Australians welcomed, where the right of employers and employees to collectively bargain, to establish awards that guarantee decent living conditions for all Australians, had to go in the 
 name of labour market flexibility. In Mr Howard's terms, `labour market flexibility' means the right to sack and destroy ordinary Australians' working conditions.</para><para>The Labor Party is more than happy to take this issue on and explain why that is not the Australian way and also that it is a stupid way to go economically to treat Australian workers as though they have to be intimidated and cowered into submission to receive less wages for their valued work.</para><para>We have a number of amendments that we will move. One of them that I particularly want to speak to as a senator from South Australia is an amendment to exempt Sealands from the levy that is being imposed in this bill to raise the money for the redundancy package. In South Australia, Sealands has the major operation in Port Adelaide.</para><para>I have to say that I find it extraordinary that this company has to pay this levy. It is because the government wishes to punish it, I believe. Why? Because, when Mr Reith and Mr Howard were at the height of their intimidatory activities and their rhetoric against the MUA, Sealands in South Australia would not have a bar of it. We had the spokesman for that company explaining that they had good industrial relations with their workers. They were able to negotiate decent outcomes and were able to run a productive waterfront in South Australia. Of course, that is not the image that this government wanted to have portrayed to the Australian people. They wanted to have an image that the MUA was unproductive and uncooperative everywhere in Australia. So Sealands have to be one of the victims of their industrial atrocity, of the sackings. The Patrick's workers in South Australia got sacked as well and Sealands, by not going along with the rhetoric that this government wanted, now has to be punished by paying the levy.</para><para>We in South Australia are getting sick of this government particularly punishing South Australia. Earlier this week we had the most bizarre scene of all, where a prime minister stood up and endorsed a railway line from Melbourne to Darwin. This is against his own policy last year, at the time of the South Australian state election, of endorsing and 
 making a contribution of $100 million to building the Alice Springs to Darwin railway line. Now we have the Prime Minister endorsing a private sector project with no feasibility study other than a line on a map that seems to zigzag through every country town in western New South Wales and Queensland where there was a National Party or Liberal Party electorate under threat from the One Nation Party. South Australia is now in uproar over this decision and even the conservative paper, the Adelaide <inline font-style="italic">Advertiser</inline>, has gone berserkâI might say very pleasantly berserk, in my viewâin pointing out the humbug and hypocrisy of the Prime Minister on this issue.</para><para>Couple that with Sealands, which got the contract some years ago to run the major part of the South Australian waterfront, now being punished because they are running a productive wharf and cannot be exempt because this minister, this government, this Prime Minister, want to punish them. We will move the amendment, and I trust there are enough sensible senators to understand that Sealands should not be punished because they run good industrial relations.</para><para>The next amendment aims to exempt Tasmania from paying the levy on the domestic trade across Bass Strait. We believe this is a very necessary amendment. Why should Tasmania be punished because of the industrial mayhem this government wishes to impose on the waterfront? I hope the government has some form of answer as to accepting an amendment or arrangement to exempt Tasmania. Just as I will look forward to campaigning in South Australia against this government in the forthcoming election campaign on how they have treated Sealands, if they do not accept the amendment, and on how they have treated us over the Alice Springs-Darwin railway line, I look forward to campaigning in Tasmania, if we do not get this exemption through, on how this government has treated Tasmania.</para><para>Earlier this year, before the waterfront dispute flared in its full, awful glory, I visited Burnie. The waterfront workers there were employed by the Patrick company. I was taken around by the manager of Patrick and 
 shown how that wharf was working extremely productively. There was no complaint from the Patrick management about the cooperation they were receiving from the waterside workers, members of the MUA, on the Burnie wharf. They said, `It is working very well and there is cooperation to ensure that every day the ship loaded with the paper produced by the Burnie mill leaves for Melbourne to keep those customers happy and the mill in employment.'</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">SHERRY</name><name role="display">Senator Sherry</name></talker><para>âAnd they got sacked.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>4J4</name.id><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator SCHACHT</name></talker><para>âThey got sacked, for no other reason than they were members of the MUA. It is extraordinary. They got sacked not because they were not productive, not because the company complainedâthey got sacked because they had next to their name `member of the Maritime Union of Australia'. Most of us pointed out, and it has been pointed out by other commentators, that this is contrary to the government's own industrial relations legislation, which said that you could not be sacked for being a member of a union. This is the legislation this minister and this Prime Minister put through the parliament in 1996, that you could not be sacked purely because you were a member of a union. But this minister and this government broke their own law. I suppose that is part of the conspiracy case that we would all like to see take place in respect of this minister, other members of the government and Mr Corriganâthat they were willing to break their own law in their ideological obsession to destroy the MUA.</para></talk.start></continue><para>It is an enjoyable occasion to be here tonight speaking on this bill, in the sense that we have seen the defeat of this ideological campaign. We have seen the destruction of the credibility of the minister, who set out to destroy the MUA. In the settlement now announced in negotiations between Patrick company and the MUA, the MUA is still on the waterfront and still with its membership. The negotiated settlement means appropriate numbers of redundancies, which clearly could have been achieved by sensible cooperation before the lockout occurred, before the dogs were set loose and the balaclava wearing 
 security people were set loose at midnight on the wharves.</para><para>The union never said at any stage they were not willing to talk about a better and more productive waterfront. They wanted to do it in a cooperative way. This minister has been utterly defeated. He is going to have to bear that defeat for the rest of his political career, and so he should. We are going to remind him on every occasion we get that he was defeated by the enormous effort of ordinary workers in Australia, who right across Australia rose up and said, `This is unfair.' With the support of the community we are not going to allow shonky companies, a shonky government using illegal and intimidatory means to destroy the jobs of all workers. This is a magnificent victory, not just for the MUA and all its members; it is a magnificent victory for all ordinary workers in Australia. That is why we are very pleased in one sense to be here tonightâto acknowledge that victory and the defeat of the government. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>4184</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI must begin by not agreeing with Senator Schacht on one line that he used at the end.

How things can change in just four months in politics. This bill was introduced by a gloating minister, the Minister for Workplace Relations (Mr Reith), just before Easter, the day after 200 waterside workers were sacked by the Patrick Stevedoring Group. It struck me as passing strange at the time that on the one hand Mr Reith was professing that he had no prior knowledge of the actions by Patrick, yet within six hours of the workers being sacked 
 these bills were drafted and presented to the House of Representatives. We are continually told by ministers how difficult it is to deal with amendments before them which they have seen for days and weeks, but this took six hours.</para><para>Over the months since, more and more information has come forward about the government's role in the appalling conduct by Patrick Stevedoring in sacking all its workers because they belonged to an union. We find out that very early on senior officials in the bureaucracy were advising the government of strategies to sack the whole work force on the wharves. Earlier this week further documents revealed that in April 1997 the federal government discussed the sacking of the waterfront work force, a year before it actually happened.</para><para>The public needs to get to the bottom of the government's involvement in this. To do that the minister should comply with the Senate's return to order demanding all documents held by the government in respect of the dispute. I remind the Senate that the government argued that it could not comply with that order because the matter was sub judice. It argued that way despite advice from the Clerk of the Senate that that was not necessarily a good argument. But even if it were a good argument on the part of the government, the approval of the waterfront deal by MUA members in Sydney and Melbourne this week will apparently see the withdrawal of all legal action. Therefore, no sub judice argument will then arise. Naturally, it is appropriate that the Senate should again raise the issue when the status of legal proceedings becomes a little clearer, that is, the issue of the return to order.</para><para>I expect that the government has heaved a huge sigh of relief that, despite the belligerence of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the minister over the last six months, a peace deal has been done which will end the conspiracy proceedings in the Federal Court. As an Australian parliamentarian and as an Australian, the last thing I wanted to see was my government dragged through the courts on a conspiracy charge.</para><para>The MUA has already succeeded in getting 10 judges, including six of the seven High Court judges, to agree with its legal interpretation of the laws guaranteeing freedom of association and that there was an arguable case for the common law tort of conspiracy that has embroiled Lang Corporation, the Patrick Stevedoring Group, Chris Corrigan and the government in the case. I have little doubt that the MUA, if it had won the case, could have collected up to $400 million of taxpayers' money in compensation, money that the government put at risk, not to mention placing Minister Reith and others under the glare of a bunch of very eminent QCs in the courtroom. As I said, while Minister Reith has lambasted the MUA for these past two years he must be pleased that, despite his calls for a holy Liberal war on Australians at the waterfront, peace does look like breaking out.</para><para>But back to the bills. What in April 1998 was a face-saving public funding of waterfront sackings by legislation is today an essential funding plank for the Patrick peace deal. As I said, how things can change in four months. The bill is now essential to underpin the restructuring of Patrick Stevedoring, which will result in substantial efficiency improvements. As the government has indicated, it regards that as the benefit it has got out of this strife we have been put through.</para><para>As a result, I think we have to commend the MUA and Patrickâwho are both very tough characters, I think everyone would acknowledgeâon finally coming to this agreement. It is worth noting that, despite regular fireworks, the MUA and the maritime companies have been working towards a more efficient work force for 15 years. In that time, the waterfront work force has declined from around 10,000 to 3,000âsomehow that 7,000 reduction gets forgotten in these thingsâwith the cooperation of the union and the employers.         </para><para>This reform process was most accelerated under the auspices of the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority from 1989 to 1992, when 4,500 workers left the industry and productivity rose significantly. This productivity improvement declined in 1993 but it has 
 improved again since. In previous speeches before the Senate on these matters I have indicated how the port authority in my own state of Western Australia has praised the doubling of productivity on the Fremantle wharves, for instance. That is not to say that our wharves are necessarily outstanding examples of productivity; some of them are not. They do need continual attention by management, workers and regulators to get them up to speed.</para><para>Australia's bulk handling ports, which incidentally are all staffed by MUA workers, particularly those grain ports, are amongst the best in the world, a point conceded by the Productivity Commission and even the farmers. It is strange that a union which is condemned for its work practices on one side of the equation, the container side, is never or seldom praised for its genuine performance on bulk handling. That one-eyed, biased approach to the problem is what has disturbed me most. We think the waterfront has come a long way, but we recognise that it still could do a lot better. The Democrats are supporters of negotiated productivity improvements on the waterfront. We do not take umbrage at workers being well paid. We do believe that restrictive work practices should be reformed, but this method of doing so generated our absolute rejection.</para><para>I want to take this opportunity to pay tribute to those who have achieved reform and change on the waterfront over the last decade. Listening to some of the protagonists on the aggressive side, you would think nothing had happened in waterfront reform. The reluctance of the government, of some of the businesses and of some of the financial markets to give the previous government and the workers of Australia any credit at all for the hard yards already achieved on waterfront reform is part of the reason they are facing such a backlash from so many Australians. Australians of whatever political complexion just do not like unfairness. The government lost the public relations battle because Australians thought that that was a fundamentally unfair and partisan action that it took.</para><para>For some of the market commentators, whom we should describe as the zealot 
 economic rationalists, no reform is ever enough. In the last decades, millions or certainly hundreds of thousands of jobs have gone from Australia. But that was not enough; it is never enough. Those sorts of zealot economic rationalists have an insatiable appetite for human bodies, for people who formerly had jobs and no longer do. The competition policy, launched under the previous government, has knocked out thousands more jobs. This government has added 27,000 Public Service jobs and 23,000 Telstra jobs to the scrap heap of economic reform. If there is a message that came out of the Queensland election that is a good one, it is that enough is enough; stop producing this insecurity.</para><para>I found the gloating over the illegal sacking of 2,000 waterfront workers a few days before Easter quite nauseating. But it was not just politicians; the money markets loved the retrenchment so much that the Lang Corporation shares went through the roof, just as the BHP shares soared the day they announced they were pulling out of Newcastle. That is a reminder for us allâthose people who think that market morality is wonderfulâthat the market has no morals. It is up to the political and business leaders of the country to recognise that and to guard against excessive worship of the market. It is no wonder that people do not feel that their jobs are secure in this country.</para><para>With regard to these bills, I am not very keen on government subsidising companies to get rid of their work force. I think jobs should be preserved wherever they can be. But I am conscious that the waterfront peace deal does depend on this bill, so the Democrats will be supporting it. As you would be aware if you have looked at your tables, we have circulated a few amendments. I have difficulty with the prospect that efficient stevedores should be forced to pay for the restructuring of less efficient stevedores.</para><para>I am advised from the committee hearings that there are two national stevedoring companies, P&amp;O and Patrick, with between 90 and 95 per cent of the market. There is one very strong regional stevedoring company, which is Sealand, and there are five or six small business stevedores in Australia. The 
 one involved in this dispute was Patrick. P&amp;O apparently intends to take advantage of the funds, so they are well on the same path. But Sealand in Adelaide, through cooperative industrial relations negotiation, have apparently reached the highest productivity of any Australian port. So why should they pay for the Patrick restructuring? They had nothing to do with the dispute.</para><para>I understand they do not believe they will benefit from the fund, but they will incur the cost which is imposed through this bill, the levy on each container. Although there is no legal obligation on them not to do so, that is not supposed to be passed on, and both P&amp;O and Patrick have said they will not pass it on. A competitor that did not participate in all this sort of thing is going to end up with a levy that they are likely to have to absorb. Why should new stevedoring companiesâmy small business stevedores, as I call themâwho have just started operations and who might have new equipment and already high levels of productivity be forced to pay the levy? What benefit will there be for them in that?</para><para>I will quote from a letter that I got from Robert Strang, the Managing Director of Strang Stevedoring, which is a small business stevedore that commenced operations in Melbourne in August 1996. I asked permission to quote from this letter. This is that quote:</para><para>The proposed imposition of costs on those stevedoring companies not drawing on the funds provided would directly benefit our competitors and at the same time impose commercial constraints and unacceptable costs and financial burden on our company for which we get no benefits whatsoever.</para><para>That is an unequivocal rejection of this approach. I hope that the government will think carefully about the equity of imposing a new business cost on a small business company that will never benefit from it. It is quite appropriate for the government to impose a levy on those companies which are prepared to accept it and will benefit from it. But, as for those small business participants which were on the sidelines of this dispute, I think it is an inequitable principle for them to be subject to the cost.</para><para>I am quite concerned about the level of accountability for the up to $400 millionâI think it is $400 millionâof public money affected over 10 years by this bill. I will be moving an amendment to improve the accountability of the minister back to parliament for management of the restructuring fund. I am hopeful that the minister will see fit to respond favourably to that because I am quite sure that he does want this fund to be managed as professionally and in as accountable a manner as possible.</para><para>Probably what I am most concerned about is that the government's obsession with the MUA and the price of waterfront labour ignores some of the issues that contribute to Australia's waterfront inefficiencies. The Productivity Commission, in its report on waterfront reform, also pointed out that waterfront costs in Australia were high, not just because of the cost of labour but because of the cost of port charges and fees, and because of the lack of competition between stevedoring companies. If you are to address productivity in this area, there are three areas to look at. One is the port authority, which you might describe as the landlord; the second is the stevedoring operation, which you could describe as capital if you wished; and the third component is labour. All the emphasis on labour to an extent has resulted in insufficient attention being paid to the capital and landlord sides of the equation.</para><para>Until the Treasurer (Mr Costello) spotted the political opportunity, the government had not extended its reform agenda to look seriously at these issues, particularly the duopoly between Patrick and P&amp;O that exists in many ports. I would remind the Senate that of Australia's 46 ports there are 16 monopolies and nine duopolies. It really makes you wonder how serious the government was about achieving serious waterfront reform if they had failed to really construct an agenda and an attack on the other two-thirds of the productivity agenda. Quite frankly, by encouraging an employer to breach the government's own Workplace Relations Act and to carry out a shonky corporate restructuring, I think unfortunately the government diminished its credibility in attacking what was a problem 
 and what did need to be addressed. Waterfront reform was important to address. The route that the government took has set it back somewhat rather than advancing it as it should have been.</para><para>The events of the last four months show that there is no substitute for negotiation and managed progress on waterfront reform. There is no benefit in a crash through approach. There are no quick fixes or easy solutions, and plenty of hard work is ahead for all players and regulators to achieve a better waterfront. The Workplace Relations Act did provide an opportunity for the government to advance its reform of the waterfront but I am afraid that the route it chose and the manner in which it handled it has just resulted in massive opposition, not only from the political parties within the parliament but from Australians as a whole. I hope that what has been learnt out of this lesson is that jaw-jaw is always better than war-war.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>4187</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe government's stated aim in introducing the <inline ref="r518">Stevedoring Levy (Collection) Bill 1998</inline>  is to underpin proposed administrative arrangements to pay workers who are made redundant on the waterfront, particularly employees of Patrick Stevedoring. Discussion of this legislation is inevitably surrounded and has been dominated by the actions of Patrick in sacking its entire 1,400 work force nationwide with the active knowledge, planning and support of the current government. The issue was handled, or I should say mishandled, on a day-to-day basis by the Reith-Corrigan partnership.</para></talk.start><para>The bill sets a maximum rate of levy at $20 per container and $10 per vehicle. Initial rates are set at $12 per container and $6 per vehicle. The money is to underpin a fund to provide monies for alleged waterfront reform.</para><para>Should the entire industry be required to fund primarily one company, Patrick, particularly when it contrived through illegal strategy a company restructuring to deliberately declare itself bankrupt while effectively still maintaining substantial business assets? Independent analysis of the Patrick group made by a firm of accountants, Price Waterhouse, in late 1996 valued the Patrick group, 
 consistent with the so-called sale price in September 1997, at $315 million. Liabilities to Patrick employees illegally sacked, such as accrued leave entitlements and severance pay, were in the order of $125 million.</para><para>A contrived bankruptcy was entered into to asset strip a healthy series of companies, leaving no moneys for entitlements and no work for their employees. And the solution? Pass the bill on to the stevedoring industry and, in turn, on to the general public. Pauline Hanson's proposed two per cent loans schemeârecently condemned by the Treasurer, Mr Costelloâpales in comparison with this government's underwritten, no interest loan scheme.</para><para>We have assurances in the speech of the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, Mr Reith, that the costs cannot be passed on to consumers. How can this be guaranteed? The reality is, if costs go up as a result of a new charge, fee, levy, surchargeâthat is the latest government buzzwordâor whatever inventive name this government chooses to use, they will be passed on by the operators in higher end charges which the consumer will pay.</para><para>This approach particularly hits my home state of Tasmania. As an island region, where all containers and vehicles move in and out by sea, this will mean millions of dollars in extra costs a year. Apparently Mr Reith, realising his mistake, has now decided to exempt certain aspects of freight containers and vehicles into Tasmania, and I would like to see that in the legislation. But perhaps, while he is here, he and Mr Howard might like to resolve our problems permanently by adding a bridge to their latest $9 billion rail extravaganza. Burnie and Tasmania could certainly do with it.</para><para>The justification is made that the MUA monopoly must be broken. What about the port monopoly and the stevedoring oligopoly? What about the other monopolies and special arrangements in our economy: chemists, newsagents and pharmacists? What about benchmark objectives across a range of other industries to drive down their costs to consumers? </para><para>An interesting new principle was also announced by Minister Reithâthat of reducing wages and salaries on the waterfront down to the community norm. That is an interesting new approach from any government, particularly from this government that as recently as yesterday, in debate on corporations reform, was bitterly resisting Labor's requirement that executive salaries should be disclosed to shareholdersâonly the owners of a company. The truth is this is a government of moral bankruptcy and double standards. The truth is this government entered into a conspiracy with Patrick to sack to its workers unlawfully because they were members of a union, the Maritime Union of Australia, in contravention of Mr Reith's own Workplace Relations Act 1996.</para><para>There was extensive legal action surrounding the Reith-Corrigan conspiracy. I do not intend to go into this in any great detail. The legal outcomeânot once, not twice, but three timesâspeaks for itself: from the initial interlocutory orders of Justice North, to the 3-nil decision of the Federal Court, and finally to the 6-1 decision of the High Court. Ten of the 11 most distinguished legal officials in Australia ruled in favour of the union, the MUAânot Patrick, not the government, but the MUA. This whole issue is best summarised by the Federal Court's decision, which stated:</para><para>As individuals, each member of the Bench, like all sensible Australians, is in favour of an efficient waterfront. . . . The business of the Court is legality. Just as it is not unknown in human affairs for a noble objective to be pursued by ignoble means, so it sometimes happens that desirable ends are pursued by unlawful means. If the point is taken before them, courts have to rule on the legality of the means, whatever view individual judges may have about the desirability of the end. This is one aspect of the rule of law, a societal value that is at the heart of our system of government. It follows that this judgment should be seen only as a judgment about legal issues, not a view about the social, economic and political arguments concerning waterfront management that have dominated the media during the last couple of weeks.</para><para>Fortunately, the Australian people recognised the moral bankruptcy of this government's approach. This statement exemplifies all that was wrong with Patrick and the Reith-Howard 
 Liberal government's approach. This government believed that the end justified the means. The only true bankruptcy in this dispute is this government's moral bankruptcy.</para><para>Briefly, on my home town of Burnie: Patrick in Burnie had already well passed the productivity benchmarks set by Minister Reith.

Yet if Mr Howard is confronted by questions about his moral integrity he quivers, he pouts, he shakes with indignation.

It was implemented by the Corrigan-Reith duo. If the events were not so serious, they would go down as the Laurel and Hardy of Australian industrial relations history.

It is a second reading amendment.</para></talk.start></continue><para>This plan, which was also developed in consultation with the former Minister for Transport and Regional Development, was endorsed by the Prime Minister. It was a plan with one purpose: the destruction of the MUA. I am not sure whether the member for Hume was entirely in the game plan or whether he had some misguided view that this was purely a plan to reform the waterfront. But I am sure that that was not the view held by the member for Flinders. His aim clearly was, has always been and has been enunciated by him in various ways many times, the destruction of the Maritime Union of Australia.</para><para>Mr Reith and Mr Howard assumed that, once they had effectively orchestrated the sacking of 2,000 workers employed by Patrick's, the only recourse available to those workers through the courts would be damages. The plan made provision for such an outcome with a crude redundancy plan, and that is the plan that is set out in the original bill that was put before the House of Representatives. Of course, they were wrong. The government forgot that justice and fair play 
 might have had some bearing on this matter. But the Federal Court and the High Court had different views and the workers were therefore, rightly, reinstated. As I said, the original redundancy plan was crude; frankly, the original bill was crude. The government is admitting that by proposing amendments in this place.</para><para>The original bill allowed money to be paid out for anything directly or indirectly related to waterfront reform, and it provided for the definition of what was and what was not waterfront reform to be determined by the minister or his delegate. It was clearly designed to enable the damages costs to be covered off. It also provided for any related costs associated with the Reith-Howard plan to be paid out. It was a plan designed for Mr Corrigan. And it would have picked up the NFF costs on the way through as well, or at least James Ferguson hoped it would. It was a plan designed in such a way that, while Chris Corrigan and Peter Scanlan were the big financial winners, it would be left to the rest of the stevedoring industry to pick up most of the tabâso Mr Corrigan would have all his costs covered but he would only have to pay part of the bill. The rest would be paid by P&amp;O, which did not like this activist strategy, Strangs, Sealand, Brambles and the rest of the industry which were not in on the game at any stage. This would have been a handsome reward for Chris Corrigan for delivering to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business the scalp of the Secretary of the MUA, John Coombs.</para><para>However, as we now know, the Reith-Howard plan has gone badly wrong. It has cost this government dearly and all but ended Mr Reith's leadership plans. I do not think you have to be a real political pundit to know that Mr Reith is not running second to the Treasurer anymoreâhe is out of the race altogether. With the passing of every day more information about how the government went about this unlawful conspiracy is being revealed, and we saw some more two days ago in the House of Representatives. Let me assure the government that there is a lot more to come.</para><para>Now we have a properly negotiated settlement that is clearly in the interests of all parties on the Australian waterfront, and I believe it has been signed off subject to a provision that the agreement is subject to the ACCC ceasing to pursue action against the MUA. So, basically, we are now where we should have been and could have been at the start of this processâthat is, if it were not for the obsession of Mr Reith and the Prime Minister to smash the MUA.</para><para>We will have to amend the government's bill tonight or tomorrow morning to ensure that this crude weapon, designed to overcome a damages claim, is transformed into a proper instrument of reformâa properly restructured and targeted redundancy package, and that is exactly what the opposition amendments are designed to do.</para><para>Mr Reith said that the ALP would vote for this bill because the MUA would tell us to. The fact is that the government proposed this bill because Chris Corrigan said it had to. The government is pursuing this bill because it is doing what Chris Corrigan wants and demands. In the Senate inquiry into this bill it was made clear by the MUAâand not contradicted by Mr Corrigan; in fact, I think he affirmed it in my recollectionâthat last year there were 217 redundancies offered up by the MUA in negotiations with Patrick's relating to only Webb Dock and Port Botany and none of the other ports. So, in discussions about two of the many ports in which Patrick's was involved, 217 redundancies were on the table.</para><para>But apparently Mr Corrigan said, `Patrick's doesn't have the money to pay the redundancies.' One wonders, given the nature of the discussions that were going on, whether Patrick's had a view that they should not have to pay their own money, that they had a promise on the table at that stage that, whatever happened, in the end the government would pay. So Patrick's were negotiating with the MUA in bad faith at that time because they had this government in the bag for their sinister and un-Australian bottom-of-the-harbour asset stripping sacking plan.</para><para>What of the question of savings? What of the question of the money that industry and 
 farmers are supposed to save out of the restructure of the waterfront? That has been the basis of the government's argument justifying public moneys being spent on this plan. What did Mr Corrigan say on the <inline font-style="italic">7.30 Report</inline> tonight? He said, `We might have to pass the money on, but that will depend on competitive pressures.' So Patrick's will probably be forced to pass some of the savings on to customers. Hardly the sort of commitment that this government would have wanted from Mr Corrigan today, given what it has said would be the outcome of this plan. It has been talked up as if we would get massive savings which would be passed on to manufacturers and farmers and the community. The co-conspirator, Mr Corrigan, made it clear tonight that, at the end of the day, he sees the savings in the pockets of Patrick's, the Lang Corporation, himself and other shareholders rather than in the community, unless competitive pressures force some of those savings to be passed on.</para><para>What of the question of the undertaking not to pass on the cost of the levy? Mr Reith told the public at the press conference just before Easter that he had in writing from Patrick's and from P&amp;O an undertaking that these costs would not be passed on. One thing that we established at the hearings last Monday week, from both P&amp;O and Patrick's, is that neither had given a commitment in writing to this government not to pass on the cost of the levy. So the government has a promise from Mr Corrigan. With respect, Mr Corrigan has not necessarily been good at negotiating in good faith, given what was happening with the Maritime Union before Christmas and what has been clearly exposed as his ability to be fast and loose with the truth.</para><para>So we have, at best, a verbal undertaking from the officers of Patrick's and P&amp;Oâa verbal undertaking not to pass these costs on and no commitment at all, apparently, to pass on a substantial amount of any savings that arise from this reform to the community. This is what we are getting from this package.</para><para>We have had so much hiding of detail and obfuscation on this matter, and the avoidance of answering direct questions, that it is important that the Senate put on the public 
 record and carry a resolution which will detail what it expects in relation to the proper accounting for the expenditure of public funds. In this case we need to be absolutely certain that those public funds are spent properly on redundancies and on the administrative costs of those redundancies only; that those redundancies are in accordance with the undertakings given in writing to the government; and that those undertakings are observed.</para><para>The families of the waterside workers and their friends and their communities have been under great pressure during this dispute and have suffered a great deal unnecessarily as a result of this conspiracy. It is time we dealt with this matter properly. I do not believe that the Labor Party will vote for just any bill. It will be voting for a bill that is fair, that does not require Patrick's competitors to pay their bills when clearly Patrick's are on the record as saying that they are not necessarily passing the benefits of this reform on to the community unless they are forced to by competitionâand we cannot be really confident that they will so be forced. We want to be sure that there is an absolute guarantee that none of Patrick's competitors are forced to pay their costs, while Patrick's get away scot free. I move:</para><para>At the end of the motion, add "and that the Senate:</para><para>(a)	 notes the use of public funds to facilitate the payment of redundancies on the waterfront; and</para><para>(b)	 reaffirms the principle, stated previously in resolutions of 9 December 1971, 23 October 1974, 18 September 1980, 4 June 1984 and 29 May 1997, that there are no areas in connection with the expenditure of public funds where any person has a discretion to withhold details or explanations from the Parliament or its committees unless the Parliament has expressly provided otherwise; and</para><para>(c)	 reminds the Government of the Senate's expectation that the operations of the Maritime Industry Finance Company (MIFCo), supported by Commonwealth guarantee, will be transparent and accountable to the Parliament".</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>4191</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIt must be that time of the

So I think the minister will be next after me tonight.</para></talk.start><para>The  Stevedoring Levy (Collection) Bill 1998  and the  Stevedoring Levy (Imposition) Bill 1998  put in place a scheme to establish and fund the Maritime Industry Finance Company, or MIFCo, to establish a loan facility from financial institutions of up to $250 million to pay stevedoring employees sums equal to their redundancy entitlements. Funds are to be raised over time by a levy on the loading and unloading of containers and vehicles in Australia. The passage of these bills is problematic for the Greens (WA), given that they were integral to the government's involvement in the entire Patrick's debacle. These bills were first tabled in the House of Representatives only hours after Patrick's Operations Pty Ltd terminated labour supply agreements with the four Patrick employment companies, which employed approximately 1,400 workers who were members of the Maritime Union of Australia. What a coincidence!</para><para>My first reaction at the time of the introduction of these bills was to oppose them given their part in the outrageous conspiracy to deny 1,400 workers their livelihood purely because they happened to be members of a union. Things have changed in recent times and now, given the finalisation of a negotiated agreement between the Maritime Union of Australia and Patrick, it appears that the passage of these bills is essential to ensure that the 400 or so workers who will lose their jobs will have access to redundancy and related payments.</para><para>There are valid concerns about the bills themselves. I understand that both the Australian Democrats and the ALP have amendments to correct most of these problems. They relate to such issues as the tightening up of the definition of payments that can be made through this fund to ensure that they are used for only valid redundancy and related payments. They relate to providing an opt-out provision to give stevedoring companies 
 which do not wish to use the fund to pay for redundancies to avoid paying the levy. They relate to limiting the levy to international containers only to avoid potential problems with the Bass Strait trade and trade to Australian territories such as Norfolk Island. They relate to tightening up the provisions relating to parliamentary scrutiny of the scheme.</para><para>It is my understanding that the ACTU and the MUA have indicated that, if amendments that address these concerns are successful, they will support the passage of the bills. Given that these organisations are representative of the people most affected, I would certainly not be advocating a support at any costs approach. We will also support the passage of these bills subject to the amendments also being passed.</para><para>We are at an extraordinary period in Australia's history. We are, as I have mentioned on a number of occasions, in a period of unprecedented economic and social change. We are in a period when many people feel frightened and many people feel insecure, and within our society there are those who would manipulate the fear and insecurity to their own ends. I believe that this government and Patrick tried to use that feeling to try to break the organised workplace that was the waterfront in Australia.</para><para>The community got together. When people go through a life threatening experience, I guess they see the light before their eyes. I guess that, when some people saw this extraordinary period of Australia's history, they saw their own lives reflected in that and they banded together. They banded together because they saw that it was not a dispute about the MUA; it was a dispute about the rights of people in their workplace to bargain collectively and to support each other for a fair go. So many people in Australia believed that that was what it was about.</para><para>It was not the court case in the end. If the community was not there, then the time that it took for those decisions to be made in the court case might have meant that things would have happened too quickly, that it would have been too late. So it was not simply about the law and it was not simply about legal justice; it was about peopleâand 
 even governmentsâabusing laws and it was about people making sure that they themselves were not going to be the next in line.</para><para>We will be looking at the committee stage carefully to see what real will there is within the government to come to an outcome which is acceptable to the majority of the community, remembering that the Senate is a representative body of a wide range of people. I have mentioned in the past that at the waterfront there were people from all walks of life. There were MUA members, families, friends, church representatives, Aboriginal people, environmentalists, non-unionists, people who had small businesses and unemployed people. They were all there. I am hoping that the government is beginning to heed that message as well. I will be looking carefully at the outcome of the committee stage to make sure that we move a little closer to something that is better in the future.</para><para>These bills are not an answer to anything. These bills contain a measure that perhaps should not ever have had to happen in the first place. The Greens (WA) will be looking to make sure that in the future we can revisit the situation that has led to this awful crisis coming up in the first place and we will be looking at the role that governments have played in manipulating industrial relations situations to their own end and also the way the legislation that we set up and was pushed through in 1996 with the vote of the Democrats at the time was used by the government in such a way. So in the end I think we as a parliament have to sort out what we did in 1996 and find out if there needs to be changes to that legislation and, if so, we need to make those changes so that we do end up with a fairer workplace in Australia.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>4193</page.no><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name><name.id>SF4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI would like to make a point in the closing moments of the debate on the <inline ref="r518">Stevedoring Levy (Collection) Bill 1998</inline>  and the <inline ref="r516">Stevedoring Levy (Imposition) Bill 1998</inline>  now that Senator Mackay is here.

The member for Oxley acknowledged this point a year and a half ago when she said:</para></talk.start><para>As far as I am concerned, all I am doing is representing fairly the views of the great majority of my constituents. This is part of my responsibility to the people of Oxley.</para><para>Very clearly, the most potent way in which we represent that part of Australia from which we come is to become involved in the parliamentary process: to serve on committees in areas of concern to our constituents, to take part in the debates on legislation and, importantly, to vote on the bills. This is particularly so in the case of Independents who, not constrained by party processes, perhaps have a unique opportunity to speak, to reflect an individual view and to try to amend legislation.</para><para>Let us have a look at how the Independent member for Oxley has become involved in the parliamentary process, enabling her to fairly represent `the views of the great majority' of her constituents. Most of us recall with great clarity her views on immigration and the need for a tightening of the immigration laws. In fact, she went further, when she said that 
 immigration must be halted so that our dole queues are not added to. Surely, then, she would have wanted to contribute to this government's changes which effectively tighten migrants' entry requirements and extend the waiting period for migrants to receive social security payments. No, she did not. She took no part in the debate. She moved no amendments to reflect her public concerns and, when the vote was taken, she was nowhere to be seen.</para><para>Working for the dole is another issue that has attracted the interest of the member for Oxley. In fact, she has frequently called for the introduction of work for the dole programs for our young people, particularly those in regional areas. She said that work for the dole `has the potential to restore hope for many of the 100,000 young unemployed'. So, when an opportunity arose to speak on this government's legislation to create work for the dole programs, to go on the parliamentary record, did she add her voice to those in the government who were voting for it? No, she did notânot in the debateâand, when the vote was taken, she was nowhere to be seen. Thank goodness on this occasion the young unemployed of Oxley did not suffer from her absence: there are a number of successful work for the dole projects in the Oxley electorate.</para><para>Small business is the backbone of Australia. It is the incubator for jobs and wealth creation on the farms and in the suburbs. Not surprisingly, the member for Oxley claims to stand up for small business, which surely means just that: standing up, speaking out, `representing fairly the views of the great majority' of her constituents. In fact, she said she wants to see small business encouraged and provided with the incentives to employ more Australians, especially young people. She said that the government must do all it can to help reduce interest rates for business. Of course, the government has. Interest rates are at the lowest level for 30 years. So, when the government put forward legislation to help small business and exempt the smallest businesses from the unfair dismissal laws, was the air above the member for Oxley's seat filled with the resonance of her supportive 
 comments on this important policy initiative? No, it was notânot in the debate. Again, when the vote was taken, she was nowhere to be seen. So much for the small business concerns of those Oxley constituents.</para><para>Native title and the complications that have arisen from the claims that now effectively lock up much of regional Australia are issues of concern to all of us. On this occasion, the member for Oxley has agreed. In fact, she went further when she said:</para><para>One Nation will continue to fight to abolish the nonsense and inequity that is native title.</para><para>She said she will work to dismantle it. But, if the member for Oxley really cared about cleaning up the native title mess that was left by the previous government, she would surely have been in the thick of the parliamentary debate. She would have been in the chamber moving amendments on the 10-point plan, speaking out publicly. But she was not. There were no amendments. When the vote was takenâtwice on this occasionâshe was nowhere to be seen.</para><para>So, when the votes are taken, when the opportunity comes to stand up in the other place and really be counted on the record, she is not seen. She is not seen on work for the dole, she is not seen on immigration and she is not seen on small business. She is not seen in any of those important policy debates. These are the pieces of legislation which have changed Australia's approach to these important policy areas. In fact, the member for Oxley has been `not present' for 143 of the 209 substantive votes that have been taken since she arrived in Canberra and, on the day she was sworn in, said:</para><para>I will be concentrating on Oxley, not Canberra.</para><para>Strangely true. She has been absent for almost three-quarters of the House of Representatives votes since she was elected, but in the process she has curiously managed to notch up enough overnight stays in Canberra to currently top the list of backbench members who have claimed the Canberra travelling allowance. Why, you may ask. How can it be that the member for Oxley, who describes the rest of us as `self-serving politicians', could have been spending so much time in Canberra? 
 Could it be that parliament is irrelevant to her ultimate objective?</para><para>What we do know is that the member for Oxley was not in Canberra on committee business because, unlike other Independents, she serves on not one single parliamentary committee so she can put forward the views of her constituents and take part in the policy process. Not on Aboriginal affairs. Not on employment, education and training. Not on primary industries. Not on family and community affairs. Most importantly, not on law and order. She is nowhere to be seen. So why, you might ask, has she claimed almost $14,000 in cash and tax-free for her overnight Canberra accommodation for the final six months of last year alone? That is a question for her supporters to answer and resolve in their minds.</para><para>In May 1997, the member for Oxley said that the answer to problems similar to those concerns could be found amongst the people who have sat in this place year after year and have achieved so little, but the reality is that the member for Oxley will not be able to change one single law on one single issue in this place until she starts to participate in this parliament by speaking out, by moving amendments, by taking part in the parliamentary process and, most importantly, by being here to vote. In so clearly failing to do so on issues that she claims to represent as being the views of her electorate, the majority of her constituents, she bears the burden of her own criticisms. She is hoisted on her own petard. She is a politician who fails to do her duty in representing the thousands of people in Oxley who sent her to this place to represent their views, to put fairly, as she said, the views of the great majority of the constituents of Oxley.</para><para>So when it counts in this parliamentâbefore her peers, on the record for Australia and in the votes on the issues that count for this nationâwhere is the member for Oxley? She is nowhere to be seen on the issues that count. If, as she claims, she really wants to address the issues at the heart of this nation's problemsâand that is what she says when she recruits members to her partyâshe must start by fulfilling her responsibilities as the elected 
 member for Oxley and come to this parliament as the member for Oxley and take part in the policy process, join the committees, move the amendments, speak out on the issues that count in the parliamentary debate and, most importantly, turn up for the divisions. She must get her name on the public record as representing her constituents on what really counts. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Meat Industry</title><page.no>4195</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>4195</page.no><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator CARR</name><name.id>AW5</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âTonight I would like to speak about what, to me, is further evidence of the activities of a group of insidious, unscrupulous employers who are operating in a Patrick-like manner to undermine the wages and conditions of a group of workers in this country. These actions have become all the more common since this government was elected because people now believe that the political climate is favourable to crooks and shysters stealing workers' money and entitlements. They believe they have the support of the governmentâa government which sees this as a legitimate means of conducting industrial warfare against employees.</para></talk.start><para>In the case I am mentioning tonight, we see the discredited Patrick's strategy of attempting to remove a unionised work force in the meat industry. This example is of Mr Rashad Aziz, who lives in Melbourne and whose company, Rashad Aziz Investments, owns an abattoir at Mount Schank, about 15 kilometres south of Mount Gambier in South Australia. Since the purchasing of the business by Mr Aziz in 1991, the meatworkers union members have consistently had difficulty enforcing awards and ensuring that legitimate entitlements were paid by that company. What we have seen in subsequent enterprise agreements is attempts being made to undermine the wages and conditions of workers employed by Mr Aziz. Approximately two years ago, employment of AMIEU members at the abattoir was transferred from an employing companyâthat is, the Mount Gambier Meat Processing Pty Ltdâto other companies controlled by Mr Aziz, who then argued that the enterprise agreement that had been signed by that company no longer applied and that those members of the union were no longer entitled 
 to enjoy the benefits of that enterprise agreement.</para><para>This company has been engaged in a number of protracted disputes. On one occasion, a dispute involved some $250,000 worth of back pay. On 21 May, the Federal Court took the view that, although the company transferred the operations of this company to four subsidiary companiesâthe Mt Schank Meat Processing Pty Ltd, Quality Meat Packing Pty Ltd, South East Services Pty Ltd and Select Meat Exports Pty Ltdâthe employer was still subject to his legal obligations to meet the entitlements due to workers employed at that abattoir. That left open a further claim for some $400,000 in back pay.</para><para>On 1 June administrators were appointed to Mt Schank Meat Processing Pty Ltd, which is the employer of the AMIEU members. On Monday of this week, the company's employment was terminated by those administrators. The associated companies have notified vacancies to Centrelink, which is a government agency still, and have commenced interviewing new staff to work at the abattoir. No prizes for guessing that the criterion is that they be non-union members. This is clearly an example of workers being asked to undertake employment which was formerly held by union members and at wages and conditions that are substantially lowerâin fact, some $200 a week lower, which would leave a base rate of $420 a week for the workers.</para><para>This is an outrageous attempt to use industrial and corporate laws, as they currently exist, to allow unscrupulous employers to steal from their employees in a manner which ought be condemned by this parliament. Workers ought to be protected by this parliament against the actions of such employers. In the meat industry this is becoming all too common.</para><para>In the case of Wodonga Meats, Wodonga, a similar pattern has emerged with a principal, a Mr John McPhee, who employed labour at the Wodonga Abattoir. The kill there was undertaken for McPhee Meatpacking Pty Ltd, owned by Mr John McPhee and ANSCO. Wodonga Meats went broke in May 1996, owing some $2.8 million to workers in ac 
 crued entitlements, not including redundancy payments. Millions more were owed to other creditors. McPhee Meatpacking went into receivership in July 1996.</para><para>On 2 April 1998, in the Wangaratta Magistrates Court, Mr John McPhee received a 12-month suspended gaol sentence and a $30,000 fine, after pleading guilty to more than 30 charges of dishonest use of company funds, and he was ordered to pay a total of $103,870.50 restitution to the liquidators of McPhee Meatpacking Pty Ltd. One of the charges referred to the purchase of 12 racehorses for $23,350, paid for by a Wodonga Meats cheque, and written into the books as 56 cattle brought for slaughtering at the Blainey Abattoir in New South Walesâalso owned by Mr McPhee.</para><para>The charges were brought against McPhee by the ASC. They originally included 33 Victorian charges: 17 of false accounting, 16 of theft; and 48 Commonwealth charges: 16 of failing to act honestly as a director, 16 of improper use of his position as a director to obtain benefit for another, and 16 of false accounting. He pleaded guilty to 17 charges of false accounting and 16 of failing to act honestly as a director.</para><para>Wodonga Abattoir has reopened since Wodonga Meats and McPhee Meatpacking, the original company, went broke. Another company of which McPhee is director continues to own the land on which the meatworks is situated and, of course, still operates. The company that now operates the abattoir has two of McPhee's trusted former employees as directors, and a labour hire firm employs the labour. John McPhee is believed to still be in full control of the entire operation. He attends the works on a daily basis and continues to exercise the authority of an employer over the people employed to work there.</para><para>So we have a case where, even when unscrupulous employers are discovered and convicted in courts, they are still able to operateâand to operate in a manner which suggests to me that they are not fit and proper persons to actually function in the meat industry. To me, this is a corrupt practice, a 
 practice which this parliament ought to pay attention to.</para><para>I noticed today that we debated a particular bill by Senator Mackay which would address some of these issues in terms of employment security of workers employed by these unscrupulous employers who are, in fact, undermining not just the living conditions of workers employed in their particular enterprises, but also I think the legitimate actions of proper employers who do pay wages and conditions, who do meet their legal obligations and, of course, who do conduct their business in a fair manner. In so doing, I think the unfair advantage that the unscrupulous and, I think in this case, the criminal are taking over other employers in the industry who do engage in ethical business practices ought be condemned and, as I say, action ought to be taken by this parliament.</para><para>We have a similar case at Grafton. The South Grafton Abattoir was operated by R.J. Gilbertson (Queensland) Pty Ltd. However the land, plant, buildings and equipment are owned by R.J. Gilbertson Pty Ltd, the holding company, and approximately 50 workers at the abattoir were employed by Giltech which had no realisable assets. What appears to have happened as a result of various corporate manoeuvres is that, through the transfer of assets and/or cash between the various Gilbertson companies, the employing company was stripped of the funds to pay these entitlements which should have been paid to those workers at the abattoir in South Grafton.</para><para>One has to ask the question: what sorts of laws are there in this country that allow this sort of theft to go on and these sorts of actions to occur in such a manner where the perpetrators of these, what I regard as, crimes are not prosecuted at law? These matters are under investigation by the Australian Securities Commission. I trust that that commission does take these matters through to their rightful end and that these sorts of actions are stamped out. Workers are entitled to the protection of proper industrial laws. They should, in fact, have the opportunity to take benefit from those laws and not be subject to these sorts of abuses and corrupt actions.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Victorian Central Highlands: Regional Forest Agreement</title><page.no>4197</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>4197</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to speak tonight about a matter of extreme importance to the natural environment of my home state of Victoria. It is indeed of importance to Australia but particularly to Victoria. I refer to the recently signed regional forest agreement for the Victorian Central Highlands.</para></talk.start><para>We have heard a lot of mistruths in this place about RFAs generally from the government, and the Central Highlands RFA is no exception. Last month in question time, Senator Parer said that the Central Highlands RFA is:</para><para>. . . a win for both jobs and the environment. One hundred and sixteen thousand hectares have been added to the central highlands reserve system. This represents a 64 per cent increase in the reserve system.</para><para>He continued:</para><para>. . . the central highlands regional forest agreement will create jobs, protect the environment, and I commend it to the Senate.</para><para>I would like to look at some of those statements and try to work out the real situation. It is worth doing, not just because of the importance of the Central Highlands region, but also because the region has come up in this chamber on a number of occasions in question time, matters of public importance and debate over legislation.</para><para>The Central Highlands Regional Forest Agreement was signed by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Premier of Victoria on 27 March this year. At the time of the announcement of that signing, it was described by environment groups as `an enormous con trick, a glossy PR exercise designed to make it seem that the longstanding conflict over native forest logging has been solved'.</para><para>As with the East Gippsland and Tasmanian RFAs, the  Central Highlands RFA process has been widely criticised for some dubious scientific methodologyâfor lack of proper survey data and questionable statistical sampling techniques. Done correctly from the start, the RFA process could have had some integrity and offered us at least some chance of lasting peace in the forests. Instead, the 
 ecological importance of the Central Highlands region and many others is at risk.</para><para>Forty vegetation classes have been identified in the Central Highlands region, of which 20 are considered rare, endangered or vulnerable. The Central Highlands also contains 25 species of mammals, birds, reptiles, frogs and fish, and 15 plant species that are listed under Commonwealth or state legislation as being threatened. These species include Victoria's faunal emblem, the Leadbeater's possum, the Baw Baw frog, the grey goshawk, the spotted tree frog, the crimson spider orchid, owl species, and many more. The area contains magnificent mountain ash forests, fern gullies, riverine forests and other vegetation types. It is also virtually on Melbourne's doorstep and, therefore, into the future will become an even more important recreational and aesthetic asset.</para><para>The 116,000 hectares claim is a nonsense. These areas are either largely mountaintops and other areas that would not have been logged anyway, or, alternatively, they are not big enough to be considered secure and viable reserves as habitat for threatened species. In reality, no further secure or significant reserves have come out of this process. The RFA fails its most obvious environmental testâthe state's faunal emblem, the Leadbeater's possum, is a species in serious trouble, yet the logging giant Amcor has access to two-thirds of the possums' known remaining habitat.</para><para>The RFA between Victoria and the Commonwealth agrees that, even if a world heritage assessment of these forests within the eucalypt theme were to conclude that they were of international significance and would meet the world heritage criteria, the Commonwealth has actually agreed not to proceed unless all governments agree and, given that this includes the Victorian government, that is highly unlikely. This is all spelled out in clause 29 of the agreement.</para><para>Similarly, the agreement says that no recommendations for further listings to the Register of the National Estate shall proceed unless jointly agreed between the federal and state governments. In our view this is an abrogation of the federal government's re 
 sponsibility, and this is precisely why so many people are very worried about this government's proposed changes to environmental laws due to come into this chamber, I understand, some time this year. In essence, it is about state rights, not the rights of the planet and the myriad of creatures that inhabit these wonderful forests.</para><para>The public consultation process for those changes to the federal environment laws has been grossly inadequate, with only one month for the community to comment on a very vague discussion paper put out by the office of the Minister for Resources and Energy (Senator Parer). The Central Highlands was the same story with many groups claiming consultation was tokenistic and was there to simply legitimise predetermined outcomes.	 Certainly, if you believe the book by Pamela Williams entitled <inline font-style="italic">The Victory</inline>âand I have no reason to doubt itâabout the last federal election, this tokenism is certainly the case. That book goes into some detail about the deal which was done between the Liberal Party and the forestry industry prior to the last election. Certain agreements were already reached as far back as November 1995.</para><para>In clause 40 of the agreement, the Commonwealth has also agreed that Victoria's processes and systems provide for ecologically sustainable management of forest in the Central Highlands. Yet the parties also agree on badly needed improvements in later clausesâsuch as clause 48 which recognises the need to further develop appropriate mechanisms to monitor and review the sustainability of forest management practices. Also, clause 59 agrees that pest plant and animal control programs will be developed within five years. How then can the Commonwealth agree that Victoria's forest practices were, at the time of signing this RFA, already sustainable?</para><para>In clause 79, the agreement also allows for mining and exploration in the reserve system. In addition, no package of measures is yet available which would guarantee proper management of Aboriginal heritage. Clause 74 recognises this fact. And so it goes on.</para><para>Perhaps one of the most startling admissions in the agreement is contained in clause 81 regarding the Thompson catchment. This 
 is the catchment that provides most of Melbourne's water supply. Logging within the catchment has been controversial for many years. A recent economic study concluded that the catchment is worth more in dollar terms for its water than for the returns which could ever come from logging. The RFA agrees to develop a long-term timber harvesting and water production strategy for the catchment `when timber resource data becomes available in 1999'. Obviously, we have been proceeding for all these years without even basic information, as this RFA now admits.</para><para>I argue that successive federal governments have dragged various states into national competition policy arrangements, and they have used various means to do so including the competition principles agreement. But what do we see in the RFA? The Commonwealth agrees that pricing and allocation arrangements for wood from public forests are solely matters for Victoria. In other words, unlike other COAG agreements about the pricing of water, the Commonwealth government have given away their involvement in these matters. They may as well have said `We don't care, even if state governments want to give our forests away for nothing.'</para><para>I have visited many places in this RFA region, and I cannot for the life of me see how this agreement can claim to be ecologically sustainable. After logging, these coupes look more like battlefields. The Central Highlands RFA, as described by Senator Parer, is not a win for the environment. It is, rather, a lost opportunity, squandered by this government.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Waterfront</title><page.no>4199</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>23:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>4199</page.no><name role="metadata">Watson, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WATSON</name><name.id>VJ4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âLast Tuesday, in the concluding minutes of the adjournment debate, I raised the problems encountered on a regular basis by many Tasmanian shippers in forwarding their cargo through the port of Melbourne. Shippers from Tasmania are very much at the mercy of shipping companies and some very bad waterside practices. There are difficulties in booking space and getting containers, loading is frequently unreliable, ships hardly ever dock or leave on time, and to keep up 
 with their schedule shipowners will take the decision to pull out of port, leaving on the docks containers booked on the vessel, to hopefully be loaded on the next ship. I am referring to the export trade.</para></talk.start><para>Exporters do not have faith that containers will be shipped in the manner they request, or on the deck they request. If a tarpaulin is put on a container at the shipper's expense to protect their product, the tarpaulin may be stolen and almost certainly will be damaged. Exporters find they have no right to expect their product to be cared for and protected once out of their sight. In Australian shipping, customers had no rights 25 years ago, and for many Tasmanians little has changed today. Reforms are supposed to have occurred, but people from Tasmania, when shipping overseas, ask where they are, certainly in terms of the costs.</para><para>Until we have a sincere approach on reform in which it can be acknowledged and accepted by all parties in the shipping industry that the customer should and must always be right, there is unlikely to be any worthwhile reform. The customer, the shipper, must have a right to expect that he actually can and will get what he pays for. The customer, the shipper, has the right to expect that everything possible will be done throughout the booking of space, the ordering of empty containers, the receival of the product at the wharf, storage at the wharf, loading onto the ship, the voyage, discharge and delivery at the point of destination, to ensure that the paying customer is always right. The customer has a right to expect nothing less. Then, and only then, will we have reform that is working. Then, and only then, can the customer, and Australia, become world competitive.</para><para>No wonder exporters are frustrated. No wonder they are cynical about the Melbourne waterfront. One Tasmanian exporter became so frustrated about shipping his product through Melbourne that he actually provided additional tarpaulins to be put at Melbourne wharf so that when the original one went missing he had a replacement. This particular exporter reckoned that wharfies must really like camping. Not a week went by without the same exporter receiving complaints from 
 customers in Melbourne and Sydney that their consignments were one or two bags short.</para><para>Then again, fresh vegetables from the north-west coast of Tasmania, grown in that amazing red soil, are world renowned. Wharfies and their families must be really well fed on Tasmanian vegetables, particularly from the north-west coast. A textile importer innovatively changed the wording on their crates to ensure they received their full order on arrival at their depot. The wharfies' families must be well clothed too.</para><para>Shippers complain of the high cost of shipping. It was not too many years ago when it was difficult to find shipping executives after lunch. It could be argued that our shipping managers, our stevedores and our port authorities let go the management and control of the Australian waterfront. Weren't these the people who did the deals because it was the easy way to keep the ports working? What about the $12 pay increase to wharfies in 1991, in the middle of a recession? It was wrong then, and we have continued inefficient work practices ever since.</para><para>We believe that the position can be redeemed. It is going to take a great deal of effort if we in Australia are to get these things done. But, without what I call total waterfront reform, this country will never be world competitive. New Zealand has certainly tackled the problem, and so must Australia. The situation is embarrassing for us as a country and it is also embarrassing for our exporters. Recently when in New Zealand I visited the port authority in Auckland and found there that the wet handling chargesâthe tug charges and associated eventsâby the Port of Auckland Authority were five times cheaper than any port in Australia. We are not talking about 10 per cent or 20 per cent but five times cheaper than any port in Australia.</para><para>There must therefore be total reform, and it must be honest reformâby all the partiesâto end the decades of poor work and management practices on our docks which have added to exporters' costs and reduced our international competitiveness. As a Tasmanian senator, I look forward to total reform, particularly from the port of Melbourne.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senate adjourned at 11.06 p.m.</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>4200</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tabling</title><page.no>4200</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following documents were tabled by the Clerk:</para><para>Child Care Actâ</para><para>	 Child Care (Eligible Child Care Centres) Amendment Guidelines (No. 1) 1998.</para><para>	 Child Care (New Allocations) Guidelines 1998.</para><para>	 Child Care (Other PlacesâAllocations) Guidelines 1998.</para><para>	 Childcare Assistance (Fee Relief) GuidelinesâSection 12AâAmendment guidelinesâCA/12A/98/1.</para><para>	 Childcare Assistance Immunisation Requirements Direction 1998âIMCA/12G/98/1.</para><para>	 Childcare Assistance Immunisation Requirements Direction 1998âAmendment directionâIMCA/12G/98/2.</para><para>Child Care Payments ActâVaccination Schedules GuidelinesâVS/18/98/1.</para><para>Childcare Rebate Actâ</para><para>	 Childcare Rebate (Exempt Persons) Amendment Determination (No. 1) 1998.</para><para>	 Childcare Rebate Immunisation Requirements Direction 1998âIMCR/39A/98/1.</para><para>	 Childcare Rebate Immunisation Requirements Direction 1998âAmendment directionâIMCR/39A/98/2.</para><para>Financial Management and Accountability ActâDetermination under section 20âCommonwealth Parliamentary Association Conference and Seminar Contributions ReserveâDetermination 1998/6.</para><para>Fisheries Management ActâSouth East Trawl Fishery Management Plan 1998âSET 01.</para><para>National Health ActâDeclarations Nos PB 10-12 of 1998.</para><para>National Parks and Wildlife Conservation ActâPulu Keeling National Parkâ</para><para>	 Comments on representations received by Parks Australia on the proposed plan of management.</para><para>	 Plan of management.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Superannuation Act 1976</inline> âDeterminationâSuperannuation (CSS) Employer Component Payment (Telstra Superannuation Scheme) Determination No. 4.</para><para>Taxation Rulings TR 98/10 and TR 98/11.
