Most sitting weeks involve Hansard transcribing up to 130 hours of chamber and committee material. The two Houses sit for up to 80 hours, the Main Committee of the House of Representative sits for approximately 6.5 hours and there is generally around 30 to 40 hours of other committee hearings.</para><para>3.

Hansard will use its resources, including overtime and external providers, to produce chamber reports and committee transcripts within the nominated turnaround times. However, it appears inevitable there will be delays in committee transcript production in the week of 1 to 5 June. This almost certainly will have implications for production of committee transcripts in the week of 9-12 June, which while not a House sitting week, is very heavily booked for legislation committee and other committee hearings.</para><para>6.

The objective of this act is to ensure that measurements are made on a consistent basis throughout the nation and are compatible with measurements in other countries.</para><para>The act was amended previously to provide for the introduction of certified measuring instruments used for regulatory purposes, such as police measurements of speed, and occupational health and safety measurements. At the same time provision was made for the use of certified reference materials to provide for improved chemical measurements in a wide range of applications in industry and government regulation such as police breath alcohol measurements and environmental monitoring.</para><para>However these previous amendments have been frustrated by a drafting error in the definition of a "certifying body" which meant that certifying bodies for both certified measuring instruments and certified reference materials could be created under the National Measurement Regulations, but existing capable bodies could not be appointed.</para><para>The purpose of the bill is to amend the National Measurement Act 1960 to correct this drafting error and-thereby allow the appointment of certifying bodies by the National Standards Commission both for the certification of certified measuring instruments and for the certification of certified reference materials.</para><para>A second purpose of this bill is to remove the mandatory retirement age of 65 years for the Executive Director of the National Standards Commission in line with government policy. This will allow the Commission greater flexibility in succession planning.</para><para>I commend the bill to the Senate.</para><para>PAYMENT SYSTEMS AND NETTING BILL 1998</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Overview of the bill</inline></para><para>The common law has long recognised the principle of set-off between an insolvent company and its creditors. Where a company is insolvent there would be an injustice if the law allowed the liquidator to insist upon receiving 100 cents in the dollar on the whole of a debt due to the company, while insisting that the creditor must be satisfied 
 with less than 100 cents in the dollar in relation to a debt owed by the company to the creditor. To address this, the law has allowed liquidators and creditors to set-off the debts, so that only the net amount becomes payable or provable, as the case may be, in the liquidation. This important principle has been taken up into section 553C of the Corporations Law.</para><para>However, the common law in this area has not kept pace with technology. Improved communications technology and computers have made it possible for large institutions to enter into many transactions in the course of a day, and to be able to identify precisely the time each day each transaction was entered into.</para><para>Taking advantage of this technology, the major financial institutions have many dealings each day with each other and their customers, usually for very large sums of money. Further, instead of paying each other the gross amount owing on each of these transactions, the parties have agreed to set-off the debts owed to each other at the end of each day. As there are several participants in the system, the parties commonly agree to a form of multiparty set-off, known as multilateral netting.</para><para>Multilateral netting has three significant advantages for the parties. First, because only the net amounts are actually paid, it reduces their liquidity requirements. Second, an institution does not have to wait until it receives funds from one transaction before entering into another transaction. Third, there is a reduction in risk should one of the other parties become insolvent, because only the net amount is at risk, rather than the gross amount owed to the insolvent party.</para><para>However, because the common law has only recognised set-off between two parties, there is some doubt about the effectiveness of multilateral netting on the insolvency of one of the parties. The bill will overcome that uncertainty.</para><para>In particular, the bill will provide legal certainty for multilateral netting currently undertaken in the Australia payment system overseen by the Reserve Bank. This will enhance the stability of the Australian financial system. The bill will also provide certainty for netting undertaken in connection with the trading of derivatives, known as close-out netting, and for netting undertaken in accordance with the rules of a stock or future exchange or an associated clearing house, known as market netting.</para><para>In addition, the bill will provide legal certainty for transactions undertaken through the real time gross settlement system to be implemented by the Reserve Bank at around mid 1998.</para><para>These measures will enhance the integrity of the Australian payment system and the international competitiveness of Australian financial institutions. They will make a significant contribution towards 
 the Government's commitment to establishing Australia as a major regional financial centre, and bring to Australia new business and employment opportunities in the financial sector.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Integrity of netting in the payment system</inline></para><para>The Australian payment system currently comprises a number of separate systems for transferring funds in Australia between banks, other financial institutions and their customers. The multilateral netting system currently operating in the payment system produces a result reflecting a participant's overall debit or credit position vis-a-vis all the other participants. The system sums the exposures of each participant in the system and calculates a multilateral net position at the end of the day for each participant.</para><para>In the present framework of banking and insolvency law some uncertainties attach to the effectiveness of these multilateral netting arrangements. These uncertainties focus on the application of the law concerning unfair preferences in relation to multilateral netting arrangements. While insolvency law confers a statutory right of set-off in certain circumstances, there is some uncertainty about whether multilateral netting arrangements are enforceable in an insolvency. The bill will ensure that multilateral netting arrangements in the payment system that are approved by the Reserve Bank will survive the insolvency of a participant in the arrangement.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Integrity of the real time gross settlement system</inline></para><para>The Wallis Report recommended that the Reserve Bank give high priority to promoting cost-effective control of domestic and international settlement risks.</para><para>The Reserve Bank, the Australian Payments Clearing Association Limited (APCA) and the major national banks have participated actively in the establishment of a sound framework to support enhanced clearing and settlement systems in the payment system. As part of this process, high-value payments (which account for more than two-thirds of the value of cleared payments in Australia) are to be settled on a real time gross settlement basis.</para><para>Under real time gross settlement, the processing of payments will only occur if the paying institution has funds available in its settlement account with the Reserve Bank. At the same time as the funds are debited to the paying customer's account, and credited to the payee's account, the corresponding entries are passed to their institutions' accounts with the central bank. In this way the transaction is completed in all its elementsâincluding settlementâimmediately and irrevocably. The Reserve Bank and Australian Payments Clearing Association Limited are working towards implementing real time gross settlement at around mid 1998. 
</para><para>However, because of the Zero Hour Rule, some uncertainties attach to the effectiveness of real time gross settlement arrangements.</para><para>When a court-ordered liquidation commences, any payments or transfers of property made by the company thereafter are void, subject to certain exceptions such as payments made by the liquidator. It has been suggested that a court-ordered liquidation may be taken to have commenced at the beginning of the day on which the order was made. (This possibility is known as the Zero Hour Rule.) Accordingly, payments made through the real time gross settlement system could be void if the paying party enters into liquidation. This would undermine the irrevocability of those payments and create severe liquidity problems in the payment system. To prevent this possibility from arising, the bill will exempt real time gross settlement payments from the possible application of the Zero Hour Rule.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Integrity of netting for close-out and market contracts</inline></para><para>In June 1997 the Netting Sub-Committee of the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee recommended the enactment of legislation to clarify a number of issues arising in netting in financial market transactions. The sub-committee was particularly concerned to ensure that the appointment of a liquidator to a party to a netting contract does not affect the validity of the contract.</para><para>In its discussion paper on "Electronic Commerce", released as part of the Corporate Law Economic Reform Program in December 1997, the Government indicated that it would be legislating along the lines recommended by the Sub-committee to provide a more certain and robust legal framework for close-out and market netting. These reforms have received strong support from the financial sector.</para><para>To allow the existing legal uncertainties to remain would leave Australia well behind international best practice in financial market reform. These uncertainties have already been addressed or are presently being addressed in a number of other jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom, France, Canada and New Zealand, and at the international level by the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision, to promote the legal enforceability of netting arrangements.</para><para>The bill will therefore take up the sub-committee's recommendations and provide legal certainty for close-out netting in the financial markets and for netting undertaken in accordance with the rules governing stock and futures exchanges and the associated clearing houses. It will put the Australian legal system supporting financial market netting on par with that in a number of OECD countries.</para><para>Enhancing the integrity of close-out and market netting will make it easier for financial institutions 
 and their customers to obtain all the benefits of transactions which are generally regarded as an essential part of sound financial management, such as interest rate and currency swaps and other arrangements which hedge exposures. It will also assist Australian financial institutions to join Exchange Clearing House Limited, an international clearing house for foreign exchange transactions.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Ministerial Council for Corporations</inline></para><para>The bill will alter the effect, scope or operation of the Corporations Law. Accordingly, as required by clause 510 of the Corporations Agreement between the Commonwealth, the States and the Northern Territory, the Commonwealth has notified the States and the Northern Territory of the bill.</para><para>I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill and I commend the bill to the Senate.</para><para>CHEQUES AND PAYMENT ORDERS AMENDMENT (TURNBACK OF CHEQUES) BILL 1998</para><para>The measures proposed by this bill will complement those proposed by the Payment Systems and Netting Bill 1998 to enhance the effectiveness of arrangements within Australia's payments system.</para><para>Presently, cheques are cleared via a specialised paper clearing stream within that system. As part of those clearing arrangements, and in accordance with long-standing practice, financial institutions collecting cheques deposited by their customers provisionally credit their customers' accounts with the amounts of the cheques deposited. The collecting institutions do not, however, normally allow their customers to withdraw those deposited funds until they are confident that a cheque will not be dishonoured.</para><para>Having regard to the revocable nature of cheques, and the uncertainty that could arise in the event of the insolvency of a participant in the payments system as to whether cheques drawn on the insolvent participant had been paid or dishonoured, it is not clear that other participants in the system would have a clear and unambiguous right to reverse the provisional credits they had made to their customers' accounts.</para><para>If unsettled cheques could not be treated as dishonoured, and the provisional credits reversed, collecting institutions would be required to bear the loss so occasioned and would have to prove in the winding up of the insolvent participant for the amount of that loss. In that event, collecting institutions would have to wait for the reconstruction of the affairs of the insolvent participant or for the payment of a dividend in its winding up.</para><para>To enhance the integrity of Australia's payments system the bill will make it clear that, in the event 
 of the insolvency of a participant in that system, other participants will have a clear and unambiguous right to treat unsettled cheques as "dishonoured". This will allow them to reverse the provisional credits made to their customers' accounts and "turnback" the cheques to their customers. As a consequence, their customers will be required to seek payment in lieu of the dishonoured cheques from the drawers of the cheques (ie. the persons who wrote the cheques). The drawers will, in turn, be required to prove in the winding-up of the insolvent institution for the monies they had deposited in that institution to meet their cheques.</para><para>The enhanced stability of the payments system, and ultimately the entire financial system, that will result from the measures proposed by this bill, will be to the benefit of depositors at large.</para><para>I present the Explanatory Memorandum to the bill and I commend the bill to the Senate.</para><para>CHEQUES AND PAYMENT ORDERS AMENDMENT BILL 1998</para><para>Cheques have been a mainstay of the Australian payments system for generations. Notwithstanding the advent of newer payment instruments in the last 20 years, including credit cards, automatic teller machines, direct credit payments and EFTPOS, cheques continue to play an important role. Each day, around 3 million cheques worth over $17 billion are written by individuals, businesses and governments in Australia. On average, each Australian will write 55 cheques per year.</para><para>Extension of cheque issuing rights to building societies, credit unions and SSPs</para><para>The bill will expand the range of institutions that can issue cheques in their own name. Credit unions and building societies will be able to issue cheques in their own name, or request their industry special services provider to provide them with a cheque issuing facility.</para><para>Building societies and credit unions are presently limited to the provision of agency cheques drawn on a bank or to issue "payment orders", with the same rights and obligations under the Cheques and Payment Orders Act 1986 as cheques.</para><para>Repeal of Payment Orders</para><para>In practice, payment orders have come to be regarded as second-class instruments. This bill proposes the abolition of payment orders and repeal of the provisions of the Act that relate to them.</para><para>Transitional provisions will preserve the operation of the Act to payment orders issued at the time of commencement of the bill.</para><para>Miscellaneous amendments 
</para><para>The Government also proposes a number of miscellaneous amendments to the Cheques and Payment Orders Act to overcome limitations experienced in the practical application of the Act, and to allow financial institutions greater flexibility in their cheque operations.</para><para>Conclusion</para><para>As the Final Report of the Financial System Inquiry (the Wallis Report) of March 1997 noted, cheque usage in Australia is high by international comparison. The Government anticipates that the measures proposed by the bill, to extend to building societies, credit unions and their special services providers the right to issue cheques in their own name, will do much to:</para><para>.	 advance the principles of competitive neutrality supported by the Wallis Report;</para><para>.	 enhance transparency in the payments system by making it clear to consumers which financial institution stands behind a cheque; and</para><para>.	 facilitate the provision of cheaper and more efficient financial services to consumers, especially to those consumers living in rural and regional Australia.</para><para>I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill and I commend the bill to the Senate.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Conroy</inline>) adjourned.</para><para>Ordered that the  National Measurement Amendment Bill 1998  be listed on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline> as a separate order of the day.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>CUSTOMS LEGISLATION (ANTI-DUMPING AMENDMENTS) BILL 1998</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>3447</page.no><id.no>r522</id.no><cognate><cognateinfo><title>CUSTOMS TARIFF (ANTI-DUMPING) AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>r521</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate><cognate><cognateinfo><title>DATA-MATCHING PROGRAM (ASSISTANCE AND TAX) AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>r524</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>3447</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bills received from the House of Representatives.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>3447</page.no><name role="metadata">Newman, Sen Jocelyn</name><name role="display">Senator NEWMAN</name><name.id>BE4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Social Security</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI indicate to the Senate that those bills which have just been announced are being introduced together.

The coalition outlined this commitment in its Primary Industry Policy "Reviving the Heartland," in which it undertook to "improve existing countervailing and anti-dumping procedures to ensure Australian producers are not disadvantaged," and to "reduce the inquiry period for anti-dumping and countervailing cases". The policy proposed "a maximum total investigation period of 155 days."</para><para>Australia has committed itself to anti-dumping and countervailing legislation which is consistent with the obligations imposed by the relevant agreements of the World Trade Organisation (WTO). Of particular importance is the obligation that "throughout an investigation all interested parties must have a full opportunity for the defence of their interests", including the opportunity to see all relevant information, to acquaint themselves with the opposing views and to offer rebuttal arguments.</para><para>At present Australia has a two stage, two agency, investigation process involving Customs and the Anti-Dumping Authority (ADA). Customs undertakes a preliminary inquiry within a statutory period of 100 days (extendable to 120 days in certain circumstances). Where there is a positive preliminary finding of dumping causing material injury Customs can impose provisional measures (securities). Following such a finding the investigation is referred to the ADA. The ADA calls for additional submissions, gathers further information and will essentially re-do what Customs did in its preliminary investigation, although using different information. The ADA process is to be completed within a statutory maximum time frame of 120 days. The Minister then decides on appropriate measures.</para><para>This system is a legacy of Labor's period in office. It has been criticised by industry on many counts: the time to imposes provisional measures where 
 necessary, by which time long-term damage may have been caused to the Australian industry; the time taken to reach a final finding is too long; and, the two-agency structure creates duplication, inconsistency, uncertainty and additional cost to parties.</para><para>The anti-dumping system has been reviewed five times in the last eleven years. The most recent of these reviews, the 1996 Willett Report, "Review of Australia's Anti-Dumping and Countervailing Administration", made a number of recommendations for reform of the system, including abolition of the ADA and the introduction of a single-agency system leading to shortened investigations. These recommendations reflected many of the concerns of industry expressed in earlier reviews. The changes which the Government now seeks to introduce draw heavily on Willett's conclusions, whilst recognising that not all his recommendations may be desirable or workable.</para><para>Willett recommended a two-stage, single agency process: 100 days for the investigation phase (at which time a Statement of Essential Facts would be published), followed by a review period of 55 days, conducted internally, with a final finding to go to the Minister at day 155 (but with an overall investigation period of 175 days for cases of greater complexity).</para><para>Under existing arrangements, a positive finding is referred to the ADA for a de novo investigation (often mistakenly referred to as a review). The ADA continues the investigation by seeking and verifying additional information to that which was before Customs. This adds 110 days (120 in complex cases) to the inquiry and has given rise to the criticism of duplication and delay. Willett recommended that the only way to achieve reduction in the time taken to 155 days was to substantially reduce the time available for review. He suggested this be done by eliminating the second agency, and introducing a more limited review by the first agency (ie. internal review).</para><para>At first glance, the Willett model would deliver the reform sought by industry. However, the Willett model has serious shortcomings: its compressed investigation phase would prevent thorough examination of the issues; the opportunities for interested parties to defend their interests would be inadequate; and, its proposal that Customs conduct internal reviews of its findings would call into question the credibility and impartiality of the entire process.</para><para>The Government has therefore formulated modifications to the Willett model which will overcome these deficiencies. The Government's model meets the objective of a total investigation period of 155 days but delivers to interested parties greater opportunity for a comprehensive consideration of 
 the facts and an additional process of external administrative appeal of the merits.</para><para>Under the Government's model the ADA is to be abolished and Customs will take on the sole responsibility for the conduct of investigations. An independent body, the Trade Measures Review Office, to serve the newly created public office of Trade Measure Review Officer (TMRO), the person charged with reviewing dumping decisions, will be established within the Industry, Science and Tourism portfolio.</para><para>Provisional measures in the form of securities will be available from day 60 of an investigation onwards if Customs determines that there is sufficient evidence to warrant their imposition. This is in conformity with the requirements of the relevant WTO Agreements.</para><para>A Statement of Essential Facts will be issued by day 110, 10 days more than Willett allowed for the initial investigation phase. This additional period will address a major concern of industry, namely that information, particularly regarding exporters, only becomes available late in the initial investigation. Consequently, the local industry has a limited opportunity to raise concerns regarding this information and more importantly the investigating authority has a limited time within which to address those concerns. The additional 10 days will enhance the opportunity for all interested parties fully to defend their interests and will enable Customs to issue a comprehensive Statement of Essential Facts reflecting its reasoned conclusions on all relevant issues.</para><para>After issue of the Statement of Essential Facts, interested parties will have a 20 day period within which to lodge submissions in response. Customs will then have a further 25 days to complete the investigation, having regard to matters raised in the submissions. It should complete its investigation on or before day 155. Customs will then forward a detailed report and recommendations to the Minister. The Minister's decision in response to the Customs recommendations will constitute a final finding. The investigation will thus be completed within a 155 day time frame in conformity with the coalition's election undertaking. Only in exceptional cases will the Minister  authorise an extension of the investigation period.</para><para>In formulating these reforms the Government recognised that anti-dumping and countervailing investigations and reviews can be disruptive for all interested parties. Investigations may give rise to trade chilling effects, which are to the detriment of exporters, importers and consumers alike. Australian industry views such investigations as creating uncertainty within the market place which may delay investment decisions thereby retarding their economic development and overall efficiency.  
</para><para>The Government accepts that it is in the interests of all parties for these investigations and reviews to be completed as soon as is practicable. It is convinced that its proposed reforms have struck a balance between, on the one hand, the desirability of speedily resolving investigations and, on the other, doing so in a manner which is not only consistent with our WTO obligation but in certain respects exceeds those obligations.</para><para>However, this balance can only be maintained if all interested parties are subject to a discipline which requires that if they wish to participate in the investigation or review process they must ensure that their submissions are lodged promptly. Therefore at various mile stones through out the investigation or review process the Government's reforms confer a power upon the relevant decision-maker to disregard any submissions which are received after specified periods, if there is insufficient time remaining for their proper consideration. Without such powers the statutory deadlines would never be met and the balance which such deadlines are designed to preserve would be undermined.</para><para>The 155 day investigation phase contains sufficient safeguards to ensure that all interested parties will have sufficient time to identify any errors or other deficiencies in Customs findings of fact and reasoning. A 155 day investigation phase will also ensure that Customs will have sufficient time to be able to respond to such concerns before forwarding a recommendation to the Minister regarding a final finding.</para><para>Nevertheless, if grounds exist, parties to the case will have the right to have the Minister's decision reviewed by the TMRO. Parties will have a maximum of 30 days following publication of the Minister's final finding within which to lodge an application for review. The application must contain particulars of the basis upon which it is alleged that the investigation was flawed. Other interested parties will then have 30 days within which to lodge responses. The TMRO will then have a maximum of 30 days to consider the matter and to make a recommendation to the Minister. If the TMRO considers that sufficient doubt attached to any aspect of the investigation such as to call into question the Customs' recommendation to the Minister, the TMRO can recommend to the Minister that that aspect of the investigation be remitted to Customs for reconsideration.</para><para>The significant feature of the appeal mechanism is that the TMRO will not undertake an investigative function. It will be limited to examining the investigation record in light of the arguments raised in the application.</para><para>This will ensure the outcome of dumping inquiries is decided as quickly as possible, providing certainty in the market place. 
</para><para>With the transfer to Customs of the investigative functions of the ADA in relation to applications for continuation of measures after the statutory 5 year time limit and applications for review of anti-dumping measures, it is proposed to extend the current 120 day limit the ADA has to conduct such inquiries to 155 days. This is to provide consistency across the range of investigations to be undertaken by the ACS so as to ensure that the opportunities for all interested parties to fully defend their interests are consistent.</para><para>Finally, it is proposed to confer on the TMRO the ability to review decisions made by the CEO as to whether an investigation should start, or should be terminated because there is no good reason to continue it, and as to the amount of customs duty paid on particular consignments of goods.</para><para>CUSTOMS TARIFF (ANTI-DUMPING) AMENDMENT BILL 1998</para><para>The purpose of the bill is to make consequential amendments to a taxing Act, the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act 1975, made necessary by amendments to the Customs Act 1901 proposed in the Customs Legislation (Anti-dumping Amendments) Bill 1998.</para><para>In Item 57 to Schedule 1 to the Anti-dumping Amendments Bill referred to above, it is proposed to repeal, amongst others, subsections 269TJ (4), (5), (6), (7) and (9) of the Customs Act. These provisions currently permit Australia to take retaliatory countervailing action against another country in certain circumstances. They are inconsistent with Australia's obligations to the World Trade Organisation ("the WTO"). These obligations require that WTO dispute settlement procedures be exhausted before such action can be taken.</para><para>In that context, the Government has decided to remove from the Customs Act the provisions enabling retaliatory countervailing action to be taken.</para><para>In consequence, the capacity to impose countervailing duty pursuant to those sections should also be repealed. It is proposed to do this in this bill.</para><para>DATA-MATCHING PROGRAM (ASSISTANCE AND TAX) AMENDMENT BILL 1998</para><para>Madam President, the Data-matching Program is an important aspect of the continued efforts of this Government to ensure the integrity of Australia's social welfare system.</para><para>Over the past seven years, the Data-matching Program has been conducted under the Privacy's Commissioner's scrutiny with careful regard for individual privacy and is an important control on personal financial assistance schemes, helping to keep them free of abuse and fraud. It has been 
 proven over the past two years that it can achieve substantial savings in public expenditure.</para><para>The Data-matching Program is also valuable in encouraging voluntary compliance with the rules in place to ensure payments are targeted to those in need. It reminds the community that it is not a case of if fraud will be detected, but when. It has now become an important feature of the review mechanisms that are helping to build the integrity of the system and the confidence of the public that the system is, in fact, secure from fraud.</para><para>There are on-going review and reporting arrangements in place to allow the Parliament to maintain its scrutiny of the Program. The present Government, when in Opposition, argued successfully for continuation of this scrutiny. The Privacy Commissioner continues to play an important role in ensuring that the Government agencies participating in the Data-matching Program abide by the strict conditions already set down in the legislation to protect the privacy of individuals. In addition to the Privacy Commissioner being able to seek information and scrutinise the activities of the Agencies involved in the Data-matching Program, there is a requirement that those Agencies report annually to the Privacy Commissioner. The Act also requires that these reports are laid before the Parliament. There is also a triennial report to the Parliament covering the three previous financial years. The first triennial report is due in the second half of this year.</para><para>Madam President, in 1996 the Australian National Audit Office conducted a follow-up of its 1993 Audit of Data-matching within the Department of Social Security. This review was in keeping with this Government's election commitment to review the Data-matching Program.</para><para>Madam President it can be noted that the ANAO's Audit opinion given in its 1996 report was as follows:</para><para>"Overall the Department has made substantial achievements through implementing legislative changes, improved reporting procedures, savings collection, better targeting and project evaluation processes. These changes have resulted in both substantial increases in savings generated by the Program and in efficiency improvements."</para><para>When the Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Act 1990 was first enacted it incorporated a sunset clause to take effect in January 1993. That sunset clause has, however, been extended by the Parliament on three separate occasions. The latest occasion was in 1995 when the sunset clause was extended until 23 January 1999. In part the sunset clause was kept in place because of concerns in the Parliament that the Data-matching Program would not achieve the expected savings and in part as an 
 attempt to allow the Parliament to maintain scrutiny of the Program.</para><para>Madam President, the Data-matching Program has now proven that very substantial savings can be achieved, and the Parliament has been regularly informed of the operation of Program in addition to its deliberations of bills previously introduced to deal with the sunset clause. The Program has become an important feature of the overall social welfare system and one that needs to be given a permanent place in the continuing efforts to maintain and improve that system. In the event that the sunset clause is allowed to come into effect, the loss of savings that could be achieved would be in the order of $560 million over the four years from 1998-99. Accordingly, this bill seeks to remove the sunset clause.</para><para>Madam President, I commend the bill to the Senate.</para><para>Ordered that further consideration of the second reading speech of the bills be adjourned until the first day of the spring sittings 1998, in accordance with standing order 111.</para><para>Ordered that the  Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Amendment Bill 1998  be listed on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline> as a separate order of the day.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE CONSEQUENTIAL AND RELATED MEASURES) BILL 1998</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>3451</page.no><id.no>r454</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title><page.no>3451</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Message received from the House of Representatives acquainting the Senate that the House of Representatives has made the amendments requested by the Senate to the  Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance Consequential and Related Measures) Bill 1998 .</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Third Reading</title><page.no>3451</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newman</inline>) read a third time.</para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (BUDGET AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 1997</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>3451</page.no><id.no>r398</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>3451</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 5 March, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ian Campbell</inline>:</para><para>That this bill be now read a second time.

This bill is much like the raft of this government's bills as they relate to the social security portfolio in that, on the one hand, they give a small amount and, on the other hand, they take away again. I always try to be as positive as I can about the positive aspects of a bill that assists people often in very difficult and dire circumstances, but I always feel a little restrained in my congratulations because it is always balanced with something being taken away.</para></talk.start><para>I would be very pleased to occasionally get up here and debate a bill, particularly in relation to social security, where I could say completely positive things about the piece of legislation. But this will not be the occasion today because it is a bill much in the way of mixed fortunes, particularly for those who have disabled children under the age of 16 years. Senators might recall that the matter of disabled children has been one of some concern already expressed in this chamber, as already this yearâin fact, it may have been late last yearâthere was a major restriction on the access of disabled children to the disabled children's allowance. In fact, the criteria was changed, and we were assured very early on in the negotiations in the debate that it was a change to the criteria to make assessment easier and more certain. But what we found in the end was that the table being proposed by the government meant that a large number of children who had previously accessed that disability payment were no longer able to access it.</para><para>This is pretty much a representative lesson that I have learnt from this government. Whenever change is proposed, in the vast number of occasions what change to the criteria for eligibility means is that fewer people end up being eligible. This government saves money on the backs of the unemployed, the aged, the sick and the disabled. I am constantly reminded every time I see the smiling face of Mr Peter Costello, the Treasurer, talking about the $2.7 billion surplus that the people who paid for that surplus are not people like Mr Costello. They are not like 
 most of the people in this chamber who are on pretty good salaries. It was paid for by the aged, pensioners, the disabled, the ill, those going into nursing homes, those people who were having a pretty hard time of it, those people and those families who are on very limited income. They are the people who paid the pain for the $2.7 billion.</para><para>It is worthwhile remembering when we deal with what appears to be just a few changes in the paragraphs in the legislationâa flick of a penâthat there are real consequences for people out there in the community. We have to always remember that they are real people; they are not people who are disassociated from us. When we are making decisions about social security payments, there will be real human beings whose lives are made a little bit harder if their eligibility is reduced.</para><para>I suppose I should return to the bill that is before us, because there are some positive measures contained in the bill.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>BE4</name.id><name role="metadata">NEWMAN</name><name role="display">Senator Newman</name></talker><para>âThank you.

I know that the minister has been at some pains to point out this measure, and now it is coming through our chamber today. To some extent it allows carers to access the carers pension in slightly broader circumstances. What one of the measures has done is that, where carers their caring activities, they still qualify for the carer payment when they have ceased in their caring activities for 63 daysâa slight increase on the previous 52 days.</para><para>It gives the opportunity for a carer who I think is often under great stress, both emotionally and physically, to take a break. That break can now be up to 63 daysâtwo monthsârather than the previous 52 days. It is now in line with the existing provisions for the child disability allowance, the domiciliary nursing care benefit and the Commonwealth 
 respite programs. Not only do we have a slight increase in the carers entitlementâit is reasonably slight, it is only a further 11 daysâbut also we have achieved the object of all bureaucrats in that we also have a very neat arrangement.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>BE4</name.id><name role="metadata">NEWMAN</name><name role="display">Senator Newman</name></talker><para>âGood administration is not to be derided.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>B36</name.id><name role="metadata">Neal, Sen Belinda</name><name role="display">Senator NEAL</name></talker><para>âAt a meeting yesterday with a group of community people in relation to not social security but child care we were talking about the advantages of certainty, the tyranny of neatness within the bureaucracy and how certainty is important but at the same time it cannot become so overriding that the rules and regulations that apply to real world circumstances become overwhelmingly difficult just because there was a need to make the arrangements neat. For one who has a bit of a tendency to neatness, I think it was a warning that I took on board.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>BE4</name.id><name role="metadata">NEWMAN</name><name role="display">Senator Newman</name></talker><para>âHow is your linen cupboard?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>B36</name.id><name role="metadata">Neal, Sen Belinda</name><name role="display">Senator NEAL</name></talker><para>âI rearranged that just a fortnight ago. We do have to be careful in making everything conform that we do not adversely affect people's circumstances. Some of the positive provisions contained in this bill are set out in schedule 2âand we do support schedule 2.</para></talk.start></continue><para>As I have said, this is a positive part of the bill. It provides for the consistent treatment of lump sum payments under the income test as it relates to carers, and this is regardless of whether the recipient of the lump sum is a pensioner or an allowee. At present, certain lump sums in the nature of income will be averaged over a 52-week period for pensioners, while they may be treated as income for the fortnight of receipt for allowees. It also allows a situation where lump sums which are not exempted will be apportioned over a 52-week period, regardless of the social security payment type.</para><para>The secretary also has a discretion where he or she may exempt certain lump sums which are not periodic payments, leave payments or income from remunerative work. Exempt lump sums are not subject to the ordinary income test, but the assets test and the deem 
 ing rules will apply. The kind of lump sums a secretary may exempt include lottery wins, gifts and that sort of thing.</para><para>I suppose the most positive aspect of schedule 2, if I am  correct, is that carers for disabled children under the age of 16 years are now covered by this particular payment. This is very much a positive thing, and we are very supportive of that move. I suppose the sad thing about it is that it goes hand in hand with the recent restriction of eligibility for the child disability allowance, which occurred earlier in another piece of legislation. I suppose that means also, because of that restriction, the number of people who now will become eligible for the carers allowance under these new provisions will be fewer than before the changes were made in relation to the child disability allowance.</para><para>Schedule 3 is a reasonably positive provision also. It simplifies the treatment of income streams under the income and assets test. It provides for a consistent treatment of income streams based on characteristics, such as the term of the income stream and access to residual capital rather than their source. Basically, that means if you have access to an income stream, even if it is from things that are normally treated differently, they will now be treated consistently. In fact, certain long-term income streams where access to capital is lacking will not be subject to the assets test. Shorter term income streams will be subject to an assets testing.</para><para>There is a negative to all this, despite this government's stated objective of preventing rorting of the systemâand I have to accept their statement in good faith. In fact, looking through the media at some of the investment advertising, you yourself might even see pretty easily that this does occur. People have been able to invest large sums of money in short-term income stream investments and, therefore, have large sums invested but still be able to maintain their social security entitlements. I think most people in the community would accept that that is not particularly desirable.</para><para>On some occasions I have also seen people who carry out these procedures even, in fact, when having invested their money in perhaps 
 more profitable type investments that would have reduced their access to social security payments; in fact, they themselves might have been better off financially even taking into account their social security payments that through their manoeuvring, I suppose you might say, they were able to access. So I suppose it is a good move to prevent this from happening.</para><para>But perhaps the downside is that there will be about 2,100 people who will lose their pensions because of the fact  that they have invested sizeable moneys in certain fixed term superannuation and other schemes. It seems that, when changes are made to catch rorters, there also is always the tendency to catch some genuine people. I suppose I am fearful and concerned, particularly in light of government policy on superannuation taking so long to encourage investment superannuation, that this move could catch some people who are quite genuine.</para><para>Perhaps the minister, when she is on her feet, might want to discuss this matter in some detail. It is of concern to the opposition, and I am certain it is of concern to a lot of people who have invested in those sorts of superannuation schemes already.</para><para>The government now intends, I understand, to move further amendments which will tighten up its proposal. I understand that these amendments are aimed at those who might structure their income stream and investments in such a way that their income varies during the period of investment, with this allowing them to obtain access to social security payments that they might not have accessed if they had invested in a different way. I think most of the community would support preventing people from doing thisâbasically consuming revenue contributed by most taxpayers when in fact such people do have some access to means of support but have managed to structure it in such a way as to take advantage of the rules.</para><para>There is a serious problem with the bill. As I have said before, a positive part of the bill is that carer payments have been extended to those caring for disabled children under the age of 16. But there is a downside to it, and I will try to run through some of the elements 
 briefly in the time that I have allowed to me. It is difficult to see from the available material who will benefit from this proposal. Most who might qualify for the payment under the proposal are already in receipt of the parenting allowance or the special benefit. Possibly the minister could point out who is and what numbers of people are going to be entitled to this payment who were not already entitled to some sort of payment.</para><para>Furthermore, the criteria in respect of under 16 year olds are much more restrictive than the existing criteria for older peopleâthat is, the person who is actually being cared for. The minister might want to explain why anticipated outlays for the measure are just over $1 million a year up to the year 2001, because obviously a million dollars does not represent a great number of people. I suppose that ties in with the questions I raised earlier. Who does get a payment who previously did not receive one? What benefit is there if it is much the same people?</para><para>We understand that there will be only about 100 people eligible for this payment who were not previously eligible for it. Certainly, if this is not the case, I would like to get information about who it is in quite some detail. It seems to me that, if that really is the case, introducing such legislation and publicising it as broadly as obviously it has been publicised really is a two-handed card trick.</para><para>As for those who, under this bill, receive carers payments for people over the age of 16, the disabled people must be severely handicapped for their carers to qualify. The particular person's disability must be such that they require frequent care in connection with bodily functions or require constant supervision to prevent injury to himself, herself or another person. A child under 16 must be profoundly disabled for his or her carer to qualify. I am sure we will have endless debates about this and we will probably have several court cases too. I think most people would accept that `profoundly' is a harder or a more difficult requirement to comply with than `severely', although I suppose the quantum of the difference is probably pretty hard for meâand maybe for the minister as wellâto put.</para><para>I would like to know, and I am sure the rest of the community would like to know, why there is this distinctionâ`severely' or `profoundly'âbetween those people who are under 16 and those people who are over 16. Why make the criteria for carers harder to comply with? Why make it a harsher requirement for those who are under 16 than for those who are over that age? It would seem to me that the effort in caring for a disabled person who is under 16 would, if anything, would be harderâ<inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>3454</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe Senate is currently considering the <inline ref="r398">Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Budget and Other Measures) Bill 1997</inline>  and, as with most social security legislation, the Democrats see this bill as a mix of good and bad. As is often the case, we will be supporting some aspects, opposing some others and seeking to improve other bits.</para></talk.start><para>Starting at the beginning, schedule 1 of the bill will, from 1 July this year, extend qualification for the carer payment to those people caring for a profoundly disabled child under the age of 16. Under the current arrangements, the carer payment is paid to those who provide care for a `severely handicapped person' aged 16 or more, which for a single person is at a maximum rate of $354 per fortnight and for couples is at $295 each per fortnight.</para><para>With those parents with disabled children under the age of 16, previous governments have taken the view that primary responsibility for their children's care lies with the family. There is, of course, the child disability allowance of $75 per fortnight, which is paid to parents whose disabled children require substantially more care and attention than other children of the same age. But this allowance is really meant to assist only with the additional costs that parents with these disabled children incur: it is not intended, as the carer payment is, to provide an adequate income to live off.</para><para>The first schedule of this bill will extend the carer payment to those parents with children under the age of 16 who are `profoundly disabled'. The requirement that the 
 child must be `profoundly disabled' is a much tighter eligibility requirement than applies to the child disability allowance. That reflects the different purposes the government has decided these payments should be designed to meet.</para><para>At the outset, I have to say that the Democrats are very pleased to see the government extending the reach of the carer payment. No doubt all senators will have received letters from people caring either for a disabled child or for an adult. They will know from those letters, from personal experience or contact with people in the community, that caring is very often a 24 hour a day activity for these peopleâan activity which precludes many of them from a level of involvement in society and other types of activity which many of us take for granted.</para><para>It should not be forgotten, and it should be emphasised at every opportunity, that carers make an enormous contribution to society as a whole and the community through their caring role. In doing so they not only contribute a social and community benefit but they also effectively save governments very large amounts of money. The Democrats congratulate the government for moving in this direction. So in relation to this measure we would like to communicate waves of positive affirmation and all those encouraging things one should say when the government does good thingsâbecause it is a positive thing.</para><para>We would, however, have liked to see the government go a little further; that is, we would like to see the eligibility requirements for a profoundly disabled child under this legislation relaxed a little. We do not say this because we feel like making life difficult or spending some more money, but because we feel that under the proposal as put forward by the government there will be some very deserving people who will miss out on the support they so desperately need and who are the type of people whom the Democrats believe this payment is designed to assist. Of the approximate 107,000 disabled children eligible for the child disability allowance, I understand that the parents of about only 450 of them will qualify for the carer payment under this new arrangement. To qualify under 
 the proposed definition a child will have to satisfy three of the conditions set out in section 18A of the bill. I noted the comment in the bills <inline font-style="italic">Alert Digest</inline> that many of these conditions on their own would ensure that the child needs constant care. It is really the requirement for constant care which is probably the principle that underlies what the carer payment is meant to be about. That is not being adequately recognised in this bill.</para><para>This issue has been raised by the Carers Association of Australia in a letter to me, which I imagine they have sent to many other senators. They stated that it was of particular concern to their association that there was a framing of the criterion more in terms of medical conditions and disability than in terms of the need for 24 hour care. They pointed out that constant supervision was not included in any of the qualifying criteria. They were also concerned that under the proposed criteria, children with uncontrolled epilepsy, spina bifida, cystic fibrosis, severe autism or a number of psychiatric illnesses may be excluded from assistance and they would be excluded even where their parents were required to provide round-the-clock care for those children.</para><para>To reiterate, the Democrats do congratulate the government for this reform and this improvement, but we would like to see more disabled children eligible for assistance under these arrangements and we would like to see the focus of eligibility criteria shift a little more towards the level of care that is required for those children. We are also concerned that there is no provision for those families who may have more than one disabled child. In circumstances where no one child necessarily meets the requirements for a profoundly disabled child but the care needs of the family are equal to or greater than if they had a single profoundly disabled child, the Democrats feel they should be eligible for the carer payment, again because of the aim and purpose the payment is intended to address. This is a principle which the government recognised late last year in relation to the child disability allowance and we believe it applies equally in this situation.</para><para>Another issue raised by the Carers Associationâand I believe it is a very valid oneâis that, despite the best intentions of legislative drafters, there will always be people who fall through the cracks. That is a hazard of the trade in trying to frame legislation for the social security area in particular. What the Carers Association suggested is some discretion for the department to deem eligible for assistance a family who, while not meeting the prescribed requirements for assistance in terms of the black and white letter which always needs to end up in legislation, are nevertheless in their particular circumstances clearly manifestly deserving of such support. The Democrats would support enabling some discretion for the department to assist people who quite clearly are in need despite the fact that the requirements as outlined in the black and white letter of the law do not necessarily enable them to fit into the appropriate pigeonhole. I indicate now that the issues I have raised in relation to the schedule will be ones that I will pursue in the committee stage.</para><para>Finally in relation to the schedule, the Democrats welcome the fact that this bill will allow a person to cease caring for a caree for up to 63 days in any one calendar year and still receive their carer payment. Whilst this is a low budget item in terms of outlaysâcosting only about $80,000 a yearâthe benefit this measure will bring to the people affected will be enormous. The Democrats fully support this part of the bill.</para><para>On the same theme, I would like to take the opportunity to congratulate the minister for this year's budget announcement that the carer payment will continue to be paid for up to 63 days when the person receiving care is temporarily in hospital. Again, not a terribly big budget item but for those people it is aimed at it will provide much needed relief to carers, who I again wish to acknowledge and emphasise do play a very important role.</para><para>The next schedule of the bill I want to comment on is that relating to the introduction of new means testing arrangements for income streams. From 20 September this year the government aims to change the way income streams are means tested. The proposed system will be based on the character 
 istics of the income stream itself rather than, for example, where the income stream was paid from. It is without question that the current means testing of these retirement products is often contradictory and, in some cases, just totally inadequate. It is fairly difficult to understand as well, but these are the things we have to wrestle with in our important role as legislators. The current system is contradictory in the sense that what are effectively very similar products can be subject to very different means testing and subsequently have widely varying effects on the level of payment someone receives from the department. It is inadequate in the sense that some products on the market have been clearly specifically designed by financial institutions and advisers to take advantage of loopholes in the current system.</para><para>As an example of this, some time back a financial adviser drew the attention of the Democrats to the fact that some people were making use of rolling annuities to avoid the assets test. That meant that very large sums of money could be placed into these products and, due to the depletion method employed to assess these products, these funds were effectively exempted from the social security assets test. So, by simply rolling over these products every 12 months, people maintained their fundsâwe are talking about hundreds of thousands of dollars hereâand were drawing a pension from the public purse. In the type of targeted social security system that we have very much moved towards, that is something that is clearly a problem.</para><para>The explanatory memorandum to this bill lists a number of other mechanisms being used by people, with the assistance of their financial advisers, to circumvent the intention of the current legislation. These types of products dramatically dilute the effectiveness of the income and assets testing regime set out under the legislation. The effect of that is that the Department of Social Security is forced to change the rules to cover those loopholes. That is what we are seeing in this bill before the Senate today. Regrettably, that means that those people who have purchased their retirement products totally in good faith and within the intention of the legislation may 
 be subject to an upheaval in their retirement plans. That is always something that should be avoided if at all possible.</para><para>The Democrats acknowledge that the system proposed in the bill before us today is a comprehensive overhaul of the income and assets testing regime applying to retirement income stream products. As I said, we recognise that the way in which the current system is being manipulated is not a situation which could be allowed to continue, particularly because of the targeted nature of the social security system that we have.</para><para>The Democrats have always been very reluctant to support legislation which may alter the social security entitlements of those who have already purchased their retirement income products. For the reasons that I have just outlined, however, we accept that basically the government had little option but to introduce changes. We believe the proposed system represents a significant improvement on the way in which retirement income streams are treated under the social security means tests. So, once again, the Democrats indicate positive affirmation of the government's intentions and aims in this area. We will be supporting the introduction of the system proposed in schedule 3 of this bill.</para><para>There is, however, one group of social security recipients we believe should be exempted from this system, that is, those who purchased their allocated pensions or annuities prior to 1 July 1992. These people were exempted back in 1994, when the current system was introduced, for the reasons that I have just outlined. We believe they should continue to be exempted. Again, that is a measure that we will revisit in the committee stage of this debate.</para><para>The final aspect of the bill that the Democrats would like to mention is the changes proposed in schedule 4 which relate to seasonal workers. The government's stated aim of this schedule is twofold. Firstly, it is to prevent high income seasonal and contract workers from immediately accessing unemployment payments during the off-season or between contracts. This includes such workers as tuna fishers, fruit pickers, shearers, casual teachers and people who perform locum roles 
 in various jobs. Clearly, this will have a significant impact on a number of workers, particularly in rural and regional areas. Secondly, the government's aim is to exclude higher paid casual or contract workers who have their leave entitlements cashed out in their salary from receiving newstart over Christmas shutdowns.</para><para>The bill itself provides a fairly broad definition of the type of work that will be caught by this legislation. In addition, it contains a power for the secretary to deem certain work to be seasonal work. The effect of the legislation will be that seasonal workers whose wage in the past six months was greater than average weekly earnings will need to serve a waiting period before qualifying for social security payments. The length of that waiting period will be determined by the amount they earned: the higher the earnings, the longer the wait for payments.</para><para>This proposed change is based on the notion that any person earning in excess of average weekly earnings should have put away funds in case of future unemployment or to cover future lack of employment income. In other words, they are expected to undertake some sort of personal unemployment insurance. This premise will apply regardless of any factors which might have prevented the person saving at that time and completely ignores their current financial circumstances.</para><para>The Democrats believe that this is just another in a string of enforced poverty measures we have seen over the past few yearsâindeed, stretching back a number of years now. The aim of many of these measures is to force people to run down any savings they might have before they are able to obtain any assistance from social security. We need to emphasise, when we look at these sorts of measures, that unemployment payments are paid at a rate well below the poverty line and that the average length of unemployment is currently well over 52 weeks. That means that unemployed people really need to be able to maintain some level of savings to see them through until they rejoin the work force, otherwise we really are looking at enforced poverty. The Democrats have great concerns 
 that that will be the impact of this measure on many people.</para><para>There is a current system of waiting periods, including a liquid assets test which is fairly tight and fairly stringent. The Democrats believe that these measures are more than sufficient to ensure that only those needing assistance are eligible. Indeed, we would say that, in some instances, the waiting and preclusion periods that exist are too harsh. To add an extra measureâas this schedule of the bill proposes to doâwill, we believe, compound the unfairness and injustice that some people will be subject to. It is important to emphasise that the existing liquid assets test imposes a waiting period of up to 13 weeksâthat is, three monthsâon those people who have easy access to any significant level of assets. That already exists under the current legislation.</para><para>There has been a lot of talk lately about ways to remove poverty traps that affect many low income earners. To the Democrats, this is a very important issue in the tax debate as a whole and in the social security legislation, yet this measure increases the pressures on unemployed people to run down their savings. It also increases the pressure on people in terms of those poverty traps.</para><para>We need to encourage people to try to get out of situations rather than, every time they do get a bit of a chance to build up a few reserves and move out of welfare dependencyâand this is constantly identified as a major problemâthey are dragged back down again by measures such as this. For those reasons, the Democrats will not be supporting schedule 4 of this bill which tries to introduce that measure.</para><para>Nonetheless, in closing, I should re-emphasise, so that I do not finish on a negative note, the support of the Democrats for many of the positive measures that this bill does introduce and indicate our thanks to the government for their work in modifying the social security system to more adequately address the existing needs of people out in the community.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>3458</page.no><name role="metadata">West, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator WEST</name><name.id>1X4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe <inline ref="r398">Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Budget and 
 Other Measures) Bill 1997</inline>  is a bit like the curate's egg: there are some parts that are good; there are some parts that are bad. I have concerns about part of schedule 3 in relation to income stream terms of over five years and under five years. I just wonder, with this government encouraging older people to stay at work until they are 70 years of age, what the actuaries might be advising some people to do with their investments when they actually retire at age 70. What are they saying about the five-year period?</para></talk.start><para>Our life span, according to the <inline font-style="italic">Bible</inline>, is three score and 10, which is 70. Seventy-five is beginning to nudge up into an area where people are dying at a faster rate. I wonder what the actuaries may well have to say about that particular requirement. I recognise the need to ensure that people invest wisely and that their investment is not going to be able to take advantage of what may be loopholes but I also would not like to see people disadvantaged if, at age 70 when they retire, they may well have an illness that is not going to see them live more than five years and they might be better off making a certain type of investment which gets trapped under this. I urge the government to look very carefully at that particular issue.</para><para>The piece that I want to concentrate on is the payments to carers of those under and over the age of 16. I think extending the carers payment is a great idea, I think that increasing the amount is a great idea and I think that increasing the number of days that a person can be away from the person they are caring for is also to be commended. But I have major problems with some of the definitions here. Over 16 years of age a person has to be severely handicapped for the carer to qualify. A person's disability must be such that they require frequent care in connection with their bodily functions or require constant supervision to prevent injury to themselves or to another person.</para><para>Under the age of 16, in this bill, they must be profoundly disabled for the carer to qualify. I am having difficulty seeing the logic in the differentiation of the definition between the two ages. I know that someone is likely to tell me, `We have improved the child 
 disability allowance and those people who cannot get the carers support pension will be able to qualify for the child disability allowance,' but with the restrictions on and the tightening up of the child disability allowance there are going to be people who will miss out altogether.</para><para>I am getting quite a number of calls to my office from parents who have children with quite severe disabilities or illnesses and who are now finding, because the child has hit the magic age of six, seven or whatever, that they are coming off that allowance. These are children who require a lot of supervision, assistance, actual administration of medication and things like that. But this government has knocked them off.	So the difference between severe and profound disability is a major concern. Those in the industryânot the departmentâof the provision of care to people and diagnosis of people with severe and profound illnesses will tell you that there is quite a significant difference.</para><para>I have also major concerns that under the bill the disability that will give rise to a child's parents being eligible for the allowance for a profoundly disabled child must have three of the following seven specific circumstances: the child must be tube fed, the child has a tracheotomy, the child requires a ventilator for at least eight hours a day, the child has urinary and faecal incontinence, the child cannot stand without support, the child's condition is terminal and palliative care has replaced active treatment, the child requires personal care on at least two occasions between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m.</para><para>There are many children who are terminally ill who require palliative care who do not fit into any one of those other categories at the stage when they are transferred from active care to palliative care. They may well have faecal and urinary incontinence when they are very close to their death and they may also not be able to stand without support very close to the time of their death but there are many children around with terminal illnesses on palliative care who do not fit into another two of those criteria.</para><para>But the smaller those children are, the more love, care, attention, support and affection 
 they require from their parents or carer. They might not require to be fed, they might well be able to toilet themselves, they might well be able to walk around as their condition enables them; what their needs are are more the spiritual and tender loving care needs than the active hands-on medical model. This is very much the medical model. This does not take cognisance of the psychological needs of a child or the family, or the spiritual needs of that child. I have a grave concern about it, as I have said.</para><para>What about a child, for example, who has severe epilepsy not well controlled by medication and who requires supervision? They may, during an epileptic seizure, actually have faecal or urinary incontinence, but they do not require tube feeding, they do not require a tracheotomy, they do not require ventilation, they cannot standâhaving an epileptic fit you are not supposed to be standing anyway. But they do not have a terminal illness and they do not require personal care each day at 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. What about that child? That carer is not going to be eligible, from my reading of the bill, and that is a major concern to me.</para><para>What about children with severe psychiatric conditions who require constant supervision to stop them from harming themselves or from harming others? It would appear to me, as I said, that this is very much the medical model. It is not the holistic model of health that should be being taken into consideration here; it is very much the physical, medical model. Those within the mental health stream might well feel that this is a further indication of discrimination against those with a mental health problem.</para><para>To people who tell me that these diseases do not occur in children, then I say to them, `That is rubbish! I have cared for children. I have had children in my clinic that I have had to care for who had these disorders or I had to support the parents.' I know that they are rare, but I have had a small child in my clinic who had a disorder so that she was self- destructive. The inside of her mouth was constantly ulcerated where she kept biting it. She kept biting her limbs that she could get to her mouth. I forget the name of the disease, 
 but it was a diagnosed disease and she was self-destructive.</para><para>She could feed herself; she did not require a tracheotomy; she did not require ventilation; she was not incontinent of faeces or urine; she could stand without supportâafter she was a baby and had learned to walk. She did not have a terminal illness and require palliative care. She did not require personal attention between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m., but she required constant supervision to see that she did not injure herself. It is quite probable that by the time she hit the age of 16 or 17âif she lived that long; if she had not damaged herself permanently and irreparably and killed herselfâshe would have automatically gone onto a disability support pension.

We were not the ones who tightened up considerably the child disability allowance. We are not the ones who are claiming millions of dollars in savings in that particular area.</para></talk.start></continue><para>But I have a grave concern for this because this is an area that I have worked in. This is an area for which I have had responsibility in a professional capacity. Whilst these are not a great number of people, for the families that are involved it is a huge problem. They have major problems to overcome. They require a lot of support and that is something that this is not going to give them. They often have to give up employment so that they can care for their child. I have major concerns about this type of thing.</para><para>It is wonderful that the government has put in this offer, but I do not think it has thought through the groups that are going to be most adversely affected and the groups that might well be left out of the coverage of this legislation. Maybe it is because people have not thought it through properly. For children with terminal illness, during the last few weeks or months of a child's life the family want to be able to be with that child. People would prefer to have their children at home rather than in hospital. But I wonder, because of this, how many are not going to be able to be cared for at home that could have been cared for at home? That is something of major concern and worry to me.</para><para>I am sorry if the minister does not like what I am saying. I am sorry if she thinks I have missed the point completely, but this is a group of people that, if you are going to start to provide a service to one, you have to provide it to all. Given that they have already 
 made access to the child disability allowance more difficult, there is going to be a group that used to get some support who now will be getting no support. The opposition will certainly be looking to move an amendment to tighten up those differing definitions because they are of major concern to us.</para><para>That covers my major concerns with this bill. Some of it does simplify and improve the provisions dealing with hardship rules applying to income maintenance periods and makes them apply to proposed seasonal work and preclusion periods. As I said, please do not think that this bill is something we totally disagree with.

As a result of those consultations, it has been decided that these age related criteria should be extended to include not only a child who is under the age specified in a criterion, but also a child who has the care needs specified and who will not reach the relevant developmental milestone by the specified age. For example, in relation to a child standing without support, qualification would be extended to cover children who are under the age of two and unable to stand without support and who are expected to be unable to stand without support at the age of two.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>3462</page.no><name role="metadata">Neal, Sen Belinda</name><name role="display">Senator NEAL</name><name.id>B36</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI move:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	 Subparagraph 18A(2)(c)(iv), omit "urinary and faecal" (wherever occurring), substitute "urinary or faecal".</para><para>There was some discussion earlier today during the second reading debate about the concern the opposition had about the restrictive definition for children under the age of 16 years. In fact, the terminology was `profoundly disabled' rather than `severely handicapped', which is the definition for those who are over this age of 16 years.</para><para>The government did go on to define what `profoundly' means. It requires at least three of very specific criteria to be met. Frankly, each of them in themselves is pretty severe: the child must be tube fed; the child has a tracheotomy; the child requires a ventilator for at least eight hours a day; the child has urinary and faecal incontinence; the child cannot stand without support; the child's condition is terminal and palliative care has replaced active treatment; and the child requires personal care on at least two occasions between 6 p.m. and 6 a.m. each day.</para><para>Each of those is pretty severe, but under this definition it is required that three of these be met before the carer is entitled to this allowance. I suppose that is why I said at the beginning that, while we welcomed the introduction of this payment, it was pretty paltry as far as it went. For a child to have three of those seven thingsâeach of them, in my view, requiring fairly strenuous and all-encompassing careâis a bit too severe in the circumstances.</para><para>The amendments proposed by the government broaden those criteria in a very minor way and extend them a little. Under their definition, a child under three who is incontinent does not come within that criterion, but their request slightly broadens it by saying that if it is expected that the child will be incontinent after threeâeven though the child is under three at the momentâthen that criterion is fulfilled. With regard to their request No. 3, under their definition, if you have to get up on at least two occasions between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. and the child is under six, you do not come within the last criterion. They have slightly broadened it so that, even if the child is under six at the time, 
 if it is expected that once they are over six the carer will have to get up to them on at least two occasions between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. each day, then that criterion is fulfilled.</para><para>Of course, it is not sufficient that a child complies with one of those criteria: they must also comply with two others. So, having achieved one of the two matters set out in amendments 2 and 3, it does not necessarily mean that the person caring for them will qualify for this particular payment that is being provided by the government.</para><para>Our amendment to the government's request again is quite minute. In the fourth criterion, where it refers to the child having `urinary and faecal incontinence', the word `and' is replaced with `or', so in fact the child fulfils the criteria by being incontinent in only one of those regards rather than requiring them to be incontinent in regard to both aspects.</para><para>As I said, we are in agreement with the government's amendments, but we say that really does not take us very far.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>3463</page.no><name role="metadata">Newman, Sen Jocelyn</name><name role="display">Senator NEWMAN</name><name.id>BE4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Social Security</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI recognise that the opposition would like us to extend the definition of the profoundly disabled childâand we will come to their other amendments soon.

They are intended to extend the criteria for those children under the age of 16 in some small way; that is, in relation to request No. 1, that the words `continuous personal care' be replaced by the words `constant supervision which is substantially greater than that required by a child of the same age who does not have a disability'.</para><para>As you can see, there may be a child who does require a great deal of supervision, but it may not be required continuously, at every moment. Essentially, what is required by the bill as it is presently drafted is for continuous 
 personal careâfor the carer to be in attendance at every moment. We believe that is too much and that the option we proposed is a more reasonable and, I suppose, middle ground in terms of the requirements.</para><para>Presently, under proposed subsection 18A(2), the child who is being cared for must satisfy at least three out of seven matters, and they are the matters I read out in the debate on the earlier amendment. Request No. 2 adds to the list a further circumstance in relation to children who require substantially greater assistance with feeding because of their disability. It does not change the fact that you are still required to satisfy three criteria, but it adds an eighth element to the list of mattersâthat is, that the children require substantially greater assistance with feeding as a result of their circumstances.</para><para>Request No. 3, again, slightly changes subsection 18A(2). It adds a further circumstance againâso that would be a ninth circumstance, of which three must be satisfiedâand that is a general discretion to treat other circumstances as relevant. As we know, in drafting legislation, even though we may try to cover every possible criteria, there may in fact be some criteria that have not been thought of, that the minister or the department has not turned their minds to, that may actually have a very major impact on whether full-time care is required.

Remember, if you had wanted to do this, you had 13 years in which to do it. I want to quickly put on the record just what the situation is. Your amendments would result in the measure losing its focus on assisting families in high-level caring situations. They would open the measures to a broad range of customers for whom it was not designed. Your three additional criteria will result in parents and carers of children with moderate disabilities entering the program, whereas the initiative is designed to capture families providing intensive or palliative care.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The three criteria you are proposing will result in the payment being available to carers of children with moderate conditions, such as behavioural disorders including attention deficit disorder or oppositional defiant disorder. Children with these conditions, for example, may require substantial assistance with feeding, substantial supervision and extra attention in other functional areas such as communication, mobility, self-care skills, social and community skills. But the needs of children with disabilities such as these, when compared with the needs of children requiring intensive care for conditions such as dumping syndrome, are significantly less.</para><para>I want to give you an example of what this is really about. A nine-year-old child suffers from dumping syndromeâan extremely rare medical condition which results in her receiving insufficient nourishment from normal meals. She needs to be fed constantly, 24 hour a day, via a tube direct into her large intestine. She requires constant monitoring, as inconsistencies in feeding will result in unstable blood sugar levels and a risk of becoming comatose if untreated. The child is able to survive approximately 40 minutes without receiving formula. She also suffers from urinary incontinence and severe constipation, requiring daily enemas and other 
 medications. The child also requires several other medications each day.</para><para>In their caring role, the parents need to check and record their daughter's blood sugar levels constantly, they need to load and calibrate the formula pumps and monitor the tube at all times to prevent kinks and blockages. The jejunostomy site must be cleaned and cared for. The child's baths need to be strongly supervised so as not to dislodge the tubes. The administration of the enema, and bathing and cleaning of the tubes and surrounding areas require both parents. Night-time care is monitored by an alarm attached to the formula dispensing pump as well as via a baby monitor. On any given night, the parents may be required to attend to the child on up to 12 occasions.</para><para>That is the kind of profoundly disabled person we are talking about. That is why I am concerned that you are diminishing a very important measure. You are jeopardising a very important measure by opening it up to families which do not have the same disabilities to contend with. The reason for my concern is that your amendments would add at least $36 million per year to the cost of the measure, compared with the current estimated cost of $1 million. You are potentially including something like 16,000 extra families because of your amendmentsâthat is what you will do.

If you are describing someone who requires supervision at the level set out in our amendment and assistance with feeding but who must also 
 comply with the criteria that presently exists, I do not believe that that is moderate. In my view, just one of the conditions set out here would certainly be in the community's mind much more than a moderate disability.

On the last occasion when I tracked down some information given like that, I was told eventually, after pursuing it for some time, that it was based on evidence provided by the department on an anecdotal basis and that they could not really disclose it because of privacy.

In preparing the costing, the department analysed the responses for those functional domains which correspond most closely to the additional criteria proposed in the opposition amendments. The assumption is that, for a child to be classified as requiring substantial additional assistance or supervision in a particular domainâfor example, feedingâthe parent would indicate 
 that their child has a significant deficit in that domain.</para><para>In regard to your amendment that the child needs substantially more assistance with feeding than that required by a child of the same age who does not have a disability, 35 per cent of parents surveyed reported that their child was at least one descriptor behind in self-care skills, including feeding and meal time skills. In relation to your amendment about a child requiring constant supervision which is substantially greater than that required by a child of the same age who does not have a disability to prevent injury to himself or herself, or to another person or to property, 49 per cent of parents surveyed reported that their child had one of the behavioural descriptors in the assessment tool and 34 per cent reported that their child had two of the descriptors.</para><para>In regard to your amendment that any other circumstances which in the opinion of the secretary indicates that the child needs substantially more care or attention than a child of the same age who does not have a disability, 31 per cent of parents surveyed reported that their child was at least one descriptor behind in receptive communication skills, 30 per cent of parents surveyed reported that their child was at least one descriptor behind in expressive communication skills, 30 per cent of parents surveyed reported that their child was at least one descriptor behind in social and community skills, and 12 per cent of parents surveyed reported that their child was at least one descriptor behind in mobility skills.</para><para>As a result of those findings, it is estimated that, under the proposed amendments that the opposition and the Democrats are bringing forward today, at least 30 per cent of the current child disability allowance population of 120,000 would be eligible for carer payment, and based on CDA experience 50 per cent of them would satisfy the income and assets test. Therefore, the proposed extensions to eligibility would potentially open up the carer payment to an additional 18,000 carers of profoundly disabled children under 16 years of age. Multiplying the expected population by the unit cost of the current meas 
 ureâthat is, $1 million divided by 500 recipientsâgives an estimate of a total program cost of $36 million.

For example, parents who are on a special benefit are not getting the benefit of a pensioner concession card. As you would know, that card opens up a lot of opportunities for people to reduce their living costs. Also, when two parents are involved in this total care, there is the potential for two carer payments.

As I outlined in my speech in the second reading debate, schedule 3 of the bill deals with the new system of means testing for the various retirement income stream products. The existing system of assessment for allocated pensions and annuities was introduced back in 1994. When that bill was debated, a majority of the Senate voted to exempt those people who had purchased their allocated 
 pensions or annuities prior to 1 July 1992, which was the date of the then government's security and retirement statement on superannuation which included the new means test treatment of those pensions. As such, the pre-1992 treatment of allocated pensions and annuities has applied to these people for many years now. The Democrat amendments Nos 1 through 5 standing in my name are simply designed to maintain that exemption; that is, those people will continue to be treated the way they have been for the past six years or more. I understand that there are only about 1,000 people involved here.</para><para>While it does retain a bit of an anomaly, if you like, and different people will come out ahead or behind in relation to the new treatment for pre-1992 people, the basic principle that was applied when the Senate originally considered this back in 1994 of people having a consistent understanding of how their pensions, annuities or retirement incomes are arranged is an important one and where possible we should seek to maintain the way that people's income arrangements are treated.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>3471</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThere are some remarks I do want to make about this because this measure will impact significantly on an unknown number of peopleâI would like the minister to give me a best estimate. I certainly believe that thousands of retirees will be classified as self-funded retirees on a part pension. The effect of it is retrospective. I have two letters from people who are retired: one person is aged 71 and the other, the President of Australian Pensioners League, is in his 80s. The difficulty with this measure is that it forces people to unravel their retirement income stream purchases. I would like to know the number who will be required to unravel. Secondly, Minister, could you give us a precise estimate of the savings the government believes will result from this measure?</para></talk.start><para>Minister, I also draw your attention to an answer you gave last week in respect of self-funded retirees. You were stressing in the answer to that question that, in respect of the health card issue, self-funded retirees who had struggled and saved and put money aside during their working lives to encourage thrift 
 were being rewarded for that. Here we have a similar category of people in their retirement yearsâthe people who have contacted me are in their 70s and 80sâwho are being forced to unravel long-term retirement income contracts by the changes you are imposing.</para><para>The two particular concerns are, firstly, there is a cost to unravelling agreed legal documents in respect of the purchase of income stream products. I understand it may be $1,000 or $2,000, depending on the type of contractual agreement that is being entered into.</para><para>Secondly, why should people who were given an assurance in 1992âadmittedly, you could say by the former Labor governmentâabout the long-term nature of a retirement income product now be required to unravel those arrangements in their retirement years? These are people who have been thrifty and who have savedâpeople that you, Minister, have acknowledged have been very responsible. This certainly has caused considerable outrage amongst a sector of the retirement community.</para><para>Very briefly, because we are under time constraints, I want to put on the record some correspondence from a Mr Sydney Horne. He maintains that the government's `new broom' approach, which is supposed to sweep away all so-called anomalies, is fanciful. He said:</para><para>The stated aims of the government are to encourage private saving to ensure that superannuation and other savings are directed towards providing retirement income.</para><para>But the reality for Mr Horne is that he will have to unravel his retirement product, his retirement arrangements. It is effectively a retrospective unravelling. I understand Mr Horne wrote to you, Minister. He has forwarded to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation copies of the correspondence. He was not very impressed with the response. He maintains, and I certainly agree with him, that the effect of this is retrospective. It will affect aged pensioners. He believes that in his case he will lose one-third of his income from a product that he purchased eight years ago. You can understand people's concernâparticularly a person who is aged, retired and has done the right thingâthat they will lose 
 one-third of their income and will have to seek financial advice at a cost. This reminds me somewhat of the issues we debated last year with the deeming of superannuation when a person reaches age 55. Harsh outcomes have been the result of that government measure.</para><para>I know we are under a time constraint, and I very much regret that because this is a change that will, I believe, adversely affect many thousands of retirees. They will have a great deal of worry and concern imposed on them by what I believe is a very harsh and unjust measure.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>LI4</name.id><name role="metadata">PATTERSON</name><name role="display">Senator Patterson</name></talker><para>âI hope you don't join your colleagues and undertake a scaremongering campaign.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>BE4</name.id><name role="metadata">NEWMAN</name><name role="display">Senator Newman</name></talker><para>âWhen he knows the facts he won't.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name></talker><para>âI will take those interjections.

 here and purport to discuss this measure in those terms. The opposition was very thoroughly briefed on this measure. I understood that they were supportive of it. I certainly know that this measure was not introduced lightly before there had been long consultation with the retirement industry and with retirees. I also understand that there is considerable support for this measure because of the need to make this a clearer area. There needs to be a more logical basis on which people can assess how they will be affected by social security depending on the productânot the sort of dog's breakfast that we have had.</para></talk.start><para>I will get to some hard facts, Senator, because obviously you were not briefed. But Ms Macklin, the spokesperson, was briefed. This is what the impact of the changes is estimated to be in the first year. This is, of course, the crucial year, because it is the year that affects people who are already in these forms of income stream. It affects these people more than it affects people who will come on board in years to come.</para><para>In the first year, 40,200 customers will receive a pension increase, 16,000 customers will have their rate of pension reduced if they do not take other action, and 2,100 customers will have their pensions cancelled. But 270,000 customers with income stream products will not be affected by the proposalâmostly those with defined benefit income streams. Customers most likely to be adversely affected by the new rules are those who are using loopholes, such as those people with fixed term superannuation pensions. Most will now have their investment included in the assets test, whereas currently all these products are assets test exempt. Those with annuities with terms of five years or less will now be subject to deeming rules and they will no longer receive the benefit of a full year's reduction in asset value at the commencement of their term.</para><para>There are also very strong arguments against allowing a saving provision for these products because, given that allocated pensions can be commuted at any time, a person could adjust their investments and take out an income stream that is assets test exempt. 
 Some of the main beneficiaries of savings provisions would be people who could either fully or partly provide for themselves in retirement but who are taking advantage of a loophole which allows an assets test exemption to access an age pension or a higher rate of payment.</para><para>While some may lose their asset test exemption, the income test treatment of allocated pensions will be more generous than under current arrangements, given the use of purchase price as the deduction. If they are subject to a saving provision, this group of people will miss out on the more generous income test. The depleted asset value, as at 20 September 1998, will be used for calculating the impact of the assets test and, given that these products will have been operating for at least six years, the assets value will be substantially depleted in most cases. The assets test may, in fact, have no impact on them given the depleted asset value.</para><para>Importantly, the ministerial exemption power is available to assist those people who are financially disadvantaged by the new arrangements and who cannot rearrange their affairs without a significant penalty. That is not something new: there are certain circumstances in the social security legislationâa very restricted range of areas, I admitâwhere the minister does have an exemption power. This would be one of them. Where people could not rearrange their affairs without facing a significant penalty I would be committed to assisting them. But it would be difficult to justify saving provisions which are isolated to those products. It could generate a call for arrangements in place before 20 September this year to be saved.</para><para>Administratively, the saving provisions would also be very complicated, I am advised. Revised running costs would have to be sought to enable Centrelink to run parallel systems to administer both the current and the new means testing arrangements. So I do suggest to Senator Bartlett that there is a better way of achieving what he would like to achieve through his amendment to save the pre-1992 people.

I understand we will be supporting the measure but it is a very difficult measure to support, given that you are playing off the fact that 40,200 people get an increase andâyou have acknowledged this for the record and for the purposes of this debateâ16,000 people will have their retirement incomes reduced.

I quoted from page 21 of the budget paper which talks about their having a contract that cannot be broken or where significant penalties would apply for changing the current contract.

She seemed to be implying that, in one case, the opposition indicated support then there was some change of position. I stated in the second reading debate, and our position is unchanged, that we are supportive of the general thrust of these overall changes in taking account of income streams. But that does not necessarily mean that we are not amenable to the needs of a small group of people, the pre-1992 people, who had allocated pensions and annuities. First, it is relatively defined and small group. Secondly, when it was agreed at the time in 
 1992 to exempt that group of people, there was general agreement, I am advised, from all parties including us while we were in government and, I believe the coalitionâthe present government. Maybe the minister would like to enlighten us on that. You mentioned a number of figures, Minister. As I understand it, they relate to the whole raft of changes. We would be very interested to know the cost of the amendment before us now that was moved by the Democrats, not the amount of money involved in the entire schedule.</para></talk.start><para>Progress reported.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Sitting suspended from 11.53 a.m. to 12.45 p.m.</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>AUSTRALIAN PRUDENTIAL REGULATION AUTHORITY BILL 1998</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>3475</page.no><id.no>r465</id.no><cognate><cognateinfo><title>AUTHORISED DEPOSIT-TAKING INSTITUTIONS SUPERVISORY LEVY IMPOSITION BILL 1998</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>r466</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate><cognate><cognateinfo><title>AUTHORISED NON-OPERATING HOLDING COMPANIES SUPERVISORY LEVY IMPOSITION BILL 1998</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>r467</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate><cognate><cognateinfo><title>SUPERANNUATION SUPERVISORY LEVY IMPOSITION BILL 1998</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>r481</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate><cognate><cognateinfo><title>RETIREMENT SAVINGS ACCOUNT PROVIDERS SUPERVISORY LEVY IMPOSITION BILL 1998</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>r479</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate><cognate><cognateinfo><title>LIFE INSURANCE SUPERVISORY LEVY IMPOSITION BILL 1998</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>r475</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate><cognate><cognateinfo><title>GENERAL INSURANCE SUPERVISORY LEVY IMPOSITION BILL 1998</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>r473</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate><cognate><cognateinfo><title>FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS SUPERVISORY LEVIES COLLECTION BILL 1998</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>r469</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate><cognate><cognateinfo><title>FINANCIAL SECTOR REFORM (AMENDMENTS AND TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS) BILL 1998</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>r471</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate><cognate><cognateinfo><title>PAYMENT SYSTEMS (REGULATION) BILL 1998</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>r477</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate></debateinfo></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>FINANCIAL SECTOR (SHAREHOLDINGS) BILL 1998</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>3475</page.no><id.no>r462</id.no><cognate><cognateinfo><title>FINANCIAL SECTOR REFORM (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 1998</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>s161</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate></debateinfo><para>Consideration resumed from 28 May.</para><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>In Committee</title><page.no>3475</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>AUSTRALIAN PRUDENTIAL REGULATION AUTHORITY BILL 1998</para><para>The bill.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>3475</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI table four supplementary explanatory memoranda relating to government amendments and requests to be moved to the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority Bill 1998 and six related bills.

By dint of those far-reaching powers, it has major ramifications at a national, international and regional level.</para></talk.start><para>I would first like to start by finding out from the government how it plans to counter the likely impact of some of the measures in this package, particularly the question of banks and consolidation. Small towns in particular in regional Australia are losing their banking services. This is coming on top of losing their Medicare offices and CES offices, albeit supposedly replaced by this new and better service which we have seen on advertisements on the television. Despite this new and better service, my colleague, Senator West, has asked question this week about office closures, lack of access and all the impacts that are currently being felt in the regional centres. Telstra offices and railway stations have closed in regional centres and now there are the government's plans for Australia Post. Regional Australia is getting a raw deal out of this government. Once this 
 bill is agreed to and passed by the Senate almost certainly regional banking operations will be taken away.</para><para>This bill needs to address that and I am hoping the government can quieten fears of the people of regional Australia about the impact of this bill. It will allow big banks which are making huge profits to close down their banking services, introduce more ATMs and reduce personalised services and access to the banking services that regional Australia needs.</para><para>In today's <inline font-style="italic">Herald Sun</inline> there are examples of women in particular being robbed at ATMs. It happens in the city all the time but, as there are fewer opportunities for access to banking services in country centres, one can expect to see the same sorts of problems compounding. Those are the real world impacts on ordinary Australians in regional centres; not airy-fairy impacts such as better competition or impacts on the global market and international financing.</para><para>The government has an opportunity today to tell us how this measure of reforms, as it calls them, will address that issue. I hope that that will be part of the discussion today with Senator Ian Campbell and that he can reassure us that regional Australia will not suffer just because the government has a cosy deal going with the banks and the Wallis group. Also, just because the Wallis committee said that there are a lot of economic efficiency gains to be made by these proposals, I hope that the government is not wedded to this `free market at all costs' approach and has no role to play.</para><para>I hope we are in a position where Senator Ian Campbell and the government will explain the benefits to us and how regional Australia will benefit from losing its banking services. As I said, it has already lost its Medicare offices, CES offices and its Telstra centres, and the loss of its post offices is to come. I hope that the government is in a position to explain that to the Senate.</para><para>I was lucky enough last week to be at a speech given by the Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank. He talked about his concerns about the trend towards self-regulation and away from what can be called black-letter regulationâthat is, parliamentary legislation, 
 to the laissez faire approach. He cited a number of examples around the world where countries have given up sovereignty and the capacity to influence their own economies by opening up without question to the world financiers.</para><para>This package of bills is in that vein. It is about self-regulation rather than black-letter regulation. It is about allowing flows in and out. It talks about foreign ownership and how foreigners can come in and buy our banks. Banks are very important strategic national institutions. They have a very important role to play in making sure that we control our own destiny, that we are not captive to interests in the US, or interests in Japan, or interests in Europe. Wallis is gung-ho, open slather, throw open the doors, let's have everybody in, irrespective of the consequences.</para><para>Last week, Dr Neville, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank, ran up a bit of a flag to say, `Well, just a minute. There are consequences in allowing that sort of untrammelled access.' He talked about the impact that the untrammelled flows have had in Asia. That is a large part of what has gone on. He was very concerned about the number of capital movements that are short-term, not long-term productive investmentâjust in, a bit of speculation and out. He was flagging that the Reserve Bank of Australia believes that an untrammelled throw-open-the-gates approach is the wrong one. That is the view of the Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank. And yet this government seems hell-bent on running down that path.</para><para>Today is the opportunity for Senator Campbell to tell the Australian people, the Senate, and those in the gallery how this package is going to protect Australians, protect Australia's sovereignty. That is the challenge of the debate in the chamber today: how we are able to see more greatly enhanced national sovereignty and individual protection arising out of this bill.</para><para>The government have just dropped some amendments on us in the last 24 hoursâ</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>XE4</name.id><name role="metadata">BOLKUS</name><name role="display">Senator Bolkus</name></talker><para>âFew minutes.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name></talker><para>âIn the last few minutes, as Senator Bolkus correctly says. One of them in particular is of concern to me. It is the desire to take away consumer protection from the ACCC. I would have to argue, as others have recently, that the ACCC and Professor Fels have run amok. They have been happy to talk about market monopolies on the supply side, but they have not been prepared to talk about market monopolies on the business side. I think there is a legitimate criticism of the unevenness of the approach of the ACCC.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Notwithstanding that criticism, the ACCC is a body that has had many successes in making sure consumers are protected. In the transport industry in which I used to work, the ACCC caught a number of the major transport companies colluding to make sure that prices of courier services were kept high. It was a simple little scam based on an informal agreement. When you phoned one of the major companies in an area that as part of that agreement belonged to the other company they would quote you a deliberately exorbitant amount. You would then check with the company that had been informally designated and they would give you a realistic priceâalthough slightly above what would be a competitive price. The ACCC caught them and fined them $20 million-odd dollars. That is the sort of success the ACCC has had.</para><para>What we see today is attempts to take the regulation of consumer protection in financial services out of the control of the ACCC and pass it to the new ASIC. It has a massive number in responsibilities. The opposition is supporting the creation of ASIC. We think it is a step forward, but only if it is given the resources to deal with the issues. That is my third biggest concern with this legislation.</para><para>This government is not fair dinkum about consumer protection in financial services, because it is passing them across to a body which is underfundedânot just slightly but massively underfunded. At the same time, it is trying to foist the MIB on ASICâthat is not `men in black', as some people may know it, but the  Managed Investments Bill 1997 âwhich is a significant shift in corporate practice in this country. It is passing regula 
 tions and laws to heap much more onto ASIC's areas of responsibility and not giving it enough funds. The government is not giving it enough funds just to cope with the MIB legislation, never mind the extra regulation that it is now getting because of lumping consumer protection in with financial services.</para><para>The government is wiping out the ISC and moving its responsibilities. The ISC has had a chequered history. It has not been perfect; it has been criticised. I have had some dealings with it over time in my previous occupation as a superannuation officer, but it was always running on the smell of an oily rag. And we are seeing too many things being put under the jurisdiction of ASIC and the government not prepared to prove how fair dinkum it is by giving it significant funding.</para><para>I hope the government will stand up today and argue that it has given ASIC $7 million to deal with MIB and it will be adequately budgeted for. I am hoping Senator Campbell can reassure the chamber about this. I am hoping he can take us through exactly how much extra money ASIC is going to have to cope with these extra responsibilities that are flowing to it by the passage of this bill, by the possible passage of the MIB. I am looking forward to that contribution from Senator Campbell.</para><para>In closing, I make a couple of points which, at this stage, the government seems to be supporting and which I really want to stress the opposition's position onâthat is, the issue of dealing with the foreign takeovers and, more importantly, what is known as the big four, the banks. We will not support mergers between the big banks being allowed. There are already exorbitant profits being made in the banking sector at the expense of ordinary Australians. There is no way this opposition will support legislation that in any way sees a reduction in the limited competition that is there now.</para><para>The banks are making huge profits, billions of dollars a year, all at the expense of ordinary Australians. I am sure you have all seen the extra charges. When you open your bank statement, there is charge after charge running down the sheet. That has all come about in the last few years as the banks have sought to 
 repair their balance sheets for their poor lending practices in the 1980s and early 1990s when they had to write off millions and millions of dollars worth of bad loans that they made. No-one forced them to make them; they just tossed the money around.</para><para>The banks have had to recoup that money by going to their loyal customers who stuck with them through thick and thin. Often they were customers with small accounts. The banks have been slugging the ordinary pensioners and battlers they were always claiming to protect. We now see the banks ripping off those battlers. The banks are saying they have no social role and that they do not have to subsidise the poor because that is not their job. That is fair enough. If that is their position, at least they are honest enough to say it before parliamentary committees and to say in the papers that they are not responsible. But, if the banks are not responsible, then who is? This parliament is. That is why we have to be very careful with this legislation.</para><para>As I said, Senator Campbell, here is an opportunity to reassure Australians and to reassure everybody who is listening today that these reforms will benefit. I will be listening, and lots of Australians will be listening when you speak. We are hoping to be reassured on these issues.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>3477</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI am reassured that Senator Conroy thinks that all Australians will be listening when I speak.

Madam Chairman, Senator Conroy does raise some very important questions. I think a very legitimate debate is occurring throughout the community about what is happening to banking and financial services delivery in Australia. As all senators know, that flowed from the implementation of the recommendations following Sir Keith Campbell's committee of inquiry. Those recommendations were put in place by then Treasurer Keating in his early years. We saw the Australian financial system opened up and 
 the entry of foreign banks. Those changes did cause concerns.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Clearly, the mergers of major banks that have occurred over the past few years have caused concern. The closure of banks and restricted access to banking services in regional Australia has caused concern. I know in remote areas of Western Australiaâas Senator Peter Cook knows wellâwhen you go out to the goldfields they actually have cash flow crises because there is no money in these towns. You cannot go to the pub and cash a cheque in Leonora because there is no money. There are very serious problems.</para><para>We believe, and I understand the Labor Party share our hope, that these reforms will assist in alleviating those problems. They will do so, we hopeâand we can only hope as we try to make the law the best possible facilitator to create changeâin a number of ways. You have asked very serious questions on these things, and we hope that the passage of this legislation and the bringing in of the new schemeâwhich we hope can occur on 1 July, if parliament can pass these bills todayâwill see changes.</para><para>One of the most important changes that I personally believe will take place is, indeed, the bringing in of a regulatory system that brings all deposit taking institutions under a similar regulatory regime. We have already seen indications through reforms that this government has put in place, such as the cheque and payment orders bill, which allow building societies and credit unions, for the first time in Australian history, to issue cheques on their own account and not have to go through the expensive routine of issuing them on behalf of another bank. So they are able to provide services to small business at a lower cost than they have ever been able to do before.</para><para>In many parts of Australia, we have seen credit unions, the credit care movement, building societies and other financial institutions moving in to take up the slack left by the big banks in regional areas. That is something that we encourage.</para><para>Most Australians have seen the massive influx of Aussie Home Loans and all of these mortgage originators into the home loan 
 market. They are really giving the big banks massive competition. Not only because of the general movement down in interest rates but also because of massive increases in competition, that is seen as a significant reduction which is to the benefit of most Australians in terms of home lending.</para><para>We have seen some of that flow through into business lending, but not enough yet. The coalition, and I am sure all parties, would love to see more competition in the small business lending sector. I know it is a sector that is close to Senator Murray's heart. We want to see the banks really challenged by originators, credit unions and building societies in the creation of new products for small businesses and in the driving down of the costs of those financial products.</para><para>They are all things that we think can flow naturally from the so-called Wallis reforms. They are the sorts of benefits that I think Senator Conroy has in mind. I do not think there is any division between the parties on the desirability of that being achieved. That is certainly the intent.</para><para>In relation to the second tranche of matters raised by Senator Conroy, again, these are very important issues. They relate to international capital flows and the foreign ownership and control of Australian banks. I referred yesterday in my second reading speech to the statement by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) in relation to the four major banks. We have made it the government's policy that the four banks will not be allowed to merge, and we will keep a close eye on competition to the major banks. That remains our policy, and I appreciate the opposition's support for that.</para><para>We also believe that foreign control is a very important aspect of these major institutions. I incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> the whole of the Treasurer's press release dated 9 April in that regard. It outlines the government's policy in relation to foreign ownership and control of banks, and the mergers of banks. As Senator Conroy asked me to do, I refer any Australian who is interested to the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> at page 3091 of 28 May for a statement of government policy.</para><para>Before addressing the other issue that Senator Conroy raises, I say that I do genu 
 inely appreciate his interest in this subject. I know that when I first joined the Senate I got myself onto the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities, which he is now an active member of. It is not what one would call a sexy area of public policyâ</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3M6</name.id><name role="metadata">MURRAY</name><name role="display">Senator Murray</name></talker><para>âIt depends what turns you on.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name></talker><para>âThat is right. There are people who do get turned on by this, Senator Murray. If I was organising a quiet, romantic night at home with my wife, I do not think I would pull out a copy of the Corporations Law and read it to her to get her amorous. It is not the sort of natural area where you might focus if you are trying to make your political career jump. You get page 3 of the business pages, if you are lucky, on corporate law matters. But Senator Conroy has taken a genuine interest in these areas and is one of the active members who has taken a big interest in the Wallis reforms, the managed investments bill and the company law reform process which is being busily run by this government, and was very actively pursued, I might say, by former Attorney-General Lavarch under the previous government. So there is a lot of work going on there. It is not, as I said, exciting work but, if it is done properly, it can make big changes to Australia, though they will probably not go particularly recognised. Senator Conroy does have an interest there.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The funding of the regulator is a very important issue. This has been a concern raised by a number of senators. It has been raised by the consumers association, by corporate governance watchdog organisations and by the business community generally. We want to have a well-funded ASIC; we want to have a well-funded regulator that does its job well. The ASC, under the chairmanship of Alan Cameron, is to be commended for the reforms it has made as part of the ASC 2000 process. It has brought in a lot of efficiencies to its back office tasks. For example, it has saved about 15 per cent by consolidating its property, amalgamating a number of offices and so on forth. It has saved a lot of money.</para><para>The government treats the funding of the regulator very seriously. We have in this 
 budget announced a $50 million package for the next four years, which is a straight-up boost. We have announced a further $7 million for the two-year transitional period for the managed investment scheme. I have already given the opposition a written assuranceâwhich I repeat here for the recordâon the monitoring of the funding needs in relation to both managed investments and the shifting of the new responsibilities under the Wallis proposals to ASIC. We will be continually monitoring the appropriateness of funding for the new ASIC. On top of the $50 million over four years, there is the $7 million special package for the transitional phase of MIB. We have also shifted all of the funding that existed for that section of the operations of ISC that are moving as a consequence of this across to ASIC. All of the funding goes with all of those roles and all of those people.</para><para>We believe that is a responsible funding package. It is in the government's interest to fund ASIC well in these matters. It is in the government's interest, it is in our crass, pragmatic political interest, to make sure that ASIC performs very well. As chairman of the Ministerial Council on Corporations, I would get crucified by my state colleagues, the state Attorneys-General, distinguished members such as Geoff Shaw from New South Wales, if quality of service deteriorates in any of the service centres provided by the ASC, as it is now, and ASIC, as it will become known as a result of the passage of these bills. There is a very active feedback mechanism in relation to services provided by the ASC.</para><para>The West Australian business community, as Senator Peter Cook knows well, monitor this very well. They fought the foundation of the ASC, as Senator Peter Cook would well know, because they were very worried about funding and service reductions in the regions. As a West Australian senator, I am ever vigilant about ensuring that the service quality remains in the state capitals. I assure the Senate, all Australians and Senator Conroy in particular that if the funding for ASIC creates any service difficulties or regulatory difficulties I will probably be the first person in this country, this great wide land, that will know 
 about it. I hope that answers the legitimate concerns that you raise.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>3480</page.no><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name><name.id>3L6</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThank you for that, Senator Campbell.

The section to which the amendment has been moved concerns the possibility of anyone who is an employee or a board member of APRA acting illegally and disclosing information that should not be disclosed. As I read it, the effect of the amendment is to expand the coverage of those who might be caught in the net as possible offenders. That is, if anyone discloses information which ought not be disclosed about the performance of APRA's powers, they are then caught.</para><para>This amendment includes functions as well as powers. I imagine there is a differentiation between what a function and a power is. It seems to me to expand the net. APRA is the replacement for the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Insurance and Superannuation Commission in terms of the exercise of prudential responsibility for the Australian financial sector; it is the supervisory entity which will oversee the Australian financial industry.

They are necessary to correct an omission in the methodology used to determine on what assets base the levy on an entity is calculated. The existing clauses inadvertently preclude a range of dates that the Treasurer may need to use which may not allow the Treasurer to determine an appropriate date for some entities to measure their assets. It gives the Treasurer more flexibility to determine those. I understand that they have been the subject of negotiation with the affected institutions.

The explanation is of course comprehensible. The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill, originally No. 7 of 1997, renumbered No. 3 of 1998, has been carried by the Senate, but in doing so the government withdrew schedule 5, which related to choice of superannuation funds. That provision of the bill was taken out. It is my understanding that, while the government has either foreshadowed or introduced a <inline ref="r541">Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Choice of Superannuation Funds) Bill 1998</inline>  into the House, there is no such thing at this point as a superannuation legislation amendment choice of superannuation funds act 1998.</para></talk.start><para>If I am correct, what we are being asked to do is to accept an amendment which relates to something that does not exist. From the point of view of the government, the government might sayâI will not say itâthat they have a reasonable expectation of coming into existence. I do not know what the view of this chamber is, but I think one of the reasons why in TLAB 3, when we debated it early this week, the government withdrew schedule 5, the superannuation choice of funds part, was that it may have been of a mind to expedite that bill for the other provisions in it. But it may also have come to a literate understanding of where the numbers were in 
 this chamber as to whether this bill would pass through this chamber. My question is: am I right that this legislation does not exist yet? What is the explanationâand I am curious to know; I am not being combatant about thisâthat would be offered about amending a piece of at this stage non-existence legislation?</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>3490</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âAs I understand it, and my advice supports it, it is a commencement provision. It would only have any effect if that act were at some stage in the future to come into being. It is a bit like the Monty Pythonesque parrot. It is an ex-parrot at the moment. It is non-existent; it has ceased to be. We are not basing this on any reasonable or unreasonable expectation about the future of anything called an act to do with choice of super funds. It just means that, if it does happen to come about, this creates a trigger and a commencement.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>3490</page.no><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name><name.id>RF4</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThank you for that explanation. Therefore, if an act materialisesâthat is, this actâthen this provision has effect.

I have followed the practice of the government and of the former Labor government of relating the amendment back to the date of a press release, in case of companies taking advantage of the situation between knowing of such an amendment coming up and the amendment becoming law to exercise what I may refer to as devious practices. That is the significance of the date 3 May 1998.</para><para>The substantive amendment is that on item 2, and it refers to the liability for debts or liabilities of a related body corporate. We are concerned here with entities structuring themselves in such a way as to avoid liabilities or responsibilities by interposing companies with little capital backing between creditors, employees and the companies within the group which have substantial assets.</para><para>This is not a new problem. In 1988 the Law Reform Commission conducted a general insolvency inquiry. As a part of that inquiry, the commission considered the possibility of making related companies liable for the debts of an insolvent company in certain circumstances, and the commission recommended that companies should be so liable. A draft section D13 was produced. That draft section is a relatively simple one which essentially hands a discretion to a court to order a related company to contribute an amount to the debts of the insolvent company on its winding up.</para><para>In its considerations the Law Reform Commissionâand for the purposes of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>, I am referring to pages 146 and 147 of that reportâreported as will follow. I ask for the Senate to bear with me, because I think 
 what they said is worth repeating at length so I will quote all the way through. The quote is as follows:</para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">Liability for debts or liabilities of a related company</inline></para><para>334.	<inline font-style="italic">Relaxation of separate entity principle</inline> . Although this topic of liability for debts or liabilities of related companies does not strictly fall under the heading of director liability and disqualification, it is similar in that it deals with the imposition of liability on persons who have been closely connected with the running of the company but who would ordinarily be protected from being required to contribute to the amount available for distribution in the winding up. Under the existing law, the separate personality of each company prevents access to the funds of one company for the payment of the debts or liabilities of a related company except where the debtor company is a shareholder or creditor of the related company. This may operate unfairly where the business activity of a company has been directed or controlled by a related company. It is as though the related company was acting as a `director' of the other company and causing it to incur debts and liabilities.</para><para>335.	<inline font-style="italic">Proposal in DP 32</inline> . In DP 32 (para 222) the Commission proposed to give the court a wide discretion to order that a company that is or has been a related company pay to the liquidator all or part of an amount which is an admissible claim in the winding up `if it is satisfied that it is just'. Three specific criteria to which it was proposed the court may have regard were</para><para>.	 the extent to which the related company took part in the management of the company</para><para>.	 the conduct of the related company towards the creditors of the company and</para><para>.	 the extent to which the circumstances that gave rise to the winding up of the company are attributable to the actions of the related company.</para><para>It should not, of course, be sufficient that creditors have merely relied on the assets of the related company in their decision to deal with the company.</para><para>336. <inline font-style="italic">Assessment and recommendation.</inline>  The Commission's proposal was supported by several submissions. One submission, from the Law Council of Australia, strongly opposed the proposal on four grounds.</para><para>. <inline font-style="italic">Separate entity principle.</inline>  The Council said that it is a fundamental principle of company law that separate companies have separate legal entities. However, as a matter of policy, the Commission sees no reasonable objection to recommending the imposition of liability where a parent company permits its subsidiary to incur debts when insolvent. 
</para><para>. <inline font-style="italic">Project financing.</inline>  The Council argued that financing for large resource and other projects needs to be done on a limited recourse basis, but that, under the Commission's proposal, it would not be possible for a parent company to satisfy itself that it would not be liable for the debts of the project. However, the fact that creditors have entered into contracts on a limited recourse basis would be one of the `other relevant matters' to which the court is required to have regard.</para><para>. <inline font-style="italic">Uncertainty.</inline>  The Council said that the uncertainty in commercial dealings that would be created by the wide discretion given to the court would be undesirable. Lenders would be unable to ascertain the true liabilities of parent companies and could be expected to assume that at least some unguaranteed liabilities of subsidiaries should be taken into account. However, persons lending to the parent of a group of companies have regard not only to its balance sheet but to the consolidated balance sheet of the group and generally take cross-collateralised security. The Commission does not accept therefore that the suggested uncertainty would follow from its proposal. Moreover liability for a subsidiary's debts otherwise than under a guarantee would only arise in the context of the Commission's recommendations  where that subsidiary was or became insolvent.</para><para>. <inline font-style="italic">Accounts.</inline>  The Council suggested that auditors and company directors would have enormous difficulty in producing accounts which represent a true and fair view of a parent company. However, the Commission does not accept that accounting difficulties are sufficiently serious to deter it from recommending the imposition of liability on a parent company which has permitted its subsidiary to trade while insolvent.</para><para>Accordingly, the Commission recommends that companies be liable for the debts or liabilities of related companies in the manner set out in D13.</para><para>I have quoted at length to make sure that it is clear in the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>  what the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission were. It went on in fact to outline, in what it refers as section D13, the way in which this section should be structured. I have stuck as faithfully as I can to the section that the Law Reform Commission laid out, partly because there is no sense in reinventing the wheel but also because it had obviously carefully considered the matters and weighed the manner in which it should be presented.</para><para>I say `as carefully as I can' because I have had to add one section. That is the section which is item 2(d) on sheet 1006. That arose because of the following. Senators would be 
 aware that this occurrence has occurred in three specific instances recently in relation to employee entitlements and that is what is known as the Woodlawn, the Cobar and the Patrick examples. Of course the attention, quite rightly, has been focused on the awful consequences of employers evading their responsibilities through structuring their affairs in such a way that they can escape them.</para><para>While it is true that the Woodlawn, the Cobar and the Patrick examples all relate to employee entitlements, proposed section 588YA will inure for the benefit of all creditors, including those who have judgment debts against the insolvent company as a result of proceedings taken under sections 51AA, 51AB or 51AC of the Trade Practices Act or the franchising code of conduct or any other of the state based retail tenancy legislation for that matter.</para><para>Now you are pricking up your ears and you are saying, `Now he's referring to creditors and, not only is he referring to creditors, he is actually referring to matters that affect small business.' I was alerted to this by a letter I got from an organisation which indicated the real danger. I will quote from that letter but I do not choose to give you the source. The letter said:</para><para>I consider that your proposed amendmentsâ</para><para>because I had circulated these, as I told you, on 3 Mayâ</para><para>may also have a wider application to the recent fair trading package in that franchises and shopping centre owners could establish corporate shells to run various business enterprises. Should a franchisee or a retail tenant in a shopping centre ultimately be successful in court proceedings against a business enterprise concerning unconscionable conduct, an award for damages may not be effective if the entity has no assets or puts itself into voluntary administration. The establishment of such corporate structures would, of course, defeat the fair trading reforms.</para><para>Those are important points because, regardless of what your political perspective is, I would be surprised if any senator in any political party would actually relish the thought of companies being able to avoid their obligations to suppliers, banks, landlords, tenants and customers as well as to employees 
 through the restructuring and the deliberate manipulation of their corporate structure to avoid their obligations. I think this kind of legal and accounting spivery should be stamped on by the parliament. It should be stamped on so forcefully that these people will realise that we will not put up with what is immoral and should be illegal.</para><para>I do not know why, and I have not inquired into the reasons why, that particular Law Reform Commission recommendation is not yet in law, but I do think it is time we redressed that problem. I would seek, because I do regard it as an urgent matter, the urgent support and the full support of the Senate in stamping this out. It has much reference to recent events, but it really is part of a far broader problem and a far bigger picture. I therefore commend these two amendments to the Senate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>3493</page.no><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name><name.id>RF4</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe Labor Party will support the Democrat amendments that have just been moved by their spokesman Senator Murray.

In Senator Murray's amendments the words `on the application of the liquidator' appear. The distinctive difference that our amendments seek to bring is to extend that to include as well a creditor of a company and the commissionâthey are two separate entities. The commission in this case refers to the ASC or, as it will become, the ASIC. The reason I do so is for very much the same reasons as have been very well articulated by Senator Murray. However, I would like to address the Senate on them for a moment so that the position of the Australian Labor Party is very clear.</para><para>This amendment is known in my office as the `Patrick amendment' and for good reason. Senator Murray has pointed out that that is a classic and recent case in which a company has stripped its assets from a particular company that engaged employees and returned those assets to the principle company, in this case Lang Corporation, and those employees found themselves to be employed by a company simply as an employee entity without rights to recover their entitlements to pay, 
 annual leave, long service or any other award rights or entitlements that they had.</para><para>It was a case that gained national notoriety in the waterfront dispute. It was not, as Senator Murray has said, the only or an isolated example of this sort of behaviour. In Woodlawn and Cobar there were examples of similar practices being engaged to procure the insolvency of a company, drive it into bankruptcy and leave the workers of that company stranded without being able to obtain their rights to pay or other award entitlements. These amendments would close off that type of ability and therefore are desirable in company law. These amendments are also socially desirable and they protect the interests of workers in an employment situation where the artificial arrangement of corporate affairs occurs that creates that end result.</para><para>As Senator Murray has said, and I concur, this was not an isolated example; there are others. What is disquieting to me is that, in the midst of the public revelations about how Patrick was asset strippedâonce the news broke about how Patrick had confected this artificial concoctionâan article appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline>âI do not have it to hand but it is well referencedâwhich reported that a senior Australian law firm had been inundated by inquiries by various employers about how other companies should do it as well. We have on the record three major corporations in Australia engaging in this practice and by virtue of that article and anecdotal evidence we know that there is interest more widely spread in the corporate community about how this might be done so that they too can take advantage of this issue.</para><para>It is therefore appropriate for the parliament to move decisively to close down this type of what can only be described as `employment rort'. Quite apart from the industrial relations elements of this there are other good reasons in corporate law why it should be done.</para><para>I want to take the time of the chamber for a few minutes to put down clearly and quite explicitly why these amendments will operate in the way in which I have said and to explain the nature of the scam that was followed in the case of the Patrick company.</para><para>The Patrick companies, which employed the labour within the Patrick groupâand there were four of themâwere stripped of their assets. Most of these assets went upstream to other companies in the Patrick group. The only significant asset left with the Patrick employing companies was a contract to supply labour to the rest of the Patrick group. This has a provision, which the administrators describe in their report as `onerous', which provided that if there were any interruption to the supply of labour by, for example, industrial action, the Patrick group could terminate the labour hire contract and therefore obtain their labour from another source.</para><para>These changes in the Patrick corporate structure were made without the knowledge of the work force. That is a significant point. No worker was consulted on this; it happened in secret. They did not know that they were actually employed by companies that were little more than $2 registered companies and they did not know that their contract to supply labour to the Patrick group could be terminated on such easy grounds.</para><para>When Patrick terminated their entire work force of 1,400 workers, they relied on this new structure. The Patrick group determined the grounds had been made out to terminate the labour hire contracts with the Patrick employing companies, and these contracts were terminated. The Patrick group was free to hire labour from other sources, which they did; hiring labour from the NFF and P&amp;C Stevedores. At the same time, the Patrick employing companies were placed in receivership, having lost their only significant asset: the contract to supply labour to the Patrick group. The employees of the Patrick labour hire companies were, as a result, basically left without their two most important rights. Any claims to secure entitlements like annual leave, sick pay, redundancy pay and long service leave could only be made against their direct employer, the $2 companyâPatrick's employing companies, now in receivership. Their right to be protected against unlawful termination was rendered meaningless.</para><para>The workers could only be reinstated to their direct employer, the Patrick employing companies, but those companies were in 
 receivership and, in any event, the Patrick group would be under no obligation to take labour from those companies. A reinstatement is therefore of no practical effect even though it was clear that they were sacked illegally, and that is because they were members of a union.</para><para>The government has tried to say that the circumstances of the Patrick corporate scam were unique. That is plain wrong. Any corporate group could organise their structures so that employees are employed by internal labour hire companies with a tenuous agreement to supply labour to the rest of the group. Indeed, many corporate groups, for quite legitimate reasons, already have separate companies within the group and employ the labour just as separate companies own the assets, own the land, hold the debt or hold the tax losses. A corporate group could easily alter this structure so that they could do what Patrick have done.</para><para>Any employee who is employed in this sort of structure is effectively without any job security at all. They have a legal entitlement to redundancy pay, long service leave, accrued holiday and sick pay, but that is only enforceable against a company which is only a $2 company. There will be no assets to provide these entitlements on termination. They have a legal right not to be sacked illegally, but any reinstatement order is only enforceable against the direct employer which may not have worked to provide to the employee. That is why the bill introduced in this chamber as a private member's bill by Senator Mackay, and the amendments that I have moved are important.</para><para>The Patrick scam could happen to anyone. Any employee could be left without an effective means of being reinstated to their job or getting their accrued legal entitlements. Labor's amendments to the Democrats' amendments here today ensure that this cannot happen again. It gives employees a measure of job security. It does so by making amendments to the Corporations Act.</para><para>The two amendments to the Corporations Act are as follows. The first amendment provides, where a company is in receivership, that the court can make an order requiring a 
 related company to pay the debts of the other company, including debts owed to employees like accrued entitlements. The requirements for liability of the related company in this case are also somewhat different. The matters which the court will take into account in determining whether to make an order are as follows: the extent to which the related company took part in the management of the employer; the conduct of the related company towards the creditors of the company generally, and to the creditor to which the debt or liability relatesâthat is, the employees; the extent to which the circumstances that gave rise to the winding up of the employer are attributable to the actions of the related company; and any other related matters. Again, this provision will give greater security to employees in relation to their accrued legal entitlements.</para><para>The second amendment will give creditors the right to bring proceedings for the recovery of debts against directors of companies acting in contravention of the Corporations Law. At present, the only company, usually the liquidator or receiver, has this right. Under this provision, creditors such as employees will be given the right. In the Patricks case it would mean that employees of the Patrick companies, not just the receivers, would have the right to sue Chris Corrigan and other Patrick directors for debts arising from breaches by them of the Corporations Law.</para><para>Those are my supporting arguments for the amendments that I moved. We will be supporting the Democrats' amendments. We hope the chamber will support our extension of those amendments.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>3495</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe Democrats will accept the opposition's amendments to our amendment.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>3495</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI will make some brief comments on these matters.

The previous government made a decision to come down with the stand that we now have, so they made a deliberate policy decision there. That is not to say that it is not time to review these issues. The Labor Party has made that decision and it may indeed prove to be the right decision.</para><para>One of the things that the structure of the Corporations Law in Australia post-1990 requiresâparticularly these sections of the Corporations Lawâis ministerial council approval for any proposal. It was the process that I described during the second reading debate on this package that did indeed delay a number of the amendments that we have considered. Obviously, in a federation the processes where you have ministerial council structures which were put in place by the previous governmentâand supported by usâensure that the states get a say in these matters.</para><para>Dealing with the amendments in the way that is proposed today will be in breach of the corporations agreement. However, can I say on the constructive side that these matters have already been brought before ministerial council by one of its membersâindeed, the Attorney-General for New South Wales, Jeff Shaw, which will be a nice surprise to members oppositeâso they will have to be dealt with by the ministerial council. That is the appropriate way for them to be dealt with. I do not intend going into any more detail on the detailed provisions which are the subject of the Democrats'âand now amended by Laborâamendments. The coalition will oppose them and clearly the people in the other place will have to make a decision if the Senate does indeed pass them.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>3496</page.no><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator MACKAY</name><name.id>9L6</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âJust to make some additional comments to support those made by Senator Murray and Senator Cook, I go to the private member's bill which is before us, moved in 
 my name in the Senate and in the name of Bob McMullan in the House of Representatives. I would like to say that I agree wholeheartedly with the comments of Senator Murray when he says, `Now is the time to deal with this matter expeditiously.' This is really the first opportunity we have had, since the unfortunate events where 1,400 people were sacked, to attempt some remedial action with regard to this and to attempt, in legislation, to take some action whereby this sort of activity cannot happen again.</para></talk.start><para>I would just like to say that the very day that the 1,400 Patrick workers were sacked we had some very unedifying spectacles, both in the House of Representatives and in the Senate. In fact it was quoted by the media as `gloating and gleeful' activity and behaviour from members of the government. I had to speak on it the next day and I found utterly distasteful the sight of anybody at all in Australia, let alone members of the government, let alone ministers of the Crown, taking a clear personal pleasure in the sacking of 1,400 workers.</para><para>I have to say that it was a very emotional day for us on this side of the chamber when we spoke about this in great depth the next day. The irony was not lost on me that at the same time as the government was expressing concern for the workers employed at Cobar and the workers employed at Woodlawn, saying this was dreadful, that they did not support it and they would go out of their way to ensure that benefit would flow on and so onâalthough it took a considerable amount of time for that matter to be sorted outâcertain members of the government were clearly involved in or knew of the asset stripping activities of Patrick and were being advised by senior public servants as to how this could happen in terms of the replacement of the Patrick work force with an entirely new work force. So it was a very unedifying spectacle. I think that the government's comments with regard to Cobar and Woodlawn seem in retrospect to be hypocritical in the extreme and it really is not the sort of thing that we want in this country.</para><para>I would like to say that if this type of activity had been conducted by a trade union 
 in this country there would have been absolute mayhem on the government benches. There would have been calls for, if not immediate action in relation to, the deregistration of the union that was involved in any activity that was comparable with what Patrick did. This government has come down on unions like a ton of bricksâand so has the ACCC, headed by Allan Felsâwhere they have regarded them as improper in terms of free flowing business.</para><para>We have a situation where the government has let business get away with this. The government has not only let business get away with it, it in fact conspiredâthis is a case that the government will claim is sub judice and we will have an argument about that in the next few weeksâto ensure that this could happen. So it has not simply been passive, simply doing nothing, it has been proactively working with a company to ensure that this could happen.</para><para>This, in modern day Australia, is absolutely outrageous. But, it does not stop there. We also have a situationâand I would like to talk to the Senate about thisâwhereby this type of practice has in fact been replicated in one of the government's own agencies. I refer here to Employment National. The minister owns eight out of the 10 shares of Employment National. When the Employment Security Bill 1998  was introduced into the Senate it was very clear that the government at that point intended to ensure that the jobs of the CES workers would be transferred into the new Employment National with the usual rights with regard to long service leave and using the GECA award in terms of the no disadvantage test.</para><para>What happened was that the opposition and the Democrats were successful in moving a number of amendments with regard to that bill. What happened? Senator Vanstone pulled the bill and we have not seen it since. We have only to look at the consequences of that attempt to institute the types of changes that were incumbent within that bill, but without legislation, to see that has created a whole series of problems for the government that are coming to light now.</para><para>But the critical thing with regard to those CES workers who have lost their jobs with the abolition of the CES is that they were under the clear understanding in terms of the whole process that they would be given the option, first, of voluntary redundancyâwhich is fair enough; that is an accepted public sector practiceâor, second, transferral to the new Employment National. In relation to what conditions they would be employed under in the new Employment National, we had a discussion at the estimates round before last with the employment advocate as to what he would use in order to ensure the no disadvantage test was properly applied.</para><para>Prior to the employment advocate's appearing at estimates, workplace relations officials had advised the Senate committee that the GECA award would not be used with regard to the application of the no disadvantage test, that there was no relevant award because Employment National was a new company. When the employment advocate appeared in front of the Senate estimates committee, we asked him what he would be using. He said that, quite clearly, the GECA award was the appropriate benchmark to use with regard to the application of the no disadvantage test. So the government and Employment National were caught between a rock and a hard place with regard to ensuring that these people did not experience any diminution of their conditions.</para><para>What happened subsequent to that? Employment National set up a labour hire company; that is what happened. So you have got Employment National operating and you have got an Employment National labour hire company. Now Employment National, the government owned organisation for the delivery of employment services in this country, is saying, `Sorry, we don't employ the CES workers. We don't directly employ anybody. It is the labour hire company that employs them.' Therefore, there is no direct nexus between the GECA award and the conditions of the CES workers and the people who are going to be picked up by Employment National. They will be employed by this other company.</para><para>There is a personnel link between Employment National and Patrick. I am not suggesting that this necessarily has any genuine significance, and I do not intend to cast aspersions on this person at this stage, but Peter Storey, who heads Employment National, used to work for Patrick. With regard to the changes that Employment National is currently going throughâand has been taken to court on by the union, incidentallyâthere seems to have been a change of tactic when Mr Storey came on the scene. I am not sure whether that is coincidence or whether it is, in fact, premeditated. It is the matter of a court case at the moment and it is something about which we will have to wait and see.</para><para>But the reality is that those CES workers who have been offered employment with Employment National have been told that to get that employment they have to sign an AWA or they will not get the job. These are CES people who are employed under the Public Service Act and whose conditions were determined by GECA. They have been told that, in order to secure any future employment whatsoever, they are going to be forced to sign an AWA, to their own severe disadvantage with regard to the diminution of their wages and conditions.</para><para>So it is not simply in the corporate sector that this is happening. It is simply not good enough for the government to come along here and cry crocodile tears about the Cobar workers and the Woodlawn workers. The Employment National situation is happening in the government's own backyard, with the complicity and the full knowledge of the government, in a company owned by the government. If we cannot trust the government owned enterprises not to do this, how on earth can we have any confidence with regard to the corporate sector? That is the point. It is all very well for the parliamentary secretary to come in and say, `This is a matter that needs to go to ministerial council' or whatever, and `Yes, there may be some merit in this.'</para><para>I say to the government that if it genuinely has a concern about what happened to the workers at Cobar and Woodlawnâand we know the government does not have any 
 concern for what happened to the workers at Patrick Stevedoresâthen why not do something about fixing up what is happening in its own backyard with regard to Employment National? Let us ensure that there is a proper corporate structure with Employment National. Let us ensure that the ex-CES workers, or whoever, are in fact employed directly by Employment National, not by a labour hire company which allows Employment National to deliberately get out of commitments that it otherwise would have with the transfer of people from the public sector.</para><para>I say to the government that not only is it grossly hypocritical not to support the amendments moved by Senator Murray and Senator Cook with respect to the corporate sector, but also it is being grossly hypocritical in terms of the corporate structure of Employment National. If the government chooses not to supportâand clearly the parliamentary secretary has indicated that it will notâthe amendments moved by Senator Murray and Senator Cook, at least it should do something about what is happening now in its own backyard with Employment National.</para><para>Returning to the substance of the amendments that are attempting to provide security for Australian workers, I am very distressed to hearâI did not see the article that Senator Cook alluded to in the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline>âthat a law firm has been inundated with requests. This is something that has to be actioned now. This is something that cannot wait for a time whereby it is convenient for the government to deal with it. In terms of what Senator Cook advised the Senate, clearly this type of behaviour is happening right throughout Australia in the corporate sector.</para><para>What are we going to do? Are we going to wait until there is a plethora of Patrick style labour hire companies all over the countryâor Employment National style labour hire companiesâso that we have a repetition of a Cobar situation, a Woodlawn situation or a Patrick situation, before we act? Is that what the government is seriously asking us to do? Or can we do what Senator Cook and Senator Murray are proposing and carry these amendments now to ensure that such activity is clearly not legal?</para><para>We have in front of us four examples of where this type of activity has occurred: Cobar, Woodlawn, Patrick and Employment National. The latter twoâthere is absolutely no doubt in anybody's mindâknew precisely what they were doing. They deliberately used provisions in order to ensure they were able to, in the Patrick case, sack an entire work forceâillegally, as it transpired, although it was clearly illegal to us at the timeâand in Employment National's case to ensure that it can shed and shirk its responsibilities to workers who will be employed by it.</para><para>I say to the government: let us not wait for several years for more and more of these companies to go bust and not allow their workers their due entitlements. Let us do something about it now by ensuring that this sort of situation does not happen in the future. I reiterate that if the government is genuinely concerned about this type of corporate structure one of the first things it should do is fix up its own backyard and do something about Employment National.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>3499</page.no><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name><name.id>SF4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThis amendment deserves to be supported. It is a pity that such an amendment has to be suggested.

 has not only occurred in Patrick's case, or in the examples given by Senator Mackay in her excellent speech, but it has also occurred in the meat industry where again and again abattoirs have closed down and left people unpaid.</para><para>Within company law there is that proposition that directors owe a duty to the company and to the company only.

There has been a movement away from that. In legislation we are about to consider, the Company Law Review Bill 1997, the government has seen the virtue of moving away from the Foss v.

Although those who are advising Patrick might say it is in the company's interests to do what it did, nevertheless there are wider obligations that they should attend to. Indeed, its reputation would be much better had it acted differently, and had it and many other companies not made necessary the amendments put forward by Senator Murray.</para><para>Senator Ian Campbell said quite rightly that this is a national scheme and there are problems caused by that.

I will quote this passage:</para><para>Corporations have ceased to be merely legal devices through which the private business transactions of individuals may be carried on.

 in fact, become both a method of property tenure and a means of organising economic life.

This was written well over 60 years ago and the position has got even worse. Large corporations do control their workersâand I use the word `control' advisedlyâas if this was a feudal system. It was a feudal action in the most dramatic of cases, that is, the Patrick case, but this feudal system is the system that corporations use in many situations.</para><para>While taking on board what Senator Ian Campbell said, I think that the present situation needs to be remedied and needs to be remedied quickly.

Not that long ago the Cobar and Woodlawn workers were camped on the lawns outside Parliament House. They had a sad and sorry story to tell about how corporate spivvery had taken hundreds and thousands of dollars of their own entitlements. It was nothing special: nothing more than their long-service leave; nothing more than their accrued holidays; and nothing more than their superannuation.</para></talk.start><para>By a little bit of corporate spivvery, a bit of asset stripping, they had been left with nothing. I think there might have been $9 million in the case of one. For many days the government refused to even acknowledge their presence on the lawns. They were sad days for Australia. After some media attention and persistence from the workers, who were not prepared to be ignored, eventually a delegation got to meet with the Prime Minister. He promised not a great deal to give them hope, but at least he listened. He talked about reviewing the situation.</para><para>A few weeks later we saw Patrick Stevedores move in with the dogs and the balaclavas, and it became clear that the Prime Ministerâas on the GST when he said `never ever'âreally was crying crocodile tears with those workers. We have seen a similar situationâas Senator Mackay has so eloquently outlinedâwith Employment National. Here is a government that wants you to believe it cares, that wants you to believe that it is for the battlers, that wants you to believe that it is prepared to make sure that workers' entitlements are protected, that promised Australian workers before the last election that nobody would be worse off. Well, there are a few workers at Cobar, Woodlawn, Employment National and, more importantly, at Patrick, who have been made a heck of a lot worse off. You could almost be forgiving of it, if it were simply the corporates doing this but, as Senator Mackay said, the government has been doing it itself. So when it says to the workers that the Prime Minister met with, `We are looking at it', it is true that it has been looking at the issue but it has been looking at how to refine it and do it better.</para><para>We have seen the government willing to spend taxpayers' money in a guarantee to Patrick to get them to sack the entire union work force. This was the end of real job security. A lot of battlers in Australia are worried. You do not have a job for life any more. Many organisations, both public and private, do not have a culture any more of `You start work here when you are 18, you finish when you are 65, and you work for the one company all your life.' That is a thing of the past. In the last election campaign the Prime Minister promised workers that they would have job security, and he gave them every indication that he was willing to have a look at these sorts of issues. Today is the `put up or shut up' test. Today the government can accept the Labor Party's amendments and put into action right here what it told those Cobar and Woodlawn workers it was prepared to look at.</para><para>I say to Senator Campbellâthrough you, Madam Temporary Chairmanâthat we accept that the states have a role to play, that this is a federation. But what you are seeing, report 
 ed in the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline>, as Senator Cook has mentioned, is a flood of interest in copying these proposals, this legal spivvery that has taken away ordinary workers' conditions and rights. Yes, we do need support from the states, but we need leadership from the federal governmentâsomething that is lacking in a lot of different areas. Here is the chance to strike a blow for the battlers. Here is a chance to say, `We accept that this sort of corporate chicanery cannot go on.'</para><para>The angst felt by those families can be redressed in a small way. There is not a lot this legislation can do for those it has already happened toâI do not believe we are proposing a retrospectivity aspect to it. Here is a chance to make sure that it cannot happen again because, if you, as members of the government, reject this amendment, every time it happens it is on your head. You have the capacity to accept this amendment and put pressure on the states, as you do in any set of circumstances. But each time another worker appears in the newspaper or on <inline font-style="italic">A Current Affair</inline> or anywhere else and they have had their super, their leave loading or their long service entitlements takenâbecause a company has been involved in asset stripping or has established the mechanisms to take from their workers what is not theirs to takeâit is on your head if you reject these amendments.</para><para>You cannot cry the crocodile tears you cried a few weeks ago over Cobar and Woodlawn. At the time I thought it was pretty funny that the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, Mr Reith, and John Sharp and others took up the case on behalf of some of those workers. They were prepared to stand up publicly and support them. But at the same time, Mr Sharp, when he was Minister for Transport and Regional Development, was setting this in motion. Peter Reith cried crocodile tears about the workersâhow he would be willing to look at it and how it was terrible that it had happenedâand all the time they were working away behind the scenes to take away workers' rights.</para><para>I would like to talk about the smell test that Senator Cooney discussed. The government set itself up to work with Patrickâthat is, Chris Corrigan and Peter Scanlon. The latter 
 is an old favourite of mine. I have spoken quite often  now on Peter Scanlon and his role through the 1980s in two of the biggest six corporate scams that have ever taken place. That is not something I have alleged; that was said by the National Companies and Securities Commission, which went on to become the ASC, the corporate watchdog. They said, `These are the big six scams that happened in the 1980s. These are the real spivvy performances'. And Peter Scanlon was up to his neck in two of them.</para><para>I will not spend too much time on the Elders H fee, Swiss bonds and VicInvest, to name but three of the transactions that Elders was involved in, that Peter Scanlon was the corporate brains behind.	John Elliott gets a lot of the publicity because he is larger than life. But the real brains, the corporate strategist, behind what went on at Elders was Peter Scanlon. He would not pass Senator Cooney's smell test in a million years. Yet this government decided it was going to get into bed with one of the biggest corporate spivs in this country when it decided to back Corrigan and Scanlon.</para><para>I have talked before about the whole corporate scam behind the Swiss bonds. That is still under investigation by the National Crime Authority. It is not dead, it is not buried, as much as Corrigan wants to say, `It's something from the past; it's nothing to do with me.'</para><para>Scanlon wanted to settle his case with the NCA to try and pretend he had a win. He paid costs. The big test when it comes to a settlement in a legal action is who pays the costs. Peter Scanlon paid the NCA's costs. He got out and left John Elliott in this case by himself. He can say what he likes afterwards, but he knew that he was going to lose that case because it was an absolute scam. He was trying to pretend the NCA prosecuted him, chased him, defamed him and lowered his standing in the community, causing him to claim $200 million worth of damages.</para><para>Three of the four original claimants in that case have now bailed out and paid the NCA's costs. There is just big John left, and he will go down, too. He will be up for an awful lot of costs when that is all settled. But that is a 
 matter before the courts and I do not want to canvass it too widely. I simply make the point again that Scanlon pulled the pin, paid the costs of the NCA, and got out.</para><para>All the time that was happening, what was the government doing? It was having secret meetings with this companyâestablishing itself, setting itself up to take ordinary workers' superannuation, ordinary workers' leave loading and long service leaveâand with this same man. It was setting itself up to move in with the dogs on the chains and the people in balaclavas.</para><para>How would you feel if you were one of those Townsville wharfies who were acknowledged by the Prime Minister on <inline font-style="italic">A Current Affair</inline> as meeting world's best practice? There is no dispute. Neither the government, Scanlon nor Corrigan has tried to say that, up in Townsville, the workers were involved in anything other than world's best practice. Yet they had to be sacked as well. The Prime Minister admitted on national television, `Well, there'll be a few casualties along the way on the glorious road to reform.' They were sacked because they were union members; they lost their entitlements because they were union members, and this government was in it up to its neck.</para><para>I read with interest in this morning's papers that Justice North rejected the government's claims that it would be just too hard now to hold the court case into this and that it should be put off until the end of the year. Justice North said that the court case will go on. So we all look forward to the revelations. We all look forward to seeing a number of senior government ministers in the dock providing the documents that they will not give this Senate. They have now rejected the Democrats' and the opposition's attempts to get hold of the documents that will show how complicit they were.</para><para>Two weeks ago we even had the revelation in the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline> that the government, following a request to do so, provided a document and said, `This is it; this is what you asked for.' Then we find out from the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline> that they blanked out the last line and the attachment because the last line said, `Refer to the structure in the attach 
 ment.' What is that if not misleading the Senate? They are prepared to do anything to hide their involvement in this.</para><para>So it will come as no surprise when they reject our amendments, Senator Murray, because they have been in it up to their necks. They are in a situation where they could go to the state legal officers, the attorneys-general, and say, `We need this to protect battlers.' They could go to Queensland and say, `Here's your chance, Rob Borbidge; here's your chance, Joan Sheldon. You can support the battlers in your state; you can protect Townsville workers'â</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3M6</name.id><name role="metadata">MURRAY</name><name role="display">Senator Murray</name></talker><para>âAnd small business.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name></talker><para>âAnd small businessâabsolutely, Senator Murray. They could say, `You can be part of protecting all of those. You can use this in your state election. This will be a big winner for you, and it will dovetail in with our strategy about the battlers. But don't mention the GST; talk about the battlers instead.' </para></talk.start></continue><para>So the smell test should have been applied to Patrick, it should have been applied to Corrigan, and it should have been applied to Scanlon, because there is no way anybody who is reputable in the financial community would deal with Scanlon and Elliott any more. Those are the facts if you go and talk with the business community around Australia. They know they smell; they know what really went on. But this government decided, for their own grubby ends, that the ends justified the means. They were prepared to look the other way, andâworseâthey were prepared to deceive this parliament consistently for 12 months while they set up this corporate scam. Today is the day of reckoning. Today you can accept the amendments that will stop this sort of asset stripping and the taking of workers' legal entitlements away from them.</para><para>Amendments (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cook</inline>) agreed to.</para><para>Amendments (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murray</inline>), as amended, agreed to.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>3502</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âby leaveâI move:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	 Schedule 1, page 7 (after line 27), after item 8, insert:

I have outlined in my speech at the second reading stage the need for strong consumer protection in the financial services industry, a sentiment echoed in other speeches in the second reading debate. Most of our discussion on this will be under the Financial Sector Reform (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1998, which we will be considering after this one.</para><para>Satisfactory consumer protection will not be achieved simply by legislating for codes of conduct and dispute resolution processes. We also need to ensure that policy settings and the operations of key regulators are also guided by consumer considerations. Amendments 1 and 2 provide that the membership of the Payment System Board includes a member with a consumer representation or advocacy background. The Payment System Board will be replacing some of the functions of the Australian Payment System Council. The 
 board will retain the payment system monitoring and public reporting functions of the APSC. Consumer representatives have contributed greatly to its operation. The need for consumer representation in this area continues, as the advent of new technologies greatly increases the complexity of participation in the payment systems and broadens the issues.</para><para>Amendments 3 and 4 refer to the need for consumer expertise within the new Australian Securities and Investments Commission. That is paramount now that ASIC is to be solely responsible for financial sector consumer protection. It will be vital that there is the necessary experience and understanding of consumer protection issues at the top executive level as the transition is made from the ASC to the vastly expanded ASIC. Such guidance will help establish the new vision for ASIC: the new structures, the new culture and the new operational approaches.</para><para>We are therefore moving to ensure that a commissioner is appointed to the ASIC who has consumer protection experience. We are encouraged by the work on measures for the `good advice' policy program. The government may argue that the ASC already has such a person at commissioner level. If that is so, it does not militate against our amendment, because there is no requirement for such a person at this stage. What we are seeking is a requirement for there to be such a person.</para><para>Our eye was also drawn to the Financial Sector Advisory Council. This council has some very eminent Australian business people drawn from the financial sector. They are doubtless very well placed to discuss the impact of the post- Wallis changes, or what will be post-Wallis after today, on finance sector companies. The council seems less well placed to discuss the impacts of those reforms on customers. Businesses, of course, are always concerned with customers because that is where they make their profit, but they may not view customers in the way that we would expect a customer representative to view customers. This is a poignant concern because of the fact that the council will be responsible for an evaluation of the reforms in five years, 
 so we are looking for a particular perspective. The council is non-statutory, so the Australian Democrats are not seeking legislative measures there but do seek action by the Treasurer and Assistant Treasurer, and indeed by the Parliamentary Secretary, to redress this imbalance.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>3504</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe Democrat amendments propose that at least one member of ASIC and the Payment System Board should be a consumer representative. As senators would know, there are currently three commissioners of the ASC, including the chairman. They operate on a full-time basis and do not act as representatives of any sectional interest. They are appointed on the basis of their standing and their expertise. It is undesirable to appoint representatives of consumers, or any other interests, for that matter, as managers of a regulatory authority with the enforcement responsibilities of the ASIC. This could lead to regulatory capture.</para></talk.start><para>At the moment all three ASC commissioners seek to pursue consumer interests and, if you change the dynamics of this by making one of them a representative of consumers, you may risk issues been decided through an effective voting process. It can also lead to calls by each sectional interest for equivalent representation. ASC commissioners currently and deliberately are required to sever all ties with their previous employer to avoid any potential or perceived conflicts of interest. The ASC already has in place extensive consultative mechanisms to ensure input from all relevant interest groups, including consumer representatives. I might say that I know the liaison that occurs between the ASC and consumer groups is extremely active, if not on a daily basis.</para><para>ASIC will continue to work closely with consumer interests to help it understand fully and to take proper account of consumer needs in policy development and to make it aware at an early stage of problems which consumers are experiencing in the financial services sector. Those comments apply equally to the Payment System Council. I might also say that the government's proposed amendments 
 to the ASC's mission statement make it quite clear that the interests of consumers and the role in the ASC of protecting the interests of consumers are paramount. In particular, if you look at the FSI (Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 1998 it says:</para><para>In performing its functions and exercising its powers, the ASIC must strive to promote the confident and informed participation of investors and consumers in the financial system.</para><para>We believe that this is a clear signalâin fact, a legislative responsibilityâplaced on commissioners to act on behalf of consumers. It means you have actually got three commissioners acting on behalf of consumers and not just one.

The opposition, of course, is sympathetic to what is being put here. We think this is quite an important point, but we balance against it the fact that, if sectional interests were given prominence in a bill such as this, there could and would be arguments that other sectional interests should be represented among the commissioners too.</para></talk.start><para>I think, to some extent, whether the commissioners wanted to or not, it would have the effect of creating an expectation that a consumer commissioner would be responsible for consumer matters while they, while embracing consumer matters, might direct their attention to other things as well. The obligation here is that all commissioners should have regard for the consumer interests that this body will deal with. For those reasons, we will not be supporting the amendment.</para><para>However, as I said at the beginning, this is quite a serious matter because this is an area in which there have been good examples of why there ought to be a duty of responsibility to their consumers for the financial institutions involved here. There are notorious examples of where consumers have not fared well, to put it mildly, at the hands of banks or other financial institutions.</para><para>I am interested to hear that the government regards this to be of paramount importance; it is important for us to hear that. We regard it as of paramount importance as well. It is my intention, while not supporting the Democrats' position at this point, to indeed monitor the performance and developments of this part of the bill should it become law. Of course, if it does not operate in the way in which the concept has been explained in the bill, in the explanatory memorandum and in the discussions that we have had with the government, we would then reserve the right to come back, reopen this bill and insert the amendment that has been proposed.</para><para>With those wordsâI have to call you Mr Chairman, I do not know why standing orders require me to do that, Madam Chairman; but they do, I am informedâperhaps I can seek an assurance from the parliamentary secretary on this point. The particular point that I seek an assurance on, and invite the parliamentary secretary to provide more comment about, is the selection and background of the commissioners.</para><para>Senator Murray has raised a question about a consumer representative. We are joining the government in resisting that amendment for the reasons that we jointly share, which I have now articulated and which was referred to earlier. The opposition and the government have both gone on the record now, in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>, as saying that we regard consumer protection as paramount.</para><para>It is our view that, under this legislation, all commissioners should be responsible for consumer matters. The selection of the commissioners is important and their background and grasp of consumer issues is important. If all of them are responsible, but if all of them are drawn from the corporate sector and are articulate in corporate affairs but not as sensitive to consumer affairs, irrespective of the delegation of responsibility for consumer interests, their background and comprehension of those interests may be limited.</para><para>In the selection of these commissioners, I think it is important that the people who are considered have a genuine understanding of the consumer field, or can bridge both the corporate and the consumer fields. Otherwise, 
 with the best will in the world, people will conscientiously turn their attention to a consideration of consumer issues, but if their background does not equip them to comprehend that fully, you will get an in-built bias in the structure of the commission and, thus, I think, less sensitivity to these concerns than the government, the opposition and the Australian Democrats would require.

Schedule 19, items 26 and 27, dealing with terms and conditions of transferred staff and accrued benefits of staff transferring across to the new authority, refer specifically and exclusively to Reserve Bank employees. No reference is made to ISC employees. ISC employees have no legislative grounding to maintain their current terms and conditions of employment or recruit entitlements. Our amendments simply include ISC employees wherever Reserve Bank of Australia employees are mentioned. They ensure that the same guarantees that are given to one set of employeesâthe RBA employeesâare given to all.</para><para>To return to 170MB of the Workplace Relations Act, the government originally said that these amendments were not necessary as ISC employees are covered by section 170MB of the Workplace Relations Act 1996, whereas Reserve Bank of Australia employees are not, which is why they need mention in the APRA legislation.</para><para>The first point to make is that 170MB covers only certified agreements; it does not cover accrued entitlements or other conditions that APS employees may currently hold, and our amendments would guarantee that. The second issue is that the government has since acknowledged in writing that, because the ISC certified agreement refers to the Public Service Act, technically section 170MB would not apply. I have a letter here which I intend to seek leave to table. I have not shown this to the parliamentary secretary yet. I am happy to defer the seeking of leave until such time as he has had a look at it.</para><para>The Treasurer's office first offered to read a statement outlining their commitment to preserve Australian Public Service conditions into <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> during this debate. While welcome, this was not acceptable to the opposition as sufficient safeguard for the employees. It remains our position that these commitments should be enacted. The government then agreed to go away and come up with suitable amendmentsâamendments that are now being moved on behalf of the opposition. For whatever reason, they are not prepared to move these amendments themselves.</para><para>I note that these amendments are a revised version. They reflect the consultations we have had with the government and limit the cover to ISC employees rather than the broad definition of APS employees. This is a result of the government's written assurances that only ISC employees will be affected in the transfer to the new authority. I have another letter which I have not yet shown to the parliamentary secretary. I intend to seek leave to table that letter as well.</para><para>The APS employees are transferred under section 18(c) of the Public Service Act 1922. It allows the Commonwealth authority to `determine any special terms or conditions of employment that are to apply to the persons.' This gives APRA the power to preserve the conditions of employment previously held by APS employees. It also gives them the power to disregard such conditions. A further point should be made about section 81(c). Section 81(c) only comes into effect upon transfer. Only once transferred can the board grant special terms and conditions to staff. This does not give staff any certainty in the interim period. Because APRA does not currently exist, any agreements on conditions, remuneration and entitlements would be subject to approval by the APRA board when established.</para><para>Our amendments give guarantees to staff, irrespective of whether or not they have yet been transferred, that the conditions the board determines are no less favourable than those that they would currently hold. I acknowledge that both the Treasurer and the APRA chief executive officer designate, Graeme Thompson, have indicated that most current 
 Public Service conditions will be maintained, although the Treasurer has qualified this by saying that they will be `largely maintained'.</para><para>At this stage the government has not made any detailed commitments to staff. On that point, I would remind the Senate that the government does have form on reneging on commitments given to Australian Public Service employees transferring to newly established agencies or authorities. Previous commitments made to the Commonwealth Employment Service staff transferring to Employment National were not honoured when this government set about establishing Employment National through the backdoor.</para><para>Without going into that issue, I think it is clear that our amendments would prevent even the possibility of a similar situation occurring here. If the government really is committed to preserving the conditions currently held by ISC employees, then our amendments only ask it to put its money where its mouth is and enact the informal commitments already given.</para><para>Finally, I say that the government has also said that our amendments are duplicitous, creating nothing more than pages of extra legislation. We reject this assertion on two fronts. Firstly, we believe that our amendments enshrining in legislation the government's commitments are the best way of ensuring that ISC employees be transferred across to APRA, retaining conditions of employment that are no less favourable than those they currently hold. Secondly, our amendments, far from adding pages of legislation to this omnibus bill, add no more than a few lines.</para><para>We believe that the legislation should be explicit for all employees, not just Reserve Bank of Australia employees. Our amendments are simple and brief, but they do deliver certainty to ISC employees transferring to the authority.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN (Senator Crowley)</name></talker><para>âSenator Cook, you sought leave to table two letters.

The government believes that these amendments do not need to be included in the legislation, because section 81C of the Public Service Act 1922 provides the mechanism to move APS staff from the APS to a Commonwealth authority, and it enables the APRA board to determine any special terms and conditions of employment to apply to transferring staff.</para></talk.start><para>The legislation was drafted to cover the transfer of RBA staff because they cannot be moved to APRA without specific enabling legislation. The APRA chief executive officer and chairman elect have stated, pending harmonisation of workplace terms and conditions, that they intend to apply the terms and conditions of the ISC certified agreement to ISC transferees with only those amendments as are necessary consequent upon the staff ceasing to be the APS.</para><para>Madam Chairman, because we can see that the numbers are clearly here for these amendments, we will not be calling a division on this matter. We will, however, be voting no.

They are rather weighty, as you can see. We certainly consider that, with only three days of public exposure for 39 pages of amendmentsâan inadequate public exposureâit would be almost impossible for senators without significant resources to be confident that all the provisions of that law were appropriate. I will be interested to see how the opposition feels about that. But we have felt that it would be unreasonable in the circumstances to hold up the Wallis package. We know it is very dear to the government and it has our broad support, so we do not find anything over which we are going to dig our heels in.</para><para>The amendments we are referring to here really relate to a number of matters. Some of 
 them will transfer consumer protection from the ACCC to ASIC and they can be separated from the changes to prudential regulation and industry efficiency, which are at the heart of this package of bills. As Mr Wallis said:</para><para>The goals intended for these amendments could be achieved through different mechanisms by ministerial direction rather than legislative change.</para><para>Nonetheless, if it be the consensus of the committee that these government amendments be made, we are certainly not going to stand in the way. If there are any problems, we hope the government will come back and amend them shortly thereafter.</para><para>We have found some problems with this legislation, the   Financial Sector Reform (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1998 . For example, we think that, while the Crown is bound in respect of the Commonwealth, it is not clear whether state instrumentalities and authorities are bound. I wonder, parliamentary secretary, if you could comment on that when you reply to the remarks I have made because it is not clear to us. Other questions have been raised as to whether the ASIC will have the powers to undertake the actions which it has been asked to do.</para><para>Importantly, the amendments do not seem to completely mirror the measures of the Trade Practices Act in the important respects of not incorporating the measures recently passed through the fair trading amendments. I would appreciate it, parliamentary secretary, if you would respond on that basis as to why and what the situation is there.</para><para>The unconscionable conduct protection in this package of bills does not appear to extend to small business. As you know, parliamentary secretary, it is the government's clear intention to now extend unconscionable conduct provisions to small business, so once again I would appreciate your response. The measures do not allow for industry codes of conduct to be prescribed, yet the trade practices/fair trading amendments did do just thatâthey wanted that to happenâso perhaps you would remark on that.</para><para>In relation to broad consumer protection, we understand it was not the government's intention to include small business, but we believe it was Wallis's intention. We consider 
 that, given the clear problems small business can have and does have with the financial sector, it is essential that it have access to inexpensive dispute resolution and that it be covered by the unconscionable conduct measures. I remind you, parliamentary secretary, of the remarks I made in my speech during the second reading debate where I indicated that a survey had established that something like 75 per cent of all small businesses had had problems with banks of one kind or another. I indicated to you that, if you extrapolated that out mathematically, that turned out to be about 700,000 small businesses, so it is not a minor problem.</para><para>We are moving in our amendments to include small business under the broad consumer protection measure of these amendments. That is the purpose of amendments 1 and 2, which we have moved by leave together. The government has also asked that we trust that, through legislative and non-legislative measures, consumer protection measures can be delayed until CLERP is worked through. With the delays that an election will cause, we do not see that as desirable. We think there is a possibility that these matters will not again be attended to until late in 1999âbut it remains to be seen if that is true. We do not see it as reasonable that consumer protection measures are delayed as a lower priority while measures to improve industry efficiency are legislated as urgent. We think that shows the priorities as being misplaced.</para><para>We would like, through our amendments, to require that ASIC be responsible for accrediting industry codes of conduct which include industry dispute resolution by requiring that participating companies are parties to an accredited industry code of conduct and dispute resolution processes. The government said to us that the Corporations Law already includes some of these matters and that this definition that we are proposing an amendment to would in fact restrict it more.</para><para>Our reading of the law was not that it would restrict it more but that, for the purposes of this division, `person' would include those itemsâin other words, it is additional too, it is merely establishing or verifying the 
 fact that small businesses are so described. We have deliberately put that in because that is the small business definition from ABS and we want to make it explicit that small business is included in the matter. We certainly do not see it as excluding the intentions of the Corporations Law. Perhaps, parliamentary secretary, between you and your advisers you can respond on that basis. I feel I have given you a long list of questions as well as our approach. I would appreciate your response, parliamentary secretary.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>3534</page.no><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name><name.id>RF4</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âCan I go first of all to the copious amendments, as I comprehend them, moved by the government. Document 239 runs for 39 pages. These amendments, I am advised, are amendments which put into this bill the Trade Practices Act provisions that enable this bill to have power of enforcement. The opposition supports that. This bill will ensure that the consumer protection provisions of the ACCC apply in this sector.</para></talk.start><para>We have one concern which I will express now. It does not go to the point of resisting the amendments; we will support them, as I have said. But look at what is being effected here: the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission is giving authority and power for the financial sector to ASICâwe are taking out of the ACCC overarching power for everything and putting some of this power for the financial sector into a discrete piece of legislation. That is my understanding of what is happening. While we will support it for the financial sector, my concern is that it does generate some envy among other sectors.</para><para>It is possible to contemplate that, say, the food industry or some other sector might say, `Can we too be exempted from the ACCC and be given our discrete act?' If that starts to happen then you break down the important role the ACCC plays and you create an area for smart lawyers to try to find the differences between all of those sector provisions and play on the margins to escape prosecution or the enforcement power of this sort of legislation. I ask the government to briefly comment 
 on that. I would appreciate having them on the record about that concept.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>3535</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIn relation to bringing the consumer protection provisions of the Trade Practices Act under the Corporations Law and ensuring that you have consumer protection under a financial sector single regulator, the very point that Senator Cook makes about smart lawyers trying to pick differences between the two pieces of legislation and regulatory regimes is very much the issue that we are seeking to solve here. The best illustration of it is in the area of the Corporations Law where you have specific disclosure requirements and specific remedies if you do not comply with those disclosure requirements. A lawyer could defend an action in relation to those provisions of the Corporations Law and convince a court that everything is in compliance with the law and then another lawyer can come along and say, `Okay, you are off the hook in relation to the Corporations Law; now let's try you under the Trade Practices Act.' So you have a serious double jeopardy situation.</para></talk.start><para>The other explanation I make is that there is a difference between consumer products such as food or motor vehicles and the corporations and financial sector where you are seeking to form corporations, finance corporations, raise money for corporations and merge and acquire corporationsâyou are effectively dealing with entities, the financing of entities and the other consumer provisions that might then apply to those entities when they seek to provide goods or services to the world at large. Given the short time available, I hope that is sufficient explanation of the thinking behind ensuring the consumer protection provisions in relation to the financial sector are enforced and applied by a single financial regulator, the ASIC.</para><para>I turn to the points raised by Senator Murray. I hope I can give a comprehensive answer to those inquiries and questions. Taking the last point first, in relation to the definition of `person' there is no doubt that under the ASIC Act the definition is much broader than that which would apply if 
 Senator Murray's amendment were to succeed. The amendment purports to extend the definition of consumer to cover what are essentially small incorporated businesses. Because the government's amendments will be in the ASIC Act, the definitions in the Corporations Law will apply to the amendments. Under the Corporations Law, references to natural persons include references to bodies corporate and vice versa. A person in proposed section 12BC will therefore include bodies corporate. Accordingly, the Democrats' proposed amendment would narrow the operation of the existing provision rather than extend it, which I understand is their intention to do.</para><para>Senator Murray also referred to the problem associated with 39 pages of amendments and asked questions about the amendments passed in this place relating to fair trading and unconscionable conduct. We believe that these provisions  bring under the financial sector regulator and under this legislative regime those provisions that are necessary in fulfilling those functions. There are similar provisions to those which he refers to, but the provisions that we passed through this place as a result of the fair trading inquiry stay with the ACCC and are unaffected. The government does not believe that those areas are necessary for the financial sector regulator.</para><para>In terms of the prescription in relation to industry codes, we have had some helpful discussions about how we go about that. I said in my second reading speech that the government is progressing industry codes in the financial sector through the corporate law economic reform program, particularly policy paper No. 6, which goes into some detail about industry codes. We are very keen not to prescribe the detail of those industry codes in the legislation. The Australian Securities Commission is actively negotiating with industry sectors that are not already covered by codes. Those codes will be developed and CLERPâthe corporate law economic reform programâpaper No. 6 has committed the government to introducing legislation which will provide a competitively neutral regulatory regime which will bring industry codes under the Australian Securities Commission and 
 ensure that compliance with them is monitored by the Australian Securities Commission.</para><para>We believe that that is by far the best way to go. Industry is cooperating with the Australian Securities Commission and the Commonwealth government in relation to these codes and a whole range of matters relating to the operation of those industries in the new regime. We believe that that process will achieve results far more quickly than bringing in a very blunt instrument in relation to mandating and prescribing what those industry codes should be in the legislation. We think it is far more appropriate for the Securities Commission to work with industry on those codes.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>3536</page.no><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name><name.id>RF4</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI want to try to expedite this bill and get it through by the time we rise, but I did not mention before that the opposition will support Democrat amendments Nos 1 and 2 which I think you are about to put to the chamber.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN (Senator Ferguson)</name></talker><para>âThe question is that Democrat amendments Nos 1 and 2, which are amendments to government amendment No. 3, be agreed to.</para></talk.start><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>3536</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIn respect of government amendment No. 3, I move:</para></talk.start><para>(3)	 Omit subsection 12ED(3).</para><para>This is a further minor amendment which moves to omit section 12ED(3), which provides that the warranty concerning financial services does not extend to insurance contracts.

The governmentâand I understand all political partiesâis very keen to see dispute resolution procedures advanced in our society in the interests of a non-litigious, cheap and rapid resolution of disputes in whatever industry or circumstance they may occur. The commission is being required to approve industry codes and it was our view that industry codes should include alternative dispute resolution.</para><para>Our original amendment really was prescriptive. The government has said to us that it would prefer it if the process were indicative, so if you turn to amendment No. 4 on sheet 1012, revised 2, item 2, you will see that the words that we had there originally have now been changed to:</para><para>The Commission must not approve an industry code under subsection (1) unless the Commission is satisfied with the procedures for alternative dispute resolutionâ</para><para>So the first thing is that they must be satisfied that those procedures are adequateâ</para><para>having regard to any of the following guidelines:</para><para>The reason that we have changed it to `having regard to all those guidelines' is that neither we nor possibly anyone else can foresee every circumstance and every basis on which dispute resolution elements should be outlined. We thought that we should leave flexibility to the commission, but that we should clearly indicate the Senate's indicative list of desirable elements which are required in alternative dispute resolution. That is the change we have made and it is a substantial change. I presume that any reaction from the government will really be on technical matters rather than on principle, because I gather that it is very keen on dispute resolution.

These networks include people in the judiciary, parliament, clergy and the Public Service. Many of these people live in an abhorrent culture in which is included, as a spoils of office, the right to have sex with children. These people put themselves at continual risk of serious compromise in their work places as perpetrators, as too do those people who knowingly ignore or turn a blind eye to this ultimate betrayal of our children.</para></talk.start><para>Honourable senators should be concerned at recent developments involving the Criminal Justice Commission, the body set up to investigate official corruption in Queensland after the Fitzgerald inquiry. One of the senior members of this body, Mr Bob Hailstone, a former priest and manager of the ABC in Brisbane, and director of the corruption prevention division of the CJC, has left the CJC in what could only be called exceptional circumstances.</para><para>In November last year a Queensland police paedophilia task force raided Hailstone's house at 31 Dudley Street, Bardon and took possession of a great deal of obscene material. Last week Charles Goh, a man who lives with Hailstone at 31 Dudley Street, appeared in the Brisbane Magistrates Court on charges of possessing for sale indecent or obscene material.</para><para>These charges raise serious issues of concern. I have in my possession a letter which I will now read into the public record, and which records disturbing incidents alleged to have occurred at Mr Hailstone's house. The 
 letter was written by a man, Mr Phillip Wood, shortly before he died. Hailstone recently resigned from the CJC rather than face disciplinary charges including association with an inappropriate person. It seems to me that the whole period of Hailstone's service with the CJC should be examined, particularly as this body has failed in the past to investigate paedophilia allegations.	The letter written to a Brisbane solicitor reads as follows:</para><para>Dear John,</para><para>This is my account of the incident on 30th June 1996.</para><para>On 30th June 1996 I attended a luncheon party at the home of Mr. Robert Hailstone, 31 Dudley Street, Rainworth. In attendance were a total of fourteen persons, including Mr. Robert Hailstone:â</para><para>it then mentions a second and third personâ</para><para>the others I either didn't know or can't remember their names. During the course of the luncheon, some of the guests and the host were talking about having sex with young Asian boys, especially during their holidays in Thailand. This conversation was somewhat disturbing to me as I regard pederasty as anathema but I said nothing. Later on the conversation was about the church and their involvement in it, some of the group having been to church that day. This triggered a hostile reaction in me and I asked them how they could be involved in an institution that so vocally condemns homosexuality. This prompted an outburst of abuse by one of their number to me, with me responding by calling them a bunch of churchgoing pedophiles and saying that they should be outed (meaning to publicly expose them). I then left the house. As I was reversing out of the driveway (there were a number of cars parked there) I clipped the wing mirror of one of the cars. This bought the lot of them out onto the driveway, shouting abuse and kicking the drivers side of my car breaking the drivers side window. I was bleeding from the broken glass and being physically attacked by a number of persons. In an attempt to escape I reversed into a tree and drove into the side of a car parked in the driveway. In the melee that followed one of their number managed to turn off the ignition of my car and remove the key. I was than left alone in my car whilst they huddled together a few metres away. I used a spare key and drove out of the driveway. I was covered in glass and blood and very shaken up but I drove to my home in Victoria Point without incident. I had arrived at the luncheon at approx. 12:15pm and arrived at my home at 3:30pm.</para><para></para><para>Mr. Robert Hailstone, who is a director of the C.J.C. had stated to me on a couple of occasions that he could have anyone in Queensland arrested on a trumped up drug charge.

He is a person who very correctly, properly and rightly is outraged by the fearful crime of paedophilia. The only point I have to make is that this is such an abhorrent crime that people should be declared guilty of it only after the due process of the law has found them so. Due process is about making sure that people whom we say are guilty of a crime, particularly when it is an abhorrent crime, are in fact so.</para></talk.start><para>I wish to table with the agreement of the Senate a report of my visit to South Africa from 23 April this year to 30 April this year, not because I expect it to be read widely, if at all, but under the new rules we have to table these reports with the Special Minister of State, Senator Minchin. I have no objection to that. I took it over there and was very well treated by Katrina Hodgkinson, whom I must mention because she was so efficient and pleasant about looking after my affairs.</para><para>I left here very rapidly for my visit and I should acknowledge the assistance given to me at that time by my Whip, Senator Chris Evans, who made a difficult situation much better than it would otherwise have been.
