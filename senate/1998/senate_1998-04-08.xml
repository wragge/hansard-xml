Until this year, the industry paid two compulsory export promotion levies; the prawn boat levy and the prawn export charge. The levies funded prawn promotion activities through the Australian Prawn Promotion Association (APPA), and cost prawn operators an average of $800 per year.</para><para>The previous Government imposed the levies in 1995, through the Prawn Boat Levy Act 1995, the Prawn Export Charge Act 1995 and the Prawn Export Promotion Act 1995.</para><para>In December 1996, I was contacted by a group of prawn operators who said that they strongly opposed paying the compulsory levies and charges. I considered their arguments against the background of the Government's view that compulsory primary 
 industry levies should only be imposed on an industry if the levies have substantial industry support, and there is significant market failure.</para><para>I decided to hold a plebiscite of the industry, which was conducted by an independent consultant, Coopers and Lybrand. The packages included a `yes' case and a `no' case, prepared by the supporters and opponents, respectively, of compulsory levies. The count of the ballot papers was observed by industry scrutineers.</para><para>The plebiscite showed that 85 per cent of the operators that voted opposed the levy and the charge. The response rate, 67%, was extremely high.</para><para>The plebiscite was not, of course, binding, and I carefully considered its results, as well as the outcome of discussions with APPA and representations from prawn operators and exporters.</para><para>I subsequently announced that the prawn boat levy and the prawn export charge would be abolished from 1 January 1998.</para><para>The Government partially implemented the decision by making regulations that set the prawn export charge to zero from 1 January 1998.</para><para>It was not possible to abolish the prawn boat levy by regulation due to technical legal difficulties associated with the definition of a "levy period" in the Prawn Boat Levy Act. Accordingly, the bill defines the final levy period under the Act as the period from 1 July 1997-31 December 1997.</para><para>The bill repeals the Prawn Export Charge Act, the Prawn Boat Levy Act and the Prawn Export Promotion Act, however, the repeal will not take effect until 2001, to ensure that outstanding levies and charges can be recovered.</para><para>The bill also provides that the three Acts, Regulations made under the Acts and any agreements made under the Acts will continue to apply after their repeal in respect of any levies imposed before the repeal.</para><para>I would stress that the bill does not abolish the Australian Prawn Promotion Association, which will continue operating with the voluntary support of the prawn industry. APPA will continue to have access to the $115,000 in accumulated levies held by the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation.</para><para>The Government enthusiastically supports industries promoting their products overseas, however, it is not willing to use the coercive powers of the state to force prawn operators to pay compulsory promotional levies against their wishes.</para><para>The second part of the bill amends the Fisheries Management Act 1991 to prohibit commercial fishing operators from taking black marlin and blue marlin in the Australian fishing zone. 
</para><para>The bill includes three specific exemptions from the ban: holders of scientific permits, charter fishing operators, and recreational fishers.</para><para>The bill imposes a penalty of 125 penalty units ($13,750) for a breach of the prohibition and also provides a defence to a prosecution if upon becoming aware of the taking of the fish, the person immediately takes steps to return the fish to its natural environment.</para><para>Black and blue marlin are prized by game fishers, but are also caught by commercial fishing operators.</para><para>In the 1996 election campaign, the Government promised that we would impose a mandatory ban on the taking of black and blue marlin by commercial operators if the existing voluntary ban proved to be ineffective.</para><para>A small number of commercial operators have ignored the voluntary ban; accordingly, we have decided to impose the ban by law.</para><para>The Government's decision is in line with the recommendations of the recent House of Representatives inquiry into fisheries management, and is supported by the commercial fishing industry, charter fishing operators, and recreational fishers.</para><para>It has been argued that the prohibition should be extended to cover striped marlin, or maybe broadbill swordfish.</para><para>The Government believes that the bill represents an honourable and reasonable compromise between the interests of commercial fishers on the one hand and recreational and charter fishers on the other.</para><para>We would strongly oppose any attempt to extend the ban to cover additional species, and would, if necessary, withdraw Schedule 1 of the bill rather than allow it to impose unnecessary restrictions on the fishing industry.</para><para>I commend the bill to Honourable Senators.</para><para>Ordered that further consideration of the second reading speech of this bill be adjourned until the first day of the winter sittings, in accordance with standing order 111.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL 1997 [No. 2]</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>2290</page.no><id.no>r455</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>In Committee</title><page.no>2290</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Consideration resumed from 7 April.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN (Senator Hogg)</name></talker><para>—The committee is considering <inline ref="r455">Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 [No. 2]</inline>  as amended.

I think it is very important to consider the importance of this issue for justice. I do not think any one of us would like to be in a situation where, for reasons of complexity and technicality, we have knocked out or caused people's legitimate native title claims to be knocked out on the basis of technicality. That is what we are in danger of doing here.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In a short while I will go back to amendments 184 and 269, but Greens-Democrat amendment 196 replaces the absolute prohibition on claims over previous exclusive possession tenures and exclusive rights on non-exclusive tenures with a more general obligation, as far as is reasonably practicable, not to claim areas where native title is extinguished under section 61A(1). This is important because it might involve a more complex mining claim. There are situations where people are in the courts, especially the wardens' courts, daily, sometimes for very long periods of time, trying to knock out people's claims on the basis of technicality. This may well be what indigenous Australians will end up receiving if the bill stands as it is currently written.</para><para>In Australia, we cannot in all conscience set up a situation where the sheer complexity of 
 the application forms is the basis on which people's claims are not received. We cannot use that as the basis for justice. It cannot be seen that rights can be removed or not obtained legally—in the very narrow sense of `legally'—because, under hundreds of potentially exclusive possession tenures, a mistake, and potentially one mistake, is made.</para><para>Nobody can tell me that it is the right, fair and reasonable way to go to leave in there the potential for technical knockouts, TKOs, on something as important as establishing native title claim. I think it is outrageous that we have a situation where people have to write their applications like a jigsaw puzzle anyway. I am sure that, between ourselves, as adult people in our society, we can work out how people can establish where their traditional lands exist. After that is established, we can work out the areas where they are unlikely to get a resolution of their native title claim. But, no, the government is not interested in that kind of fairness. But considering they have gone along that road, this amendment is a totally reasonable compromise. I would hate to think that any Australian parliament this century could deliberately leave in the bill a provision which has such potential for technical knockout.</para><para>Amendments nos. 184 and 269, which have already been moved, clarify that native title claim applications must include all people who can claim to hold that particular native title. We also think that is a difficulty, but this amendment will clarify it so that it is not as onerous as the provision proposed by the government under section 25(1)(b) and section 25(3).</para><para>I do not know whether Senator Harradine was listening to my first argument in relation to amendment No. 196, but it is absolutely essential, I believe, that we are not associated with an amendment which creates a nightmare of technical knockouts of claims on the basis of mistakes on application forms.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>2291</page.no><name role="metadata">Minchin, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator MINCHIN</name><name.id>JX4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State;Minister Assisting the Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We are pleased the Greens have moved amendments Nos 184 and 269 in the sense that they agree with us that this matter should be remedied in 
 terms of authorisation by all members of the native claim group. But I point out that government amendments Nos 54, 55, 57 and 58, which were agreed by the Senate last night, exactly cover this matter—they pick up the very point you make. Therefore, it becomes a problem if you move a subsequent amendment dealing with the same issue. So I would ask you to consider withdrawing those amendments in light of the fact we have already amended the bill to take account of the very issue you raise.</para></talk.start><para>Amendment number 196 goes to the heart of part of the problem that is occurring on the ground with native title claims being made—sometimes obviously inadvertently and not deliberately—for land over which there is a freehold title or other exclusive possession title. People receive in their letterboxes notices from the tribunal that so-and-so group has claimed exclusive possession of land that includes their freehold title. That is causing considerable distress and concern, in most cases not intentionally, and it is regrettable.</para><para>We think it is very important that the bill contain the provisions set out on page 153 that the claimant application is not to be made on land covered by previous exclusive possession act areas. We think it is essential that the claimants ensure that the area they are claiming does not include land where native title has been extinguished by virtue of an exclusive possession act. We are talking about rural properties that are freehold and all that sort of thing.</para><para>In deference to the point you make, we have introduced—and I think the Senate has accepted—government amendment 59 to make it clear that applications may be amended at any time to reduce the area covered by the application. The very point we are seeking to cover here is to enable applicants—who, as I say, in most cases have unwittingly included freehold properties in their claim area—to very simply and quickly amend their claims to excise those freehold estates from their claim without their being pushed back down the line or the processing of their application being unduly prejudiced. We want to ensure there is a simple and easy way for them to amend their application upon notice from the 
 tribunal—or the registrar, in this case—that their claim covers an exclusive possession area. We think that is the most sensible way to deal with it.</para><para>We take in good faith the statements made by native title claimants that they are not seeking to claim freehold. As I say, I accept that often where freehold is claimed that is accidental because the claim area is so big. But if we allow applications to remain in the terms of 196, I think we will continue to have on-the-ground problems that really are unnecessary between claimant groups and those who hold an exclusive possession title.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>2292</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr Temporary Chairman, I am quite happy to have amendment 196 dealt with separately.

I would like to clarify also that I did mention that Greens-Democrats amendments Nos 184 and 269 are not enthusiastic support for the government's proposal about native title claims; they are a softening. The government has made some moves in that direction as well. There are many areas in which amendments are being made that do not actually indicate that we like or approve of what the government is doing, so I do not think you should read that into it at all, Minister.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I believe we cannot underestimate the importance of amendment No. 196. Senators will have noticed that the minister said that people could at any stage reduce what is on their native title claim. But at some stage there will come a point at which people can simply knock it out on the basis of technicality.</para><para>It must be understood that not all of the representative bodies that we are dealing with, or the people involved in claims, have the resources to be able to put in a claim that meets the onerous requirements that the government is setting them. For some people, 
 it is a high jump bar they cannot get over, so maybe they will be desperate enough to put in a claim that they believe is accurate on the basis of the information.</para><para>This is not access to justice. This is not in any way procedural fairness. This is not something that we should in this parliament be responsible for or be associated with. I do not think what the minister has said is any justification at all for leaving this onerous provision unamended and I would absolutely urge the committee to think about amending this provision. It still largely gives the government what it wants, unfortunately, but basically it is a more general obligation and is more reasonable, so it is `as far as practicable'. If I were to be drafting a bill, that is not the way I would be going about it.</para><para>Because the government has been so determined to make things as hard as possible, because the government has been so determined to knock out as many legitimate and other claims as possible to make it more and more difficult for people to apply, we are ending up with these kinds of provisions. It is like people putting on their thinking caps and thinking, `How could we make it as difficult as possible for people to actually enjoy their native title rights?' This is one of those areas.</para><para>Even the government will not find themselves covered in glory from anybody if they find themselves simply defending, again and again, what they are doing here. So please, I would be keen to see what the rest of the committee's position is on this matter.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>2292</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I will start off by saying that Senator Margetts makes what I think is a very valid point. One of the most insidious parts of the legislation that passed through the Senate last year was the way that procedural rules are used to create more and more barriers to access to native title. As we said last time, it may not be blanket extinguishment but what they have done here is piece together an enormous quilt of extinguishment, and they have done so in this particular instance by making it enormously difficult for people to access rights and putting in all sorts of burdens and liabilities when they try to do so.</para></talk.start><para>It is unfair and the unfairness was exacerbated by the fact that so many of these amendments got through last time without what I would claim is sufficient scrutiny. One of those amendments is the one that we are discussing today. If you look at the difference between amendment 196 and the government's proposal, you find that there are two differences: one is that the government's proposal refers to a previous exclusive possession act; the Democrat/Green proposal refers to situations where native title has been extinguished. They do allow for a bit more flexibility in terms of people being able to pursue rights when there is a doubt, and I leave that doubt to be resolved. Given the approach that the Senate has taken on this legislation in respect to extinguishment, in respect to allowing some flexibility and in respect to falling on the side of suspension rather than extinguishment, the Democrat/Green amendment has got merit on that ground.</para><para>The other thing that we are fighting about here is five or six words—`as far as is reasonably practicable.' The Democrats and Greens want to put that rider into this provision to ensure that people are not unfairly struck out when they are pursuing their rights under the law. Let us remember, in the context of all this, the basic starting point: native title is not something that is bestowed through this legislation. Native title pre-existed this legislation; in fact, it pre-existed white settlement here. So what we are trying to do through this legislation in effect is undermined by the fact that we make it more difficult for people to pursue their rights under this legislation.</para><para>`As far as is reasonably practicable'—five or six little words, but very symbolic. What the government is doing is saying, `We want to put a very hard line up and if people can jump the barrier, fair enough, but if there is injustice at the edges, then we do not want to know about it.' I think the Senate should know about it and the opposition supports the Democrat/Green amendment.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>2293</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to ask the minister: will an application that does not comply

What is being done is there is a belated recognition that native title is and always has existed in Australia's indigenous history. Therefore, the government is suggesting that, by a technicality, you can somehow strike out the ability for people to enjoy the native title that has always existed. You are suggesting that this is the kind of law you should apply for people to have their native title acknowledged, that technical knockouts are an appropriate mechanism for people trying to establish the native title they have always had, and that this is an appropriate way for this parliament to act. You will allow potentially highly resourced companies to go in and strike out native title if somebody has not got their application right in terms of knowing every element of every title within their claim area at the time they put in their application.</para></talk.start><para>Despite the slight amendment you made, we are in fact simply softening.

 common law. The High Court has said that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians can come to the courts of Australia and seek to establish their native title before that court, and the test the court must be satisfied of is that the claimants have maintained their traditional connection to the land claimed and that there has not been an act of extinguishment by a government in the meantime. The court system is thus made available to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders to come and seek to have a determination that they hold native title, that they are the native title holders and that they hold certain rights to the land in question.</para></talk.start><para>It is part of our common law system. It is our common law that is recognising these traditional laws and customs, but that is the process by which these determinations are made. The common law will recognise native title once a determination has been made that X group holds X native title rights and interests on Y piece of land. Then the common law is triggered.</para><para>As has always been part of our common law, when you make a common law claim, it is open to other parties to come before the courts to have such a claim struck out in the first instance. So that is all we replicate. The strike out motion must be based on an assertion, which the court would have to be satisfied of, that the application does not comply with the basic requirements regarding applications, and they are frankly fairly basic. The matters to be dealt with in respect of applications are not unduly onerous. Given that these claims can take years, cost the nation millions and millions of dollars and involve many other parties—as we have seen with Yorta Yorta—it is not unreasonable that some sort of basic application requirements are put in place and it is not at all unreasonable to give other parties the rights they have in every other field of legal endeavour, the right to come before the court and ask that it be struck out.</para><para>If the claim meets all the application requirements of the act, then I would imagine a strike out motion is unlikely to be successful. Once claims get into the system, they do take years, they are taking years, they do cost 
 millions of dollars and often, as we know, they cause considerable division within Aboriginal communities themselves. So it is not unreasonable to have this sort of process put in place and it is not unduly rigorous.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>2295</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would argue that it is unreasonable that it is being done at the application stage.

That will mean, apart from anything else, that people will actually excise areas of legitimate claim. They will not be able to leave those for the period of determination. They will knock those out or be required in the end to knock those out in order to avoid being knocked out themselves by a strike out provision.</para><para>This is in fact unreasonable.

There seems to be one thing that we are missing in all of this. It is that until the 
 Mabo and the Wik decisions there was no basis for native title in this country. But the High Court has said quite clearly that the doctrine of terra nullius is itself now dead. This means that we have 210 years of history during which we have been operating on a doctrine which no longer applies. So I have to say to the minister: it is just not possible to re-establish native title after 210 years and expect that somehow or other we are going to say, `Well, really, that doctrine still exists and we are going to make it as hard as possible for native title to be established.'</para></talk.start><para>The problem that we are trying to put to the minister is that we are in an entirely new era, that we now have to take account of native title, and that it is no longer possible to say that native title somehow or other has to have every possible hurdle put in front of it before we can even get to the stage of determining it.</para><para>I know it is costing a lot of money and time, but that is the consequence of the High Court finally saying, `No longer can we ignore native title.' It just does not convince me to continually say it is costing a lot of money and time, et cetera. Of course it is; it is because of the 210 years of history that we allowed to happen before we corrected something. It is just impossible to argue on that basis that somehow or other we have to make it as smooth as possible for native title really to be suppressed. That is the effect of this. That is the effect of saying that `an application for determination of native title' et cetera.</para><para>I want to ask the minister if he could give me an argument as to why the words `as far as is reasonably practicable' are not acceptable to the government. It seems to me that that, as Senator Margetts has said, puts a human face on what otherwise seems to be a determination to make it as difficult as possible. I do not accept the argument about the costs and the time and all the rest of it. That is a consequence of our history, that we have taken this long to fix the whole thing up. Of course it is going to be difficult. Did anyone expect anything different? We are trying to fix up an injustice that has gone on for 200 years. So that argument does not convince me. But if the minister could tell me why the 
 words `as far as is reasonably practicable' are not acceptable to the government, then I might understand what it is that the government is arguing.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>2296</page.no><name role="metadata">Minchin, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator MINCHIN</name><name.id>JX4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State;Minister Assisting the Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thought that we all approached this debate in a spirit of seeking reconciliation, coexistence and goodwill.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>DX5</name.id><name role="metadata">MARGETTS</name><name role="display">Senator Margetts</name></talker><para>—What!

In many cases, as I said, that includes Aboriginal people. You know very well that in rural Australia one of the things that is causing community division, hardship and distress is native title claims for exclusive possession. Many of the claims are for exclusive possession, and that is their right, but where such a claim lodges on the kitchen table of a family with a pastoral lease, it inevitably causes distress. In many cases, this is not intended; the claims cover vast areas and everything inside it is claimed.</para><para>We are trying to ensure a system whereby native title properly can be claimed where native title may have survived; that such a native title claim can be dealt with efficiently, effectively and fairly by the courts of Australia; and, where native title is proved, that a determination can be made. To make this system work, you have to try to avoid unnecessary conflict on the ground. One of the most important ways of doing that is to ensure that claims do not include areas of land—mostly inadvertently—that cover other people's freehold or exclusive possession leases. That is why we say that an application should not cover a previous exclusive posses 
 sion area. But we have made it as easy as possible for applications to be amended in the spirit in which I take the statements by Aboriginal people—that they do not want to claim other people's freehold, and that those claims can be amended to excise those areas, which are often tiny. Some of the Queensland claims are huge. We are often talking about only small areas that would need to be excised to meet these requirements, and there is a very simple procedure to enable that to occur.</para><para>The problem with 196 is that it allows into the system applications that cover areas where native title has been extinguished and, therefore, all that goes with that—thus roping into the claim and the court process people who occupy land where native title has been extinguished, who have freehold, et cetera, and the legal argument over that—rather than ensuring that the resources of all parties to the claim and of the courts are focused on the areas of the claim where native title can have survived. We think it is important that claims not include such areas; we are making it very easy for claims to be amended, without dropping out of the system,  to ensure that they do not.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>2297</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I cannot let that go by without commenting on the pejorative language that the minister used. He said earlier that it is our common law which is recognising native title, as if some magnanimity has arrived suddenly, by which we are creating a gift for the indigenous people. Minister, you are wrong on that; you have a blind spot on that. You are not accepting that, for 200 years, common law rights existed but were denied by people like you in parliaments, in places of authority, both colonial and post-colonial, when the indigenous people had that right but they were denied that right.</para></talk.start><para>Now the minister talks about the hardship or distress that is being caused in the community by indigenous people having that common right recognised, even though in a very truncated form. But he talks about it as if the hardship and distress is something that can be visited only upon members of the white community. It is as if, for the indigenous people out there, there is no hardship and 
 distress involved in this; that all they are doing is sending in paper applications to get recognition of their land. I submit that he is totally wrong. The problem is that blind spot, that inability to recognise that it is not only hardship and distress for the indigenous people, it is divestment. It is a horrific history of recent generations who are longing to get recognition, not of a new attachment to the land but of their existing and continuing attachment to the land, which was there in common law all the way through but which was seized and broken by force, causing great hardship. That is the blind spot—the bigotry of the idea that says, `This is one-sided potential suffering that's going to occur here.' The follow-on from that is `Therefore, we'd better tighten down—we'd better screw down—the provisions to make sure that fewer and fewer applications from the indigenous people will be successful.' It is a wrong way of thinking.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>2297</page.no><name role="metadata">Woodley, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WOODLEY</name><name.id>HX5</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am not sure I really got an answer to the question I asked before: could the government indicate why the words `as far as is reasonably practicable' are not acceptable? I have another question, but I guess it is really a rhetorical question: has the government or anyone ever calculated, over and against the cost that we are now seeing in terms of court cases, et cetera, the cost to Aboriginal people of all that has happened in the 200 years of white settlement? This includes the cost of the dispossession of their land; the cost of the loss of culture and language; the cost of losing their children; the cost of the fact that Aboriginal people have been almost destroyed by what most people quite legitimately would call an act of genocide over the 200 years. Quite clearly, when we talk about court costs, we have to put alongside those court costs the cost to Aboriginal people of our history. When you do that, the court costs pale into insignificance in terms of all that Aboriginal people have paid for the history of white settlement in this country.</para></talk.start><para>That is why I continue to press the question as to why the government would not accept the words `as far as is reasonably practicable'. I do have an answer from the minister on 
 that: he does not feel that those words advance what the government is trying to achieve.

No-one on this side underestimates the enormous impact on Aboriginal society of European settlement. Obviously, it has been massive and destructive. But you have to look at what has occurred since. In response to that, governments, many of which have been of my persuasion, have given to Aboriginal people enormous areas of land. They now own or control 15 per cent of Australia. They now own or control an area the size of New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and the ACT.</para></talk.start><para>That is why we set up the indigenous land fund—because we do acknowledge that connection to the land, that need for land, the need for some reparation. So we supported the $1.3 billion land fund. My government is putting in $120 million a year to build that fund to $1.3 billion, so that it will enable Aboriginal people to buy $45 million worth of land every year. There was a general recognition that the High Court, if you have read the judgment, understood that, simply as a function of 200 years of development, it was not going to be easy for Aboriginal people to establish their native title. That is why the government set up the indigenous land fund. That is why we support it. That is why governments in the past have given enormous areas of land to Aboriginal people.</para><para>We go forward on the basis—I would hope, together—that, yes, there is native title, but we do have a land fund.

It was up to the High Court to ensure some protection, and they did so. I hope that in the future the High Court will continue to do so. Let us put on the record 
 the fact that the history of Australia has been to progressively eat away at those rights. We did not just steal their land; we stole their kids. Let us keep that in mind as well.</para><para>I suggest that the points have been made in this part of the debate. We are, in a sense, going around in circles. Some of the language has not been helpful. The basic point is that we on this side have a concern about what is happening with the procedural aspects of this bill. People are being denied the flexibility and, through that, the capacity to pursue legitimate claims. As a consequence, they will go outside the Native Title Act. They will go to the common law and we will have another generation of cases.

We have already had voted down what we believe is one of the most important issues in this section, and to save the Senate's time I will put amendments 194, 199 to 207, 210 and 211 together. Amendment 194 substitutes the section with a member or members of the native title claim group authorised by that group. We believe that makes that section more reasonable.</para><para>Amendment 199 allows combined applications for a determination and for compensation in respect of areas within the boundaries of the area claimed of native title or in the alternative. An application to be registered may be certified by a representative body. Amendment 200 improves the workability by allowing replacement of the authorised claimant. Amendments 201 and 202 ensure that claims for a determination only do not have to be considered for registration.</para><para>Regarding amendment 203, if a section 29 notice is served the applicant may seek registration in respect of the area covered by the notice. Under amendment 204, application may be amended in any way but only if authorised by the group, so nobody else can force them to do that. Amendment 205 is a minor consequential amendment. Amendment 207 is a consequential amendment to ensure that claims for a determination only do not have to be considered for registration. Amendment 210 allows substitution of the applicant. Amendment 211 leaves the courts some flexibility in deciding whether to amalgamate overlapping claims.</para><para>These are about workability. Funnily enough, nearly all of the so-called workability provisions in this bill are about removing rights. These are amendments that try to work on enabling indigenous Australians to establish their claims.

 to take account of native title determination applications that are covered by sections 47, 47A or 47B, which allow certain extinguishing acts to be ignored in special circumstances.</para><para>The sunset period will continue to be six years, but the time from which it starts to run will vary, depending upon the kind of application involved. In the case of an application which only covers an area to which 47A or 47B would apply, the six years starts to run from when it could reasonably be known that an application could be made under either one of those sections. In the case of an application that only covers an area of land to which 47 would apply, the six years starts to run from either the commencement of subsection 13(1)A or from when it could reasonably be known that an application could be made under section 47, whichever occurs later. In other words, the six years does not commence until those conditions are met.</para><para>Government amendments 62, 63 and 64 deal with who may be parties to native title proceedings before the Federal Court. These amendments are aimed at streamlining the court's processes for determining native title claims by rationalising the number of parties to native title proceedings.</para><para>Government amendment 65 inserts a note to subsection 84(C)1 which deals with the making of strike-out applications to the Federal Court. The amendment does not alter the Federal Court's strike-out powers. It simply makes it clear that a native title determination application may be amended, even if a strike-out application has been made in relation to that application. Claimants who have made an application that is the subject of a strike-out motion should be encouraged to amend their application as soon as possible so that it does comply with the act, and avoid the costs and delays in having the Federal Court hear the strike-out motion. I think that amendment is relevant to our previous discussion. I commend those amendments.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>2304</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This is an area where the whole question of workability and certainty is important and it is one where the government has dropped the ball. We have to work on the 
 basis that native title pre-exists the Native Title Act. To the extent that the government does not accommodate legitimate interests for native title or unfairly denies them access, there will be uncertainty. To the extent, then, that the government does not allow for complementary interests to be pursued under the act, those interests will go outside the act.</para></talk.start><para>We think, as we thought last time, that the government's proposals were unnecessarily restrictive in the way that the claims process can be pursued. I will go to the sunset clause aspects of it later. In respect of the non-sunset clause aspects of this debate, and the question of parties, government amendments—No. 62, for instance—accommodate the concerns that opposition 249 raised when it was accepted by the Senate last year but rejected by the House of Representatives. Amendment 249 sought to restrict non-native title parties who could join a native title application to those who actually held an interest in relation to the land or waters concerned, but it left open the possibility of persons seeking to be joined as parties on the basis of a public right of access only if the relevant minister was not already party to a proceeding.</para><para>We were concerned not to have uncontrollable actions propelled by a whole range of persons who may not have a direct interest in the matter being party to them. Amendment 62 reinstates the position of the current Native Title Act which has been widely interpreted by the courts, but it is an improvement on the government's bill. We support 62. We support 63 and 64. Once again, opposition amendments on the same matter are reflected in these government amendments, especially in respect to 64 where the Federal Court has capacity to remove parties in those circumstances where those parties' interests are already being properly represented.</para><para>In terms of the strike-out application, this amendment 65 is in response to opposition 251 which was rejected by the Senate. Discussions have led to 65 being in a form acceptable to us.</para><para>Let me turn to the sunset clause. I said it last time and I say it again today: you cannot be serious in pursuing this clause in the bill. The native title bill is there to provide certain 
 ty of process and certainty of time lines. That is why it is there. If we are going to be honest about it, everyone knows that if you wipe out the native title bill, you will still have native title claims. But what the parliament deemed it necessary to do, and what the parliament continues to deem it necessary to do, is to provide a proper process for those claims to be handled; a proper, workable process that gives you time lines of three months for expedited acts to be considered and six months in respect of negotiations. You cannot get that sort of time line under the common law. You probably could not get to base one in the Federal Court under the common law within a six month period. It is important that we maintain a process-driven piece of legislation to ensure that native title claims can be handled in the best processes possible.</para><para>We say that what the government has put up are not the best processes possible but, in any event, they do provide certainty to the stakeholders this government pretends to represent. In those circumstances, to try to get rid of an act like this in six years is nonsensical, especially when one considers how long it takes for claims to be pursued under the common law. This whole process started with Koowarta in the early 1970s: 26 years later, we are still dealing with the common law; yet you are suggesting a six-year sunset clause—a rigid sunset clause which posed no due consideration to any evolving factors and matters. We say it is undesirable, unworkable and a con job on the public. We know why it is being moved—so backbenchers can go into their electorates and say, `We are going to put an end to this, we are going to fix it up so that in six years there will be no more claims.' Well that is a lot of bunkum and the government ought to be honest about it and should not be pursuing this clause.</para><para>But what they do is come up with another one, based on times starting to run in relation to pastoral leases, vacant Crown leases and so on. The government's amendment replaces subsection 1A, and the net effect of the amendment is to narrow the operation of the sunset clause so the applications under sections 47, 47A and 47B must be brought 
 within six years of the earliest date upon which they could be made; that is, time starts running in relation to pastoral leases and so on from the time that the pastoral lease is purchased by the native title holder, or at which it could reasonably be known that a reserve has been created, or land has become vacant Crown land.</para><para>One of the things that amazes me about this initiative of the government's is that somehow it manages to ignore a very important body of case law, which Senator Harradine, Senator Margetts and I, probably more than anyone else in this place, would be aware of. When we started clocks running in migration legislation, the Federal Court and the High Court brought in, as they should have, the concepts of natural justice and admin law. Just because a piece of legislation says, `The clock starts running now', that does not mean it runs as determined, because it is subject to those common law principles of fairness, the admin law principles. We had clocks running, as we thought, with people in detention, but the courts held that, because of lack of notification, because of lack of knowledge, because of lack of due process, the clock that the legislation deemed to start did not start.</para><para>Why is it that this lesson has not been learnt by the government? I for one learnt it. I am sure other senators in this place learnt it. What you have here is an unworkable clock system, an unworkable time running system. I would have thought that in that body corporate of the Attorney-General's Department there would have been some attention paid to those principles of common law that the highest courts in this country have attached to concepts of clocks running, time running and reasonable knowledge that that is the case.</para><para>So it is an unworkable proposal that you put up here—unworkable because it does not factor in the requirements of the highest laws of this country. I do not think this clause will do anything but create another body of law piggybacked on the body of migration law, and I think it will provide more uncertainty, not just because of that factor but also because, when the courts determine that the clock is to start running, what infrastructure can we guarantee will be there to handle that? 
 You want another generation of court cases? Hey, presto, you have given people one with this provision.</para><para>So we say that if the government wants a bit of flexibility, recognising all those arguments I have put, let us be balanced in this, let us not predetermine now what the situation will be in six years time. Let us adopt a flexible mechanism. That is reflected in my amendment N33—an amendment which is an alternative to the removal of the sunset clause. The amendment says that the operative sunset clause will remain in the act but it will not apply unless there is a determination of each house of parliament approving a determination by the minister that it should apply.</para><para>So somewhere down the track when the parliament has had an opportunity to consider how the law is operating and whether it needs to continue to operate, let both houses of parliament then make an assessment as to the desirability of the law continuing. That gives you a bit of flexibility and a flexibility that should be important in your considerations. As we say on this side, this is very much a shame debate, but to accommodate some of the government's concerns—as this side of the debate seems to be doing on every particular point—let us give some due consideration to this model, a model which allows the parliament a role in the process, a role in the determination as to whether the Native Title Act still needs to continue.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>2306</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I wonder what the reaction would be if what was being moved here was not a guillotine on the rights of indigenous people but one on the rights of leaseholders around the country. I wonder what the reaction would be if the government were proposing, for example, in a more conciliatory direction, that all leaseholders should sort out an agreement in the future with indigenous claimants and that those who have not done so within six years would lose their lease entitlements. That is the reverse to this. This is saying, `If a native title claim has not been acknowledged within the next six years and arrangements made as to how that is going to work in relation to leaseholders, the lease is null and void.' There would be pandemonium. People 
 would be horror-struck at the idea that such summary injustice could be dealt out. But that is what the government is doing to the indigenous people here. It is saying, `If the claim has not been made within six years, bang, down comes the guillotine on all your rights forever.' As Senator Bolkus says, it ignores the common law right that exists.</para></talk.start><para>We had Senator Minchin saying a while ago, `It is our common law'—as if it is something that belongs to the white community in Australia—`which is recognising native title.' Nothing of the sort. It is common law recognising that it was wrong not to have acknowledged native title over the last 200 years. But native title always existed. In Senator Minchin's words, we have got to the point where the government says, `Our common law is recognising native title', and it sees this not as a recognition which is now part of the justice of this country but simply as a window of opportunity. And you slam shut the window six years down the line and go back to the situation that has always been there of denying the common law rights of the indigenous people. What an extraordinary thing to do. Senator Minchin says, `We are giving land back to the indigenous people', totally ignoring the injustice of the whole thinking behind that—that there is something to give back, when in fact the indigenous people have that native title and it has been there all the time. It is not only extraordinary; it is patronising.</para><para>The sad thing about it is that there is a mental block involved. There is a simple mental incapacity to understand the injustice that is involved in that language. As Senator Woodley said, language means a lot, but behind language is a course of thinking. The extraordinary thing is that the government here is saying, essentially, `We are going to revert back to where we were before Mabo. We are going to bring down the guillotine and cut off the right of indigenous people to have recognised that they have an ongoing relationship with the land.' That is totally unjust.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>2306</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—What we are dealing with here is the claims process and the sunset clause.

After all that has been said over time and all the nice words, the Labor Party is saying that they are agreeing to a sunset clause.</para></talk.start><para>Of course, the Democrats-Greens (WA) amendment 190 is the same as the opposition amendments. I recognise that, but here we have almost a guarantee that, if there is a change of government, there is nothing that would indicate that Labor would remove a sunset clause. It is not good enough to say, `We will have to put it through both houses of parliament.' What are we going to get at the moment on Aboriginal issues? Who is going to guarantee justice for Aboriginal people in both houses of the parliament at the moment, given the current votes on these issues?</para><para>I will not be moving all of the amendments that are down for the Greens (WA) and Democrats in this section. The position of the Senate is becoming quite clear in relation to many of these issues, but there are some groups of amendments that I will be moving. Amendments 192 and 333 are to knock out the nasty areas which, in fact, Senator Harradine supported and helped the government get through last time—that is, a sunset clause on compensation—which is hard to understand.</para><para>Our amendment 213 is to omit section 82, and that is in relation to the Federal Court's way of operating: it will allow it to take into consideration cultural and customary concerns. We know that this is very important. We have had a number of debates about the importance of these issues. The word `Hindmarsh' should spring to mind as to why is it so important that we do not stop the Federal Court from being able to take these issues into consideration. Currently the bill does not enable the Federal Court to do that any more than with any other claimant. That means that, if pastoral leaseholders or miners 
 do not have cultural issues in relation to families or spiritual connection, then the court will find it difficult, if not impossible, to take those issues into consideration for native title holders, and that, of course, is ridiculous.</para><para>Amendment 222, which is to oppose item 25, does a similar thing in relation to the National Native Title Tribunal: not to force them, but to allow them to take into consideration traditional cultural and customary concerns. Our amendment 222A to oppose item 26A is in relation to the area we debated last time where the government has decided, just like that, that the head of the National Native Title Tribunal no longer has to be a judge.</para><para>These are the issues. We are not going to remove the rest because it is quite clear what the pattern has become, but it is important for us to move on these particular areas. What we are seeing today seems to be a product of the Queensland election, just as what we saw in the past in relation to Hindmarsh was a product of a South Australian election. That is a very sad way to be making decisions in relation to basic justice for indigenous Australians.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>2307</page.no><name role="metadata">Woodley, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WOODLEY</name><name.id>HX5</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I will try not to repeat what Senator Margetts and Senator Bolkus have said, but I probably will overlap to a certain extent. I do want to make a couple of comments, and this is the appropriate place to do it. We are dealing with the claims process and the sunset clause. The claims process sets up the machinery in which the Native Title Act facilitates the claiming and later the determination of native title. It could rightly be called the gatekeeper provisions of native title. In part, the government amendments put in place what have come to be called the Brandy amendments. However, the amendments go too far. It is the view of the Australian Democrats that the inclusion of a sunset clause underlines exactly what this government really thinks about native title. I agree with Senator Bolkus when he says, `Are they really serious?'</para></talk.start><para>It is an astounding statement to say that indigenous people, after 210 years of dispossession, should effectively get their house in 
 order and help us, in six years, to solve the problem we created. Is it because we somehow or other consider this whole Mabo and Wik issue, and all the rest of it, simply an annoyance and that it would be good if we could somehow or other get rid of it? As I said previously, we have 210 years of history to deal with and it is going to take some time. Six years to solve the problem! Senator Bolkus is right: are they really serious?</para><para>The sunset clause represents a turning back of the clock. There would be some senators here who would remember the pictures of the abject poverty of indigenous people that shocked much of middle Australia and brought forth their support for the 1967 referendum.

To a large extent that has been the hallmark of indigenous and non-indigenous Australians—a form of forced visibility. The Mabo decision, in legal terms at least, made Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people visible. That is what getting rid of terra nullius was about. After only five years in the sun, the Australian Democrats will not allow indigenous people to be sunsetted, enforceable by this government.</para><para>I have a couple of comments on some of the other Democrats-Greens (WA) amendments, particularly those amendments which deal with working out cross claims. It is 
 important to note here that it is possible for native title rights to be overlapping. For example, some native title rights may include the right to conduct ceremony and others may include the right to fish or camp. This empowers the Federal Court to assist in making determinations that will facilitate the necessary flexibility to ensure that justice can be effected. The Democrats, of course, will support these amendments.</para><para>Another amendment deals with expanding the flexibility of the court to deal with overlapping claims. It deals with the complexity of overlapping claims which, in part, have been caused by catastrophic events such as stolen generations. In Queensland, the transportation of people for generations from one part of the state to another caused an incredibly complex mix of people, as did the forcing of people into communities. Most communities have an incredible complexity of ancestry.</para><para>Last time when I made this speech I read the comments of Professor Marcia Langton. While I will not repeat all of what she said, her conclusion, I think, in speaking before the Joint Committee on Native Title in Darwin, is very important.

 the occasions to which Senator Bolkus referred in respect of the immigration matters.

I make it perfectly clear that I am not going to support the proposition that the clause be taken out, but I indicate that I will be supporting the proposition that is being put forward by Senator Bolkus in the event that the clause stands. He has put forward a proposition that both houses of parliament be involved prior to the minister making a determination that a particular application should be subject to 4A.</para><para>I think that does bring the parliament back into the process and, in the final analysis, I hope that the government will accept that in the manner in which I believe Senator Bolkus put it forward.

I believe it is a reasonable attempt to meet the concerns of the government in respect of this matter.</para><para>If it clarifies anything at all, I will be voting for government amendment 61, and I will be voting that the clause stand as printed, and then I will be supporting opposition amendment N33.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>2309</page.no><name role="metadata">Minchin, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator MINCHIN</name><name.id>JX4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State;Minister Assisting the Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to briefly comment on the generality of the sunset clause and on some of the comments made. I acknowledge the opposition from some parts of the chamber to this. From the government's point of view, we think that it is perfectly reasonable to propose that, six years from the date of this legislation becoming law, there be a sunset on further applications. That is against the backdrop of several factors. Firstly, after nearly four years of operation of the Native Title Act, nearly 750 claims have already been made. They cover over 50 per cent of Australia, so at least two-thirds of what we believe is the claimable area of Australia is already under claim. We are saying that those who have not yet made 
 a claim have another six years in which to lodge an application with the Federal Court. That will make a total of 10 years, in the first four of which over half the country is under claim.</para></talk.start><para>We have to say time and time again that this does not in any way affect the common law right to make native title claims in the courts of Australia—as has, of course, been the case from the time of the Mabo decision itself. From that day forth, native title claimants who felt they held native title were able to come to the courts of Australia. It was not until a year and a half later that the Native Title Act was in existence. The situation that pertained from Mabo through to the end of 1993 will pertain for time immemorial. Native title claims, as a matter of common law, can be made forever. Against that backdrop, we do not think it is unreasonable to say to those claimants who have not yet made a claim—and, as I say, I do not know how many more there are likely to be—that we want you to make your application within that six-year time frame. You do not have to lodge the claim until the six years comes up in 2004. As long as your claim is lodged by then, your claim will be dealt with through the processes of the Native Title Act for as long as it takes. The claim will always be there on the register; the whole right to negotiate process or the procedural rights will all attach. The whole structure will continue because the six-year time limit on compensation claims does not start to run until the compensable act occurs, and that could be any number of years down the track.</para><para>The whole structure will continue, contrary to what Senator Bolkus is suggesting: that somehow there will not be a structure there to deal with this. We anticipate that, even with this six-year sunset, the whole apparatus set up under the Native Title Act will continue for a very long time, and the right to make common law native title claims will continue absolutely forever and will not be affected by this process.</para><para>We think it is reasonable, and we think the Australian people think it is perfectly reasonable, to say that we want those who wish to make their claims under the auspices of the 
 Native Title Act to lodge their applications by April 2004. I make those comments in respect of Senator Brown's comments about wiping out rights. As I say, common law rights are not wiped out. The Native Title Act is a statutory creation and the statutory rights will continue for all claims lodged in that time frame. The whole structure continues.</para><para>Senator Brown talked about leaseholders. Of course, leaseholders around Australia can have their rights taken away from them at any time by governments—and governments do that. Statutory rights—given, bought, whatever—held by leaseholders are probably taken away from them every day of the week by governments. There have been some very celebrated cases of that kind. On the one hand, no, we are not taking away common law rights to claim native title. On the other hand, to say that somehow native titleholders are being dealt with prejudicially is not correct. The fact is that, as a matter of law, the property rights of statutory titleholders are dealt with by the laws of this land, as they are in every other country.</para><para>That is the backdrop to this. We think that opposition amendment N33, which is some sort of modification to this, is really no modification at all; it is just the removal of the sunset clause using different words. What is being proposed is that the minister would be required to make a determination in respect of every single application, that they would seek to have the sunset applied to that application and then get both houses to agree. We think that is something of a charade and we cannot support it.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>2310</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I totally agree with Senator Margetts on this. What is happening here is that, whereas the Senate voted last time to throw this objectionable clause out, we are now facing a situation where the sands are shifting. Labor and Senator Harradine are coming up with a `leave it to the future' option, cutting the ground from under their stand of last December and conceding yet again more of the rights and hopes of indigenous people in this matter. They are setting up the guillotine to cut those rights off in six years time, as the government wants. Instead of dropping it with 
 certainty in six years, they are saying, `Well, we're going to pull the guillotine rope, haul the guillotine blade to the top of the scaffold and set the rope on fire. We'll give parliament a bucket of water to throw in six years if it wants to stop it at the last minute.'</para></talk.start><para>As Senator Margetts has pointed out, what would happen in this place given the mood at the moment? Bang! Down comes the guillotine. Once again the Greens and the Democrats are standing firm in throwing out this sunset clause—this attempt to cut out the indigenous people's rights in the year 2004, while Labor and Senator Harradine concede to the government. That is what is happening here.</para><para>For two centuries there has been a wall of denial of Aboriginal rights. Suddenly that denial has been removed. We thought that forever more indigenous people's rights would be recognised and processes would be available to them to have those rights recognised.	But, `Not so,' says the government, `we're going to build that wall from the year 2004 into the future.' So we have a continuing wall of denial with a six-year window in the middle of it. That is the best that is being conceded here. We will return to the past in the year 2004.</para><para>What Labor and Senator Harradine are saying is, `Oh, we will entertain that idea but we would like to put it off to till the year 2004 because we do not have the gumption to stand by our December decision now; we do not have the gumption to throw this out because it is objectionable and unfair to indigenous people.' It puts a date at which we go back to the past—pre-Mabo—and say that indigenous people then will not have the right, through these processes, to make application to have the claim to their land recognised. Senator Margetts says she is saddened by the process, and I know that she has chosen her words carefully there. I think it is pretty dastardly.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>2310</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Being in the crossfire, there are two or three points that I need to make to Senator Minchin in respect to his concern as to the language of the suggested 1B where we say `in relation to an application'. It is exactly the 
 language that is used in 1A, and the language in 1B is used to tie in with the language in 1A. So, if it is good enough for your sunset clause, it is good enough for the amendment that the opposition wishes to move for it. Your sunset clause applies to an application; ours also applies to an application.</para></talk.start><para>In respect of the other side of the debate, what is being put here is a continuing parliamentary oversight of the continuation of the Native Title Act. That is all that has been put up in this particular place. If a government can persuade both houses of parliament that there is no longer a need for the Native Title Act, then it is their obligation to do try to do that, and let us face it, they would have to be very persuasive to convince the Senate to that effect. There would have to be a good mounting body of evidence.</para><para>Presuming there is a double dissolution, for instance, I suppose all psephologists reckon that the government's numbers will go down substantially in this place. So, we are not talking about abdicating the role of the parliament. We are basically reinforcing the fact that the parliament has a continuing interest in this. Let us also place on record in this context the point I started off with: native title preceded, co-exists, and will continue long after any law of this parliament tries to control it. I think it is important to place that on the record in the context of the reaction that we may have had from this side of the parliament.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>2311</page.no><name role="metadata">Woodley, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WOODLEY</name><name.id>HX5</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am trying to work out what is going on, as a matter of fact, because the Senate was very clear last year that the sunset clause should go. There was no doubt about that. In fact, I think most commentators agree. As Senator Bolkus said before, `We did not really believe the government was serious.' For that reason, I do not even know why we are now considering some kind of fall-back position. I thought there was an absolutely firm position by all the opposition parties that the sunset clause should be opposed. It is of no benefit to the government, it introduces so many uncertainties, and why the government continues to press it is just beyond me. So it would seem to me that we should simply vote 
 against item No. 3 so that the sunset clause will disappear. All of sudden we are discussing some fall-back position. That means that there must have been some significant shift that I do not know about since last year.</para></talk.start><para>I have to say that in 1997, when the final amended bill was voted on by this Senate, the Democrats and Greens voted against it, because it was nowhere near what indigenous people needed in order to pursue their rights in this country, so we voted against it. Yet, in some way or other, even that position, which was totally inadequate, which was a betrayal of Aboriginal people and their rights, now seems to be under some kind of doubt. At the very beginning of this debate, the Democrats and Greens tried to have the 1997 position established—if you remember, we sought a vote on that. Now I think we are beginning to understand why even that 1997 position was under some threat. I thought that was the starting point—a starting point that was totally inadequate, but at least a starting point for us to seek to improve on that position.</para><para>But we are taking that 1997 position and eroding it. That is impossible. We cannot do that. In the name of justice and everything else—I am trying not to swear—I just cannot see how we can take the position that we arrived at in 1997 and in some way seek to erode that.</para><para>I hope the opposition parties will oppose the sunset clause and we will not continue this process—that I am not aware of but that seems to be going on—where we have fall back positions from that very inadequate position that we started with when the Senate, not the Democrats or the Greens, passed the 1997 amended bill.

I thought the 1997 position was totally iniquitous. This is not even close. This is buckets of extinguishment with loads of misunderstanding and extra injustice all lumped on top. All the promises made by the Labor Party and 
 the public statements made by Senator Harradine do not mean a thing when we deal with these kinds of issues. We did support knocking out this clause in 1997. It was unjust then; it is unjust now.</para></talk.start><para>This situation is very similar to the one we faced with the threshold test, except the players have just changed. Instead of Senator Harradine presenting something which the Labor Party could appear to be forced to support and then make it look as though everything was okay and they had done something for Aboriginal people, now we are doing exactly the opposite. Here we have the Labor Party saying, `This is our compromise amendment,' and Senator Harradine saying, `Yes, this is good enough,' and therefore the Senate looks as though it has done something for Aboriginal people, when in fact all it has done is sell them down the toilet. This is a disgrace.</para><para>Amendment N33 is a disgrace. It does nothing. It leaves the situation theoretically exactly like we have it now. It basically is not something that has ever been accepted by the various groups around Australia—the Australians for Native Title and Reconciliation or the National Indigenous Working Group—and I just wonder where the policy has come from within the Labor Party to sign up to something which is a sunset clause.</para><para>I do not feel inclined to allow this injustice to take place, to allow people to take bows in the public arena and say, `Look what we've done for Aboriginal people. Okay, we've sold them out, but we could have sold them out worse.' Well, they are selling them out worse. Let us not pretend that this is not a massive sell out. Let us not even give it any dressing up. It is the Labor Party coming to a nice little arrangement and Senator Harradine and the government making a nice bit of theatre: `Yes, we'll say no in this House. It'll go to the House of Representatives and we'll touch our brow and say, "Yes, it's closer to our position. We've got a sunset clause, we'll accept it."' That is why everybody in this area of the chamber is so outraged.</para><para>But guess what? We have not fallen for this. Indigenous people are not falling for this. It is not good enough. We are not giving the 
 opposition the okay for them to do this in years to come. We are not giving you any indication if you get back into government that you can do the same and same and same again. How could I? After listening to the people who have pleaded with me to make sure that justice and fairness are part of this bill, how could I give you that ability to say, `We've looked in our conscience and this is what we've come up with'? No, I am sorry. This is not justice. The Labor Party could have said to Senator Harradine, `If you want to support this, you're on your own.' But, no, they have sold themselves down. They can do it.

The only people who have been engaging in theatricals in this particular debate have been Senator Brown and Senator Margetts. That is to the detriment of the indigenous peoples of Australia; indeed, it is to the detriment of all of the other stakeholders, the community in general and reconciliation. Unless there is legislation which is fair, reasonable, workable and indeed honourable, we are not going to have reconciliation in this country to the extent that we desire it.</para></talk.start><para>What we need is a workable situation. I voted against the sunset clause as it stood then, and that was the sunset clause that was included in the original Native Title Amendment Bill. Even the government believed that particular clause was inadequate, because its amendment 61 has specified the times at which the clock will start ticking. It has done this, recognising some of the points that have been made to the government by not only indigenous persons but also others who want to see a workable outcome.</para><para>It is all very well for Senator Brown and Senator Margetts to carry on with their theatricals, but they have to have a look at what is workable. It is all very well for Senator Brown to carry on with his theatricals about the Senate now cutting down indigenous people's rights and cutting them off after the year 2004. That is an absolute nonsense. It shows, as I have said before in this debate, 
 his complete ignorance of the basics of native title. I wish that, when he comes into this chamber, he would give a little bit of consideration to what he is saying. We all get very emotional about this matter, but what we have to do in this chamber is exercise our function of review of government legislation and stand up for the rights of individuals and, indeed, of the community at large. That is what I am trying to do. I believe that is what most honourable senators are trying to do.</para><para> It is not that we are going to establish a wall of denial from the year 2004 against native title rights—not at all. As has been indicated to the chamber by others, these are procedural matters to try to establish procedures which can work to the benefit of the stakeholders, particularly to the benefit of the native title holders and claimants. That is why we have been laboriously going through this legislation, not only in December but also now. We are not going to, as Senator Brown said, turn back to the past pre-Mabo. Does anybody believe that? Does anybody here in this chamber, in the gallery or listening to the debate believe that? Of course they do not, because it is absolute nonsense.</para><para>I would now like to bring to the notice of the chamber precisely what effect is being desired by opposition amendment N33. All right, the Prime Minister has said that one of his sticking points is the sunset clause. First of all, he has moved a bit away from where he was in December because the government's amendment is moving away from that. But I think we do have to take account of statements that emanate from the Prime Minister of Australia on behalf of the government and, if possible, amend provisions which would enable the government and others ultimately to live with the legislation and ensure that it is pursued vigorously on behalf of those whom we represent, particularly indigenous Australians. Let us see whether we can introduce those amendments. This is why I am going to support Senator Bolkus's amendment.</para><para>Subsection 1A says that no application is allowed to be made under paragraph 1A later than six years after the commencement of this subsection. Then, of course, you have that 
 amended by the government's amendment which ameliorates that even further. Senator Bolkus and the opposition's amendment is that subsection 1A does not apply in relation to an application for a determination of native title until each house of the parliament has approved the determination by the minister that it should apply.

Bear this in mind: we are reaching a very critical stage today and, if you are going along your line, you are definitely saying to everybody—the Aboriginal people in Australia and everybody else—`You've got no hope of getting this measure 
 up.'

Who would have thought that Labor and Senator Harradine would be in here doing it again, this double-step whereby Senator Harradine first of all says to us, `Let's have the government amendment passed first up, then we'll get on with the Greens-Democrats amendment to get rid of the sunset clause.' Having got the government amendment passed, he says, `Well, the government's moved some direction; we've got to move some direction towards them.' That is, we will not be supporting the Greens-Democrats amendment to get rid of this sunset clause. That was his position four months ago. That is a position he is selling out now. That was Labor's position four months ago. That is one we are not going to see get through now.</para></talk.start><para>What is happening here is a repeat of the threshold test double-shuffle. What happens is that Labor comes in and says, `We'll support the stronger position, but then we'll see Senator Harradine support the government to get up the weak position.' That is, our weak position. That is what is going to happen. They will say, `We will go for the weaker position.' And if the Greens and Democrats do not support that, the government will prevail. It is the same thing as the other night. Is it going to happen with the right to negotiate? I suspect some sort of similar arrangement will be brought in—that is, an injunction to the Greens and Democrats that `If you don't go with us to a weaker position which gives the government the ability to entertain accepting this legislation from the Senate, then you are doing the wrong thing.'</para><para>I am saying to Labor and to Senator Harradine: you are doing the wrong thing. 
 You are aiding and abetting the government in getting what it wants.

In this situation it is a matter of saying, `In six years, the guillotine drops on your rights.'</para><para>It is all right to get up in this place and say, `Oh, the common law rights will still be there.' This legislation is to facilitate the application of the indigenous people to have recognition of their rights. What we are saying is that in six years time, remove the facility. I ask Senator Bolkus and Senator Harradine this: why can't you dispense with this now? Why be so gutless as to say, `Let's put it off to another set of parliamentarians three, four or five years down the line.' If you will not stand for it now, why should the indigenous people believe you are going to stand for it then? Let us be clear that what you are saying is, `Let's give the government what it wants'—as Senator Harradine said, `If they want their sunset clause, let them have it'—so you can help get the legislation through now with a caveat that says, `We'll revisit the potential for a sunset clause further down the line.'</para><para>Whatever you might get up and say to try to justify this perfidy on your position of last December—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>6H4</name.id><name role="metadata">HARRADINE</name><name role="display">Senator Harradine</name></talker><para>—Haven't you heard of a Clayton's sunset clause?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>QD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name></talker><para>—Well, there we go—a `Clayton's sunset clause'.

So if this government were to get the numbers in the next parliament, they could override any position taken in this legislation today. You know that. That is exactly why we are here now amending the 1993 Native Title Act. Had we been able then to entrench the Native Title Act, you would not be able to amend it now. It is a very basic fundamental principle of law. If anyone was to understand that, they would understand that what we are doing with this amendment is making it very clear that, for a government to trigger in a sunset clause, it must have the numbers in both houses of the parliament.

I do not understand why it is about to be jettisoned. No-one has given me any reasons that I am prepared to accept as to why we should jettison the 1997 position which, as I said, was nevertheless a position which was unacceptable to indigenous people.</para><para>This is one of the so-called four sticking points for the government. I deliberately asked the minister the other day: if the RDA clause was attached to the Native Title Amendment Bill, would the government accept that? The minister very frankly answered me that, no, they would not. So quite clearly, the trigger for a double dissolution is already in place.</para><para>When Senator Harradine says to me, `Do you want a double dissolution?', I say that that is not in my hands. The government has already indicated that the trigger is in place and whenever this goes back to the House of Representatives they will ensure that that trigger is there. So it is not an argument to say, `Do you want a double dissolution?' In any case, that is not in my hands. It is not something which I can determine; it is something which the government has to determine. But in terms of the trigger, the government has indicated under the RDA clause that that trigger is already there. It is just a matter of hours or days and the House of Representatives is going to put the trigger in place.</para><para>That is not a reason to have a fall-back position: `Do you want a double dissolution election?' It has got nothing to do with it. That is already in train. If I am wrong, Senator Harradine, please correct me, but it seems to me that you are not going to vote for opposition amendment 223 and Greens- Democrat amendment 190, which is to knock out the sunset clause.</para><para>I presume the ALP is going to vote for that in the knowledge that they will not lose it. Therefore, somewhere along the line, it seems 
 that people have got together and decided—and, by the way, I was not part of that discussion—`We know what is going to happen so we have to put in place a fall back position.

We are going to have the government talking about how the courts are tied up. The reason the government will be talking about that is that people are going to be forced to make claims when they would otherwise not have had to put themselves through that expensive legal process if there did not seem to be anything happening on land which seemed to be a threat which required them to legally participate in such things as the right to negotiate.</para></talk.start><para>There are many groups around Australia that have told me that they generally keep an eye on their traditional lands and it is no accident that they are part of a process when there is development looming because they need to be concerned and need to be consulted. What is being forgotten is the whole concept of a sunset clause. Whether or not Senator Harradine believes it is a pretend sunset clause does not matter. There has been a lot of pretence in this debate. A lot of that relates to whether or not what we are doing is actually going to be fair and just for Aboriginal people.</para><para>What we would have is that every single group, every single clan has to go through the claim process for every potential claim on an area around Australia on the basis that some time in the future we are going to close the door. What an extraordinary and stupid thing for us to do. That is the principle. It is not about pretence or what we are going to do in the future. We are setting in train a situation where people are going to have to put in a claim. They are going to have to put themselves to this expense.</para><para>We have been told that if they do not get their claim right, they go through all this extremely expensive process and the government—and Senator Harradine supported them—can knock them out on a technicality. They are going to have to start again. In six 
 years time, they may well have gone through this process but made three mistakes and they run out of time. Do they have to come to the parliament each time this kind of process occurs? This principle is not acceptable. What we are going to do to the people on the ground by way of this sunset clause is not acceptable.</para><para>It has taken 210 years to decide whether or not we are even going to think about recognising native title and we are saying that they have to have all their claims in in six years. This is outrageous. In other parts of the world they are going through the process of talking through treaties with their indigenous people and those treaty discussions are rightly taking decades because they need to be right. The Australian government needs to talk with each of the indigenous groups in this country.</para><para>We are going through the process of setting a sunset clause—a Claytons sunset clause, as Senator Harradine says, or a pretence, if that is what Senator Bolkus is saying. They are saying that whatever decisions we now make can be rescinded in the future. We know that. What is this opposition going to do in the future if they put their stamp to a sunset clause now?</para><para>The ALP said in the past that they would not be supporting a sunset clause and now they are saying that they are going to support an amendment which allows that to happen. When Senator Bolkus says, `We will not be supporting that in the future,' what kind of credibility does that leave them with? They said, `We will stand firm. These are points that we will not move on.' Look what they have done.</para><para>We are leaving that over the heads of indigenous people. We are making sure that the court system, the inadequate processing system, the inadequate resources are all going to be stretched to their absolute limits and beyond because absolutely everybody who does not know at this point in time that their lands might be threatened by future development will be forced to put in a claim of some sort on the basis that at some time in the future they are going to need it. That is ridiculous. No way in the world should we be 
 supporting that. The Labor Party said they will.</para><para>Does this make this legislation acceptable? Does this make this legislation anywhere near the revolting, inadequate 1997 legislation? If that is what the Labor Party thinks, they have a very different idea than I do of what is equity. They have a very different idea of what is acceptable. I would think by this stage they must realise that the legislation, even from their point of view, has to be voted down.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>2318</page.no><name role="metadata">Woodley, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WOODLEY</name><name.id>HX5</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Senator Harradine may be prepared to help us here.

Well, Senator Bolkus and gutless Labor Party, we are not coming with you at all. We went as far as we were going to go in December last year. We are listening to what the indigenous people have to say on this, which is to hold the line at this point.</para><para>The theory behind what Senator Harradine says—and I cannot understand why you have not worked this out; maybe you have and maybe it is your own theory as well—is that what we have to try to do here is go as close as we can to the Howard government's 10-point plan to avoid a double dissolution and a joint house sitting next year which will put the neat 10-point plan through. Code: let's put the 10-point plan through now with a little bit of tinsel and dressing on it and let's sell out the indigenous people in doing that. Well, we are not going to. This vote today is another step towards a clear enforcement of the principles behind the 10-point plan.</para><para>Senator Minchin sits over there and says, `Look at all the other people disagreeing on this.' But he must be very pleased, not about the Greens and Democrats holding firm—that has always been a threat to him and he does not like to hear his 10-point plan labelled for what it is—but to see the backflips, backsliding, weak-kneed approach, this let's find a point which is going to be acceptable to the government manoeuvring which is going on on the other non-government benches.</para><para>Senator Harradine, your position last year was fair, honourable and reasonable. The position to which you have moved is unfair, dishonourable and unreasonable. There has to be a line drawn somewhere. As Senator Margetts said, we felt the position in Decem 
 ber last year was untenable. That is why we voted against the legislation, despite the amendments.</para><para>To go further on the four points, remember this: even on the RDA, the Labor Party and Senator Harradine would not vote for an amendment which made sure the RDA prevailed over all the components of this legislation. They went for a weak second position there. If the government gets its way with an acceptable arrangement on the other three points, I wonder if we will not see the RDA revisited, as Senator Woodley pointed out. Senator Harradine, you said that for the indigenous people the clock will start ticking.

Earlier on, almost as soon as we started giving an indication that we would continue to vote in the way we had indicated on this issue, even though the Labor Party have said that they will support a sunset clause, they were spin

It is as clear as crystal that, in effect, the sunset clause will not come into effect until such time as both houses of parliament agree. I do not want to canvass what we discussed a while ago—I cannot remember how long—on this particular matter. This is the opportunity for the Greens and the Democrats to support this particular motion, which would then mean that the provision would be able to satisfy the test of just, fair, honourable and reasonable legislation in respect of the sunset clause.</para></talk.start><para>I do hope that the Greens do not take that `cut off your nose to spite your face' attitude that they took when I moved the amendment to the threshold test provisions, wherein I attempted to be able to include the stolen generation and those indigenous land-holders who were locked out by pastoralists in the past. On that occasion, the Greens voted against my amendment which would have opened the gates for those indigenous people in Australia for whom the gates were locked, and would have covered the stolen generation.</para><para>I do appeal to them not to take the dog in the manger attitude that they are adopting at the present moment, to recognise that we are in a serious situation here with the possibility of getting some type of legislation through 
 which will meet those tests that I mentioned and, in this particular regard, recognise that this was one of the sticking points and that this is one of the ways of getting around that sticking point.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>2321</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I give Senator Harradine credit for greater intelligence than for having us believe that the parameters he is using here are truly ones of trying to reach a fair, honourable and reasonable middle point. That was his position last December—that that was fair, honourable and reasonable.</para></talk.start><para>Now he is coming in with a different stipulation, which is that we must move towards an accommodation with the government. He is saying to the Greens and Democrats, `If you don't move to give the Howard government more of what it wants, you're a dog in the manger.' What absolute gall he has when he tries to dress up his unforgivable welching on the position of last December, and then points the finger across the chamber to people who are standing firm for indigenous rights and says, `You're the dog in the manger.' It is not hard to work out what is happening here. Dressed up in this pious, fair, honourable, reasonable cloak is a sell-out of the indigenous people.</para><para>Somebody came up to me on the lawns of Parliament House last week and said, `Look at Senator Harradine. This means he is going with us, doesn't it?' I reserve judgment. But I do not think too many people will be dancing at this outcome. Certainly not too many indigenous people will be dancing with joy at what Senator Harradine is doing today, because it is blighting the expectations that came out of that performance last week.</para><para>I suppose, in his own way, Senator Harradine—who has been working for all those hours and hours that we have heard about, and all of us have been doing the same in recent weeks—thought, `Here is the plan: the Greens and Democrats will have no option but to come with me to the Promised Land of an accommodation with the Howard government.' In his terms, it is objectionable legislation.</para><para>Well, you calculated wrongly, Senator Harradine. Madam Chair, it shows political 
 ineptness not to have tried this on us weeks ago. It was a plan for failure from the outset. When you start caving in to a government which is going beyond where we went last year, when you start caving in to a government which has race-based election threats hanging over everybody, you have to be prepared to go all the way. If we start going in this direction with Senator Harradine, backing up motions which have been put by the Labor Party for his facility, then you end up moving further and further down the track.</para><para>Of this Labor Party amendment, Senator Harradine says, `Oh well, it is not a sunset clause that is watertight. It means that the parliament, somewhere down the line, can decide whether it will actually give it the final tick.' Make no bones about it: through this capitulating amendment of the Labor Party, we are being asked to vote for a sunset clause. It is not good enough to say, `Let's hope that a parliament further down the line will look at this again in some different light.' If Labor and Senator Harradine cannot stand firm on this now, why should we expect they will be any different three or four years down the line? Of course they will not be. The test is here and now, not three or four years down the line.</para><para>So, once again, we will find, presumably, the Labor Party supporting its own sell-out amendment, and Senator Harradine will sit there and support it as well. If Labor had not put it up, he would not be doing this. The government will come over here and stick by the Prime Minister's `no move' principle. We might say—although I abhor his position—that so far he is not budging on that, unlike the Labor Party on this side which is budging. And over here the Greens and the Democrats will say, `We won't sell out further; we stand by where we were last year'—and we endorsed the arguments of Senator Harradine and the Labor Party when they said `No' to this in December. For us those arguments ring true, and we will hold our ground on that. The epithets from Senator Harradine trying to weaken our resolve so we will follow his weakening resolve simply will not work.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>2322</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—If it has not been evident in flashing 
 lights all morning, it should be evident right now that the decision for this Senate today on the sunset clause is not whether we have one but whether we give it approval now or whether we, as a Senate, as a parliament, have some control over when it comes into effect, if it in fact comes into effect at all. That is the decision that has been facing us for the last hour or two, and it is still the decision facing us now.</para></talk.start><para>It is not now a matter of whether we have a sunset clause, because that vote has been taken and the outcome is what we always thought it would be. In the legislation now there is a sunset clause. It has been accepted by this Senate.</para><para>The question that we have had to face all morning is does that sunset clause apply from the date of proclamation of this bill, or does it apply from next week, this week or after a double dissolution? I do not think, if there is an election, this government will have the numbers to be returned, but, if by some misfortune they are returned, they probably will not have the numbers to get it through a joint sitting.</para><para>The question before us is whether we want to have some control over when this clause comes into effect. The opposition proposal, despite all the bluster, basically says the body that should make the decision as to whether there is a sunset clause continues to ride shotgun over that decision. That body is the parliament. If the government cannot get a majority in both houses, it cannot trigger into operation the sunset clause. That is all we have been doing this morning.</para><para>I say to this committee that the decision on whether a sunset clause is in the legislation has been taken. Our decision now is whether we allow the government to have its way or whether we say that in the future we want a right to control the trigger. That is the decision that needs to be taken now.</para><para>There has been all this gumf about no-one believing me. I will not react to that other than to say that the guarantee is that the law will have to change, or both houses of parliament will have to take a deliberative decision to ensure that the sunset clause takes effect.

If there had been no amendment foreshadowed which gave Senator Harradine an opportunity to say, `I don't have to vote the sunset clause down now because later I will have the opportunity of an out,' he would have been forced to vote the sunset clause down to be consistent with his 1997 position. The problem is that putting up an out predetermined how the vote on the sunset clause would go. That is why Senator Margetts's suggestion was a very reasonable one: that we should vote for that amendment first so that we would know what the options were in terms of the sunset clause and whether or not we should vote it down.</para><para>The same thing happened the other night: the government, the Labor Party and Senator Harradine predetermined that the pressure would be on the Democrats and the Greens to vote in a certain way against their principles. We always have stood on the principle that the sunset clause is unacceptable. To give an opportunity for an out is the same. I recognise you voted against the sunset clause, but always in the knowledge that there was a fall-back position. I abhor the process which puts this kind of pressure on the minor parties, saying, `Well, you'll be the ones that will sell them down the drain if you don't vote for our fall-back position.'</para><para>It is incredible that we should be following this kind of process. This is one of the four so-called sticking points. It is as plain as the 
 nose on your face that people have discussed this whole issue prior to this debate. I am not going to say that deals have been done, but quite clearly a lot of people—not the Democrats and not the Greens—knew what they were going to do; they mapped out a process. What disappoints me so much is that we have not had a debate on the principles of whether or not a sunset clause without any kind of qualification should be the matter before the Senate.</para><para>I am very worried now about the whole issue of the right to negotiate. Will we have the same kind of process where there is a fall-back position and where the Democrats and the Greens will be put in the position of them saying, `Okay, if you don't vote for the fall-back position, then look out'? I am afraid Senator Margetts is right: we are aware that the Labor Party have already been in the gallery spinning their side of the story to try to make sure that they do not get any flak over this. I do not know if I even care about the gallery any more. I really do care about what we are doing. When you put into process these tricky kinds of processes to put pressure on us, it really makes me very angry and very disappointed.</para><para>At their national conference in Hobart, the Labor Party said they would keep faith with Wik.

The last time I rose in this chamber to discuss these matters, on 28 May 1997, I spoke of the conference's plans to fulfil its key role in coordinating the government's role in the International Year of Older Persons. This is the United Nations year to be held in 1999. I now wish to advise the Senate on our progress, particularly the success of the consultation process which has been pursued by the conference.</para></talk.start><para>For those who are not fully aware, there have been three approaches to the year. The Conference for Older Australians is a committee appointed by the Prime Minister, which he asked me to chair, and which is coordinating the Commonwealth's response to the international year. There is the Healthy Ageing Taskforce which is a task force of people from the states of Australia coordinating the 
 state responses to the international year. There is a group called Coalition `99, which has been formed from the non-government sector to develop the non-government sector's response to the international year. I have to report that there has been constant contact between those three groups to ensure that we have a coordinated approach, that we avoid duplication as much as possible and that we have a highly successful year.</para><para>The International Year of Disabled Persons was, I think, one of the most successful years. It was a year which many of us will remember, when breaking down the barriers was a theme which saw not only a celebration of the achievements and abilities of people with disabilities, but accessibility to the community opened up to people with disabilities, to buildings and to all sorts of other facilities, and also to areas such as employment, which had been neglected in previous years.</para><para>In the early 1980s we saw a great deal of advancement for people with disabilities and we saw a spin-off from the year. If, at the end of next year, I can say that we have had a year in which we have celebrated the contribution of older people to our community, and we have actually addressed issues that concern them that have long-term spin-offs and long-term effects, as did IYDP, then I will think that we have achieved something.</para><para>The Conference for Older Australians has adopted a four-pronged approach. The first is a process of consultation, of moving around the community and asking older people and people working with older people to address the sorts of things that they think could be achieved in the International Year of Older Persons. The second prong is to put in place a program of recognition which will hopefully involve House of Representatives people cooperating in an inter-generational approach of identifying older people in the community who are good examples of pioneers in life, who can set an example to all of us as we move on through life on the ways in which we can live, if we have our health, to a fulfilled and productive old age. Also, we will be looking towards the media to participate in the year to improve attitudes to older people.</para><para>The third prong of the approach is a whole of government approach. The Prime Minister wrote to every minister in the federal parliament asking them to look at their portfolios for aspects where they may able to initiate and/or adapt a program. I have met with almost all the ministers now on two occasions. I have been delighted at the response that they and the departments have given to the year, and the cooperation that they have shown in some very creative and innovative ideas that can be used in the year, not only for the year itself but to have long-term beneficial effects. I am very grateful to the ministers for the attention they have paid to that and for their cooperation.</para><para>The fourth part of our approach is a business and professional organisation and community partnership approach to involve business, professional organisations such as physios, OTs, nurses, podiatrists, dietitians, accountants—all the professions—and the community in partnerships on projects that may affect older people. So that is the four-pronged approach.</para><para>I want to talk just a bit about the planning for the year and then to speak briefly about the consultation approach. In planning for the year, the Conference for Older Australians has identified the following areas which require attention: (a) raising awareness among all Australians of the positive role older people can and do play in the community, and the potential for this role to expand; (b) addressing negative stereotypes about older people and ageing, and reinforcing positive images in the media and in the community; (c) celebrating the diversity and self reliance of Australia's older population; (d) fostering inter-generational interaction and understanding; (e) promoting a whole of government approach to issues of ageing, including encouraging policy directions and programs that are more responsive to the needs of older people; (f) encouraging research and planning to effectively and efficiently meet the present and future needs of Australia's ageing population; and (g) supporting broad and practical partnerships on ageing between the public and private sectors, between governments, and between local communities and individuals.</para><para>Let me just talk about the consultation process. The Conference for Older Australians wanted a consultation process in which they were actively hands-on involved, not a process in which a consultant would be employed, so we thought of a way of penetrating into the Australian community and we took a risky approach. I was told it was a risky approach; I was told by some sceptics that it most probably could have been a foolhardy approach.</para><para>I approached all of the members of the House of Representatives and all of the members of the Senate and asked them to nominate four people who would participate in a consultation process. Over 90 per cent of the members of parliament responded to that request. That means we have penetrated into the community at a level which would have been very difficult for a consultant who was taking it on as a consultancy, because we were able to use the local knowledge and the experiences particularly of the House of Representatives members, but senators assisted as well. The House of Representatives members have nominated people. Some members have been incredibly creative and have had consultations in their offices or around their electorates beforehand and have chosen people to come.</para><para>I just want to put on the public record my appreciation to all members of parliament who entrusted those representatives to us. We have fulfilled our obligation to them in carrying out those consultations in a bipartisan way. Politics have not been raised, and the level of contribution of those people in the community has been exciting to say the least. The members of the conference who have attended—not all the members go to each consultation—have come away from some of those consultations on a high, it is the only way I could describe it. After the consultation in Dubbo, I got a phone call from one of the conference members who said, `I've had the most fantastic day with the most fantastic group of people.'</para><para>We are halfway through the process. We have undertaken consultations in Canberra, Melbourne, Adelaide, Brisbane, Sydney, Newcastle, Dubbo and Townsville. In those 
 consultations, we have brought people in from all over the community. We made a decision that nobody should be unable to get there, so we offered assistance with travel to anybody who needed it. Nobody has been denied the ability to come because they could not afford to come or they were too far away. Even some of the consultations in Canberra, for example, were representative of people from around the Goulburn area and parts of western New South Wales. So we are tapping into rural and regional communities as well.</para><para>Next week we are going to Perth, and then the week after we are going to Caloundra, Coffs Harbour, Launceston, Traralgon, Ballarat and Wodonga. As well, we will be having a satellite link with the most remote and rural areas. We will be using technology to hook up people who have been nominated by their members of parliament in the most remote areas.</para><para>The issues that have been raised have been varied, but there has been a common theme coming through. There has been a concern about personal security and a fear of crime—in particular, a fear of crime involving scams or financial rorts, where people are tricked into recladding their houses and then somebody disappears with their deposit. What people have been saying is, `We need to be alerted to these scams. We need to be forewarned.'</para><para>There has particularly been a theme of requiring greater flexibility in building codes to, first of all, enable houses to be more easily adapted for older people. What the consultations have said is that every house will see at least one older generation in them and some houses will have many older generations inhabiting them, so the houses should be easily adaptable for someone who is older. That means studs should be in the right place to enable aids to be attached to the walls in appropriate places and that this ought to be thought about beforehand. It means there ought to be at least one toilet or bathroom that can be accessed by a wheelchair. And it means best practice planning would involve a pitch in at least one stairway—if there is access by a stairway to a single-storey house or a slightly raised building—that could have 
 a ramp over it so a wheelchair can manoeuvre over it.</para><para>They are very simple ideas, but they are the sorts of things coming through. It will not always be that government can deal with the issues that are raised. It may be that they will involve architects, businesses and local government, but we will be feeding these ideas back to the relevant communities.</para><para>Another thing that has come strongly through is attitudes to ageing. Almost every group without exception has been critical of the way in which older people are portrayed in the media. People have said that you see reports like, `A 35-year-old woman was involved in an accident,' and then, `An elderly person of 60 was involved in an accident.' Older people always have a qualification in front of their age, whereas younger people do not. Some older people also indicated that they feel that advertisers are sometimes less than sensitive towards their needs. Whether that is true or not, that is the perception that older people have and that is something that ought to be looked at. We ought to face that, and the media and the advertising industry need to address that.</para><para>Issues of employment of older people have come up, so has the need to value volunteerism. A lot of older people feel their voluntary efforts are not acknowledged in an appropriate way in the community. That is something every individual can do something about, as well as governments, business organisations and community organisations.</para><para>One other constant theme coming through the consultations has been access to technology. Many older people are very actively involved in learning how to use computers. They have access to the Internet and are finding great joy in that and in being able to communicate, especially with younger members of the family. We have heard stories of older people playing chess with their grandsons on the opposite side of the continent. The consultations have suggested that schools might get involved in this and have intergenerational days, where young people come in during the school holidays and introduce older people to technology and eliminate some of the unfounded fear that 
 exists. Those of us who have had experience with computers realise that sometimes you are inhibited by fear rather than the actuality of undertaking an activity on a computer. These have been some suggestions that could be taken up by the Association of Independent Schools or the state school systems.</para><para>Health, aged care and income security have been raised. They are issues which will not necessarily be able to be dealt with in the year, but we will inform the National Strategy for an Ageing Australia, which was announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) late last year. The National Strategy for an Ageing Australia is a vehicle to examine the broad policy issues created by the population ageing and to provide a framework for activities already under way to improve the wellbeing of Australians as they age. This will involve short, medium and long-term consultations and it will involve planning, suggestions and ideas not only for the short term but for the long term as we move to an ageing population.</para><para>I want to again put on the record my thanks to my colleagues both in this house and the other for their cooperation in what has to date proved to be a very successful process in consulting older people about what can be done in the International Year of Older Persons.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Minister for Resources and Energy</title><page.no>2327</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>2327</page.no><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name><name.id>RF4</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Over the last two weeks I have carefully outlined how Senator Parer has colluded in, and helped implement for his benefit, no fewer than three tax avoidance schemes.

The key feature of all three schemes is that, to be in a position to exploit them, you have to be what the tax office calls a high wealth individual—in other words, a rich person.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>7E4</name.id><name role="metadata">VANSTONE</name><name role="display">Senator Vanstone</name></talker><para>—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order.

In other words, you have to be a rich person. These schemes are not for ordinary Australians. For these avoidance schemes to pay off, 
 you have to have a network of wealthy mates, be rich enough to pay a fat fee to the best slippery lawyers and sharp accountants, and then make a profit out of the transaction. Most Australians pay their tax each fortnight because it is deducted from their pay. They do not earn enough to afford to be avoiders even if they wanted to for, as the Australian Taxation Office itself said in evidence last Friday, it would be more correct to say that the wealthier you get, the more demand there is for these sorts of techniques. Tax avoidance is the pastime of the wealthy, not of the average or even of the well-paid Australian.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Last night the <inline font-style="italic">7.30 Report</inline> did an expose on tax avoidance through trusts—the sort of thing that Senator Parer is involved with. In that item Daryl Dixon, an investment adviser, said billions were avoided every year by this dodge and ACOSS said $8 billion was lost every year through tax avoidance. If ACOSS is right, then Mr Howard could afford to give the states $3.5 billion in extra Medicare funding to ensure Australians can gain access to public hospitals, elderly people would not be forced to sell their homes to secure a nursing home bed and pensioners would not have to resort to superglue to fix their dentures due to the axing of the Commonwealth dental health scheme—and all this without having a regressive GST imposed on them. One reason why the Beazley opposition will continue to pursue this issue—as exemplified by the artful tax avoider Senator Parer—is the emblem of the Howard government on tax: let the wealthy continue to avoid tax while the rest of us get slugged with a GST.</para><para>Last Friday the Australian Taxation Office appeared before the Senate Economics Legislation Committee. It was an opportunity to obtain from the tax office their views on the types of tax avoidance schemes practised by Senator Parer. Unfortunately, time does not allow me to revisit all of Senator Parer's schemes today. One scheme involved the creation of the AQRM trust, which holds one H-class share in QCMM Pty Ltd. According to documents lodged with the Queensland Supreme Court, we now know why that trust was created. It was established to facilitate the creation of a pool of fully franked dividends 
 for distribution to QCMM directors and key employees—basically, Senator Parer and his wealthy mates. This trust is nothing more than a mechanism to stream and then manipulate the distribution of fully franked dividend income to the beneficiaries of the AQRM trust in order to maximise the avoidance of tax for those involved. What is more, the trust was established with the full knowledge and support of the artful tax avoider Senator Parer.</para><para>As the tax office stated on Friday, such dividend streaming arrangements are engaged in by only high wealth individuals. The tax office also stated, as I said previously: `The wealthier you get, the more demand there is for these sorts of techniques.' Furthermore, in answer to the question: `Is the use of interposed entities, such as trusts or other companies, popular where dividend streaming occurs?' the tax office's response was a curt yes.</para><para>Why are trusts popular, one may ask? Because, according to the Australian Taxation Office, trusts provide a fairly simple means of circumventing the existing anti-dividend streaming provisions in the law. Here we have Senator Parer's blatant tax avoidance scheme exposed for what it is by the Australian Taxation Office. It is exposed as nothing more than a contrived and manipulative arrangement by wealthy individuals, such as himself, to abuse the tax system for their own personal gain. It is for the government to ensure there is equity and fairness in the tax system. The opposition will support any appropriate legislation to achieve this. In government we will crack down on tax avoidance so that no Australian will pay a disproportionate share of tax to cover revenue shortfalls created by underpaying wealthy free-riders.</para><para>Let me now turn to the ethics of Senator Parer's conflict of interest and the failure to declare issue. There are three matters of substance here: the fact that Senator Parer broke the Prime Minister's code of conduct on conflict and on apparent conflict of interest grounds, the fact that he failed to disclose his interests and the fact that the Prime Minister would not enforce his code when it was 
 broken. Because of the Prime Minister's refusal to stand by his code, it is now a dead letter. In fact, he has reinterpreted his code and declared it to be `guidelines and not a death sentence'.</para><para>I want now to examine the morality and ethics of that argument. There are many codes of conduct that govern conflict of interest and ethical behaviour. The code of professional ethics and conduct of the Chartered Institute of Company Secretaries states that `company secretaries must not allow their position to conflict with their private interests' and `secretaries should always make complete and full disclosure of any interest they may have in a transaction'. Under that code, Senator Parer would be in default on two counts.</para><para>The code of ethics binding the Australian Institute of Banking and Finance states:</para><para>Members must avoid acquiring any business interest or participating in any business activity outside the bank or financial institution which would tend to create a conflict of interest . . . </para><para>Under that code, Senator Parer would be in conflict. The Stock Exchange, too, is quite explicit when it comes to conflicts of interest and the need for proper disclosure. Under the heading `What is required to be disclosed', it says:</para><para>Disclosure is required when the adviser has any direct, or indirect, pecuniary or other interest, that may reasonably be expected to be capable of influencing the securities adviser.</para><para>Senator Parer would be in default on several occasions under that dicta. The Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia has rules for ethical conduct. They are, in part:</para><para>Members must both be, and appear to be, free of any interest which might be regarded, whatever its actual effect, as being incompatible with integrity and objectivity.</para><para>Senator Parer, prior to placing his affairs in the hands of his children and now, would breach those rules. The same is true of the Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants. Their ethics code states:</para><para>A member in public practise shall not concurrently engage in any business, occupation or activity which is inconsistent and incompatible with the provision of professional services to clients. 
</para><para>Senator Parer—gone again. All these ethical codes are of professions in the commercial and financial area—a field Senator Parer would be familiar with and come into contact with as a businessman and as an investor on almost a daily basis. I have not included lawyers who have similar requirements, not to mention extensive legal precedent, which if not observed can lead to disbarment. Nor have I included journalists or other professions, all of which are explicit on conflict of interest or apparent conflict of interest and the need to declare that conflict where it arises. Looking at the rules of other parliaments in like democracies, this issue is quite clear, no matter if it be in the United States of America, the United Kingdom, Canada or a dozen other countries.</para><para>Finally, let me come to a professional body that Senator Parer may or may not have been a member of—the Institute of Company Directors—and its code of ethical behaviour. Senator Parer could have been a member. In the last decade he has held no fewer than 27 directorships and/or shareholdings in separate companies. We do not know if he was a member—if he was, he did not declare it. The institute's code states in relation to conflicts of interest:</para><para>The personal interests of a director, and those of the director's family, must not be allowed to prevail over those of the company's shareholders generally. A director should seek to avoid conflicts of interest wherever possible. Full disclosure of any conflict, or potential conflict, must be made to the board.</para><para>He is in breach of that institute's code as well.</para><para>It is quite staggering, given Senator Parer's extensive experience as a company director and the quite strict code of conduct directors operate under, that Senator Parer had not instilled within himself the values and sense of probity that the Institute of Company Directors seeks its members to abide by. Is it any wonder that a former associate of Senator Parer is suing QCMM Pty Ltd in the Queensland Supreme Court for unpaid dividends on a similar class of shares to which Senator Parer has continued to receive dividends on after he left the company?</para><para>What conclusions can be drawn from all this? A conflict or apparent conflict of interest and the failure to disclose are commonly regarded as unethical to the point that they are understood as universal and enduring principles defining improper behaviour. This is recognised and documented widely, including in the business community and other parliamentary democracies. To that extent, whether these principles are encoded in written form or not, they exist and are observed as benchmarks of public and private sector morality. The Prime Minister's written code is written proof that the government recognises these principles.</para><para>Whichever way the government chooses to describe its own code is trite and beside the point; the principles here are sound, solid and cannot be subverted or evaded. Senator Parer is in direct conflict of interest—as well as apparent conflict of interest—by owning shares in a company operating in his portfolio and by now concealing his ownership by vesting his shares with his children on the basis that he can call up the proceeds from them at some future time.</para><para>By not enforcing principles of proper moral and ethical conduct, the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, is complicit in the breaking of these principles and in the category of an accessary after the fact. As for Senator Parer, on the facts, if he were a member of the Institute of Company Directors, he would have broken their rules by offending against their ethical code. If he were a company secretary, he would be tossed out of their institute. If he were a stockbroker, he would lose his licence to operate. If he were a banker or financier, he would be disbarred. If he were a chartered accountant, he would be in breach of ethical standards and have recognition withdrawn. If he were a certified practising accountant, he would not be allowed to practise. He would not survive as a lawyer or a journalist either.</para><para>From the outset of this sorry saga, the Prime Minister has been at pains to underline his loyalty to Senator Parer. It is clear that the Prime Minister is a friend of the embattled senator and that he now asks the Australian people to take Senator Parer on trust, despite the evidence against him. This is an attempt 
 by Honest John to wrap the cloak of his own credibility around Senator Parer—not an advisable course. It is not a credible cloak and this action weakens it even further. However, it does raise an interesting question of loyalty.</para><para>It is clear that the Prime Minister's notion of loyalty is not the same as Senator Parer's. While personal friendships should not get in the way of prime ministerial public duty, nonetheless he has stood by Senator Parer. Does Senator Parer reciprocate his loyalty and stand by the Prime Minister? To answer this question one need look no further than the example set by former Senator Short and Senator Gibson—both of whom, out of loyalty to the Prime Minister and from an understanding of the damage they were causing the government, submitted their resignations. In this context, it is pertinent to look at the words of Senator Robert Hill who, speaking on 14 October 1996 in regard to the resignation of Senator Short, said:</para><para>. . . I still regard Senator Short as an honourable and decent person . . . he has paid a very major price in parliamentary life. That, if anything, demonstrates not only the high standard that is expected of this government . . . a high standard not only in what is done but what is perceived to be done.</para><para>If Senator Parer is loyal to the government and his Prime Minister, he should demonstrate the same high standard of loyalty that former Senator Short displayed and voluntarily fall on his sword.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Common Youth Allowance</title><page.no>2330</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>2330</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on quite an extraordinary matter which was revealed in this chamber yesterday regarding the government's strategy to sell its common youth allowance to the Australian community. The document, which was referred to in question time through Labor Party questions, reveals that this strategy is astounding in every respect. Point by point, this document analyses the weaknesses of the common youth allowance policy—and, as the chamber is aware, these are numerous—and presents a strategy to counteract criticism of the legislation. </para></talk.start><para>It must be stated at the outset that this represents a flagrant waste of departmental resources. The allocation of staff, presumably on a full-time basis, to develop a spin for the government to sell what even it acknowledges has deep flaws in its social policy, is unacceptable. This is a waste of time, energy and taxpayers' dollars, and it would only be compounded upon implementation of this strategy. It does not appear as if the government will spare any expense to try to sell this legislation with its retrograde elements.</para><para>The strategy envisages a number of things; in particular, hiring a market research agency to undertake developmental research, benchmarking and testing of promotional concepts and tools. It also proposes the engagement of an advertising agency to develop imagery, and even an advertising campaign, the use of magazine guides, posters, bus shelter advertisements, and even McDonald's placemats. Then it suggests that a PR company should be given the job of handling issues management for the passage of the legislation and media strategy development.</para><para>On top of outsourcing to the market research, PR firms and an advertising agency, the departmental document also suggests the production of a video, posters, a magazine and other promotional material to help sell the message that the common youth allowance is not as bad as it seems. On its own, the degree of outsourcing and promotion would suggest that the government has almost admitted defeat in its own efforts to sell the common youth allowance. However, the strategy in this document openly admits the points on which the policy is likely to be attacked.</para><para>There are a number of examples in the document, and I find it extraordinary that it has effectively admitted to the negative points in the common youth allowance. These points include:</para><para>We can expect more opposition from families after July 1 when families of young unemployed people start to feel the effect of the Parental Income Test.</para><para>. . .              . . .             . . .</para><para>We can expect disaffected families to air their grievances through the media . . .

However, instead of actually fixing what is wrong with the legislation, the government has decided that it is going to spend taxpayers' money—waste money—on glossy promotional campaigns which will fool no-one. The strategy acknowledges that there is widespread concern about this particular policy. It acknowledges that the concern comes from the Australian Council of Social Services, the National Union of Students and the Australian Youth Policy and Action Coalition, which it describes as `predictable'. It also describes the voluble opposition from religious groups and churches.</para><para>The department obviously views the criticism from the two latter groups as more of a threat, because the document states:</para><para>. . . they will have credibility with middle Australia as well as those families affected by the Parental Income Test.</para><para>From the lists and comments contained in this departmental document, we can pretty safely assume that one of the chief aims of the strategy is to discredit some of these so-called `predictable' organisations—not to mention the church, religious and community groups—on this particular issue. To the same degree that youth groups or other advocacy organisations—and heaven forbid that any organisations might dissent from government line or policy—have already been sidelined, the attempt is to discredit them further.</para><para>We should not forget that the strategy also takes the remarkable step of sidelining and targeting two individual members of parliament—myself from the Democrats and Jenny 
 Macklin from the Labor Party in the other House. Apparently, we are spreading `negative publicity' and for that reason we have been singled out as people who should be counteracted. Some people have suggested that we should be flattered that the government feels that we are such a threat to its policy that it expends time and energy singling us out in documents. While it is clear that this document shows the extent to which groups such as the Democrats are perceived as a real threat by this government, it is unfortunate that the government is not prepared to defend the policy of the common youth allowance proposal on its merits, instead of singling out, criticising and counteracting individuals.</para><para>I am amazed that the sustained efforts of my party and others to scrutinise and expose the regressive elements—and there are retrograde aspects—of this legislation have been branded as negative publicity by the department when, in fact, we are scrutinising, analysing and highlighting elements which we believe will negatively and adversely affect middle and lower income families in Australia.</para><para>I would be more than happy to spread some positive news. I would be more than happy to talk in the community and in the media about positive initiatives from this government in relation to young people and policy affecting them. Unfortunately, the government has not given me a lot to go out and talk about in a positive or up-beat manner—it is resorting to McDonald's placemats to do that.</para><para>If the government cannot handle criticism of its legislation—and, as the House of review, the responsibility of this chamber is to analyse, amend if necessary or appropriate, scrutinise and review legislation—then it should actually amend its policy, and not try to gloss over the real concerns of a variety of representative bodies. By all means, the groups mentioned within that strategy document are representative and, in most cases, grassroots organisations.</para><para>The Democrats have long opposed a number of policy measures contained in the common youth allowance legislation. That is because we believe that they are retrograde 
 and, in many respects, deeply unfair to young people and their families. Let's remember that lower to middle income families will be most negatively affected by these changes. Let's look at a number of those changes. There is the parental means test, which kicks in at an incredibly low threshold of around $23,400 per annum, and also the fact that 16- and 17-year-olds who are not in employment, education or training are going to lose their benefits. They are going to be completely dependent, morally and financially, on their families. The government still has not responded to the concerns of religious and other community groups as to how those young people and their families are expected to survive.</para><para>The concocted notion of what constitutes an age of independence is another aspect of the legislation that we have great difficulty with. The premise of the legislation is flawed because it relies on the belief that young people should be financially and otherwise dependent upon their families well into adulthood. This ignores the social and economic realities of Australian life for young people and their families.</para><para>We do not believe that young people and their families should be forced to undergo unreasonable and undue hardship as a result of this almost philosophical notion perpetuated by the government that families should be responsible for their children until they have reached these concocted ages of independence. Let's remember how high those ages are: 21 for young adults and 25 for young students. We are not talking about teenagers; these are young adults who are expected to be dependent upon their families and who will be judged according to their parental income.</para><para>The common youth allowance sets up this moral obligation for parents to support young adults where there is no legal obligation in any other existing legislative framework. Entitlement will be subject to an incredibly harsh means test. As I said, the parental means test kicks in at just over $23,000—that is below average weekly earnings. That is a low level. No wonder families are concerned about the impact of this legislation.</para><para>This legislation affects a large number of young Australians—around 560,000 young people will be eligible for some form of the youth allowance, of which approximately 70 per cent will be students. Government figures—and we are prepared to use government figures, although I believe they are probably quite a conservative estimate—estimate that 33,250 or around six per cent of young people will be receiving less money as a result of the common youth allowance, and 12,800 young people who currently receive some form of assistance will not receive anything at all under the new scheme. Is it any wonder that they and their families are responding negatively or with concern to the introduction of the CYA?</para><para>These are just some of the measures that are contained within the government's policy. These are aspects which the Democrats have exposed, opposed and tried to amend. Community groups, churches, and young people and their families are well aware of the potential negative impact of the common youth allowance. They know the impact that that will have on their lives and, potentially, on the community as a whole. However, the government should not make the mistake of assuming that these people will be fooled or fobbed off by some kind of glossy promotional campaign or soapie scripts with favourable plot lines in episodes of <inline font-style="italic">Home and Away</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Neighbours</inline>, let alone McDonald's placemats.</para><para>If the government wants to win the support of the community on this issue, it should listen to the criticisms of this policy, rather than seeking to silence or target those individuals, community and other advocacy groups which would expose the problems in the legislation. It should change the legislation to make it fair. Only then will people like me, my party and other groups in society sing the government's praises on the issue—which we would do if it made the sort of positive changes which take into account some of the realities of family life today.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Information Superhighway</title><page.no>2333</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>2333</page.no><name role="metadata">Tierney, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator TIERNEY</name><name.id>O15</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This is my final speech in a series of three dealing with the study of 
 information technologies and developments in Australia and overseas. This particular speech will deal with telecommunications. Four years ago, I had the opportunity to study what was a new idea at that time—the information superhighway in the United States. I said at that time that the Labor government needed to be a lot more pro-active in the development of this information superhighway in Australia.</para></talk.start><para>In 1994 there were real concerns about monopoly power,  and the duopoly was developing at that time. The ALP really did nothing to allay these fears. The Labor government did not have a policy which would enable third parties to have proper access to the cable roll-out. In the Telecommunications Act 1997 this government has introduced an access regime which will fix the problems which the ALP neglected during its long stewardship.</para><para>We will ensure that third parties have access at agreed commercial rates and, if there are any disagreements, this will not be fixed by backroom deals, as was the way in which the roll-out was determined under the previous government. Any disagreements under this government go before the Australian Consumer and Competition Commission. We have this system which, from my study, makes Australia a world leader in this regard. We have one act which covers all telecommunications in Australia, and in that regard we are much better placed than the United States and the United Kingdom.</para><para>We have two main players and access for new entrants which will allow them to become telecommunications carriers. This was brought about by our change to the legislation opening up the market in July 1997. This government is dedicated to improving telecommunications services. The float of Telstra will improve service and improve prices. The introduction of competition in the telecommunications market will also give Australians greater choice in terms of services and providers. We have ensured that providers are legally required to put on price caps. There will be untimed local calls, universal service obligations and customer service guarantees.</para><para>I believe that the changes brought about under this government make Australian legislation the best in the world in regard to the protection of consumers. The particular consumers that I have a great interest in—as I am based in regional and rural Australia—are the people outside the capital cities. This government has put Telstra and other telephone carriers on notice to improve telephone services and cater for the needs of rural and regional customers.</para><para>Amendments to the Telecommunications Act to introduce penalties of up to $10 million if a phone company fails to comply with the directions of the industry regulator, the Australian Communications Authority, have been put in place. Rural areas will, as a result, have access to first rate telecommunications services as this new information age dawns. From my study, Australia's telecommunications regulatory framework is now world competitive.</para><para>But Labor made this success, this change, that was brought about in the last few years, very difficult because, when they did start to grapple with this policy area in the early 1990s, they totally mucked it up. They had the chance to introduce one backbone system throughout Australia through what was called the common trench policy—that is, you provide, say, down one street a trench that is wide enough for a whole range of telecommunication carriers to have access to.</para><para>If the ALP had done this in 1992, it would have headed off the ugly overhead cable roll-out that many cities in this country have been subjected to. It would have saved billions—let me repeat that, billions—of dollars in wasted duplicated infrastructure. Most importantly, it would have prevented the defacing of the environment, as we have in areas like northern Sydney where these ugly cables now hang across the poles down the main streets of those suburbs. It is interesting to note that Europe is now grappling with this issue five or six years on. It seems to be determined to introduce a one-trench policy, which will allow other people to enter the market at lower cost. It is a great pity that, under the previous government, Australia lost that opportunity. </para><para>Malaysia, our main regional competitor in attracting information industries, is having big problems in rolling out its telecommunications backbone. Throughout Malaysia, only about 18 per cent of homes are on telephone, and in Kuala Lumpur the figure rises to only 50 per cent. This means a huge capacity exists as the standard of living in that country rises. It is very concerned about creating an information rich and information poor divide in its country as this roll-out continues, and it is looking at some form of subsidy for the roll-out in remote areas.</para><para>Grappling with the establishment of this communications trench policy, the Malaysian telecommunications minister was very positive about the Australian government's infrastructure fund idea, which will ensure a more rapid roll-out in the more remote areas of the country. In Australia, we are also gaining a leading edge over our competitors by having a competitive Telstra in competition with companies like Optus and Vodafone. Since deregulation in 1997, a number of small players have been developing niche markets.</para><para>I had the opportunity to speak with Optus's parent company, Cable and Wireless, and the discussions focused mainly on Optus. It suggested that competition in Australia will be further improved when Optus gets its act together on telephony software. I was told that the problems Optus has been having here in developing competitive telephony should be overcome by June 1988. We all wait with baited breath to see if that is the case because that will really force down the prices of telephone calls in Australia. The parent company was confident that Optus would be turning a profit in 1999. I also discussed with the parent company that earlier point I made about the Optus overhead cable roll-out and the very poor public perception of this.</para><para>In 1994, I warned of the potential dangers of creating an information rich and information poor society in Australia if we did not get this information technology roll-out right—the main problem being, of course, companies concentrating on major cities first and rural areas a very distant second. However, probably better than any other country in the world, Australia has now ensured under 
 this government that rural Australia is protected and will receive first-rate service.</para><para>In London, I studied the effects of privatisation on British Telecom and the whole area of increased competition. The general consensus was that British Telecom needs to lift its game. I was told that it was still operating like an inefficient monopoly player and that it was not flexible enough to meet niche market demand. It was suggested that the future lay with a lot of small players, players that would have about 10,000 customers and would each meet niche demand and put together capacity, product and billing systems.</para><para>I spoke to Telstra UK officials about this competition. They told me that there was overcapacity in the UK market, and Telstra UK believes that the second player in the UK, Mercury, was under pressure, perhaps more than British Telecom, from these new players. Its duopoly position has been threatened at the third player level, who, interestingly enough, is actually going after Mercury, which is the equivalent of our Optus, rather than British Telecom, the equivalent of our Telstra.</para><para>Some other corporations that have other functions are actually looking at getting into the telecommunications market as competitors as well, and this is very good news for consumers. Groups that you would not think would have any interest in telecommunications, such as water corporations and electricity corporations, are looking to become players. What do they have in common? They have right of way access. They have paths through which pipes and electricity lines pass. With that right of way access already theirs, they can put through very quickly things like optic fibre. Of course, the other great advantage they have is centralised billing systems.</para><para>So, by putting optic fibre through, these sorts of companies can get into telecommunications and create greater competition for the big players and drive prices down further. Those utilities in Australia—electricity and water—would be in a similar position and could get into this market, if they wished. The opportunity for that, of course, has been 
 provided by the deregulated structure that we have already created.</para><para>In Malaysia, interestingly enough, there were considerable problems with the way in which competition was developing. From my observations, Australia is probably developing things in a better way. I met with the Minister for Communications in Malaysia, who, interestingly enough, had taken on this portfolio in 1978. So he was very much across these issues and the way in which it had all developed in Malaysia. Like Australia, they started with Telecom Malaysia. They had a very similar monopoly position to what we had. But they went very quickly from one player to six, and they have discovered that they are too small. As a matter of fact, two companies have actually handed their licences back because they were not viable.</para><para>The minister said that further rationalisation is necessary. So, having gone to a very decentralised sort of structure, they have found they have gone too far and are coming more towards the way we are doing it. He suggested that, in terms of Malaysia, three companies would probably enable them to be internationally competitive. All of this suggests that Australia is very much on the right track as we move away from the monopoly to the duopoly and then to an open competition regime. My study of telecommunications—firstly in the US and then more recently in London and Malaysia—has offered many very useful insights into Australia's place in the world in this telecommunications revolution that will shape our place in the information age as we move into the 21st century.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Waterfront</title><page.no>2335</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>2335</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Today I want to speak about the issue which has occupied so much of the news this morning—that is, the actions on the Australian waterfront which took place late last night, around midnight, we are informed. It is simply an indication that Mr Reith has played his final card in what has been nothing more than a political campaign against the unions, and, frankly, it is a card dealt from the bottom of the deck. But the issue, as far as we are concerned, is far from over, and we will be pursuing it to the hilt.</para></talk.start><para>There is no doubt that Mr Reith and Mr Sharp, until he resigned in disgrace, have driven this process from day one, culminating in the actions today. The process started with the appointment of Mr Paul Houlihan by Mr Reith in March 1996, straight after the election. Mr Houlihan's job was apparently to help draft the Workplace Relations Act—and he was about crafting an act custom-made to launch an assault on organised labour. Mr Houlihan picked up a cool $20,000 for what was, as I understand it, a few weeks work.</para><para>Mr Sharp then appointed Mr David Trebeck, a principal of ACIL Economics and a close colleague of Mr Houlihan, to conduct some consultancy research on his plan because his job was to build a strategy around a workplace relations model to get the Maritime Union of Australia, and, of course, Mr Houlihan was there guiding the process as part of the consultancy. Mr Trebeck's appointment followed discussions between former Liberal director Andrew Robb, Trebeck, Houlihan and the then minister for transport, Mr John Sharp. That work laid the foundations for the government's strategy.</para><para>Mr Trebeck's work went to the questions of how best to target the MUA and how a stevedore might go about hiring an entire work force. Mr Reith's department became involved on 9 September 1996 when it was briefed by ACIL Economics. A senior officer in Mr Reith's department, Mr Darren Gillespie, met with Mr Chris Corrigan on 25 February 1997. They discussed the option of sacking Patrick's work force back then. Mr Corrigan also met with David Trebeck in Patrick's Sydney office, and, again, the option of sacking the work force was discussed.</para><para>On 27 February 1997, Mr Reith received his plan. It was written by Workplace Relations—his department, that is—but it was designed by Trebeck, Houlihan and Mr Reith himself. Its design was to smash the union. The negotiated reforms option in the draft strategy, agreed with officers of the department of transport, was removed by Mr Gillespie without reference to the department of transport officers. He also increased the attractiveness of the confrontationalist option. It is clear Mr Gillespie had his instructions 
 from Mr Reith, and he delivered the product. The Reith plan was exposed through a minute to him dated 10 March 1997. That minute said, in part:</para><para>. . . stevedores would need to activate well-prepared strategies to dismiss their work force, and replace them with another quickly in a way that limited the prospect of, for example, the Commission ordering reinstatement of the current work force.</para><para>That sounds very similar to exactly what happened at midnight last night. In 1997, the major stevedore, OOCL, was seeking to set up business in Melbourne. It made the fatal error of saying it was prepared to employ unionised labour. So the Howard government and the Kennett government had discussions, and OOCL was forced out. What did that company say? It said it was forced to move to Sydney, the rent was set too high in Melbourne. So competition is okay, but only if the government approves.</para><para>The Reith plan was then progressively refined. Dr Stephen Webster was employed, along with a number of other consultants. Dr Greg Feeney, from the department of transport, told an estimates committee that he was instructed by Mr Sharp to employ Webster after a meeting of the cabinet subcommittee established to look at maritime issues. The membership of the committee was Mr Sharp, Mr Reith, Mr Fahey and Mr Costello. What did Dr Webster receive for his involvement in the consultancy? He received $95,000. An associate, Dr John Davies, who, we are told, was engaged by Dr Webster, picked up $96,000—this for all of 12 weeks work.</para><para>Dr Webster received a bonus. He was also appointed to a position in Minister Reith's ministerial office. In August last year, on the recommendation of Dr Webster, Mr Sharp engaged Minter Ellison at a cost of $151,000 to get the legal basis for an attack on the union set up. In August last year, Australasian Research Strategies, the company of Liberal pollster Mark Texter, was commissioned to provide a report on community attitudes to the MUA and the docks, and that report cost $42,000. I might say, it is not the Liberal Party which is paying these consultancies; it is the Australian public.</para><para>Mr Texter found that the waterfront was not a top-of-the-mind issue, but there was concern about international competitiveness. So another Liberal strategist, Jonathan Gaul, was engaged to develop a political communications strategy around the Texter research. What was the theme? The theme, which we have heard many times from Mr Reith, was that wharfies are privileged. They do not receive $96,000 for 12 weeks work, but they are privileged.</para><para>While the Reith plan was being refined, so was that of the NFF. According to Mr Houlihan, `The window of opportunity came in August when we heard Patrick was losing money at Webb Dock.' In the meantime, Mr Reith tried to break the union in Cairns, but he failed. Mr Greg Bondar, the senior maritime adviser to Sharp at the time, was later quoted as saying—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">CAMPBELL</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Campbell</name></talker><para>—Mr Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order.

Of the Cairns operation, Mr Bondar said, `It was initiated by Peter Reith's department, but I think, in a way, it got out of hand.' So Mr Reith, along with Mr Sharp, then attacked the employers—it was their fault, apparently. Mr Reith said that the government had created the framework, but no-one would use it. Mr 
 Sharp said, `Employers often criticise us, but they are the ones who are responsible for not taking up the new opportunities.' That is, the existing employers would not play the game—the game that the government wanted them to play. Mr Richard Hein from P&amp;O said, `We are not about deregistering the MUA.' Apparently he had been asked about that. He also said that P&amp;O was `not about tearing up our agreement and setting out to destroy the MUA'. Apparently he had also been asked about that.</para></talk.start></continue><para>This is when the National Farmers Federation came into play. Mr Reith's plan needed a compliant employer, but he could not find one. Mr Reith then moved to get a new employer, and the National Farmers Federation was willing to play. On 18 September last year, Mr Reith, Mr Sharp, Dr Webster and the secretaries to the departments of workplace relations and transport met in Melbourne. The key item on the agenda was the establishment of a new stevedore. Dr Webster told the group that the National Farmers Federation should be brought into the plan. Strangely enough, Ms Wendy Craik and Mr James Ferguson from that organisation were at the venue of the meeting within the hour—within the hour, as if they knew about the meeting in advance.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>UW4</name.id><name role="metadata">CRANE</name><name role="display">Senator Crane</name></talker><para>—Well done; well organised.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>8O6</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name></talker><para>—Meanwhile, Patricks continued to deteriorate and it played the Dubai card.

Corrigan originally denied Patricks involvement. But later he had to confess that he had been untruthful. Mr Reith might not have known about Dubai. He knew the workers were being trained; he just did not know where.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Mr Houlihan started talks with Mr Corrigan in November of last year. The plan was set up over Christmas and Mr Reith was briefed on 6 January. On 29 January, at 2.30 a.m.—funny how these things happen the middle of the night—three buses carrying 45 security guards entered No. 5 Webb Dock. This was 
 the arrangement between Patrick and the National Farmers Federation. Patrick and the National Farmers Federation are the common theme. The common theme is also doing things in the dark of night. This is the industrial relations style of Mr Peter Reith, and this is his waterfront reform style. We see its culmination today in the mass sackings of 1,400 workers.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>C16</name.id><name role="metadata">HEFFERNAN</name><name role="display">Senator Heffernan</name></talker><para>—Better than Bob Hawke in Peter Abeles' pocket over the airlines.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>8O6</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name></talker><para>—Senator Heffernan, I am interested to hear your intervention, because the fact of the matter is that the National Farmers Federation purports to represent farmers, and I know that you are one—at least part time.

The pork industry has 12,000 employees and additional people around the country. It appears to me that the National Farmers Federation was not interested in the issue of protecting the jobs of more than 12,000 people in rural Australia employed in the pork industry. Maybe that is the reason, Senator Heffernan, that a lot of people around the country are saying NFF stands for `not for farmers'.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Frankly, the sackings that have taken place as a part of the government's plan, the government's conspiring with these employers and other organisations, are outside of its own law.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">CAMPBELL</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Campbell</name></talker><para>—Tell us about Bob Hawke and Peter Abeles conspiring, you hypocrite.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>8O6</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name></talker><para>—Thank you.

Let me tell the Senate what happened in my state today. In Tasmania there are only about 30 Patricks employees out of the 1,400 that have been sacked. They have all been sacked. In Burnie there was a ship in port. The people were sacked at midnight, when the ship was loaded with cargo—no thought about that; they were just sacked. No plans in place. What was on the ship? A valuable cargo of horses. Who was interested? The RSPCA—not Patricks, not the government. So what happened? These people who had been sacked, these people who were supposed to be involved in nicking off whenever they could, what did they do? They had been sacked, they were not getting any money, but they went in and unloaded the horses.</para><para>Last week, at that very terminal, the employees of Patricks achieved a cargo handling rate, on average over the week, of 33 containers per hour. Did they get thanked for that? This is the performance of people who were so inefficient they had to be sacked. This is the performance of this employer, so unprincipled that it is prepared to reward the good work of its workers by sacking them. That is what Patricks is prepared to do.</para><para>What happened in Brisbane today? The complicity of the Queensland Government, through the Port of Queensland Corporation, resulted in guards on the road leading into the Fisherman Islands wharf, in Brisbane. What did they do? They refused admission to 70 P&amp;O workers when they arrived to start work. They were not employed by Patricks. They were going to stop them. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Natural Heritage Trust Funding</title><page.no>2339</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>2339</page.no><name role="metadata">Crane, Sen Winston</name><name role="display">Senator CRANE</name><name.id>UW4</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to invite another of the kings of slur, Mr Duncan Kerr, in the other place, to take the 15 steps of courage out of that place and repeat some of the things that he has said with regard to my family and me, or to apologise.

Are you also aware that the stevedoring industry award requires any employer to notify their employees and their union of any definite decision that is likely to have a significant effect on employees, including termination of employment, and obliges the employer to discuss such changes before they come into effect? Can you advise the Senate what steps the government took to satisfy itself that these provisions had been complied with before you supported Patricks' decision to dismiss 1,400 workers to replace them with another work force?</para></talk.start></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>2340</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Environment</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Finally the Labor Party has come out of its shell.

Minister, how is it that your government has been able to find $250 million to sack waterfront workers who have jobs, yet you have not been able to find a red cent to help those miners who were tossed out of their jobs?

Reforms to be introduced on 27 April will improve assistance for around 70,000 families using outside school hours care, ensure that children using child care are appropriately immunised, allow 20 hours a week for families wishing to use child care for non-work related purposes and ensure that new centres are located in areas of high need. We are attacking that problem.</para><para>Significant subsidies are available for families using child care. For low income 
 families the government provides around $5,600 a year where there is one child in full-time care and over $12,000 if there are two children in full-time care.

The first thing is that overnight and instantly, after it heard of this dismissal just before midnight, the government decided that it would get up a bill which is now introduced into the House of Representatives—the fastest piece of legislation ever to be framed in the history of the Commonwealth of Australia. It is a bill which imposes a tax of $6 per car that is moved across the waterfront and $12 per container—just what we need for Australia's export industries. At a time in which the Asian economic crisis is hurting our export market, we are going to impose a new tax on the export industry. Why are we going to impose it?

But, Senator Cook, as you walk out, who is responsible for the confrontation? None other than John Coombs and the MUA. It is they who confronted the waterfront companies, the stevedoring companies, which are seeking relevant and appropriate reform. They were seeking to break Patricks because Patricks dared to challenge the inefficiencies as a result of the cosy monopoly that was previously enjoyed by the wharfies.</para></talk.start></continue><para>They were singled out by the Maritime Union and subjected to punitive strike action. That cost that company $56 million. So it is no wonder they had to make their employees redundant when they suffered that massive cost. And of course the MUA made it very clear that any attempt to reform the waterfront would `involve massive industry disputation'—a test of wills. Well, there has been a test of wills, and the MUA lost the test of wills. They lost the test of wills because, 
 as I said, the Australian community generally recognise and support the need for improved efficiency on the Australian waterfront. Australia, as an island nation, an island continent, is absolutely dependent on our waterfront and our sea transport for the export of our wealth earning goods. We cannot survive without it.</para><para>On a value for money basis, in a recent survey it was found that Australia's wharfies ensured that Australia's ports were ranked at the bottom of the list. Sadly, as a South Australian senator, I have to say that Adelaide was the worst of all in terms of value for money. Adelaide rates 18 out of the 18 ports surveyed around the world. Our crane rates are below international standards at 18.3 lifts per hour. A number of ports around the world achieve lifts of 30 per hour. What the government is seeking as a benchmark is 25 lifts per hour, a quite modest goal in relation to international standards. It is a modest benchmark to establish, yet the unions are objecting to lifting the rate from the current 18.3.</para><para>Other problems with efficiency on the waterfront include the temporary or permanent disability of about 10 per cent of the work force—much higher than in any other industry. Of course, when it comes to working days lost because of industrial action, in 1996, 1,130 working days were lost per 1,000 employees—well above that of any other industry.</para><para>The reason for that is because of all the rorts that are continuing on the waterfront. We heard about the stripper rort where the rate of 10.4 containers an hour on the first shift suddenly lifted to 29.7 containers an hour when they were told they could knock off after they finished to go to the stripper show down at the local pub. We know about the airconditioning rort where, even though the cabs of the equipment have airconditioning, the wharfies will not work if the outside temperature is more than 39 degrees. There is the safety card rort. There is the car loading rort where five wharfies are required to load a car. And so the rorts go on.</para><para>And the Labor Party has the gall to come in here and criticise the employers. They do that because of their own failed WIRA pro

Today is the day that this government put every Australian worker on notice: `Step out of line and you'll be sacked. Join a union and you'll be sacked. Get in the way of this government's agenda and you'll be sacked.' Today is the day that this government said to every Australian worker, `Don't get too relaxed and comfortable, your jobs are on the line. Get in the way of this government 
 and you'll be sacked.' Today is the day that Australians will say—and they have been saying it so far—`This government has gone too far. Enough is enough, we're not going to cop it. The line in the sand is drawn here.' You only have to listen to the response on talkback radio today to know that the government has made an utterly disastrous strategic mistake with regard to this.</para><para>It is a black day for industrial relations, it is a black day for Australian workers and it is a black day when an elected government supports a breach of its own act and its own legislation. This action is in no way justifiable. In fact, it exemplifies the mean-spirited nature of this government with regard to Australian workers—not just Australian unions but Australian workers. This has not happened by accident. I noticed with interest that, when Patrick made their announcement last night, the release from Patrick about their intention to sack and the release from the office of the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) about his response to that were simultaneous.</para><para>This issue has a very long history, and so has what I would regard as the other side's historic contempt for organised labour. They have shown a complete inability to actually understand what an equitable relationship between a worker and his or her employer is. I was actually quite shocked with some of the comments made today by the Minister representing the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, Senator Alston. For a minister of the Crown to get up in here and call a group of people who have just been sacked and deprived of their livelihoods `greedy thugs' is totally and utterly offensive.</para><para>To make comments like `they would not work in an iron lung' and `they have never done a day's work' about people who have just lost their jobs just before Easter and then to compound it by calling them greedy thugs just about sums this government up in terms of what it thinks. The MUA and the 1,400 people who have just been sacked are not the greedy thugs in this debate; the greedy thugs are sitting over on the other side of the chamber.

What is the basis for these sackings? The sackings are illegal, and people on the other side know they are. That is why not one person who spoke from the government side today either in the House of Representatives or in the Senate was able to justify it. In supporting this action, you have breached your own legislation, and you know it. Senator Alston was sitting over there. He got at least four questions with regard to this—he is a lawyer, I believe—and he was not able to answer it, and there is a reason: it is because it is a breach of the act that Peter Reith himself has trumpeted as a benchmark with regard to industrial relations in Australia.</para></talk.start></continue><para> Let us have a look at how the government has gone about this. I think Senator O'Brien has amply described what happened specifically with regard to this dispute. I want to talk about what has happened to industrial relations in this country under this government. The first thing that happened was that the government introduced AWAs. I notice now there has been some movement but basically very poor pick up. The idea behind AWAs is that, if you do not sign the AWA, you do not get a job. They are secret, you cannot find out how much people earn and you have seven minima in terms of what you are allowed.</para><para> The next thing is that the government tried to amend their own legislation with regard to unfair dismissals so that people could be sacked at whim. How prophetic that was when you look back at that debate in terms of what has happened today. Now we have a government-condoned mass sacking of workers in Australia, but there is no need for the unfair dismissal provisions there. They have legislation there. They have their own act there. What do they do? They ignore it.</para><para> It is absolutely crystal clear what the situation is here. Section 170CK(2)(b) of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 says that the employment of a worker cannot be terminated on the basis of membership of a union. Section 170MU says that you cannot terminate an employee for participating in protected industrial action. Section 170CL(2) requires that the CES be informed when an employer decides to terminate the employment of 15 or more employees. The award itself, under which these workers are covered, requires that three days notice be given to workers and their unions where significant industrial change is proposed.</para><para>Patricks is clearly in breach of all three provisions and the government is in breach of all three provisions in terms of their own legislation which they trumpeted as a triumph with regard to industrial relations. The bill that Mr Reith moved this morning provides $250 million to assist this illegal sacking of 1,400 workers, but this government will do nothing about the $9 million that is owed to miners at Cobar in relation to their redundancy entitlements and other areas.</para><para> What does this action mean for average workers? It is not just about the waterfront. This means workers can forget about the relaxed and comfortable stuff. How relaxed and comfortable do you think the 1,400 workers who have just been sacked one day before Easter are feeling? Not very relaxed and comfortable. Forget the promise that no worker will be worse off. How do you think the 1,400 workers who have been sacked are feeling? Do you think they are feeling worse off? I suspect they are. Forget the promise that workers will have choice. This is a word that the government uses a lot with regard to 
 union membership. They say, `It's your right to choose. You can choose.' You can choose to be sacked: that is what the choice is. So much for this government's commitment to choice.</para><para> Who is next on the government's hit list? Who has crossed the government? We know the Public Service has, and look what has happened to it. How many public servants have lost their jobs? Look at the restructuring of the Public Service Act. This government does not like public servants either. So you do not like people who work on the wharf, you do not like public servants and you do not like groups that speak up against the policies of this government. Who is next? That is what the people of Australia are going to be asking themselves.</para><para>This is not about waterfront productivity. I, along with my colleagues, am sick to death of the unctuous nonsense coming from the other side of the chamber with regard to whether this is about waterfront productivity. The government itself set a productivity benchmark of 25 containers an hour. P&amp;O are at 24 at the moment and rising. So much for that. As Senator O'Brien alluded to earlier, Burnie wharfies in my home state of Tasmania have set an Australian record for container loading, and they have just been sacked. They have just set a record and they have just been sacked. What about that, Senator Calvert? What about that?</para><para> This is about manufacturing an election issue. I believe it constitutes the cynical use of innocent workers and their families for political gain. This government is sending out a number of signals today and they include: get in the way of the political agenda and you will be sacked and if you join a union you will be sacked. I have to say that, in terms of cynical action, this is also about the political ambitions of Minister Reith. That is what it is about. Fourteen hundred workers have lost their jobs because Minister Reith is concerned about the Treasurer, Minister Costello. So it is about the numbers also in the Liberal Party, and that is absolutely pathetic.</para><para> Enough is enough. Average Australians are and will be utterly horrified by this action. This is dreadful. This government has gone 
 too far. I know how those on the other side think. I have to say that they have made a major tactical blunder here today—an absolute tactical blunder—and it will not be forgotten. You only have to listen to talkback radio to see the kind of reaction you are getting in relation to this. You have breached your own act. You have thrown your own law out the window and you have exposed yourselves as being an absolute disgrace of a government.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>2371</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The motion that Senator Mackay has moved—even though she said two minutes into her speech that she did not intend speaking on it but Senator O'Brien would probably turn his attention to it—is in relation to industrial conflict on the waterfront and the hardship imposed on thousands of Australian workers. I say that it is indeed the lives of Australian workers that motivate the Australian government in taking its action to introduce industrial relations reforms to the Australian work force and in making sure that the waterfront and Australia as a whole benefit from those reforms.</para></talk.start><para>As I heard Senator Chapman saying a few minutes ago, it is vital that Australia, as an island nation, perform in an internationally competitive way. `International competitiveness' is really a sort of economist's cliche because it does not mean a lot to average Australian households. But what does mean a lot to average Australian households is that they live on an island. All Australians live on an island, be it in Tasmania or on the Australian mainland, and the majority of our exports need to go across a wharf to the overseas marketplace.</para><para>I think all Australians understand that if we are to fulfil our potential as a nation and that if the individuals who form the nation are to maximise their living standards and the potential that the nation offers to all her citizens, then we have to be able to export goods and services. We need to be able to do that in a way that competes with the rest of the world. So if we are going to produce doors, doorknobs, screws and nails, or if we are going to produce pallets of cement or any 
 of those goods and services, we must ensure that our waterfront is an efficient part of the process. And that applies not only to our waterfront. We also need to ensure that our road, rail and shipping systems are all absolutely up to standard. We cannot abide a situation where we have a waterfront that cannot even make the lowest grade in terms of international competitiveness. We cannot have a situation where a crucial gateway to Australia's trade, both inbound and outbound, is blocked up; where a brick wall has been put up by a bunch of people who do not have Australia's best interests at heart.</para><para>If you want to produce something in Australia to sell to a consumer in the United States, you are not only competing against someone down the road in Australia but you are also competing against other people all around the world who are trying to sell the same consumer goods to the same consumers in a state in the United States. If you want to export something there, if you want to attract orders, you have to go and show that your product is good quality, that your product is competitively priced so that the consumers will buy it when they go into the shops in the United States, and you have to ensure that you can deliver it on time.</para><para>If you cannot get it across the waterfront because there have been strikes by members of the MUA, who are supposed to be shifting stuff across the wharves and onto the ships, you will not get it there on time and the costs of supplying it will go up. So Australia will become an unreliable supplier. Unfortunately that is our reputation in many of these areas, and certainly it was our reputation under the former government where we had strike after strike. Certainly the people who are the customers of ships that have been handled by Patricks would see this.</para><para>We do need to look at some of the comparisons. Senator Cook, one of the people who stood shoulder to shoulder with the wharfies in this dispute, said, `Look, they're okay; they are world competitive.' He said, `They are okay; they are up to standard, and it is not fair to compare them with Singapore.' We accept Senator Cook's argument. Don't compare them with Singapore; compare 
 them with workers in places like Auckland, Thailand, Hong Kong or any of these other places that are directly comparable.</para><para>Quite frankly, Australia cannot afford to be just equal to some of these other ports around the world. There is no reason why Australia should not be better. The Labor Party would say, `We're achieving 24 container movements. Every now and again we get to 24.' The average of course is 18. If they can achieve 33 container movements one afternoon so they can get off early to go to a strip show, the Labor Party says, `That's great; we achieved it in one afternoon, so we have achieved it. We don't need reform.' They are saying that we do not need reform.</para><para>Under Labor we had this thing called the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority, the WIRA process that former Senator Bob Collins was put in charge of and that former Prime Minister Bob Hawke obviously had a big hand in. These people opposite are complaining about spending money to assist in the restructuring of the waterfront now, but they spent half a billion dollars on the waterfront under that process. It was an absolute joke of a process. What did they achieve? You have only to turn to Captain Setchell and what he said about the achievements. I shall paraphrase him because I cannot find the bit of paper. He said that we have paid out all of this money, we now have higher wage rates; the wharfies are paid more and we have lower productivity as a consequence of this four- or five-year process that cost Australian taxpayers half a billion dollars.</para><para>Labor's approach then was, `Let's pay them all out, use taxpayers' money to pay them all out and try to achieve productivity that way.' What did they get? Lower comparative productivity because, while we were spending four or five years and $500 million trying to improve productivity, everyone else around the world moved ahead. So for $430 million—to be exact—we ended up with lower productivity, higher paid wharfies and more disputes than we had ever had before.</para><para>That was Labor's approach in government. In opposition it has taken until today to have any approach out of the opposition at all on waterfront reform. The only thing that Mr 
 Beazley has come up with to date is to say, `We would have a little pow-wow. We would get old Bob; we would get the silver bodgie to come in and create a bit of consensus. We will have Bob come back.'</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—Order!

At least they have to stand by their fraternal brothers in the union movement.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I should not get waylaid. I think it is important to focus on what is so important about this debate. I do not think many Australian people see this current dispute and the waterfront reform process as anything to do with mainstream Australia. That is what they need to see this as. It very much affects mainstream, main street Australia. It is about creating jobs; it is about ensuring that Australia's businesses are able to compete in the European, South-East Asian and the American markets on a fair footing with international competitors.</para><para>This government has decided that we do not want to add unnecessary cost to our exporters, many of them small businesses trying to forge markets in the United States and Europe. We do not want to hang a lead weight around their neck before their goods get over the horizon of the Pacific Ocean or the Indian Ocean, out of our ports.</para><para>I ask Australian people who are listening to this debate over the next few days to contemplate this: when you see a ship tied up in port with containers being loaded on it, all of those containers should have `jobs' written on the side of them, because the more containers that move over that horizon, out of those 
 ports, and the quicker they move, the more jobs are created.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>AW5</name.id><name role="metadata">CARR</name><name role="display">Senator Carr</name></talker><para>—There won't be too many moving, thanks to you.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name></talker><para>—Senator Carr is saying there are not going to be many containers moving, so he is threatening to close down the waterfront.

We are looking for one of the best waterfronts in the world; we are looking for one of the best economies in the world; we are looking for the best employment growth in the world; and the best performance in the economy.

They were at pains to indicate just how good the bulk handling in my state was. But in the container area, governments have rightly made the point, as have many other political parties and 
 sources, that progress does need to be made. But even here, different ports are at different levels of productivity and there are different issues between the ports. That highlights the need for workplace level negotiations, for reform to be relevant to the place where the problem is.</para><para>The problem is not uniform right across Australia. That is why we supported the Workplace Relations Act, so that reform could be devoted to the enterprise where the particular problem was. Let me read the first paragraph of that act to you:</para><para>The principal object of this Act is to provide a framework for cooperative workplace relations which promotes the economic prosperity and welfare of the people of Australia . . . </para><para>I do not see much that is cooperative about sacking 1,400 people. That is a gross infringement of the civil rights of the workers of Patricks to join and participate in union activity. People cannot come into this chamber now and say, `Look, this isn't about union bashing; this isn't about getting at a union; this is about competition and productivity.' Just read the newspapers and the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>  records of exactly what the government has been saying about this issue. It has been bash, bash, bash, at the whole principle of workers belonging to unions. That is wrong. We believe in freedom of association. Australian workers not only should be entitled to belong to unions, but they should be encouraged to belong to them. They act in their interests, just as employers should be encouraged to belong to employer organisations.</para><para>We think the infringement of the civil rights of the workers at ports like Townsville and Fremantle is extraordinary, because in those ports there has not even been any industrial action. The actions of the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) in rewarding a company with a guaranteed $250 million of government loans is not an action that is even handed and is not an action that promotes a cooperative industrial relations environment.</para><para>Most of all, we think it is a breach of the Workplace Relations Act. Freedom of association provisions in sections 170CK, 170MU and 298K of the coalition's own act make it 
 abundantly clear that employers cannot sack employees for joining unions, for participating in protected industrial action, or for being dissatisfied with the employment conditions.</para><para>It seems clear to us that there is a case that these provisions, these vital protections of employees' human rights, have been breached in this instance. Section 170CL requires the employer to notify the CES of mass terminations. Section 170GA requires employers to consult with unions on mass redundancies. That, too, has been breached. The award itself appears to have been breached, which is again protected by the act. The act is the coalition's act. The act is designed to protect the interests of both employers and employees.</para><para>We think that this particular employer has trampled over the minister's own Workplace Relations Act. If it was a union trampling over the law, this government would have been up in arms. Here we have an employer breaching the law and what happens? They are rewarded with a $250 million loan and in what must be the fastest drafting of a bill in Australian history—because we all believe in this place that the minister did not, of course, know of Patricks' action until late last night; they just worked overnight to produce this bill rapidly—the legislation to sanction their action was ready to be tabled first thing this morning. If only the fair trading small business legislation could have moved so fast, or if only the anti-transnational avoidance of tax provisions could be introduced so fast.</para><para>What does this bill do? What contribution does it make to waterfront costs and charges? The extraordinary thing to me is that it adds to them. Every time a container is loaded, whether it be by Patricks, P&amp;O or Sealand—they have all had no industrial problems, apart from Patricks—it will cost an extra $20 a container. Every time a vehicle is unloaded, it will cost an extra $10 a container.</para><para>Maybe the government is going to say to us, `Short-term pain, long-term gain.' It remains to be seen. In the meantime, in Tasmania in particular the cost to move goods in and out of that state is going to rise very considerably. To achieve what? To achieve exactly what the Labor government did previously, which was to reduce the number 
 of workers and to provide them with redundancy packages. The difference is that the Labor government negotiated that outcome. If it was the intention of the government to reduce the number of workers and provide them with a redundancy package, why not negotiate it and save us all this pain?</para><para>Many of the 1,400 workers were not in dispute with their employer. As a former business person, I say, `What a cheek.' An employer is being helped out and other employers who had absolutely nothing to do with the dispute are going to have to pay for it. I think that is grotesque. Why should other employers have to pay for the Patricks dispute? What happens if the sackings are overturned by the Federal Court?</para><para>In the meantime—and the coalition does like to talk about mums and dads—what does the government say to those 1,400 mothers and fathers facing Easter with the breadwinner on the dole line? That is what they are. They are not ogres or demons. They are Australian mums and dads. You have got to have the same attitude to them as you have to all other Australians faced with the agony of losing a job.</para><para>What sort of message are we sending to all belligerent employers? What sort of message do we send to the Cobar workers and the Woodlawn miners who asked the government to help their company find redundancy money only a few weeks ago? I know that is a different case. I know they are companies that went bankrupt, but to those workers it is no different. Those workers lose their jobs and they lose their living.</para><para>What we see here are large doses of hypocrisy, inconsistency, unfairness, recklessness and ignorance of the law. What I am angry about is that I am strongly committed to improving productivity and reforming our society to advance the overall wealth of the society. This action will have the ultimate effect of delaying and damaging permanent reform.</para><para>Only last week Australia's shipowners reached a groundbreaking deal with the MUA to remove cost impediments in Australian shipping. We had another groundbreaking deal with Sealand to open a new stevedoring 
 operation in Brisbane. Against that was the stupid decision of the Western Australian government to force one of the two stevedoring companies at the very large port of Dampier off the wharves.</para><para>If this is about competition, what on earth is the government doing supporting monopoly profits? If you are against monopoly profits in the hands of unions, you have to be against monopoly profits in the hands of employers. If you are interested in competition, for goodness sake be consistent with it. What chance is there now for further reform?</para><para>Both employers and employees are damaged by the division which is going to be caused by this problem. I share the concern expressed by the Australian Business Council's Managing Director, Phillip Holt, today that all the drama of the last 24 hours will remove the proper focus from the substantive issues of diversity and competition. Regrettably this has been about attacking the rights of workers to have freedom of association. I resent and regret that. It is a principle which the Australian Democrats hold dear. I appeal to the government to reconsider and to try to lower the temperature and the aggression in this issue and restore some sort of situation where these workers may recover their jobs. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>2375</page.no><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator CARR</name><name.id>AW5</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Every worker in Australia is threatened by this government's actions in regard to the waterfront.

With regard to farmers, over the last 15 years we have reduced tariffs and increased competition in the domestic market; the wheat board regulation has gone; the corporatisation of numerous commodity boards, research and marketing organisations has taken place; the Hilmer reforms, led by your government, have come through with the legislation introduced by your government.

 commodity prices and drought and all those things.</para><para>But you cannot deregulate everything and then say, `Here is one little sector of the market we have got to protect.

It was your government—I do not say it was the left faction, but it was certainly the ALP government—that reduced and removed tariffs and deregulate the wheat board. You did all those sorts of things. We did not particularly like it at the time but we have come to accept it. But you cannot argue that there is this one sector of industry, the one jewel in the Labor crown, that you are going to stand up for—the waterside workers union.

Certainly, over the last six years we have seen a 57 per cent reduction in the work force, we have seen a 127 per cent increase in the number of containers handled per person shift, we have seen a 25 per cent reduction in container terminal charges, and we have seen a 45 per cent reduction in ship turnaround times. We have seen some significant improvement.</para><para>There can be further improvement—no-one disputes that. But this government's approach has been to be actively involved in the planning of the sacking of 1,400 workers who are not engaged in an industrial dispute. We would argue that that is illegal. It is against Mr Reith's own Workplace Relations Act that was passed in this Senate at the end of 1996. It is illegal to do that.</para><para>Here we have Minister Reith and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) actively entering into partnership with Patricks to break the law. If that was not bad enough, they are not just acting in partnership to break the law; they are going to underpin this deal to break the law with a levy on the industry to the tune of a quarter of a billion dollars—a $250 million levy across the industry on motor vehicles and containers, of $6 per vehicle and $12 per container. That is not going to be welcome news in my home state of Tasmania, because a lot of cars move in and out of Tasmania, a lot of containers. We are almost totally dependent on seaborne trade into my island state. It is not going to be particularly welcome there.</para><para>But the entire industry has to pay this levy. So Patricks, who are in some commercial trouble and have decided to sack 1,400 workers, are being cross-subsidised by other private sector companies. It is a bit like the 
 government introducing a levy across the entire financial sector, levying ANZ to help cross-subsidise the National Australia Bank in their sacking of 1,400 workers. It is a ridiculous and absurd approach.</para><para>We are assured by the government that these costs will be met and absorbed by the industry through a new tax of $6 per vehicle and $12 per container. The fact is that the consumer who buys the goods that are transported as a result of this new tax will pay the extra cost. There is no way that the government can force a company like Patricks to absorb this additional new tax. There is no way they can do that.</para><para>Further on in Mr Reith's speech he talks about an interesting new principle in industrial relations. He says, `Today the government is encouraging employers in both shipping and stevedoring to take immediate steps to normalise their employment practices in line with community standards.' I stress the words `to normalise their employment practices in line with community standards'. What Minister Reith is saying is that waterside workers—and he does it in a very exaggerated form—earn significantly above the average wage in the community. I do not accept his figures—they tend to vary. Some in this debate have said $70,000, some have said $80,000 and some have said $90,000. The figures that are bandied about vary from government speaker to government speaker.</para><para>He talks about normalising their employment practices in line with community standards. Well, there are quite a number of monopolies, and a significant number of people in this country are paid well above average weekly earnings. Lawyers have a great monopoly. You cannot practise unless you are a member of a particular lawyers association. So maybe the government should be saying to this monopoly, `Let's support a private sector legal firm that wants to sack their lawyers and reduce their wages to the community standard, and we will help by sending in some security guards and some dogs to keep the lawyers out.' Imagine the outrage if any government attempted to reduce and break the monopoly of lawyers—or, for that matter, executives—to normalise their em 
 ployment practices in line with community standards. There would be absolute outrage if that approach were taken.</para><para>I want to refer briefly to my home port of Burnie. Nineteen workers have been sacked there, and they are not greedy thugs. I know quite a number of those workers. They are workers with families who make an important contribution to that community. There has been no industrial dispute in Burnie, yet they are among the 1,400 workers who have been sacked. Burnie is a highly efficient port, one of the most efficient in the country. Yet 19 workers and the other 1,380-odd who have been sacked have not engaged in any form of industrial action. The figure that Minister Reith uses—$270,000—is not correct. In the case of the Burnie workers, including superannuation, it will be $46,000. This is just another example of Minister Reith's demonising of a group of Australian workers for his political purposes. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>2381</page.no><name role="metadata">Crane, Sen Winston</name><name role="display">Senator CRANE</name><name.id>UW4</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am delighted to rise to speak on this motion but, unfortunately, it is the wrong motion to debate in relation to the waterfront.

We need to look at history in dealing with the waterfront. I certainly take note of what Senator Murray said in terms of the situation with the efficiency and productivity of bulk commodities. The opposite is true about container movements.</para></talk.start><para>How did we get there? We got there through a whole series of court actions going back through the 1980s as far as 1976. I am going to highlight some of those actions. It was a long, hard fight. The first one I was involved in was back in 1976 when the MUA placed political bans on Chilean and Indonesian flagships. An action was taken then under the Crimes Act in the Supreme Court of Western Australia. After a request by the then Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser, and the then President of the ACTU, Bob Hawke—he might have been secretary; I am not sure—they both came to Perth and talked to us about it. We said we would not pull off the 
 legal action, that we would uphold the law. Three days later, we got a phone call from Bob Hawke saying, `If you discontinue your action, we will lift the bans.' That case remains adjourned sine die in the Supreme Court of Western Australia today and there have not been any more bans on Chilean and Indonesian flagships. That took very severe legal action.</para><para>We then go a little bit further and look at the Mackay sugar case. Once again, it had to be dragged through the courts. We look at the continuous loading case. We got a 64 per cent productivity gain out of that just by rearranging work time, at no cost to anybody, no wages lost. It took months and months dragging the MUA and associated unions through the courts.

Once again, it was a 45D action, if my memory serves me correctly; once agin it went through the courts and had to get a legal direction to change the situation. They never learnt. They had the opportunity to learn but they never learnt. We can continue to go through these cases. Remember the Geraldton case? Remember when they moved up there they were going to close down farmers' ability to harvest. All the silos were full, CBH could not operate and the port was not operating. Once again, that went through the courts, They never learnt. That is the problem with the argument that is put forward.</para></talk.start></continue><para>This is somewhat different. Although it took the AWU in the wide comb case a long time

That is the whole sad history of this and union tactics.</para><para>Many months ago, Mr Reith highlighted that the average container movement—that is all we are talking about here, container movements—was in the order of 18 per hour. He set a target of 25 per hour as a good benchmark for Australia. There was no response whatsoever. When you come down to the bottom line of this particular situation, we find very clearly that Patricks were forced into a situation which I believe we would all prefer not to have had.</para><para>You talk about freedom of association.

Why are container movements very important? Because they handle dairy, they handle meat, they handle vegies, they handle perishables, they handle all sorts of commodities and they handle parts and supplies. But most important of all in terms of our performance with container loading is the simple fact that the major shipping companies will not come to Australia. Recently, I had a shipping company which will not come to Australia say to me, `It is safer to send a ship into a war zone. We know some don't come back, but when they go to Australia you have no idea if and when they might come back.' That is one of the reasons why this is necessary.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In the time I have left, I want to deal with redundancies.

I will not touch on the superannuation points here because I think they are already available. You have made that particular point.</para><para>I repeat again that the MUA have brought this on themselves. They had the opportunity to take action to fix the waterfront. They were given that opportunity by this government. The simple fact is that Australia could no longer afford to continue with the work practices which exist on our waterfront because they are damaging our ability to trade, damaging our ability to perform and damaging our ability to maximise the returns that should be coming back into this nation.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Patterson)</name></talker><para>—Order!

The <inline font-style="italic">Student and Youth Assistance Act 1973</inline>  provides the legislative basis for the AUSTUDY scheme and the AUSTUDY Financial Supplement loans scheme. The Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (DEETYA) administers AUSTUDY policy and the scheme is delivered through Centrelink.</para><para>AUSTUDY provides assistance to eligible secondary and tertiary students. Students must generally have reached 16 years of age and be studying full time in approved courses at schools, TAFE colleges, higher education institutions or certain other approved tertiary institutions within Australia. Students undertaking accredited private sector courses have access to AUSTUDY assistance on the same basis as students attending publicly funded institutions.</para><para>AUSTUDY is targeted to students most in need of financial support. Because of this, various income and assets tests, including an Actual Means Test, are applied in determining students' eligibility for assistance. AUSTUDY is complemented by other Government programs such as ABSTUDY, which provides financial assistance to Indigenous students, and the Assistance for Isolated Children (AIC) Scheme which provides assistance to families whose children do not have reasonable daily access to an appropriate Government school.</para><para>During 1996-97, DEETYA Student Assistance Centres (SACs) processed 504 399 applications and 417 597 reassessments; over 1.14 million telephone inquiries were received; and from November 1996 to June 1997 almost 471 500 counter inquiries were handled. In total, SACs dealt with more than 2.9 million client transactions, most of which occurred during a compressed processing season from December to April.</para><para>The Government has found the recommendations of the Report valuable in its consideration of the future of student assistance.

In particular, it will recognise the variety of ways in which young people move between job search and study activities, and combine part time work with part time study. The Youth Allowance will bring income support payments under one umbrella, and replace most income support payments for young people 16 to 20 years of age and for full-time students up to 25 years of age, including:</para><para>.

The report relates to the student financial assistance scheme, Austudy, and it has taken until now, for whatever reason, to actually get a government response to the recommendations contained in that report.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I would like the Senate to note that there were a number of very positive recommendations contained in that report, which, I understand, was quite a comprehensive deliberation over student financial assistance, in particular the operations of the Austudy scheme. The report follows on the heels of a number of inquiries by government as well as independent sources into student financial assistance. In 1991, we had the Price report in the House of Representatives and, in 1992, the so-called Chapman report, which ended up advocating a system of loans.</para><para>All of those reports canvassed important issues such as the disparity between unemployment benefits and student assistance. They also talked about difficulties between departments—Social Security and Employment, Education and Training. They also canvassed the issue of the age at which students were entitled to some form of assistance. I wish to draw the Senate's attention to recommendation No. 2 in that particular 1995 report. It states:</para><para>That DEET undertakes a detailed analysis of the costs and benefits associated with a reduction from 22 to 21 years in the age of entitlement to independent rate of AUSTUDY.</para><para>Needless to say, the government's response is that it does not accept this recommendation. It is worth pointing out, given the recent deliberations over the common youth allowance and other legislative changes to not only education funding but also student assistance in particular, that the department, or in this case the government, not only reduced the age at which students were eligible for the independent rate of assistance—that is, from 22 to 21 in that circumstance—but also made a very different, quite contrary, recommendation which was passed by the Senate last year, and that was to increase the age at which students were entitled to receive Austudy. That was increased to the age of 25.</para><para>That age has been replicated, for the purposes of the current framework, for assistance to both students and young unemployed people; that is, the ages of independence are completely concocted and they are a sham. Under the common youth allowance, students cannot access financial assistance until the 
 age of 25. They are considered financially dependent upon their parents well into adulthood. For a young unemployed person, the age is 21.</para><para>Once again, despite recommendations to the contrary in reports such as this and in previous reports on student assistance, we see the age of independence increased to a level that has no other real legislative framework. There is a moral obligation—there should not be a legal obligation—on parents to support their children until the age of 25. In fact, I should not refer to them as children, given that, at the age of 25, they are certainly adults.</para><para>There are a number of other issues contained in this report. One of the recommendations relates to rent assistance. Because it is nice to commend something this government has done for students and young people, I acknowledge the extension, for the first time, of rent assistance to students as a result of the common youth allowance measures. But unfortunately it comes with a policy framework that makes eligibility for rent assistance quite restricted, quite narrow. It is also accompanied by a one-third cut in rent assistance for those students living in shared accommodation. So, once again, a number of positive recommendations have been overlooked by this government.</para><para>I would like to place on record, especially in the context of the debate that took place in this place yesterday, the department's organisation of a media strategy document to target those of us who continue to scrutinise and expose the negative aspects of government legislation in relation to young people and students. I move:</para><para>That the Senate take note of the document.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>2392</page.no><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator CARR</name><name.id>AW5</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I do not wish to speak for very long, other than to point out that this is a government response to a report prepared by the Senate Employment, Education and Training Committee in June 1995. It takes a long time to get a response from this government—an extraordinarily long time. I note, yet again, the number of recommendations that this government have not accepted. It seems to take them year 
 after year to come up with a proposition. They do not like hearing what they have been advised by a Senate committee. It would have been much simpler if, when they got the response, they had simply said no, and dealt with it in a more direct and honest way. This government try year after year to get rid of reports. They hope they will be buried and that issues will go away in the manner that we have seen with so many other reports.</para></talk.start><para>I postponed a motion today, the substance of which was on this very question: the failure of this government to respond to the committees of this parliament and, in particular, its failure to respond to estimates committees with answers to questions on matters of great importance to the people of this country—in this case, student assistance. We see this in every division of the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs. We see it in relation to every aspect of this minister, Dr Kemp, in regard to his failure to adequately respond and the trend to treat this parliament in a contemptuous manner.</para><para>We have been promised for days that we will get responses to various reports of this committee. In the case of the report <inline font-style="italic">Beyond Cinderella: a learning society</inline>, which was presented in April 1997, we still have not had a response. There is still no response to the report entitled <inline font-style="italic">Not a level playground: the private and commercial funding of government schools</inline>, presented in June 1997. The report entitled <inline font-style="italic">Childhood matters</inline>, the report of the inquiry into early childhood education, presented in July 1996, has been sent off by this government to another department for response. We will never see the end of that matter. The report will disappear into the great vortex of some other department until the government can find somewhere else to pigeonhole it. Maybe it will be forgotten. Maybe we will not remember. I assure the government and I assure this minister that I will not forget. I will do my very best to assist them, to remind them of their obligations to this parliament and the people of this country to respond in a proper manner.</para><para>When it comes down to basic issues like answering questions to this parliament, this 
 government no longer has the capacity. This is the real question: the government no longer have the capacity to answer questions. The government do not know how to do it because they have gutted the departments. They have sacked so many people in the Public Service that they cannot even answer simple questions, simple propositions. They have to get in another consultant to help them out with basic requirements. I noticed today that, once again, KPMG has had another good run. I suppose we will get a KPMG report assessing this committee. Maybe they will come up with a proposal that will demonstrate to this government that, `We can't really accept their recommendations anyway.' But it will probably cost a couple of hundred thousand to reach that conclusion.</para><para>It is time that the government faced up to its obligations. It is appropriate that it respond adequately to the reports of this parliament, to the committees of this parliament. It is just not good enough. This response to Austudy is another example. It is just not good enough.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Electoral Matters Committee</title><page.no>2393</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report:  Government Response</title><page.no>2393</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>2393</page.no><name role="metadata">Brownhill, Sen David</name><name role="display">Senator BROWNHILL</name><name.id>RD4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I present the government's response to the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters on the 1996 Federal Election, and I seek leave to incorporate the document in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> .</para></talk.start><para>Leave granted.</para><para>The document read as follows—</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Electoral Integrity</inline></para><para>Recommendation 1</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">That the AEC prepare a comprehensive implementation plan on the Committee's proposed measures to improve the integrity of the enrolment and voting process, and report back to the Committee by the end of 1997.</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Response</inline></para><para>1.

This is the last KPMG report that we are going to get. It was made necessary, of course, because of the divided responsibility of paying travel allowance and actually travelling between the Department of the Senate and the Department of Finance and Administration, and its predecessor, the Department of Administrative Services. For the two-year period that this report covers, it shows that only 2.9 per cent of travel allowance claims required further reconciliation. It is quite a low figure—2.9 per cent—but then remember that the error rate that they found involving repayments through mistakes was a mere 0.49 per cent. Again, if you compared that with commercial standards or somewhere else, is quite a remarkably low figure.</para><para>I have to say, however, that the tables contained in this report on page 5 and page 7 are quite confusing in some ways. Let me give you an example. In the data matching results in 1996-97 it shows that one senator had 24 unreconciled claims until further 
 checking; in the final column it shows that all 24 claims were reconciled. What it does not tell you is whether that senator paid any money back at all. It is quite possible that that person had 24 challenges, resolved them all, and was not involved in one repayment. Someone who was up the list, who may have had eight misclaims, might have had to repay all eight. It is quite a confusing table. If it was done deliberately, I congratulate them for doing it in that way, because it certainly confused everyone.</para><para>I was very pleased that I received two letters from KPMG, on the two occasions they sent them out, and each time they advised me that I had no unreconciled claims. This, of course, does not go to my credit at all. It just goes to the credit of my staff, who must have put all the forms together accurately and diligently, and I thank them for that. I also stress that mistakes will happen and they have clearly happened here.</para><para>We, as an opposition, have always tried to benchmark where the line is between mistakes and exploitation. It is always an arbitrary figure. We always put a figure of about eight for a year. Eight or less could probably be explained through mistakes and forgetfulness. Some people always assume they might have been here on a Thursday night, and for some reason got an early flight, and that was not picked up by their staff member in travel allowances claimed. But anything beyond that we think needs a very serious look.</para><para>But the government has chosen today not to table its promised travel details for the period of July to December 1997. The opposition understands the minister's reasons for this. The opposition endorses the minister's decision not to table those details here today. What is proposed here is a far more detailed record of members' and senators' travel than has ever been tabled in this chamber before. Certainly, you can go to every state parliament in the country and you will see nothing like this; the transparency will be nothing like the system that is evolving in the federal parliament. I would almost say it is probably the most transparent system of any parliament around the globe.</para><para>Of course, to try to get this information ready provided an absolutely mammoth task for DoFA. The documents alone—not the published ones: the published ones will be about 800, and there are the ones kept in reserve for access on application—when the two are added together, total about 2,000 pages of information that they have had to collate, print and make sure they are absolutely accurate. For instance, never before have we published the commercial airfares that senators and members have incurred in the course of their duties. That information will be published. Naturally, travel allowance will be published, Comcar costs, the costs of a private plated vehicle that you get under the Remuneration Tribunal provisions—a whole range of information that has never been put on the public record before is intended to be put on the public record.</para><para>So DoFA has faced an enormously difficult and massive task in accumulating this information and making sure it is accurate. The method of doing so, of course, was to send each senator and member what it was proposed to publish so they could check and make any corrections. I have to say, and it is not DoFA's fault, hundreds and hundreds of corrections had to be put into the system. Even having done that task, when DoFA resubmitted those forms to all of us, some of the mistakes that were supposed to be corrected continued and more mistakes were found.</para><para>I think Minister Minchin has made a very proper decision that if he is not guaranteed in his own mind that the 800 pages are mistake free, he is not going to table them in this parliament until they are mistake free. The opposition agrees with him in that decision. Lest anyone run around from the press gallery or anywhere else saying there is some sort of cover-up here, a lack of transparency, or a failure to do duty, the real prime responsibility is to publish this information and make sure that it is accurate.</para><para>When it is finally published, some caution should be used in analysing the figures. Some attempt should be made to master the methodology involved in these figures. I want to give you a couple of examples. First, for 
 the first time ever, we are going to have published the commercial airfares of each senator and member, including ministers and office holders. Remember, it is natural that those who are coming from Sydney and Melbourne are going to have a far lower figure than those from Perth, Cairns and Townsville.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>UW4</name.id><name role="metadata">CRANE</name><name role="display">Senator Crane</name></talker><para>—Try Jerdacuttup!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>UI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator ROBERT RAY</name></talker><para>—That is right. But, secondly—remember this, Senator Crane, you have to be careful about this—this is money paid in that period, not necessarily travel undertaken in that period. If you are like me and you are booked in advance, all the money goes in that period, even though the travel is later.</para></talk.start></continue><para>But even more risky is that if you have been using a travel agent or someone else who has been very slow to process your previous year and a half, that will all be dumped in that six-month period. So anyone reading those figures should go to the footnotes. If they have any doubt, once the figures are published and before any newspaper articles appear, journalists should ring the DoFA hotline just to check whether there is some explanation for what may look like, in some case, an extraordinarily high figure.</para><para>The final point I mention is this: let us say that Senator Crane or I have a figure of $15,000. Amongst that could be $3,000 worth of expenditure on flights that were not taken—where you have cancelled the ticket but the refund is not in. So that report would show Senator Crane or me as having expended $15,000. The next report of course would show a $3,000 refund, but you have got to be careful that no journalist or anyone else says, `Your figure is extraordinarily high.' If you had taken out the cancelled tickets, it would have just come down to the average.</para><para>Again, I welcome the tabling of the KPMG report. I think they have done a fairly good job. It indicates that members of parliament have not made many mistakes in travel allowance claims. Where there has not been sufficient verification, four out of five of these claims have been reconciled by other evidence, and only 0.49 per cent represent mistakes in which refunds have had to be 
 made. There are not many organisations in the commercial sector that can show you a mistake rate that low. For all the bagging politicians get about their entitlements, most of them, despite their range of duties and pressures, have managed to get this right.</para><para>So the much more transparent system with a much wider set of figures—which I presume we will see in May—will do more than all the deliberations of the Remuneration Tribunal to keep the system honest. In 1983 Labor initiated a task of making the system transparent. We progressed with that through the next decade, making it more and more transparent. That has now been enhanced by Senator Minchin—and I give him credit for that—who has made it more transparent, keeping in mind some privacy aspects which should be there. By making it transparent, we will have a system that will mean that anyone in future who steps over the line or decides to be a maximiser or a cheater on entitlements will get caught.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>2406</page.no><name role="metadata">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Reynolds)</name><name.id>10000</name.id><electorate>PO</electorate><party>N/A</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Order! On the KPMG internal audit report of 1995 to 1997, last year KPMG was asked to audit travelling allowance payments made to senators during financial years 1995-96 and 1996-97. The audit was confined to an electronic matching of Senate department travelling allowance records with DAS and other travel records. Where the records matched, the auditors concluded that the senator was at the place for which travelling allowance was claimed and the records were reconciled.</para></talk.start><para>Where the records did not match, the auditors assumed this was because the official travel records were incomplete. Senators and former senators were asked if they had any additional travel information, such as frequent flier point records, to supplement the official travel records. Where this additional information matched with the payments information, the auditors concluded that the senator was at the place for which travel allowance was claimed and the records were reconciled.</para><para>In other cases, however, with the assistance of senators and former senators, a review of travel records identified errors in claiming travelling allowance or in processing claims. 
 This resulted in some repayments of travel allowance by senators and some payments to senators by the department of previously unclaimed travelling allowance.</para><para>The auditors examined 13,029 travelling allowance records and reconciled 12,657—or 97.1 per cent of them—in the initial data matching process. Of these, 372 travelling allowance records were not initially reconciled because the official travel records were incomplete. Senators and former senators were asked if they could assist with any additional travelling information, again, frequent flier point records. Of these 372 travel allowance records, 259—or 70 per cent—were reconciled as a result of such additional information. Of the remaining 113 unreconciled travelling allowance records, 94 were due to incorrect claims, eight arose from processing errors and 11 are still under examination. Thus, of 13,029 travelling allowance claims involving payments of $2,043,610, there were 94 incorrect claims, or 0.7 per cent of all claims.</para><para>The KPMG report makes two matters clear. Firstly, the mere fact that a senator was asked for additional information casts no reflection on that senator. It means only that the official travel records may have been incomplete or open to misinterpretation by auditors, and senators may have had—and indeed did have—other useful travel records or information. Secondly, the auditors concluded that the overwhelming majority of travelling allowance records were fully supported by independently collected travel records, and this reflected favourably on the overall adequacy of financial controls over travelling allowance payments.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Auditor-General's Reports</title><page.no>2406</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report No. 39 of 1997-98</title><page.no>2406</page.no></subdebateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—In accordance with the provisions of the Audit Act 1901, I present the following report of the Auditor-General:</para></talk.start><para><inline font-style="italic">Report No. 39 of 1997-98—Performance Audit—Management of Selected Functions of the Child Support Agency.</inline></para></interjection></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>OECD Environment Performance Review of Australia</title><page.no>2407</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>2407</page.no><name role="metadata">Brownhill, Sen David</name><name role="display">Senator BROWNHILL</name><name.id>RD4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I present the OECD Environment performance review of Australia, together with a statement by the Minister for the Environment and seek leave to incorporate the statement in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> .</para></talk.start><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The statement read as follows</inline>—</para><para>I am pleased to present to the Senate the OECD's first environmental performance review of Australia.</para><para>The document is a comprehensive and measured audit of Australia's environment; a catalogue of the measures that governments have implemented to repair and protect it; and a set of proposals for development of environmental policy and policy processes.</para><para>The most gratifying feature of the report is the authors' acknowledgment of our responsible stewardship of what they describe as an "ecologically unique continent, characterised by mega-bio-diversity", and our external territories.</para><para>And this in spite of the pressures created by what the review notes is our relatively fast growing economy within the OECD, reliant on primary industries and energy intensive industries.</para><para>More needs to be done.

There is in fact a minority report prepared as a result of this inquiry. I would like to turn my comments to the substance of that minority report. This issue of leasehold tenure in the ACT is something that has been subject to no less than six comprehensive reports. Initiated by both Labor and Liberal in the past, what we have seen with this bill is yet another effort on behalf of, this time, the ACT Liberal government to engage in a collaborative effort with their federal counterparts to once again inquire and explore the scope that exists within the system to change the ACT leasehold system. One would have thought that, by now, the futility of this exercise was well canvassed. I have to say the 
 stated aim of the government's bill in its move to extend leasehold from a 99-year renewable term to a 999-year renewable term is to remove what they claim to be a disincentive to investment to the ACT.</para><para> With respect to the Labor Party and as a result of the witnesses that came forth before this inquiry, we found that there is no compelling or factual evidence that presents any argument that would substantiate that our leasehold system provides this barrier. What we are dealing with is an ongoing campaign on behalf of certainly the ACT Liberals to try to create a bit of a smokescreen as to what some of the problems are in attracting investment to the ACT. Indeed, I contend that the responsibility of the flaws in any perceived difficulty in attracting investment is better placed at the foot of the ACT government and not on the furphy of an issue in once again attacking the leasehold system in the ACT.</para><para> The issue that is claimed to be behind this bill has been quite dramatically discredited to the point where an explicit request by Labor members of the committee for witnesses to provide the substantive evidence that would show that this leasehold change would indeed improve investment was not forthcoming. It is based on anecdotal comments and, as I said before, the advocates of such a plan are not in a position to progress any solid argument.</para><para> The other issue I would like to comment briefly on is the poor state of organisation of the ACT government with respect to this. During the process of the inquiry, specific questions were asked of the ACT minister responsible on how it was proposed to deal with this issue, given that this bill is enabling legislation which would open the door for the ACT assembly to change the leasehold tenure through their own acts. The minister's response was entirely inadequate. In fact, it became very obvious indeed that the ACT government was not adequately prepared, further providing substance to our view that this was tied in with a political stunt and not structured in any way to address the issue of substance that they claim motivated this bill in the first instance.</para><para> I urge all senators who have an interest with respect to ACT land tenure issues to 
 have a look at the arguments presented and canvassed in both the majority and minority reports. I believe you will find quite conclusively that there is absolutely nothing compelling about this bill that is worthy of the support of this chamber.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5F4</name.id><name role="metadata">CALVERT</name><name role="display">Senator Calvert</name></talker><para>—Madam Deputy President, I wish to make a point.

When one talks about native title, one talks about the incidence of native title and cultural and customary concerns. Native title is an embodiment of all those concerns. What the government is saying is, `Well, in some circumstances, the court can disregard the fundamentals of native title, the cultural and customary concerns.' What the legislation already says is that the court must take this into account. We think it is important that there be an imperative on the court to continue to take these concerns into account; to continue to take not just the words `native title' into account, but everything that is a constituent part of the concept of native title. This is an important amendment and is one that we moved last time in this debate. It was not carried last time, but what we are talking about here is an obligation on courts to continue to respect the composition of native title.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>2410</page.no><name role="metadata">Minchin, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator MINCHIN</name><name.id>JX4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State;Minister Assisting the Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We did debate this whole matter at great length last

It was all very well when the Native Title Act was written to operate on a presumption that proceedings would not involve other title holders. But now, for 40 per cent of Australia, it will involve coexisting title holders. The rules as to the Federal Court's operations in dealing with native title claims must be fair to all parties because it is a fact that other title holders may feel some prejudice if the rules are not fair to all who appear before the court. We think this unduly biases the Federal Court's way of operating in a particular manner that is not necessarily fair and even handed for all parties that will now be caught up in native title claims as a result of the Wik decision.

We still think it is critically important that the presiding officer be a judge. We think that should be the case even more so for the future than for the past because the responsibilities in this area are going to be pretty enormous over the next few years. If government needs to do anything over the next few years it is to ensure that millions of dollars are put into the tribunal and the Federal Court to accommodate for the diverse range of litigation that will flow from this legislation.</para></talk.start><para>In a circumstance where people will be going to the tribunal and the courts more, it is important that the tribunal maintain a position of respect in the community. Justice French has done an enormous job over recent years. Part of his success has come from the fact that he has been recognised as an eminent judge. We think it is important that that precedent be continued. We think it is important, for the reasons I have mentioned, that the presiding officer continue to be a judge.</para><para>The government says, `We may not find a judge who is interested in the job.' We still think it is important though and it be avail 
 able to the government to ensure that a person can be appointed as a judge and then appointed to the tribunal thereafter.

For the reasons I have mentioned, we support this amendment.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>2412</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Currently only Federal Court judges or former judges from any jurisdiction can be appointed as presidential members after the appointment crosses the Prime Minister's desk. The amendments seek to change this requirement so that a person who has been a legal practitioner for at least five years can be appointed as a presidential member and inserts a new subsection into the table contained in section 110.</para></talk.start><para>As of late 1997, there were five presidential members, including the President, Justice French, and 13 ordinary members of the tribunal. Two of the current full-time ordinary members are Aboriginal. Ordinary members are only required to have been a legal practitioner for at least five years. The main difference between ordinary members and presidential members is the power to direct.</para><para>The principle of non-judges being appointed to presidential positions may appear on the surface to be perfectly reasonable. For example, many experienced practitioners may have more knowledge about Aboriginal issues than most Federal Court judges or ex-judges. Judges are nearly all ruling class, middle age, white men. This is a paradigm that should be broken down and to select from such a select pool of people would be considered as inappropriate for the National Native Title Tribunal. To this end, there are no Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander judges or ex-judges in Australia.</para><para>Currently, the government is finding it difficult to find presidential members. Justice French wishes to resume his Federal Court duties but has recently been persuaded to remain until at least the end of the year. There does not appear in the Native Title Act any provision for the position of acting president and, in addition, the government can no longer compel judges to sit on tribunals. Wilson v. Minister for Aboriginal and Torres 
 Strait Islander Affairs proved that. However, it is unclear whether the government is simply rejecting many possible appointees, especially ex-judges, because those willing to take up the job are perceived as being too progressive.</para><para>Justice French is on record supporting the proposed changes. In his submission on proposed amendments in 1995 he stated:</para><para>Under the proposed amendments the present organisational arrangements of the Tribunal would remain unchanged. The Registrar would continue to be the Chief Executive Officer of the Tribunal under the President and would remain the Registers of Native Title Claims and Native Title Determinations.</para><para>Having regard to the desirability of distinguishing the role of the Tribunal from that of a court, it would be appropriate that no serving Judges be involved in its ongoing work. This would also have the advantage of limiting the diversion of resources from the Federal Court which will, on any view, have a significant role in the hearing and determination of native title cases or substantive issues arising from them.</para><para>That would indicate that the government needs to provide more funding. Further, in his submission in August 1996 on section 110, Justice French stated:</para><para>This section as it presently stands sets out the categories of membership of the Tribunal and the qualifications for appointment to those categories. The amendment extends the qualifications of Presidential Members to include persons who have been legal practitioners for five years or more. The amendment is supported. It will provide greater flexibility in the appointment of members to the Tribunal.</para><para>That sounds on the surface to be reasonable. The Aboriginal people I have spoken to, such as Mick Dodson, the Social Justice Commissioner, and others from various Aboriginal corporations, believe that the requirement that presidential members come from the judiciary should remain.</para><para>Three main reasons have been given. Firstly, they believe the government is wanting to open up the field not to appoint presidential members who are more appropriate, but to the contrary—to appoint people who will do the government's bidding. Secondly, they believe it will lower the stature of the National Native Title Tribunal which has come under considerable attack in recent 
 times and this will become just another area where Aboriginal people's forums are downgraded. Thirdly, they believe that judges are less likely to be influenced by the government which has appointed them than a lawyer. Judges have had the experience of working in an environment with clear separation of powers and will respect the need to remain independent.</para><para>Mick Dodson in particular has much more trust and  respect for the judiciary than the government. In our conversation recently he said it was the judiciary which gave Aboriginal people native title and the government which is attempting to extinguish it. In his 1995-96 native title report, Mick Dodson wrote:</para><para>This proposal may undermine the standing of the NNTT. In the establishment and consolidation phase of a body with the significant and unusual functions of the NNTT, it is vital that it be perceived as credible and impartial. This perception would be undermined if the President and Deputy President of the NNTT were not required to have judicial experience. I therefore believe that the proposed amendment is inappropriate.</para><para>I believe the feeling is quite strong. In fact it has been said that some Aboriginal people felt the tribunal could be stacked with government lackeys. We cannot be a party to this kind of process. It has been debated before I know, and I urge the Senate to support this important amendment.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>2413</page.no><name role="metadata">Minchin, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator MINCHIN</name><name.id>JX4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State;Minister Assisting the Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Senate fortunately passed this amendment last time to ensure that governments did have somewhat more flexibility in regard to the appointment of the president of the tribunal.

Justice French, the existing head of the tribunal, has strongly supported this proposition and has said so to the parliamentary committee. The opposition seems to be driven by some paranoid suspicion about this particular government. It really is quite ludicrous.</para><para>The point is that there are significant difficulties with the amendments we are proposing and the significant change to the operation of the tribunal as a result of the Brandy decision and the sorts of amendments that must be therefore made and in light of the High Court decision about what serving judges should or should not do in respect of executive functions. I think that is increasingly a problem, which means that appointing serving judges to this position is going to be an increasing problem. Therefore, you are restricted to former judges.</para><para>This is not a court; this is a mediation service and an arbitration service in the right to negotiate. I think it is important for governments of whatever persuasion and whatever colour to be able to ensure that the best possible person to head a tribunal of that kind, a mediation service, should be appointed and indeed to ensure that if there is a qualified Aboriginal person available who is the best person for the job to ensure that they can do it. We think it is very important that the provisions in the bill are passed. The ALP should support them because they did before. As I say, Justice French strongly supports them.

Amendments 79 and 80 clarify the notification functions of representative bodies to reduce duplication. The act imposes obligations on representative bodies and other persons to notify native title holders. Where it is likely that a person who may hold native title has already been notified, the representative body need not give notice to those persons.</para><para>Finally, government amendment 81 inserts a note pointing out that where a person is refused assistance by a representative body he or she can obtain a statement of reasons for the refusal under section 13 of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977. Those amendments do take account of the fruitful and useful discussions we have had with all parties since the last debate to see how we can further improve the provisions relating to representative bodies, which I think generally are supported. So I commend these amendments.

Once again, most of those amendments were moved by the Greens (WA). The opposition will support most of those amendments. In this respect, we have once again tried to work on and build on the provisions that passed the Senate last year to see if we could actually add to what went through. Our concern last time—and our concern continues to be—was that rep bodies are in fact quite integral to the workability of the scheme. The legislation gives them more responsibility, provides more accountability and, particularly in respect of indigenous land use agreements, the burden will increasingly fall on representative bodies.</para></talk.start><para>We believe that they should be competent and they should be resourced. We also believe that accountability is extremely important in this area and, to a major extent, we support the government's measures for accountability. But we did find problems with the government's position last time, and we are finding them again this time. We believe that accountability should come together with self-determination and, although there should be 
 a capacity for governments at the end of the process to have an override in principle of accountability, in the first instance, there should in fact be accountability directly to ATSIC, with the minister as a last resort.</para><para>We also think that the re-recognition process proposed by the government is not well thought out. It does involve a lot of problems. It will mean more work for rep bodies at a time when this legislation will demand from them a lot more work. In fact all stakeholders will demand a lot more work and diligence in a much faster time period from the rep bodies. So there are problems with the government's proposals. These problems go very much to the heart of what representative bodies are all about—they are there to represent the organisations. As I said last time, the degree of accountability imposed on them this time is far in excess of that of any other community or private sector body which is in receipt of funds from government. Our concern is that what the government is trying to do is silence the critics but, knowing Aboriginal people, they will not be successful at that.</para><para>As I said, the process has been to try to build on some of the protections retained last year. In respect of the government's amendments, although we support all of those amendments that have been put up by Senator Minchin, we do have concerns with some. In respect of transfers of documents and records, the ALP amendment would ensure that a rep body does take into account traditional laws and customs and does take into account the views of the people they represent when meeting these obligations.</para><para>In respect of these specific amendments, I will speak to each of them as they come up. In summary, we support most of the government's amendments but, in respect of some, we have amendments which we will be pursuing.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>2416</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Senator Woodley is going to lead the charge, but I do have a problem.

They are absolutely critical to the process, and that is why we have to make sure that we get right the legal framework in which they will operate.</para></talk.start><para>I think all of us have had representations and all of us have listened to evidence given in some of the native title committee hearings which showed that there have been shortcomings with some of the representative bodies. I would like to say that, while I think the shortcomings may be to do with the rep bodies themselves and how they are selected, part of the problem is also in the resourcing of those rep bodies and the framework in which they have had to operate.</para><para>While I am saying there are criticisms, let me also say that in terms of some of the rep bodies—and let us recognise other people in this place besides senators—there is at least one legal representative in this place who has himself worked hard to try to resolve the Mapoon situation that I described earlier in speeches, where there was a dispute between the Aboriginal people themselves, those who are regarded as traditional owners of the Mapoon community and those who are historical people. I recognise that that dispute seemed intractable but in fact it was the rep body, the Cape York Land Council, which addressed that, and that is the appropriate body to do it. They can sympathetically get Aboriginal people together to find a solution.</para><para>There are three broad areas that our amendments cover, and I would like to spell out what they mean. The first area is the area of re-recognition. The re-recognition process proposed for all representative bodies will cause massive disruption and unnecessarily divert the resources of the current representative bodies. Why the government sees this to be necessary rather than accepting the amendments that the Greens (WA) and Democrats are moving I cannot understand. But we consider that the de-recognition process in the amendments is sufficient to ensure that rep bodies which cannot perform the new functions can be adequately dealt with. Since there will not be a recognition process, there is no need for a transition period. All the provisions of schedule 3 come into force at commencement.</para><para>The second area covered by our amendments is functions. Additional functions for rep bodies are to be inserted: a function of protecting the interests of native title holders and of other indigenous people interested in land, and a function of determining priorities and allocating resources. In addition, the scope of the facilitation and assistance function is to be broadened. Representative bodies gain the function of certifying agreements reached through the right to negotiate process. Further flexibility is to be given to the resolution of conflicts of interest, obtaining consent to general courses of action and notification of the performance of the internal review function.</para><para>Finally, the amendments cover finance and accountability. Most of these changes remove the role of the minister in overseeing representative body accountability. The minister's role is to be limited to withdrawing recognition and changing areas of representative bodies and obtaining information to enable him or her to make such decisions. In addition, the funding period of rep bodies is linked to the period of the strategic plan and some flexibility is added to parts of the accountability regime. When we come to them I will give some more detail on each amendment.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>—I propose to take out government amendment

These amendments are in fact intended to replace opposition 312 which was accepted by the Senate and by the House of Representatives last year. No. 77 now seeks to amend 312 by creating a more limited exception to the minister's direction than is provided by the amendment that was carried last year. The removal of the right of rep bodies which have privilege or copyright in documents to withhold those documents from later determined bodies is not significant, as rep bodies should never, in one sense, hold cultural information that matters. What this amendment does not do is extend to knowledge owned by native title holders cultural information collected whilst, for instance, identifying native title holders for the purpose of an ILUA or section 26A or some other provision under the act. The government amendment 77 does not do that. Our amendment 312 did do that. So the problem we have here is that, because of that discrepancy between amendments, the minister can direct that the later bodies can have access to cultural information against the wishes of traditional custodians.</para><para>Apart from this omission, the government's amendment would be acceptable to us. Our N45 makes the minister's power to give directions under 203FC subject to the wishes of traditional custodians of such knowledge. That brings the government's amendment in line with opposition 312 which was passed by the Senate and by the House of Representatives at the end of last year. It is an important amendment. It pays due recognition to the 
 custodians of this knowledge and, as such, still deserves support in this parliament.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>2418</page.no><name role="metadata">Minchin, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator MINCHIN</name><name.id>JX4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State;Minister Assisting the Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The government has no objection to that amendment.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>—The question is that the amendment moved by Senator Bolkus to the government amendment 77 be agreed to.</para></talk.start><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>—The question now is that the amendment, as amended, be agreed to.</para></talk.start><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>—I put the question that amendments 77A through to 81, including 78, be agreed to.</para></talk.start><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>2418</page.no><name role="metadata">Woodley, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WOODLEY</name><name.id>HX5</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	 Clause 2, page 1 (line 9), omit "Part 1 of".</para><para>(2)	 Clause 2, page 2 (line 1), omit "Part 1 of".</para><para>(3)	 Clause 2, page 2 (lines 5 to 9), omit subclause (4).</para><para>(272)	 Schedule 3, item 1, page 226 (lines 5 to 7), omit the definition of <inline font-style="italic"> transition period</inline> .</para><para>These amendments remove the formal transition period.

In response to concerns expressed about the potential impact of quarrying on native title rights and interests, government amendment No. 38 will ensure that quarrying cannot be excluded 
 from the right to negotiate under section 26A. Thus, section 26A will provide only for the removal of exploration, prospecting and fossicking rights from the right to negotiate.</para><para>Section 26A is also amended by government amendment No. 39 to take account of indigenous concerns about the identification of sites of significance. The amendment will mean that consultations that take place once a section 26A determination has been made can be about the avoidance of sites of significance, not necessarily their identification.</para><para>Government amendment No. 40 is to section 26 of the bill. Section 26C excludes from the RTN certain acts relating to opal or gem mining that take place in an area determined by the Commonwealth minister to be an approved opal or gem mining area for the purpose of this section. One of the matters the minister must be satisfied of before he or she determines an area to be such an approved area is that mining for opals or gems currently takes place in that area. Government amendment 40 ensures that these areas cannot be arbitrarily expanded by requiring where it is proposed to increase the boundaries of an approved opal or gem mining area that opal or gem mining must already be occurring in the additional area.</para><para>Government amendment No. 41 is to subsection 26D(2), which provides for mining acts to be excluded from the RTN, if they were the subject of an RTN agreement or determination made at the exploration stage. The amendment makes it clear that the exclusion only applies where the agreement is made after new section 26D commences. The amendment is based on an amendment of Senator Harradine's that was made by the Senate last year. The Harradine amendment, with which the government agreed in principle, was not included in the bill as it contained a technical drafting deficiency.</para><para>Government amendment No. 42 will restrict the capacity to give notice of more than one act in a single notice in the public notice provisions. Government amendment No. 43 is a consequential amendment required because new section 66B will provide that a native title applicant may be replaced by another member or members of the claim group. The 
 amendment provides that the new applicant will also replace the old applicant as a native title party if there is an RTN process under way.</para><para>Amendment No. 44 is to section 35 of the bill. It allows negotiations to continue once an application for a determination has been made to the arbitral body. If an agreement is reached before the arbitral body makes a determination in relation to the application, the application to the arbitral body is taken to be withdrawn. The amendment is based on an opposition amendment to section 35, made by the Senate last year. We accepted that in the House of Representatives, but that amendment was not included in the bill because it contained some drafting deficiencies, which this amendment fixes up.</para><para>Amendments Nos 45 and 46 deal respectively with situations where an alternative state or territory regime approved under section 43 or 43A of the act is amended so that it no longer satisfies the criteria set out in those provisions, and that is obvious in those amendments. Government amendment No. 47 is similar to the amendment moved by the government in the Senate in December last year to correct a drafting error in the definition of towns and cities in so far as it relates to areas in the Northern Territory.</para><para>This amendment is essential to ensuring that an area is a town or city for RTN purposes only if it would have fallen within the relevant descriptions as at the date of the Wik decision. The amendment removes certain areas from the definition of towns and cities in so far as it relates to the Northern Territory. Those areas are Hatches Creek, Brocks Creek, Burrundie and Urapunga. Information supplied by the territory government indicates that these areas should be excluded from the definition because they remain undeveloped. I commend those amendments to the Senate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>2424</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This is obviously the most critical part of the debate. As we put on the record quite clearly last time, and as we are prepared to do again this time, native title is nothing without the right to negotiate. The government's measures here will reduce an effective right to negotiate to some six to eight per cent of 
 Australia. The main provisions that do that are the government's provisions which repeal division 3 of part 2. They affect the right to negotiate in two ways. Firstly, it is excluded from many areas of land and activities. Secondly, the actual process is eroded, undermining the ability of native title holders to protect their rights and interests. The government's amendments undermine the policy underpinning the right to negotiate and native title.</para></talk.start><para>As we said last time, Labor's position retains much of the existing right to negotiate. It gives it some flexibility in a fair and non-discriminatory way. The opposition's proposal, once again, as we said last time, is one of balance. We do attempt to provide native title holders with a fair process which affords them substantive equality. To the extent that we tried to do that last time and failed, most of the amendments we moved are actually being moved, once again, by the Democrats and the Greens. To the extent that they reflect our position of last time, we will support them.</para><para>The great thing about the right to negotiate under this Native Title Act is that, despite all its detractors, it does provide a process that is contained and has a time limit. It is one that, because of the processes and the way that those processes are driven, provides certainty at a much earlier stage than would otherwise be available under the common law.</para><para>We maintain very strongly that the right to negotiate, as proposed by the opposition, as is reflected in the act, is not a right of veto. It provides for the protection of native title, but it also provides for a fair process for resource development in Australia. To the extent that there have been problems with it—let me put this squarely to the government—the threshold test, the registration process, the claims process and the evidentiary provisions all add up to an enormous barrier that native title claimants have to pass before they can pursue their interests in their claims.</para><para>The right to negotiate is restricted in its application to mining activity and the compulsory acquisition of native title for the purpose of granting an interest in land to non-government parties. But it has got to be said that the provisions passed by the Senate last time and 
 added to this time make it quite evident to stakeholders, I am sure, that their concerns as to fraudulent claims, overlapping claims, have all been met—in fact, more than met—by the government in its legislation; legislation we have tried to amend and continue to try to amend because we feel it went too far.</para><para>In respect of this current debate, we are still committed to the right to negotiate. We are committed to it for constitutional reasons and to ensure conformity of the Native Title Act with the Race Discrimination Act, with the just terms of the constitution and with the races power of the constitution as it may finally be interpreted by the High Court. You cannot take away people's rights and interests, firstly, without doing it in a non-discriminatory way and, secondly, without providing adequate compensation both in terms of finances and process. The government, we maintain, has failed in both.</para><para>In the 1993 package the right to negotiate did provide a balance which, as I said earlier, ensured a process. The government's amendments greatly diminish the benefits of the rights to negotiate and those benefits that it provides to native title holders. They expose state and territory land administration to ongoing uncertainty and, as importantly, expose Australia to international condemnation for offending the Convention for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. This is one of those areas which was identified by the government's senior legal adviser as being discriminatory.</para><para>Let us get to the core of this. What the government does do in its approach is disregard the cultural nature of native title and the spiritual attachment of native title holders to land. Its approach is based on long discredited theories of assimilation. The government's bill removes, for instance, the right to negotiate from all but a sliver of the Australian continent. Even with major mining projects where lands happen to have been subject to a pastoral lease or reserve 100 years ago, state and territories can replace the right to negotiate with procedures under mining legislation. There will be resort to injunction, there will be resort to the courts. I can guarantee here that the government will have to put a lot 
 more resources into the tribunal and court system because, through these, measures the government is forcing people out of the right to negotiate process under the Native Title Act.</para><para>When one talks about the right to negotiate as an aspect of native title, one is talking about the real spirit and the heart of native title. One is talking about human beings expecting—in fact, in this case demanding—to be treated not as cattle which can be moved around properties, but as human beings who need to be respected and whose rights, customs and culture need to be respected. These people need to be respected as equals in our society.</para><para>So we pursue the position we pursued last time. We say that, in relation to the registration test, the Senate provisions have gone too far. We will be moving to discuss a whole range of areas in respect of private infrastructure, the application of the right to negotiate, towns and cities, conjunctive agreements, injunctions and so on. In terms of our amendments with respect to private infrastructure, a concern was raised with us—in fact it was raised by the Queensland Minerals Council—that the position we were taking was one that they felt had direct and indirect consequences which made it difficult for them to proceed with some projects.</para><para>We worked on an amendment to see whether we could accommodate a certain level of private infrastructure as part of a public purpose test. We worked on an amendment which provided for the compulsory acquisition of native title rights and interest if the dominant purpose of the acquisition was to confer rights through interest in relation to the land or waters concerned on persons other than the government party. We promised to do that. We have met, I must say, with universal opposition in this place from government and other parties. One of the major concerns that people raised was that the concept of dominant purpose is one that would be very hard to define and hard to protect against legal challenge. We have tried, and I must say we did expect a better response, a bit more constructive response, from 
 some quarters, but not having got that we are not proceeding with that particular proposal.</para><para>I will leave the rest of the debate to go section by section. I will say at this particular stage that we do not think there should be a need for government amendments 46 and 47 because, for instance, in respect of towns and cities, we still find that distinction artificial and unacceptable for good reasons which we will expound later on. Amendments 46 and 47 form categories of amendments which we think will not be necessary. But we see the rest of them as being incremental advances.</para><para>As I said, this is a critical part of the debate. There are 17 or so different areas under it. I will leave specific comments until the amendments come up in those areas.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>2426</page.no><name role="metadata">Woodley, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WOODLEY</name><name.id>HX5</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Senator Bolkus is right—this is the critical issue. In the end, if there is no right to negotiate then there is no native title. Let us underline the fact that what we are talking about is not a veto, it is not giving native title claimants the opportunity to hold up development, as is constantly stated, but it is simply saying people ought to talk to one another. It seems to me to be a fairly simple proposition, but one that this government seems to have great difficulty with.</para></talk.start><para>I want to address a couple of the reasons given by the government as to why there should not be a right to negotiate for native title holders that has any meaning. The government will protest that it does believe in the right to negotiate. But as Senator Bolkus has said, that right to negotiate now has so many hurdles in front of it, and there are more hurdles proposed in this particular section, that one really cannot take the government seriously again.</para><para>One of the reasons the government gives for saying there cannot be a right to negotiate for native title holders is that all claimants should be treated equally. The government then says, `Well, farmers do not have a right to negotiate with miners, so Aboriginal people shouldn't have.' I have to say to you that he is dead right in the sense that farmers do not have a right to negotiate with mining companies, and that is a great problem for them. One of the issues in Queensland that I have 
 lived with, for as long as I have lived with the whole issue of Aboriginal rights, is the problem that farmers have with mining companies. Tonight, I am going to put a couple incidents on the record so that you can understand this.</para><para>One of them is a very long-running dispute which started in 1974 and 1975 in Central Queensland when a large number of dairy farmers discovered that, because their farms were on what were entitled mining homestead leases, in fact they had no rights to that land that they had been farming on, in some cases for three generations. It was not until after 12 months of harassing a National Party government that someone from the government finally came and talked to them, and it was the mines minister. I went to that meeting. He spent the whole meeting abusing them and saying to them, `Get out of the road, progress demands that we have cement. We need the limestone on your farms for cement and that is just too bad.'</para><para>Finally, because they got together and they worked as a group, these farmers were able to raise money. They were told that if they went to the mining warden's court and put their case, then that would be their opportunity to be heard. So they did that and they spent five days in the mining warden's court. They raised at the time—this was 1975—about $9,000 to get legal advice. I do not know what that equates to today, but it is a fair amount of money. So they were heard and they spent five days putting their case.</para><para>They were then told that the magistrate would reserve judgment, as is usual in these cases, and that they would get judgment within a few weeks time. A day before the mining warden was to give his judgment, the state government came out with a statement which said, `Sorry farmers, the mining warden's court is simply an advisory body to the government. There is no report going to released. The mining leases are granted.' That is the kind of justice that farmers have had from mining companies.</para><para>But it does not end there. My friend Senator Boswell would probably come and tell me that that is history. Let me tell you that the situation obtains right up to the present day. 
 One of the strong arguments that the farmers put in this case was that engineering reports said that if quarrying of the limestone took place on the farms—and finally it did—it was likely that the limestone right across the area would be fractured and they would lose their water.</para><para>Today, there is a further dispute going on, because most of the farms around that mining area that still remain now find that the water table is four metres below where it was before mining started, which means of course that it is very difficult for them to get water for their stock, et cetera. So they are still in dispute with the mining company, and the state government is still not listening to them. Do not tell me that Aborigines have to have the same right to negotiate as farmers with mining companies. Farmers have not got any right to negotiate. This is what happens to farmers when they are faced with this kind of activity.</para><para>Let me give you a couple of other examples. The Queensland grain growers have been in dispute with some of the coal mining companies in Central Queensland for some years over the fact that much of the mining activity in Central Queensland, because of subsidence, has ruined much of the farming and grazing areas. They, too, have not been able to get justice, and so the story continues.</para><para>So, Minister, if you are saying that Aboriginal people should have the same right as farmers to negotiate with miners, then I am afraid there is not much hope for anybody. In the second reading debate before Christmas I pointed out to the government that it is within their hands to correct this, not by taking away rights from Aboriginal people but by giving farmers some justice in their attempts to negotiate with mining companies. According to advice from the Parliamentary Library and the Table Office, if the government wants some equality, it can actually give farmers a right to negotiate.</para><para>There is a device, there is a means of giving farmers a right to negotiate. It is the government's job—they are the friends of farmers, they always tell us—and I will supply that information if they want it. Let them go and bring in amendments to other 
 legislation in this place that will restore a right for farmers to negotiate with mining companies, because I can tell you they sure need it.</para><para>So what we are faced with tonight is again an absolutely critical issue. Without the right to negotiate, there is no native title. Without a proper right to negotiate, without some of the hurdles that Aboriginal people have to jump taken out of the way, that right to negotiate is a joke. I hope the Senate will be minded to vote for the opposition amendments and the Democrats-Greens (WA) amendments, which seek to improve the right to negotiate and give native title holders some hope of getting at least this opportunity to talk to those who seek to mine and in other ways interfere with their rights.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>2428</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—One of the measures of the community importance of the right to negotiate might be the fact that in 1997, when we dealt with this bill, dozens of amendments were passed. In fact 44 amendments were passed, and only six amendments did not pass that we are potentially still dealing with. A lot of issues got the support of the Senate at the end of last year.</para></talk.start><para>It is important that I state what I would be aiming to do here. I would be aiming to remove the whole of the division, to move back to the Native Title Act 1993 provisions—that is, to hold the line. I would be seeking to hold the line of the amendments which passed last time, or a selection of those at least. We will be raising again the importance of the right to negotiate issues, which were in fact defeated in 1997.</para><para>There was a lot said about this issue last year, but I think it is recognised that the right to negotiate effectively recognises the unique spiritual nature of, and provides an essential minimum level of protection for, native title. It has been mentioned that the right to negotiate, as it was agreed in 1993, was a trade-off. We know that it was a trade-off for what could well have been established in common law rights; it was a trade-off that allowed for the so-called certainty of just about every other land-holder and land title in the country.</para><para>The right to negotiate is now very much under threat, and that also threatens, as we have heard by a range of opinions. The rustle of silks on the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee were given opinions by a whole range of experts in the field, and a number of those experts suggested that the trade-off in 1993 would have been one of the few areas where it could have been argued that the 1993 act would pass as a special measure that was beneficial for Aboriginal people. If you largely removed that or removed substantial areas of that, it was argued—and I think very cogently—that it is very hard to argue that even the 1993 act was a special measure any more, because you pulled out that point where there was a potential trade-off between the rights of other land-holders and some form of recognition of what can be enjoyed under a legislative native title right.</para><para>The right to negotiate also deals with a backlog in the determination of native title. If the courts and the tribunal are not able to handle these cases quickly, there needs to be some means by which people can enjoy native title. The courts and the tribunal are clogged as a result of the failure of Australian governments to protect indigenous rights in the past, and this was mentioned very effectively by Senator Woodley earlier in the day. You can hardly point to indigenous Australians, with 210 years of dispossession, and say, `It's your fault these cases are clogging up the courts. It's your fault it's difficult to sort out the intricacies of these issues.' The backlog was the result of a lack of acknowledgment over time of existing common law or native title rights. The right to negotiate addresses this problem, we believe, in a balanced way by providing for the interests of resource developers and those, as yet, undetermined native title holders, who can only access the right to negotiate after lodging a claim and passing a threshold test.</para><para>The expedited procedure is the existing procedure. Activities such as exploration can bypass the right to negotiate through an expedited procedure which removes the right to negotiate if the activity does not directly interfere with community life, areas or sites of particular significance or involve a major 
 disturbance to any land or waters. We believe the right to negotiate already favours resource developers because the right to negotiate procedure cannot be used as a veto on resource development. To the contrary, it favours resource development. Quite frequently, we have heard in this debate that somehow or other an agreement with a time limit is a veto, and of course it is not. We know there are processes and there are time limits on all of those processes, and basically there will be a decision within those processes. Of course, access to the right to negotiate does not arise until the claim is accepted, probably close to two months after receipt of the notice. The periods for negotiation are really two and four months respectively.</para><para> Negotiations over mining to date have covered such matters as restrictions on employees shooting wildlife or disrupting social life in nearby indigenous communities, the protection of sacred sites, job opportunities for local indigenous people and other benefits in cash and kind. The potential effect on these provisions and operating costs ranges from negligible to the equivalent of a small increase in royalties. This is not going to bring the country down. If you do not provide this, if you like, pressure release, then I do not think negotiations at a later date are going to be particularly amicable. It is certainly not going to lead to anything vaguely akin to reconciliation.</para><para> I mentioned at the end of last year the areas the government has excluded from the right to negotiate. I will remind honourable senators of what they are. It is the upgrades to full primary production on pastoral leases; the right to negotiate for off-farm activities connected to full primary production; the right to negotiate when third parties are granted the right to remove forest and quarry for sand, soil and rocks on pastoral leases; the management and regulation of water, air space and offshore places; and negotiating towns and cities.</para><para>It also excludes the right to negotiate on certain lease renewals, extensions and upgrades in relation to reservations and the provision of facilities that service the public, and that could be as broad as the governments 
 want it to be. It excludes the right to negotiate on mining exploration for gold and tin mining, for opal and gems, for the renewal of valid mining leases, for the right to negotiate on the intertidal zone, as well as basically effectively excluding the right to negotiate on pastoral leases and other leased or reserved areas by allowing state and territory bodies to provide cursory alternative provisions.</para><para> We have argued this before. I hope that the ALP are going to hold the line on all of these issues where they voted in 1997. I want to make it clear that I will not be seeking to move all of the Greens-Democrats amendments that were moved at the end of last year, but I might run through a few of those areas now for the benefit of the committee. I will be moving amendments 170 and 258. They are to restore the right to negotiate on infrastructure facilities. This was supported by the ALP. They are moving identical amendments. Amendment 188 was also identical to the ALP's amendments and does something similar. Amendment 185 restores the right to negotiate in towns and cities. Amendment 110 was to restore the right to negotiate to exploration acts. Amendment 111 restores the right to negotiate to alluvial gold and tin mining.</para><para>Amendments 114 to 116, 120 and 124 were supported last time by the ALP. That includes providing for the exclusion of the right to negotiate by reason only of earlier agreement that there would be no further negotiations at the production stage and inserts a new subsection 26D(1)(a) which states that the section does not apply where the original lease is the creation of a right to mine. Amendment 120 provides a mechanism to ensure governments follow the future act provisions by allowing a native title claimant to apply to the Federal Court to stop an act which should have gone through the right to negotiate process.</para><para>We will also be moving amendment 127 which removes provisions enabling premature ministerial intervention and amendment 126 which permits an agreement to vary or replace a determination after a determination has been made. Amendment 135 allows a determination of financial conditions by an arbitral body and some parts of negotiation to be postponed by agreement for later determination. Amend 
 ment 137 replaces the provision whereby the tribunal can consider the environment, which is where it was last time. So it was the criteria which could be considered in a native title determination.</para><para> So the environment was there originally. We would like to see it put back. We would also like to see the ALP supporting it being put back, as the National Indigenous Working Group have asked us to do. I will be reminding the committee briefly in a quick argument each time of what those areas were, possibly longer when we get to the right to negotiate on pastoral leases.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>2430</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I wish to intervene in the debate at this stage because we are dealing with the last of the sticking points in this legislation. Late tonight and tomorrow the government is going to consider its response to the amended bill. In that response rests the destiny of this nation to some extent. I want to address this because, as a West Australian senator, I have been visited by numerous people from the mining industry, as you would expect. They are very nice people, but I have been somewhat surprised by their approach to the issues captured in this bill.</para></talk.start><para>By and large they have offered a view of the bill which involves a kind of political absolutism in direct contrast to the normal behaviour of business people, to whom negotiation, resolution and agreement are the very essence of business transactions. I have been startled that they have not encouraged the government to be a little more flexible and a little more accepting of some of the amendments and of the direction in which the Senate has gone.</para><para>All parties, and I do not mean just political parties but all parties interested in this bill, have agreed that the management and processing of claims, improved threshold tests, more effective procedures and greater fairness and efficiency are desirable outcomes. Far too much has been said in the debate and in the media about the negatives surrounding this bill. Far too little has been said about the positives in those areas in which there is common agreement. There is a great deal of agreement about improving the management 
 and processing of claims and threshold tests, more effective procedures and greater fairness and certainty. On those there is no quarrel from the indigenous groups, no quarrel from the political parties, no quarrel from the various interests. Those positive aspects of the bill would indeed have resulted in a diminution in the number of overlapping claims. That greater resolution of how matters are to be processed does not therefore need to be accompanied by an erosion of rights.</para><para>One characteristic of modern industrial and corporate organisations is their resistance to limitation or restraint. The drive of the modern organisation is for development, expansion and growth, and some of those people see native title as an impediment to their economic agenda, which is measured by money and control. To those economic forces, the word `workable' means being capable of compliance with their growth and development imperatives, because economic forces like that are always in a hurry. Negotiation costs money, agreements place limits on operations, and logic dictates that negotiations and agreements should be made as quick, cheap and easy as possible. Every person in this place understands that that is their mentality. But an attitude of commercial opportunism and political absolutism should not be brought to bear on an issue of great national sensitivity .</para><para>The problem for those who focus on the economic agenda is that the cultural, spiritual, historical and emotional attachment which is native title requires a different mind-set and attention to intangibles. It is the job of the government and of the Senate to reconcile those intangibles.</para><para>The mining industry came to see me because they were alarmed at the level of claims which reached them. They have painted a picture, and rightly so, of the effect of those claims on their ability to operate. But they have not told the other side of the story. Before we all think that they are descending into doom and disaster, we ought to remind ourselves of just how well the mining industry has been doing in the year in which they say this escalation of claims has really hurt them badly. </para><para>Some of the key performance indicators for last financial year, 1996-97, show that mineral exploration excluding petroleum was up 20 per cent over the previous year. Petroleum exploration was up 18 per cent over the previous year. The value of mineral production was up to $35,000 million, a 20 per cent increase since 1992-93. The value of mineral and energy exports has more than doubled since 1986-87 to a record $36 billion. Yet in the face of such fantastic growth, the industry has funded grossly misleading campaigns, fostering misinformation in the community about the disastrous impact of native title. I do not minimise the problems they face. But I think it is important that they begin to adopt, in these last hours in which compromise is possible, a rational and realistic approach and that they urge the government to be accepting of amendments which allow both the industry and native title to move forward.</para><para>The problem has emerged in a different form. The <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline>, on 13 March 1988, under an exclusive article by someone called Leeroy Betti, led with this paragraph:</para><para>A company headed by Perth businessman Ken Court paid for a native title claim lodged over parts of the massive An Feng Kingstream steel project, thousands of other mining tenements and 16 existing Aboriginal claims.</para><para>It was followed up by an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline>  on Monday 30 March 1998 by Janine Macdonald headed `Wheeling and dealing in the wild wild West', which pursued the same story. I will quote for you a couple of paragraphs:</para><para>The Minerals Council of Australia also was surprised about the payment. A spokesman said it was the only one of which the council was aware.</para><para>There have been 745 claims lodged since the tribunal was established but this was the only one of which the council was aware. That may be true. When the director, Mr Zuks, was questioned, this is what the article said:</para><para>Zuks said other money was paid to Phillips but would not disclose how much or for what reasons, and he declined to say whether An Feng Kingstream had paid for Phillips legal representatives.</para><para>You do not decline to say whether you have paid for somebody unless it might be true. I mean, the simple answer to the question is no.</para><para>Mr Phillips is an Aboriginal person and a few hundred dollars was paid to him—that has been acknowledged in the article. But what happens if it starts to extend to legal representatives with all its ramifications? So the Australian Democrats, with our limited time and resources, have begun to ask questions of Aboriginal people from my part of the world and others.</para><para>They tell us—and there is no way for us to ascertain whether or not it is true—that mining companies are known to pay for Aboriginal people to make claims. If that is so, this problem that the mining companies are saying exists—and we believe it does exist—may have partly, or even considerably, been contributed to by the mining companies themselves who, in their competitive role with each other, may have contributed the very things that the government says it has got to fix.</para><para>I would have wished that the bill could have had a provision with a subpoena set into it whereby every claimant had to declare whether a mining or pastoral interest had paid for their legal representation or for their claims. We might discover that this great problem turns out to be a white fella's problem. I do not know whether or not that is so. All I can tell you is that, with respect to a company headed by Perth businessman Ken Court, from the Court dynasty, it was exposed as a problem.</para><para>Because there is this murky, muddy, commercial undercurrent to this whole thing, I urge the participants in this debate, and the government, when it considers the bill in its final form, to cease political absolutism, to cease posturing, and to ensure that a flexible, tolerant and, indeed, careful view is taken of some of the claims and assertions being made by the commercial interests who are affected by the right to negotiate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>2431</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I hope the government was listening to that contribution from Senator Murray. I would like to follow up by referring to an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline>  of August last year under the by-line of Gerard Noonan. The headline read: `$64b committed for minerals, in spite of Wik'. I quote from the article:</para></talk.start><para>You would certainly be forgiven for thinking that mineral exploration had ground to a halt in the wake of the High Court's Wik decision on native title last year.</para><para>That's what every conservative government and red-blooded politician has been spouting for the past year. It's a refrain echoed by pastoralists through their political organisation, the National Farmers' Federation.</para><para>So what explains the fact that there are such vast sums being spent on, or committed to, projects if there's such nervousness about who owns the digging rights and controls the spoils?</para><para>The answer can only be that, despite all the hot air and fevered arguments in the lobbying forums of the country, the real world of outback mining and mineral processing is getting on with it.</para><para>Mr Noonan then says:</para><para>To get an idea of what the exploration and developmental spending looks like, here's how it adds up. (And remember, these are billions.)</para><para>He then lists the following amounts: coal, nearly $5 billion; petroleum, $26 billion; uranium, $2 billion; iron ore, $3 billion; gold, $1 billion; and so on, down to a total of $65 billion in mineral exploration and mineral processing plants in Australia slated on the boards for the next three years.</para><para>As Mr Noonan comments:</para><para>It's hardly what you'd call stalled.</para><para>The mining companies know exactly what is in this legislation; so does the National Farmers Federation. I want to take us back to the right to negotiate that we are dealing with here. It is not the right to negotiate per se, it is far from it; it is a shadow of that.</para><para>What we are being asked to consider in this fourth sticking point provision is the right to negotiate over mines, over holes in the ground, over less than 10 per cent of the potential land uses across the country which are able to disrupt, change, transmogrify, the land of the indigenous people without their being able to have a say.</para><para>Remember at the outset, as Senator Bolkus said and Senator Margetts repeated, that there is no right to veto here. Australians listening to this debate think it is all about the indigenous people having a right to knock out developments. It is not. There is no right to veto. There is a right to negotiate and come to an agreement, but there is no right to veto 
 projects. That is agreed by all components in this debate. That is the first myth to be knocked out. The indigenous people have had that right taken away from them.</para><para>The second thing, as I said, is that there is no right at all for indigenous people to negotiate on broadscale plantations, cotton crops, sea fisheries, oil derricks, wharves, roads, rail, dams, canals, irrigation projects, woodchip undertakings, tourism—Club Meds. There is a myth abroad that this right to negotiate gives the indigenous people on whose lands those functions might be slated in the coming century a say under this legislation. They do not.</para><para>Not only do they not get that say under the Howard 10-point plan, but the horror of it all is that they do not get that say under Labor policy either, and they certainly do not get that say with Senator Harradine in the box seat. The only people who would give the indigenous people that right to a say are over in this corner occupied by the Greens and the Democrats.</para><para>So there we have it: no veto right, less than 10 per cent, potentially, of developmental projects, over what Senator Bolkus says is six to eight per cent of the country. Less than 10 per cent of opportunity to have a say in less than 10 per cent of the country. If my sums are correct, from my teachers way back at Trunkey Creek Primary, the indigenous people have a say in less than one per cent of potential developments, and then they do not have a veto. That is if the legislation goes through as amended by the combined forces of the Greens, Democrats, ALP and Senator Harradine, because the government would give no negotiating rights at all on anything.</para><para>The last lingering right for indigenous people to have a say on holes in the ground has been fought vociferously by the opponents of indigenous rights, not least the government. It is a key component of their bucket loads of extinguishment. Lest anyone think that we are debating broad scale empowerment of indigenous people, I point out that we are not. That has all gone. It has been done away with. That was voted down last night. What we are talking about is the ability to negotiate with no veto rights over mines in 
 a very small component of the country. The proposed amendments are designed to take away rights over opal, gem, gold mining and so on.</para><para>If we cannot get Senate assent to this are we setting ourselves up as a den of thieves, as a place that has engaged in the theft of the last little bit of the right to negotiate for indigenous people? That is the question. Senator Woodley said that if there is no right to negotiate then there is no native title. I agree with Senator Woodley. There is very little native title left in this legislation.</para><para>Even if the government is not successful in blocking the right to negotiate for mining, there is very little native title left in terms of the ability of people who do get native title recognised to be able to have a say in what happens to their land. For goodness sake, it is a pretty pass. I say to all members of this committee: How could you not back these meagre morsels, these last crumbs of empowerment and the return of rights to the indigenous people of this country?</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN (Senator Jacinta Collins)</name></talker><para>—The question is that government amendments 38 to 47 be agreed to.

The original Native Title Act provided that the procedural rights for future acts in respect of native title would generally be that native title holders are `entitled to the same procedural rights as holders of ordinary title'. I quote from the commentary in the act itself. What the act did was add on to that by giving a special right which ordinary title holders do not have and they called it the right to negotiate. Under this act it applies, as it says in the commentary, to mining and the compulsory acquisition of native title for the purpose of making a grant to a third party.</para></talk.start><para>Acquisitions of native title by governments for their own purposes are not covered by the right to negotiate. That was traditionally how infrastructure was provided. Increasingly, public infrastructure is provided or built or set up by the private sector on behalf of the public. We do have this anomaly now where major infrastructure projects done by the government do not have the right to negotiate, but if they are done by the private sector for the public they are then caught up in the right to negotiate process. So not only is it a significant anomaly, it is one which is causing significant difficulty for major infrastructure projects providing services to the public in remote areas of Australia.</para><para>We believe that the basic foundation stone of the Native Title Act is—and it is a principle that we support—that native title holders should have the same procedural rights as the equivalent title holders. That is the foundation stone of the Native Title Act. We think in the case of private infrastructure that that is the appropriate set of procedural rights—that is, that native title claimants and holders affected by a private sector infrastructure project should have the same procedural rights as everybody else. That is what our bill provides.</para><para>It is simply impractical for the extraordinarily complex and legalistically difficult right to negotiate process to apply with infrastructure, particularly where it involves pipelines and other infrastructure that can cover hundreds and hundreds of kilometres involving native title claimants all along the way. Unless they get agreement with every single one of them, they are into arbitration, et cetera. There are huge delays built into this quite extraordinary process that is affecting the provision of services to Australians, Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal, right across the country.</para><para>So this is one area where we do think the original foundation stone of the Native Title Act should be restored—that is, that native title holders have the same procedural rights as everyone else and, at the same time, we remove the anomaly between public and private infrastructure that now exists.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>2435</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Just a brief intrusion: when I was advocating that mining companies should support the right to negotiate, I forgot to declare my interest in the matter.

So after such a long debate we are actually coming together in at least a few areas. Our view was expounded very strongly last time we had a debate on this. That was that we did not believe that an artificial distinction as is proposed by the government has any foundation in law. In many towns and cities in Australia native title holders do maintain a strong connection to their country. A number of these towns and cities are developing rapidly, placing substantial pressure on native title. There is no reasonable basis for denying native title holders who fit through the threshold test and the definition of the law the protection of the right to negotiate simply because their land is within a town or city boundary.</para></talk.start><para>We have had some concerns with the Northern Territory where we have had examples of the Northern Territory government expanding the limits of town and city boundaries out of all proportion to municipal needs to avoid the operation of the Aboriginal Land Rights Act. In the last debate we talked about phantom or ghost towns such as Hatches Creek. At that stage, we were ridiculed by the government because we raised these sorts of matters. We raised the matter of a definition of a town in the territory being so great that its definition is in excess of the Greater City of London. It is good to see that this time the government in their amendments have acknowledged, for instance in respect of Hatch 
 es Creek and other towns, that some of those towns were never developed, they have remained vacant Crown land from the date they were gazetted. In respect of Hatches Creek, the nearest town is in fact Tennant Creek, about 150 kilometres away. That sort of example exposes, I think, the artificial nature of the definition, one that does not reflect the common law and one THe opposition does not support .</para><para>I also indicate at this stage that I have had another look at my amendment 114, the notification amendment. Though I indicated that I would not be proceeding with it, I do think there is a need to proceed with it. Later on, I will be seeking to commit that—after we vote on towns and cities.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>2437</page.no><name role="metadata">Minchin, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator MINCHIN</name><name.id>JX4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State;Minister Assisting the Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The government continues to maintain its strong policy objective that in relation to towns and cities we should maintain the original foundation stone of the Native Title Act that native title holders should have the same procedural rights as everyone else. We think that is particularly important in towns and cities where Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians live side by side. To have differential and indeed preferential procedural rights for one group of people based on their race when the people next door have different rights because they are of a different race we think is highly explosive, inflammatory and dangerous from a moral and philosophical point of view.</para></talk.start><para>Again, the Senate is sitting here in Canberra debating things without having any real understanding of the impact of its legislation on the ground. The fact is, in and around towns and cities across Australia native title claims are having a very dramatic effect on the availability of land and on land prices in a very detrimental way that is hurting other Australians and, indeed, on Aboriginal Australians. The claims mean that land cannot be released. It is getting caught up for years in the right to negotiate process.</para><para>Only on 7 April the <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline> ran a story about the town of Wellstead as one of 19 country centres in Western Australia where land releases have had to be stopped because 
 of native title claims. People are leaving the town and there will not be any land released until about 2001. Native title claims are tying up and making impossible the release of land because, until you get the whole process through the right to negotiate, you cannot get the land released. Senators have no idea of what is actually happening with the right to negotiate process—how it does not work. So we have the ridiculous situation where land prices in many towns—particularly in Western Australia, which has a huge amount of land—are skyrocketing simply because it cannot be released and you cannot do anything until you get through this extraordinary right to negotiate process.</para><para>In towns and cities, based on equity grounds, we think what should happen is that native title claimants and holders should have the same rights as everybody else. If it is vacant Crown land in a town or a city, they will have the rights of a freeholder, the same as the freeholder next door; if it is pastoral lease land in a town or city, they will have the rights of a pastoral leaseholder. That was the foundation stone of the Native Title Act. It should apply in towns and cities.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>2438</page.no><name role="metadata">Woodley, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WOODLEY</name><name.id>HX5</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—As you know, Mr Temporary Chair, I sit here quite patiently and listen to the debate so that I can be informed.

Some time ago, when the coalition government in Queensland wanted to ensure that native title would become an election issue, they froze the transfer of every kind of lease in Queensland so that they could say that native title is holding up the transfer of leases on the Gold Coast, et cetera. That is the other side of the story.</para></talk.start><para>It is not just that native title might be causing problems. The real issue is that political parties in some of the state governments have decided, `Here is a nice little issue for us to have an election on and we will make darn sure that it becomes an elec

The defined Perth metropolitan area is enormous—perhaps one of the biggest cities in the world in terms of sheer size, not in terms of numbers. There is no actual logical reason why you should say that, because it happens to be within a town or city boundary, somehow or other the need to negotiate or the right to negotiate for native title holders should be removed. There is no logical reason whatsoever.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>2439</page.no><name role="metadata">Minchin, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator MINCHIN</name><name.id>JX4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State;Minister Assisting the Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Senator Margetts and Senator Brown continue to say things which, frankly, misrepresent the government's position.

The question asked at the beginning of that statement was: what is wrong with making a native title claim in a town or city?

We are talking about the procedural rights that attach. In a town or city where you have Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians living side by side, the only sensible approach, in our view, is the approach adopted as the foundation stone of the Native Title Act—that is, equal procedural rights for all Australians.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>2439</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Excuse me, but there are non-Aboriginal people living in the rural areas too—I am not sure whether the minister has remembered this.

What we try to do through opposition amendments Nos N24, 25 and 26 is amend the regime to accommodate what is in essence a small problem. I think we indicated already that government amendments 38 and 39 are seen 
 to be beneficial, but we think that we should go a bit further. We do have some criticisms of the government's section 26A scheme. The government's provisions establish state and territory schemes for exploration, prospecting and fossicking as defined in 26A. Such territory schemes replace the right to negotiate for the activities listed in 26(2)(b).</para><para>Much of the activity in 26A would not qualify under existing 26(4), which provides for approved schemes to replace the right to negotiate where the acts covered by the scheme have `a minimal effect on native title'. Our concern is that this exclusion effect, this scheme, applies to too broad a range of activities. It applies to quarrying, but the government has agreed to remove that and it does so through section 38. However, subsection (3) is, we deem, too broad in its application. Subsection (3) provides for the application of the scheme where the act or acts:</para><para>are unlikely to have a significant impact on the land or waters concerned.</para><para>The concern is that this would cover a wide range of activities which are currently covered by the right to negotiate. It has to be said this exclusion is likely to apply to almost all exploration activities, including mining retention licences, bulk sampling—in some states up to 20,000 tonnes—and extensive drilling, which is covered in subsection (2).</para><para>Given that the scheme does remove the right to negotiate where it applies and replaces it with lesser rights for native title holders, we believe that the impact of the scheme should in fact be limited to what we call `insignificant impact on native title'. Unlike the right to negotiate, the section 26A schemes of the government are linked to state and territory mining legislation. They provide only for a right to be heard by an independent person rather than for the matter to be heard by an independent arbitrator.</para><para>State and territory ministers or some other delegated person or body have an absolute discretion to ignore the concerns of title holders. One good example of this is the Northern Territory Mining Act, which gives the minister unfettered discretion to grant an exploration licence. When an assessment is made of this and it is compared to the right 
 to negotiate, it is a major deviation from the right to negotiate. In fact, it is not even a right to consultation in an effective term.</para><para>The government scheme offers consultation only to registered native title claimants of native title bodies corporate. As such, native title holders will not be able to seek the protections referred to in subsection (7). Once again, this is contrary to the right to negotiate which provides a process for native title holders to become registered to protect their interests. If this omission is not corrected, Senator Minchin, it is another one of those areas that will lead to litigation.</para><para>There is also concern, of course, as to the consultation on and identification of sacred sites. That concern was expressed in the debate last year and is picked up by government amendment 39.</para><para>The scheme also does not have provisions to ensure enforcement of the conditions of any grant inserted for the protection of native title rights and interests. It is a strange situation when one goes through a process at the end of which there is no capacity to enforce protection for native title claims and interests. Basically, it is a token process which really does not offer much in terms of protection or recognition of title interests.</para><para>We do see merit in a scheme that accommodates a range of exploration but which also deals with the concerns expressed above. The scheme proposed by Labor is through N24. We replace subsection (3) to limit the application of 26A to acts which individually or in aggregate have an insignificant impact on native title.</para><para>N25 provides for a period of two months to enable identification and notification of relevant native title holders to ensure that their interests are taken into account. We provide that the doing of the act and its conditions must be determined by an independent body. We also ensure that there are consultations as to relevant matters and that those consultations be conducted in good faith. Subsection 7(a) also provides a mechanism to ensure enforcement.</para><para>What we are dealing with here is a system whereby an exploration activity which either 
 in itself or in a cumulative sense in aggregate with other approvals has an insignificant impact on native title. We think it is important in terms of the exploration interests of stakeholders, but it is also important in terms of recognising the burden on representative bodies who will have more than enough to do in the forthcoming few years to accommodate and represent the interests of title claimants and holders. At this stage, those bodies do not in practice, I believe, have the resources, the interest or the capacity to take into account such low impact exploration. In fact, when talking to them many of them indicate that they are more concerned with ensuring that there is a mechanism in place to determine what is insignificant as opposed to what is not so that they can protect their valid interests. They would like to dispense with some of the high volume but insignificant impact exploration acts.</para><para>It is for this reason we put forward our alternative to the government scheme. It is much more limited. We look forward to getting some support. But I indicate that the government scheme is in no way attractive to us.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>2442</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Senator Bolkus, you have convinced me—no, we were convinced already.

Despite there not being any ALP amendments on this, the ALP seems to be supporting the proposition that we not provide that approved gold or tin mining acts are not covered by the right to negotiate provisions.</para></talk.start><para>This is all about having had four years experience of the right to negotiate process and where it is practicable and where it is not. I would have thought it was appropriate that parliaments do examine, with the benefit of experience, the effect of their legislation on activities around Australia. This sort of alluvial gold and tin mining simply does not lend itself to the full-blown right to negotiate process. So we have gone to great lengths to set out an alternative procedure for ensuring that appropriate negotiation rights are set up for native title claimants and holders in respect of these kinds of classes of gold and tin mining acts which are essentially alluvial. They involve very short time spans for operations and frequent moves. The right to negotiate process simply does not work with that sort of gold and tin mining.</para><para>So we have set in place, as you can see in 26B, a quite sophisticated structure for providing a proper process to ensure consultation 
 and negotiation with native title holders, but not as part of this full-blown statutory right to negotiate process. That does allow alluvial gold and tin mining to proceed, because it is just not the sort of mining that lends itself to the full-blown right to negotiate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:25:00</time.stamp><page.no>2444</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I apologise to the committee.

As I indicated earlier, the government has three amendments to this particular area—41, 42 and 43—and we support those, but we do say that the 
 government's bill does not go as far as it should.</para><para>As the bill stands, 26D(2)(b) excludes the right to negotiate where there has been a conjunctive determination. It can be excluded either by a state or territory minister, under sections 34A and 36A; by an arbitral body, under section 38; and by a state or territory minister overriding an arbitral determination, under section 42. This basically means that there are no real bona fides in the system. This means that, against the wishes of native title holders, determinations can be made about current and future acts—for example, an arbitral body may determine that an exploration may occur and at the same time determine that any mining arising from that kind of exploration licence can occur despite the fact that the type and effect of any future mining may not yet be known.</para><para>In our amendments 125 and 126, we ensure that section 26D does not extend beyond conjunctive agreements by removing the references to 28(1)(g) or 28(1)(h) in section 26D(2)(b) and 26D(2)(c), and we leave it open for native title and other parties to enter into conjunctive agreements.</para><para>Opposition 127 provides that the parties can agree that all or part of the right to negotiate provisions can apply to subsequent acts. Opposition amendment 170—in related amendments—inserts subsection (3) into section 38 in respect of arbitral determinations. That permits an arbitral body to make a determination which has conjunctive effects so long as the determination provides for further negotiations or the right to negotiate to apply.</para><para>Basically, we are saying here that the parties can agree to cover not just an exploration but also a mining operation. This is one of those areas where flexibility is required. It is required because, for instance, industry for one is not united on where the right to negotiate should apply. Also, given the nature of mines, it provides greater fairness if parties can actually not just agree to an exploration regime but also agree to, for instance, heads of agreement that govern any future developments in respect of the operation.</para><para>The important aspect here is that it is to the benefit of all if you can, at a particularly early stage, get the parties together to work out longer term agreements, based in a spirit of coexistence and cooperation, to determine future developments on land in which Aboriginals do have a title interest. It is an important one in terms of process, but it is also an important one in terms of the message that this parliament gives to stake holders—to get together early in the piece and try to work out beneficial longer term arrangements within the infrastructure and framework of the law.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>2446</page.no><name role="metadata">Minchin, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator MINCHIN</name><name.id>JX4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State;Minister Assisting the Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I have circulated a new government amendment.

 which was deferred from the previous batch. I suggest that we deal with that at this stage. It refers to section 28, injunctive relief. What we seek to do with 130 is insert a subsection (3) into section 28 to provide for native title claimants to seek injunctive relief where the notification provisions in section 29 have not been complied with. There is a potentially big problem here. If the right to negotiate process proceeds and is invalid as a result of a relevant government's failure, for instance, to comply with the requirements of section 29 and as a consequence of which native title holders do not have sufficient notice, then it is important for us to be able to tackle that early in the piece rather than down the track when negotiations have been proceeding for quite some time and parties may in fact be going to court.</para></talk.start><para> To ensure that there is no question of invalidity, to ensure there are negotiations in good faith, as is required by the act, it is important for us to ensure that there is a capacity for applicants to seek injunctive relief at that particular stage. If the right to negotiate processes are not suspended, native title holders could be deprived of a real opportunity to negotiate an agreement. As I say, it is likely that, in those circumstances, conflict will develop and develop expeditiously over time.</para><para>So amendment 130 provides that the process can be frozen if injunctive relief is sought in relation to section 29. Given the speed at which injunctions can be sought and determined, any delay to the right to negotiate process will be quite minimal. I say that with a great degree of experience, having been a former immigration minister. It is very easy to get access to courts to get a hearing on an injunction. Those hearings can be either by phone or on weekends. There is an expeditious procedure available to people. We do not see that our provision here would frustrate any real negotiating process.</para><para>Amendment No. 130 agreed to.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>2447</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The opposition opposes section 34A as follows:</para></talk.start><para>(137)	 Schedule 1, item 9, page 97 (line 20) to page 99 (line 10), section 34A <inline font-weight="bold">TO BE OPPOSED</inline> .</para><para>Whilst I move that, amendment 134 is one that I thought may come up before it.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>—We have carried that.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>XE4</name.id><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name></talker><para>—Section 34A relates to the government's provisions that allow a minister to intervene prior to arbitration. I note here that there is a bundle of consequential amendments to this, and I note that the Democrats-Greens (WA) position is identical to ours.</para></talk.start></continue><para>We have a concern with the government amendments. The government's bill gives the minister, who is likely to be either a state or a territory mining minister, a process to bypass the right to negotiate four months after a section 29 notice is issued. That is the cut-off date for registration of an application; hence the likelihood of any agreement within a four-month period is extremely remote.</para><para>I have to say that the basis for intervention under the government's proposal is a bit rich and includes that the act is likely to be of substantial benefit to Australia. That is a good parenthood statement that we all agree with, but what is good for Australia should also accommodate what is good for the property interests involved, including Aboriginal Australians. Another basis is that if the determination is not made, the benefit will be reduced or will not arise.</para><para>We in this place are always subjected to highly paid consultants briefs that tell us what an enormous impact a particular measure will have on the economy. I think the economy has been under threat of destruction time and time again because of a minor measure. It is not hard to get documentation to support such cases, and we think this particular provision is so open-ended it is farcical, and native title holders will gain significant benefits from conditions permitting the act.</para><para>That is something that is also quite often in dispute. In fact it is in dispute in respect of this legislation. The government says that they are getting enormous benefits; every Aboriginal in Australia says that they are not. The 
 government lawyers are saying this legislation is detrimental and discriminatory; the government is saying it is beneficial. These sorts of criteria are really not worth putting on paper.</para><para>There are procedural provisions in section 36B(3) which require the minister to invite submissions, with a notice for receipt of submissions at the minister's discretion. The minister must distribute submissions to other parties and provide them with seven days in which to respond. Let us face it, we are talking about some pretty big proposals here. More importantly, the minister is not required to consider the submissions. So if anyone thought that there might be some equitable relief in any admin law process, just keep in mind that you might go to all the trouble of putting up a submission but the minister has no duty to require it. So there is inadequate notice.</para><para>The other concern is that quite often in these sorts of situations it is a conflict between a native title interest and a government which is at the heart of the issue. In those circumstances, where there is such a conflict and the state ministers have the responsibility to make a determination, there could not be a more clear example of a conflict of interest than that. We believe that this provision should be amended, and our amendment 137 opposes section 34A, which provides for this early ministerial intervention.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>2448</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—They are indeed the same set of amendments as the Greens-Democrats amendments.

We need to ensure that there is a framework for arbitral determinations in the bill that is passed tonight.</para><para>With respect to the government's reduction of arbitration time periods, our amendment 142 effectively remedies the government amendments which reduce the current arbitration period in the act from six months in the case of acquisition and mining, other than exploration, to four months. We think it is unacceptable to expect a large and complex proposal, quite often covering vast areas, technologies and impacts, to be arbitrated within a minimum of four months.</para><para>We also maintain a commitment to legislation which puts a foundation under the sorts of negotiations we expect to take place. We are proceeding with this amendment to ensure that arbitral bodies can proceed to arbitration, but should do so only if there have been good faith negotiations. It is important to do that. As I say, it is something that you would otherwise not really spend the time of the parliament on; you expect negotiations to be in good faith. There have been experiences, 
 as reflected in the Federal Court case of Gwalia and the state of Western Australia in June 1996, where it was found that good faith negotiations did not take place. We believe it is important to ensure that that requirement still governs negotiations between parties. They are the two things the amendment does, and we commend the amendment to the committee.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>2451</page.no><name role="metadata">Minchin, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator MINCHIN</name><name.id>JX4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State;Minister Assisting the Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am restricting my comments on these amendments because we are debating things that we debated last time and the government's position is well known.

As we saw on the <inline font-style="italic">Lateline</inline>  program the other night, the Sons of Gwalia case is a classic example of where you have a right to negotiate process involving only one native title claimant and yet, 3½ years after that company first sought its mining lease and followed the procedures of the right to negotiate process as best it could, it still does not have its lease.</para></talk.start><para>This is going on all over the country. Experience is showing that the right to negotiate process is becoming an absolute legal minefield, with legal challenges every step of the way. We have tightened up the procedure. That is what our amendment 36 does in view of what is going on on the ground, with mining leases simply going in one end and nothing coming out the other end.</para><para>There has been an 80 per cent reduction in the number of mining leases issued in Western Australia since the right to negotiate process commenced in that state. That may please some senators who do not want any mining in this country, but for those who do know how much wealth and how many jobs are generated by the mining industry, and how dependent on it we are, that must be a cause for considerable alarm. These opposition amendments simply reflect a complete failure to take account of the fact that the right to negotiate process, as it is currently structured, is not working and there is a need 
 for it to be streamlined and tightened up in the way we proposed. To go back and stretch out time limits again and loosen the system will only compound the very significant problems we are having. ATSIC itself, in its recent report on native title, acknowledged the very significant problems in the practical operation of the right to negotiate process.

The government is trying to get away with a proposal whereby a state or territory minister may intervene in the arbitration on the right to negotiate if the bodies fail to make a determination within a four-month period. They are also trying to ensure it happens without notice requirements.</para><para>The criteria for intervention are that the arbitral body is unlikely to make the determination within a reasonable period or it is in the state or territory interest, or in the national interest if it is a Commonwealth matter, to make the determination at that time. If you really interpret the provisions that govern the operation of this discretion, you find that, basically, this is a blank cheque to state and territory ministers to intervene at will and for whatever reason.</para><para>There are procedural provisions which require the minister to invite submissions with notice for receipt of submissions at the minister's discretion, and seven days in which to respond. Once again, the minister is not required to consider the submissions. You wonder what basic lessons in administrative law the people who drafted this legislation really had. You would not get away with this in most courts in the country.</para><para>We are concerned, as before, about a conflict of interest. There is no requirement to consider inadequate notice. Our amendments are on the basis that we do not favour high levels of intervention in a process which is best to be seen as a controlled or well-organised negotiation, mediation and arbitration process. As a consequence of all the reasons 
 I have mentioned, we do not think that state ministers should have these sorts of powers.</para><para>Section 36A has been amended to give the responsibility to intervene to the Commonwealth ministers. What 148 does is replace paragraphs 2(b) and (c) and subsection (3) with paragraph (b) which brings the basis for intervention into line with the gravity of the act of intervening in arbitration—that is, it must be in the national interest to make the determination at the time. Amendment 165 replaces subsection (7) to overcome the natural justice problems in the government's proposals by allowing the minister's determination to be open to public scrutiny by causing a copy of the determination, with reasons, to be tabled in the parliament. It is very limited public scrutiny, I must confess. It is something the government should be able to tolerate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>2452</page.no><name role="metadata">Minchin, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator MINCHIN</name><name.id>JX4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State;Minister Assisting the Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Senator Bolkus's somewhat fatuous remarks about the drafters of these provisions prompts me to speak on this issue.

To suggest that there are not enormous constraints on this particular ministerial determination again shows a refusal to read 36B, which sets out quite rigorous conditions before the minister can intervene.</para></talk.start><para>This ministerial determination procedure in section 36A, as controlled and qualified by section 36B, is our proper and responsible response again to what we have identified and what ATSIC itself has identified as very major problems with the practical operation of the right to negotiate process where everything goes in one end and nothing comes out the other. It clearly is essential if you pay attention to what is happening with the right to negotiate process to have a mechanism of this kind. As I say, the minister must comply with all the provisions in section 36B before terms of notification and consultation, et 
 cetera, before he or she can make the determination. So Senator Bolkus, frankly, has not fairly represented the proposal.

This has caused problems. If we are worried about workability, this has caused problems in WA where an exploration and a right to mine arise out of same grant.

I draw the attention of the committee to section 39 on page 106 of the bill, which deals with criteria for making arbitral body determinations. We are asking that when a determination is required, the arbitral body have the ability to take the environment and the impact on the environment into consideration. This is not such a radical idea; it is already in the act. The National Indigenous Working Group have strongly requested that this should be the case. I know we can probably expect the tired old story from the minister that this is about 
 land, not about the environment. But it is in the act.</para><para>It is suggested that somehow or other people can be interested in the effect on the enjoyment of native title parties—way of life, culture and traditions, the development of social, cultural and economic structures, freedom of access, any aerial site, land or waters concerned with significance—but somehow not be worried about the impact on their environment. That is what it is saying. I find it quite extraordinary that the minister can suggest or maybe even consider that indigenous people are not concerned about their environment, that they do not want to look after it and have some say about it in relation to arbitral determinations or make sure that arbitral bodies can take these issues into consideration when they make their determination. It is quite logical and I commend it to the committee.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>2456</page.no><name role="metadata">Minchin, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator MINCHIN</name><name.id>JX4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State;Minister Assisting the Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We oppose this amendment. One of the problems with this extraordinarily legalistic process that is the right to negotiate is that it gives endless opportunities for legal challenge on the basis that if the arbitral body has not taken proper account of one of these criteria then you can go to the Federal Court and challenge it. Of course, that is what is happening. That is why it is taking years for anything to come out of the process. We believe that the criteria we have set down in section 39 are appropriate, given that we are dealing with the impact on native title of the process. There are other environmental conditions and regulations which every mining project must comply with.</para></talk.start><para>Section 39 sets down that the arbitral body must take into account the following: the effect of the act on the enjoyment by the native title parties of their determined native title rights and interests; the way of life, culture and traditions, et cetera. This is an unnecessary amendment. The impact on the native title claimants and their way of life is more than adequately catered for in the criteria laid down. This simply adds another process to it—another requirement on the 
 arbitral body which they must take account of. We think it simply adds to the complexity of the process and adds to the opportunity for legal challenge to the whole arbitral body process.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>2456</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Even warden's courts are required to listen to arguments on the environment. Obviously, standing has to be established, so it is bizarre to suggest that an arbitral body determining native title is not required to at least take into account the concerns of the claimants in relation to the impact of a proposal on the environment. Why should they be concerned about it? Because it has this impact on the environment which may have impacts, for instance, on their quality of water or have some other impact down the track on the ability to hunt or fish or something of that nature. The reality is that you cannot really separate these economic, environmental, cultural and social factors.

As Senator Margetts said, the indigenous people want this provision added. It has to be noted that two major provisions to be considered here are: the economic and other interests to Australia or state or territory concerned; or detriment to any other person. Note the word `economic'. I suppose we have to expect that this government would not want the environment to be in there because it says that that is going to lead to further litigation, but the economic considerations will potentially lead to a whole range of complexities. Anyway, there is the provision for `any public interest in the doing of the act', so I think it is a bit specious for the government to say that the environment should not be included in the public interest or that mining is a matter where the environment should not be under consideration by an arbitral body. Of course, it should.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>2456</page.no><name role="metadata">Minchin, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator MINCHIN</name><name.id>JX4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State;Minister Assisting the Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I simply add that this arbitral body process is about the impact of the act on native title. Mining companies have to go through very rigorous environmental controls before they 
 can even get to this point. The criteria also provide that the arbitral body can take account of any other matter that the arbitral body considers relevant. So to the extent that the arbitral body considers the impact on the environment in terms of the native title rights and interests claimed or held then obviously the environment can be taken account of.

As I read it, it is pretty all-encompassing. It seems to me that it does have the power to do what is suggested in Senator Margetts's motion but to do it in a way which relates to the native title interests of the parties. The clause already indicates that the arbitral body must take into account various issues:</para></talk.start><para>the effect of the act on:</para><para>(i) the enjoyment by the native title parties of their determined or claimed native title rights and interests;</para><para>I suppose even under that the arbitral body may take into account what is contained in Senator Margetts's amendment. The clause continues:</para><para>(ii)  the development of the social, cultural and economic structures of any of those parties; and</para><para>(iv) the freedom of access by any of those parties to the land or waters concerned and their freedom to carry out rites, ceremonies or other activities of cultural significance on the land or waters in accordance with their traditions;</para><para>The catch-all is in (f) which says:</para><para>any other matter that the arbitral body considers relevant.</para><para>I do have a feeling that because this is a native title amendment bill we should really focus on those areas qua native title rights and interests, because it may well be that the consequence of the acceptance of the amendment is that the arbitral body may take into account an assessment of the effect of the proposed act on the natural environment of the land or waters concerned that is relevant to subparagraph (a)(iv). Whilst (a)(iv) does talk about effects of the act upon it that are relevant to the native title rights and interests 
 so claimed or determined, I would like to ask Senator Margetts whether she believes that that would specifically relate only to the rights and interests of the native title holder. If that is so, I would be inclined to support the amendment. If it is not, if it is to take into account the arbitral bodies somehow taking some independent decision as to how the determination will `affect the environment' without reference to the rights and interests of the native title parties, if it is without reference to rights and interests of the native title bodies, then I would be concerned about that. If it is any decision in this matter which is specifically related to the environment as it affects the rights and interests of native title holder and I can have  an assurance on that, then I think it has merit.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>2457</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank Senator Harradine.

If you look at 38(1) it says that:</para></talk.start><para>. . . the arbitral body must make one of the following determinations:</para><para>(a)	 a determination that the act must not be done;</para><para>(b)	 a determination that the act may be done;</para><para>(c)	 a determination that the act may be done subject to conditions to be complied with by any of the parties.</para><para>Those provisions obviously have the direct implication that the arbitral body does have a capacity to make determinations in respect of a whole range of factors and conditions. It could very well be argued that amongst the conditions that it can make are financial conditions. The concern we have is with subsection (2) which basically says determinations can be made over a whole range of things, but, under subsection (2), you cannot look at the profits, the income, or anything that is produced, of any party in relation to land or water concerned.</para><para>Basically, we have a government that, on the one hand, wanted to ensure that when making a determination, either a minister or a tribunal could look at the impact of native title on the financial viability of a particular company, but, at the same time, denies the tribunal the power to make any determination as to conditions on which native title or interests can be protected on financial grounds. That is one of the problems we have.</para><para>In terms of determinations: we are not saying that determinations that we would like to see as part of the capacity of the arbitral body—that is, financial conditions—should have any different strength, status or effect than any other determination. The way determinations are treated is provided in section 41(1) which basically says that the determina 
 tion or agreement has effect as if the conditions were terms of a contract amongst the negotiating parties.</para><para>So, Senator Harradine, we are not saying that the determination should have any augmented power or effect; we are saying it should have the same power and effect as any other determination made by the arbitration body in this particular proceedings. As a consequence, I would argue very strongly that, if the government's regime and the effect that the government provides for determination is sustainable constitutionally, then so, of course, would be any determination as to financial conditions. We are not arguing that those determinations have any extra strength.

The only situation in which a state or territory will be given more than 180 days in which to amend its regime is if, before the expiration of the 180 days, the Commonwealth minister has determined in writing that a further period be given and, at the end of the 180 days, if he or she is satisfied that the state or territory minister is using his or her best endeavours to amend the provisions to satisfy the Commonwealth's criteria.</para><para>We think an arbitrary absolute cut-off does not take account of the fact that, if legislation is involved, with most parliaments not being controlled by the government, there has to be some capacity to allow an extension, if that is necessary, in order to enable the relevant government to change the legislation circumstances which it may not necessarily control.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>2459</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The difference between amendments Nos 45 and 46 is that amendment 45 amends section 43. I gather that, as a consequence, section 43 is not to be affected by the debate on sections 43A and 43B, the exceptions to the right to negotiate. If the opposition, Harradine and Democrat-Greens (WA) amendments are successful, you will not have a section 43A. As a consequence, you will not need amendment 46. So I make that point at the start.</para></talk.start><para>At this stage, we can probably move to what is the critical issue before the Senate tonight, and maybe Senator Harradine would like to start off here, otherwise I can continue. I will continue and, in doing so, note that the three sets of amendments are identical and are in conflict with government amendment No. 46. Essentially, we are talking about whether 
 the right to negotiate should continue to apply with respect to pastoral leases. All along in this debate, we have said that it is our view that a substantive and effective right to negotiate should be available to indigenous claimants, native title holders, under this act, and it should be made available in accordance with the provisions of the act.</para><para>To do what the government wants to do would be to reduce the effect and the operation of the right to negotiate to some six to eight per cent of Australia. That would be to subvert the High Court decision in Mabo, as it would be to undermine the High Court decision in Wik. The government seeks to exclude the right to negotiate from pastoral leases, both current and historical, and from national parks and forestry reserves so that it applies to a thin sliver of Australia. It wants to replace that. Also, this is the second arm of the government's objectives here not just to reduce it in terms of operable territory but also to replace the right to negotiate with respect to its operation and to basically provide, as the government has claimed quite often, equivalent rights to those coexisting title holders.</para><para>As ATSIC has made very clear this week, we are talking here of two different interests. We are talking here of a leaseholder; we are also talking here of a native title holder—the underlying title to the land. For it to be respected, there needs to be due recognition given to those who hold such title. Due recognition means an effective, meaningful and substantive right to be involved in the process. The right to negotiate under this legislation is not the unlimited, uncontrolled common law right to pursue matters. It is a much more constrained alternative to the common law. It is not a veto power, as I said earlier. In fact, it is an obligation on parties to proceed in a timely manner and within the constraints. The government has mentioned concerns. We have mentioned concerns. In fact, just about everyone in this parliament has mentioned concerns with the operation so far.</para><para>We have had an exhaustive debate. By the time we finish this today, we would not have broken last year's record, but we probably 
 would have gone to about 30 hours or so—last year we went to about 41 hours. It is not a bad work over for legislation like this. But, at the end of that, and over objection from many of us in this place, the Senate has given the government an enormously high threshold test. We have given it provisions that control the processes and the applications in such a way that the evidentiary and procedural requirements, as passed by the Senate, will make it much more difficult for title interests to pursue their cases under this law. In fact, quite often, it will be a matter of judgment for them as to whether they pursue it under this law or whether they pursue long established common law rights in the Federal Court and the High Court of Australia.</para><para>Our obligation is, I think, to ensure that a balance is struck here that makes this legislation acceptable to native title interests. To the extent that we do not, it will not just be they who suffer the consequences; it will be the mining interests and the pastoral interests that want certainty and want it quickly that will suffer. It is three months in an expedited procedure, six months in a normal right to negotiate process, particularly when we talk about these high hurdles that now have to be overcome.</para><para>The other thing to be said about the right to negotiate is, as I said earlier, that it is the heart and soul of native title. Native title is about respecting those who have prior rights and interests and continuing rights and interests in this land. It is about respecting indigenous rights. It is about doing what the rest of the world is doing in respect of indigenous people, that is, paying them and their rights due respect in a process that deals with their land. It is about dealing with them as human beings and not as cattle. It is about respecting their right to fish, their right to live, their right to exist on land as much as, if not more than, we respects the rights of those who have authority to fish, to mine and to plunder those resources.</para><para>We should not only be about protecting the backyards of white people; we should also be about protecting the backyards of indigenous Australians. We should not only be about protecting the rights of pastoralists to develop 
 the land; we should also be about protecting the coexisting interests of black people. We should not only be about protecting the rights of those who have licences and permits to fish and to quarry; we should also be about protecting the rights of indigenous Australians to fish, to hunt and to exist on their land. This is what it is about. This is what Wik was about and is about. The government's legislation basically denies any respect for the core of native title. It denies any respect for the consequences of it.</para><para>So we have those problems. I also have to say that legislation like this which is so discriminatory—identified as such by the parliamentary counsel to the government—is legislation which begs challenge in the court system, at a time when the Australian Government Solicitor has advised this government that the impact of the Kartinyeri case last week will leave well open the definition of the race power, the impact of the race power and the implications of the race power. To ask for cases to go to the High Court is something that non-indigenous Australians and other stakeholders want very much as a last option. It is basically like playing Russian roulette with the interests of stakeholders in this process. For these reasons we think the government is going too far. We think there needs to be an effective right to negotiate.</para><para>Let us acknowledge as we go on in this debate that we are talking about a right which, under this legislation, will be exercisable in so many less circumstances than before. It is no wonder the working group walked out on this parliament and this government. It has also acknowledged that what we are talking about here is coexistence. If the government implements Wik in the way that it should, we would be talking about coexistence, and the decision of the High Court would be subservient to the rights of other interests and stakeholders. We are basically asking for a degree of equity and a degree of constitutionality. Unfortunately, the government is not giving us that.</para><para>We have spent an enormous amount of time over recent weeks trying to develop alternative models. There is no secret: we have tried to develop a model which still pays respect to 
 the substantive right to negotiate. People have been working day and night to do that. We felt it was important to try to develop one indigenous working group. We thought it was important to see if they could work an alternative model through. But, at the end of the day, I have to sympathise with Senator Harradine. We have been consistently hitting brick walls on this most important issue. We have been hitting a brick wall with a government which, at the end of this debate, will have got close to 90 per cent of what they wanted through the parliament.</para><para>In anyone's language, close to 90 per cent is not a bad outcome, but let us not drive Australia to a race election out of stubbornness, obduracy, insensitivity and discrimination. The challenge really is to the government now. The government will get most of what it wants through this parliament. This is at least something that indigenous Australians can and should walk away with.

Schedule 43A is an attempt by this federal government to hand over its responsibility to the states and territories. If the government want to have a re-write of the history of the way state governments have treated indigenous people in this country, then I am happy to give it to them. But I think it is sufficient to say that the reason this federal parliament has had to take over responsibility for indigenous rights in this country is that state and territory governments in this country have, for 100 years at least, failed.</para></talk.start><para>Why was the 1967 referendum necessary? It was because people began to see the pictures of Aboriginal communities administered by state governments where Aboriginal people were starving and riddled with disease. They were in fact being neglected. Why did we have to have Mabo? Why did we have to have the Mabo and Wik High Court decisions? It is because state governments abrogated their responsibilities. They not only abrogated their responsibilities but also went out of their way to make sure that Aboriginal people did not receive the rights they were entitled to.</para><para>There is no way that this federal parliament should ever contemplate handing back the responsibility for Aboriginal rights to the state governments of this country. There is no way that a federal parliament in this country should contemplate allowing state governments again to perpetrate on Aboriginal people the kinds of injustice recorded in so many different ways in so many histories. I could bring you in a stack of books this high just in regard to my home state of Queensland. I hope that the Senate is going to oppose these sections. Of all the sections in this whole section about the right to negotiate, this is the one that brings out the most passion in me—the idea that this federal government should abrogate its responsibility to those states who themselves have been part of the regime of injustice and oppression.</para><para>If those state governments at some time in the future begin to show that in fact they can accept their responsibilities, perhaps then we can revisit this whole issue. Certainly, at the present time, there is no evidence to suggest that we should take the action which is proposed in this section. We certainly support the amendment of the opposition, of the Greens, Democrats and Harradine, that we oppose sections 43A and 43B.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>2462</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In this instance we have a wide agreement within the Senate in relation to sections 43A and 43B.

This certainly is a very key area in the legislation. The government's explanatory memorandum advises that the amendment bill permits the states and the territories to implement alternative provisions for future acts affecting leased or reserved areas. States and territories will only have to give native title holders the same procedural rights as other parties with an interest in the land, for example the holder of a non-exclusive pastoral lease.</para></talk.start><para>When we are talking about procedural rights I want to say very clearly that there is no true equality of procedural rights if the relevant tribunal, under its statute, may only take into consideration those things which pastoralists, for example, are specifically concerned with. I will come to that in my comments on the third reading.</para><para>The amendment that is currently before us I believe to be unacceptable. Native title holders whose lands are subject to pastoral lease, included in a national park or subject to Aboriginal statutory grants, should not be deprived of the right to negotiate. As I think I said on a previous occasion, in respect of the existence of native title and determined native title holders, it is of very little use to be a native title holder unless there is a right to negotiate, and an effective right to negotiate in respect of the specific interests and rights of those particular holders. But I do not intend to say any more at this stage. I also signify to the committee that I will oppose section 43A.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>2462</page.no><name role="metadata">Minchin, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator MINCHIN</name><name.id>JX4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State;Minister Assisting the Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to make a few remarks in relation to section 43A because it is obviously a very significant part of the bill and one of the four critical areas from the government's point of view. We have to go back to the starting point, which is the Native Title Act, and the presumptions on which it was based. As the then Prime Minister, Mr Keating, said, the 
 then government's view was that under the common law past valid freehold and leasehold grants extinguished native title.</para></talk.start><para>As many Labor and former Labor members have said, it was clear that the Native Title Act was written on the presumption that native title did not survive on leasehold land. So what the Native Title Act was based on was dealing with native title on vacant Crown land and Aboriginal land. That is clear from everything in the act itself. As I said before, the procedural rights that attach to native title were determined to be those that attach to holders of ordinary title, because it was thought that it could only apply on vacant Crown land and Aboriginal land.</para><para>There was this exception made that, in addition to mining and compulsory acquisitions of native title for making grants to third parties, there would be this special statutory right to negotiate process for those two things. We know that it was never contemplated by the government or the parliament that this right to negotiate process would apply on pastoral leases. That is the logical consequence of what was said by the government at the time and the whole premise of the act.</para><para>The Wik decision by 4-3 decided that native title was not necessarily extinguished on pastoral leases. It may well be, and there is still no native title determined on pastoral leases. As a result of our accepting that decision, you have to then make the decision of what procedural rights should attach to native title that may have survived on a pastoral lease. You must, in so doing, take account of the nature of those rights and what they may amount to. The High Court itself has said that native title may not necessarily be extinguished but where it survives, if at all, on a pastoral lease, it is a yielding right. The rights of the pastoralists prevail over the native title, and the native title rights must yield. So you then have to work out what procedural rights should attach in respect of mining or compulsory acquisitions for third parties on a pastoral lease where native title may have survived.</para><para>We take as our premise the starting point of the whole Native Title Act—that equality of procedural rights is the appropriate way to go. 
 We do think that is vital where you are talking about coexisting rights. The fact is that, unlike the whole premise of the Native Title Act, we now must deal with the fact that we have coexisting rights—native title rights and statutory leasehold rights—on the same piece of land and we must work out how they are going to live together and share that land.</para><para>We think it is fundamental to coexistence and reconciliation that there be equivalent procedural rights attaching to the statutory rights on the one hand and the native title rights on the other. You have to remember that, as a matter of the High Court's determination, there is a hierarchy of rights on a pastoral lease that involves the leasehold rights here and the native title rights there. That just flows from the fact that one is statutory and one is common law.</para><para>What is proposed here by removing 43A is a complete reversal of that relationship in respect of the procedural rights that attach to those property rights when it comes to  mining and compulsory acquisition. So the native title rights are way up here, having the full-blown right to negotiate process, and the pastoral lessee with the prevailing rights has a much lower level of procedural rights. That is a completely untenable, impractical and unworkable situation which we are fundamentally opposed to. We think it will do great harm and great damage on the 40 per cent of Australia where native title may have survived and which was not contemplated at the time the Native Title Act was passed.</para><para>I would also point out that it is clear from all the evidence that the right to negotiate process is not working very effectively at all. ATSIC itself has recognised that. There are huge backlogs in relation to mining applications going through the right to negotiate process. It is the most significant Commonwealth impediment to the development of Australia ever imposed by any federal government. It does apply on vacant Crown land and Aboriginal land to the extent that they do not already have much greater rights—like the veto on half of the Northern Territory.</para><para>It is an absolutely extraordinary proposition for this parliament to suggest that this whole process—which we know is causing this huge 
 backlog of mining leases; as I said, in Western Australia, there has been an 80 per cent reduction in the number of leases being granted—must by law apply across 79 per cent of Australia. In effect, it would apply to all mining and all major developments, because the remaining 21 per cent is essentially our cities, towns and freehold areas. It is classic Canberra, ivory tower thinking, without any regard for the impact of the legislation passed by this parliament upon the rest of Australia. It is no wonder people in Queensland and Western Australia cannot believe what goes on in this parliament, because it does have no regard for the consequences of these decisions. This is the application of a quite extraordinarily legalistic process across 79 per cent of Australia in a way which discriminates against the pastoral lessees of Australia by granting superior procedural rights to people on the base of their race.</para><para>The opposition says, `Don't worry. We've got a better registration test now, so what are you worried about?' A better registration test is a necessary but hardly sufficient condition for improving the inadequate operation of the current Native Title Act and the current right to negotiate process. As I have mentioned several times, to the extent that the new registration test does reduce the number of competing claims in any one area and may even with good fortune get it down to one claim in an area, that is no guarantee that we will improve the process.</para><para>As I pointed out, the sons of Gwalia claim is just one example in Western Australia where, with just one native title claim to deal with, that company has been trying for 3½ years to get a mining lease out of the right to negotiate process. At every step of the way, there is an action being taken in the Federal Court to prevent that mining lease being issued. That is only one claim so, even if the registration test works in the way we hope it will be effective—if it does reduce the number of competing and overlapping claims and maybe gets it down to one—you have still got that sort of problem.</para><para>So we think this is a completely inappropriate proposition. It is not the case that the right 
 to negotiate was ever designed to apply on pastoral leases. It is appropriate for the parliament to decide in the light of Wik what sort of procedural rights should apply on a pastoral lease. We think the only fair and equitable approach is to say that there should be equivalent procedural rights—that the rights granted to lessees should be the rights granted to the native title holders so that together, in their coexistence, they have equal rights. Any other approach is impracticable, unworkable and potentially quite damaging to good relations in rural Australia.</para><para>Progress reported.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ORDER OF BUSINESS</title><type>Business</type><page.no>2464</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Days and Hours of Meeting and Routine of Business</title><page.no>2464</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ian Campbell</inline>)—by leave—proposed:</para><para>That the order of the Senate of 6 April 1998, relating to the hours of meeting and routine of business for 8 April 1998, be varied to provide that the question for the adjournment of the Senate not be proposed at 12 midnight but be proposed after the question for the third reading of the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 [No. 2] has been determined.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>23:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>2464</page.no><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator ROBERT RAY</name><name.id>UI4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I think Senator Campbell just owes us a slight explanation to fill everyone in—for only a minute—on what the government's intentions are in terms of the rest of the time.

 the government's principle of equality of treatment and providing a different regime that is not called right to negotiate on other than vacant Crown land.</para><para>It was thought that this could be achieved by a regime which had at least two principle features: firstly, that the regime would enable native title holders and claimants to have their native title rights and interests taken into account by the relevant state and territory bodies, for example, mining wardens, when governmental authorities make decisions as to compulsory acquisition of native title rights and the granting of mining tenements on pastoral leases; secondly, that regime would provide true equality of procedure rights.</para><para>I want to explain what I mean by true equality. I believe that there is no true equality of procedure rights if the relevant tribunal under its statute may only take into consideration those things which pastoralists are especially concerned with, namely, whether the mining operation will affect the way in which the pastoralist carries on the grazing business, or only provide compensation for economic loss suffered as a consequence of the mining operation.</para><para>True equality, I believe, will occur only if the tribunal is able to take into consideration those things which native title holders and claimants are especially concerned with, namely, whether the mining operation will affect native title rights and interests, including culture and spiritual and other types of interests. For example, if it is proposed to carry out the construction of a mine site or access roads, then that construction may destroy or damage culturally sensitive land features. Even though the construction may have very little or no effect on the pastoralist's grazing business, it would in that instance seriously impact on native title rights and interests. Even if such construction does affect the pastoralist's grazing business, the payment of compensation will usually totally remedy the loss. Such is not the case with the native title rights and interests in that example.</para><para>There are a number of other examples that I could give, including the construction of a mine site on an area which may be adjacent 
 to a waterhole and which may affect the waterhole. The way in which the pastoralist's interests could be considered and taken into account there would be for the building and construction of a dam upstream, whereas that particular site may be of crucial significance to the Aboriginal native title holders, for spiritual or other reasons.</para><para>An analogy is provided by reference to people with disabilities. True equality demands that access ramps be provided for people in wheelchairs. To say that there is equality of treatment because everybody has access to the building by means of the stairs is patently ludicrous. Equality of treatment must be measured against people's needs. Pastoralists' needs relate to their grazing business; native title holders' needs relate to their native title rights and interests. There is no equality of treatment if the legislation does not reflect the essential difference between pastoralists' interests and native title holders' interests.</para><para>Over a considerable period of time now, there have been attempts to achieve some sort of common ground so that, in the end, legislation with which people could work could go through this parliament. That is sufficient for me to say at this stage, but I thought that it was important to respond to Senator Minchin and the points that he made in respect of the government's attitudes on this particular matter and the reasons that the government holds to those attitudes. I believe it is important to understand each other's viewpoints. That is what I have tried to do over a considerable period of time but particularly focused over the past week. But unfortunately there is no outcome to report.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>23:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>2467</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank Senator Harradine for that incisive comment on why the clause to eliminate the rights of indigenous people should not stand. That should be opposed. The most remarkable thing about Senator Minchin's contribution here is that I think he actually does believe it. I think that he has actually talked himself into believing what he tried to convince the Senate was the case. So let us get it into context. First of all, the High Court ruled that, when it comes to 
 leaseholdings, the indigenous people's rights give way to the pastoralists' rights, that is, to cattle grazing. The cattle roaming across the country have a sort of precedence over the indigenous people who want to roam across the same country.</para></talk.start><para>That is where we began in this legislative round of the 1990s. But that caused somewhat of a revolt in terms of potential property rights for leaseholders, who had never had such rights, to look at the future and, inveigled by the potential big money pouring into this country from a whole range of developers, to say, `Gee whiz, the High Court has left other developments of the future way outside our leaseholdings'—which would be possible if we were to get state governments to upgrade these leaseholdings to a de facto freehold: the woodchipping operations, the cotton growing, the dams, the fish farms, the plantations and a whole range of things—`That High Court ruling sounds like we will have to take the indigenous people into account. They may have a say in what happens beyond cattle grazing where they have no say.'</para><para>So in legislation in this place in 1993—and now here again—it was decided to solve that problem by completely eliminating, wiping out, the interests of the indigenous people for not only a veto but a right to negotiate; that the leaseholders' rights prevail if they are going to change the land of the indigenous people who have been there for thousands of years.</para><para>The governments, Labor and Liberal, argued that this was a proper thing to do to protect the rights of the people who lived in the bush and whose livelihoods were there—people like Kerry Packer, who this week must have been away from his farm for a while as I note that he lost $1 million on the gambling tables in Rio. He did tip the croupiers $10,000. But apparently his interests, as far as leaseholdings are concerned, need to be given precedence over those of the indigenous people who are actually out there in the bush, who want their connection with the land and who have been there for thousands of years. It appears also that people like the outback interest holder, the bush leaseholder, the Sultan of Brunei, has a greater direct interest 
 in the land of this country and should get more rights than the indigenous people who have been there for thousands of years.</para><para>And then after that round, Senator Minchin explained to the committee a while ago, `It is not fair. The indigenous people have rights up here and the pastoralists' rights are down here.' We have just been through a process where all those rights of indigenous people to negotiate have been eliminated, and he can still come in here and mount an argument that the indigenous people are better off.</para><para>How can he do that? Can he do it by arguing for the people in the bush like the Sultan of Brunei and Kerry Packer? No, he has to go to the big end of town. He goes to the cluster of big glass towers around the Stock Exchange that are owned by the mining companies and says, `I note that you have an interest out there in the bush. There is the potential that the indigenous people, through this High Court ruling, might have a say on your interests, and I am going to have a dickens of a job trying to explain that. Ah, I have a plan. I will try to hoodwink thinking Australians by saying, "It is not fair. These leaseholders"—they are not freeholders—"don't have a right to a say when it comes to mining, so the indigenous people shouldn't have a right either."'</para><para>And so Senator Minchin compounds villainy on villainy, gets up with a straight face and explain all this and thinks that people are going to swallow it. I think he has swallowed it himself. He sounded so convincing. But he is not going to convince the indigenous people of this country who are left under his plan, under this bucket loads of extinguishment, with nothing but an attachment which is recognised—no power on their homelands—and I submit he is not going to convince any Australian who hears what this is divestment of rights is really about.</para><para>Of course, the Senate should not be supporting this provision to eliminate what little is left of the indigenous people's power to have a say—no veto, just a negotiating right in regard to what happens to their homelands in the future. Without this little morsel, which is all that is left, they would have no powers at all. Yes, they can be consulted, they can be 
 given information about things, but when it comes to actually having a say in what happens to their country, as it is totally transformed in the years ahead, they have nothing.</para><para>As Senator Woodley said earlier, if you do not have negotiating rights, you really do not have native title. Sure, you can be given a piece of paper which recognises native title, but on the back of it are no powers, no rights, no say. That is what Senator Minchin, through this specious line of argument he put to us tonight, wants to say should be the case. I hope the Senate will not swallow it.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN (Senator McKiernan)</name></talker><para>—The question now is that amendment 46 moved by the government be agreed to.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>XE4</name.id><name role="metadata">BOLKUS</name><name role="display">Senator Bolkus</name></talker><para>—I wonder whether it is best to defer that until we have the opposition amendment moved first.

Our concern with the government's bill is that it seeks to introduce section 241C(d)(ii). It does so in a way that raises some unintended consequences. Greens amendment No. 80 seeks to omit section 241C(d)(ii). This section of the government's bill is somewhat convoluted, but it amounts to this: it allows a non-exclusive pastoral or agricultural lease to be renewed as two or more separate leases and licences.</para></talk.start><para>Instead of allowing for a renewal in the same form and manner, it allows for a disaggregation of the lease interest into two or more separate leases and licences. As part of that provision, it allows not only what is now an extremely wide primary production activities test to apply to the renewed leases, but also says in section 241C(d)(ii) that you could allow other activities associated with primary production, provided only that the majority of the area of all the new leases is still for primary purposes.</para><para>What you are possibly able to do, for instance—and it is not outside the realms of possibility—is, applying the new definition of primary production activities, in being able to renew your lease into two separate leases, licences or whatever, you may be able to start a tractor factory in one small part of the lease. So long as the overall area is still primary production, you can then section off that small area which is used for manufacturing related to primary production and allow for a new generation of industries altogether. I am sure that is an unintended consequence—I hope it is an unintended consequence—but it is a consequence which section 241C(d)(ii) provides for squarely within that provision. It is for that reason that we oppose 241C(d)(ii), and it is for that reason that we support Democrat amendment No. 80.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>23:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>2472</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I could not have said it better myself, Senator Bolkus.

Items 31 to 33 are what the Greens (WA) call the platypus amendments. Only certain people who were involved in the debate in 1993 know what this means. Section 211 of the current act provides a guarantee that certain native title rights such as hunting and gathering can continue where the law restricting or prohibiting activity allows that class of activity to be carried out under licence.</para></talk.start><para>Item 31 represents a substantial watering down of this guarantee. As long as there is permission to carry out the class of activities to non-Aboriginal people then Aboriginal people should be able to carry out that class of activity. It is not unreasonable that Aboriginal people should be entitled to exercise 
 traditional rights in all the circumstances where there is not complete prohibition on carrying out a traditional activity. If emergency situations were what the government had in mind—for instance, public safety—then the government should say so. A great deal of scientific research is carried out for private commercial purposes. In those circumstances, indigenous people should be entitled to exercise rights which are fundamental to their own existence.</para><para>Item 32 is a note stating that the exercise of native title rights is subject to laws of general application. This note is unnecessary and has the potential to create confusion as to which laws apply and the extent to which section 211 rights may be exercised or abrogated by state regulations.</para><para>With regard to item 33, section 212 ensures that any confirmation is not a backdoor way to further impair native title rights. The current act requires that such confirmation does not extinguish or impair any native title rights or interests. This is fundamental protection for the native title rights.</para><para>The statement on page 322 of the explanatory memorandum explaining this amendment is justified because ownership or exercise may technically impair the enjoyment of native title and in some respects misses the point of the provision and the protection it is supposed to provide. It is not technical. It is a substantive authorisation for the states to impair native title rights without any procedural rights being afforded. It is discriminatory in that no other person's rights are abrogated in this way.

 difficult. When we are talking about laws of general application we are talking in general terms about the criminal law and things like that.

I think our political leaders have been able to take advantage of ignorance and they have cynically manipulated public opinion and fostered hatred and divisiveness. Education is a very powerful weapon against prejudice and hatred. That is why the Democrats are very happy to move this amendment.</para><para>With this amendment we would like to give the National Native Title Tribunal the task of educating indigenous and non-indigenous Australians about native title. It is a role that the tribunal already takes on in a very effective way for those who are closely associated with the process. The tribunal has been a very valuable and reliable source of accurate advice to the Australian Local Government Association, and to state and local government organisations, in assisting them to respond to native title and to engage in non-adversarial ways of working through the processes.</para><para>The tribunal has already published material on native title, a background paper that gives national, state and territory based figures on native title applications. The tribunal is on the Internet with questions and answers, media releases, instructions on how to apply for native title, policies and procedures, time lines, determinations, draft agreements, feedback, search sites and a growing list of 
 publications. The most recent of these is a new book entitled <inline font-style="italic">Native Title and the Descent of Rights</inline>. Constraints on available funds, however, mean that this publication is not available free of charge but must be purchased.</para><para>With assistance from ATSIC, the ALGA employed a native title project manager to provide accurate, unbiased information and to conduct seminars around the country for councils with native title representative bodies and state and territory governments. At these seminars it has been very clear that communities were desperately looking for information—dispassionate, accurate information—to assist their understanding of native title, its origins and what it is, what the Native Title Act does and what the range of options are for responding to native title claims.</para><para>Not all state governments have been eager to take part in this process. The Kennett government in Victoria, until recently, was advising its councils to steer clear of local area agreements. It was discouraging councils from even meeting with claimants. But the work of the ALGA and the Native Title Tribunal has turned that around somewhat with their seminars. The ALGA, with the assistance of the tribunal, have produced booklets entitled, <inline font-style="italic">Working with native title</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Working out agreements: a practical guide to agreements between local government and indigenous Australians</inline>.</para><para>As I said, the tribunal has remained quite unbiased and apolitical throughout these seminars and in its dealings with councils. It does not discuss the 10-point plan or attempt to make judgments about its implications, so the government need not fear criticism. Local government, having worked closely with the tribunal for some time now and being a quite significant land manager in its own right and therefore a player in the process, is convinced that the tribunal is best placed to conduct a public education campaign. The Native Title National Liaison Committee has already raised the need for public education and unanimously agreed that the tribunal is the most appropriate body to play a lead role in this area.</para><para>As I have said in this debate before, I consider local government to have provided the sort of leadership that we would like to have seen from the Prime Minister. The national ALGA convention last year made a very solid commitment to reconciliation and to negotiating native title agreements and, as I have said previously, local governments are in an excellent position to bring knowledge, cohesion and understanding into their communities, instead of divisiveness and fear. They are already well placed in their relationship with the Native Title Tribunal to do that.</para><para>The tribunal does not currently have the resources or the equipment to conduct widespread public education programs, so if the government opts to support this amendment it would, of course, be recognising the tribunal's valuable work so far, but hopefully it would also indicate its willingness to make provision for resources in the next budget for such a measure. I commend this amendment to the Senate.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Thursday, 9 April 1998</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>NaN:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>2478</page.no><name role="metadata">Minchin, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator MINCHIN</name><name.id>JX4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State;Minister Assisting the Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—At midnight on the fourth day of this debate, I do not think that gratuitously insulting the Prime Minister is the way to encourage us to support this amendment. There is no doubt that there is a very low level of understanding of native title in the community. I think we all can see that, and many of us have spent a lot of time in good faith generously explaining native title to many community groups. I also commend the ALGA on what it has done in seeking to ensure that local communities affected by native title claims do have a greater understanding of what it means so that the fear on both sides can be allayed. I also support what the Native Title Tribunal has been doing, particularly Justice French, who I think does a very good job in going around the country talking about native title in a dispassionate and objective manner.</para></talk.start><para>It is a fact that the Native Title Tribunal operates in the way in which the amendment seeks to describe without this amendment. It already includes within its strategic goals that of informing and educating applicants and 
 others about native title concepts, the purposes of mediation and the role and processes of the tribunal itself. It already has a budget of $21½ million per annum to enable it to perform those and other functions.</para><para>In general terms we obviously support every effort to ensure that the community has as great an understanding of native title as possible, and I know that groups like the ALGA, farmers organisations, the mining industry and Aboriginal groups do a lot of this sort of work as well as, of course, we mere politicians. But I am not in a position to indicate government acceptance of this amendment to give additional statutory functions to this Commonwealth body. It would have budgetary implications. We will obviously be interested in the Senate's view of this and take account of it, but I am not in a position to indicate government acceptance.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>00:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>2478</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I genuinely have to say that, at the end of this debate, this is also a lineball decision for us. On the one hand I can see that there is a need for someone to be doing this, and I can see that the Native Title Tribunal does it to a certain extent. But my concerns are that, firstly, if we do give this tribunal a legislative responsibility to do it, it would be a responsibility which they possibly will not be able to meet to fulfil our expectations. This is a tribunal that is going to be overladen with work in the forthcoming years, and it will need all the resources and staff it can get to ensure that the system works properly.</para></talk.start><para>Secondly, the public education role is one that it can conduct to a certain extent, but the importance about the tribunal so far is that it has tried to build respect through building a profile of independence and not being a lobbyist for the system, and that is probably important as well. On the other hand, I just cannot see this government giving resources anywhere else for this function to be conducted. On balance, I do not know that I would support a legislative responsibility on the tribunal to do this to the extent that their operation and their profile can be enhanced. They do it and they should continue to do it, but I am a bit concerned that we may be voting for this amendment—if we do vote for 
 it—with high expectations that the tribunal cannot fulfil.

The aim of this amendment is to allow the existing law in the old Native Title Act to apply to the PNG-Queensland gas project and any other project in an identical position. In respect of the PNG-Queensland gas project, we have been requested to move this amendment by, amongst others, both Frankie Deemal of the Cape York Land Council and Norman Johnson of the Birri Gubba Land Council, and I will either table or incorporate their letter at a later stage.</para><para>We have a situation here where the PNG-Queensland gas project involves the piping of natural gas from Kautubu in the highlands of Papua New Guinea through the Torres Strait and mainland Queensland to Gladstone. It is a massive project involving some $6 billion in construction costs and there are some 16 traditional owner groups involved. It has been a project that has been characterised so far by a strong working partnership between the Aboriginal peoples and the lead joint venture partner, Chevron. I am informed that it is a good example of how the existing Native Title Act has not stopped economic development but has ensured such development does occur with consultation, negotiation and agreement.</para><para>The problem with this particular proposal is that, under Queensland law, a proponent of a gas pipeline is required to comply with the provisions of the Queensland Petroleum Act. This act provides for the grant of a pipeline licence a legal regime for the securing of easements over pipeline corridor lands and compulsory acquisition of interests in land for a pipeline easement. Acts taken under the Petroleum Act are permissible future acts as 
 they can be done over freehold land. Whilst the Petroleum Act provides for the compulsory acquisition of native title interests, it is not a compulsory acquisition act within the meaning of section 26 of the existing Native Title Act. This means that the right to negotiate is not triggered by the Queensland Petroleum Act.</para><para>The legal effect then of the Petroleum Act in its relationship with the Native Title Act was the subject of a decision by Justice Drummond in the Tenneco case. This decision confirmed that the Petroleum Act did not trigger the right to negotiate. This has led to an inability by the company to seek the triggering of the right to negotiate. In the absence of that, parties have proceeded to a project heads of agreement to develop an innovative way to progress the project. The approach adopted has featured extensive discussions with Aboriginal rep bodies, traditional owners and leaders as to an appropriate method of consultation and negotiation.</para><para>Following these discussions, there was adoption of a detailed process of consultation and negotiation which built upon and endorsed Aboriginal decision making processes. These processes commenced in February 1997 and have continued since. In November 1997, the heads of agreement was signed. There is an implementation group consisting of reps of the Aboriginal people of each of the regions which the pipeline traverses. That group is working with a company to convert the heads of agreement into specific agreements with each of the traditional owner groups.</para><para>We are informed that the amendment is needed because the timing of the changes introduced by this bill would disrupt and frustrate the agreement process which is already under way. If the government holds off this bill and puts it to a double dissolution, then there will be no prospect of this bill having effect until next year—a good 10 months down the track. Under those circumstances, the process continuing with the land councils and the Chevron project will come to conclusion and agreement. But if this legislation does apply with respect to this, then we start a new right to negotiate process. That is why the people I mentioned earlier 
 wrote to us. I will read out the last two paragraphs of their correspondence:</para><para>We are concerned that a consequence of the Native Title Amendment Bill may be to change the legal regime against which our agreement has been reached and our implementation process adopted. Such a change may well have the affect of frustrating our processes even though the intention might be to enhance the position of Native Title holders.</para><para>Accordingly, we ask that we be able to complete the processes we have started and implement the agreement we have reached against the background of the existing law. We understand this may involve an amendment to the Bill to ensure this is the outcome. In particular we believe that it would be detrimental to now apply the formal "right to negotiate" to the project when a process equivalent to that right has already been adopted by the Aboriginal Peoples and the Company.</para><para>Basically, they are asking for the existing Native Title Act and state legislative regime to apply. Amendment N49 does precisely that. It provides that this provision apply only to the specific circumstances where an act is a perversible future act under the current Native Title Act and currently does not trigger the right to negotiate, but because of the amendments to the act the right to negotiate will now be triggered; secondly, it can only be accessed if a process of negotiation has taken place and agreement has been reached; or, if there is no agreement, then the full rights provided under the existing Native Title Act—that is, the freehold test—apply to the act.</para><para>That, I am sad to say, is a longer exposition than I would have liked to have given.

In many circumstances in the government's legislation, people will have had their property rights impaired or taken away without notice of fair process. In some circumstances, what these provisions do is provide for fast-track compensation. So not 
 only are they there for fairness, but a bill which has fast-track compensation and circumstances where rights are either retrospectively taken away or taken away without due process has a greater chance of meeting the just terms provisions of the constitution.

The advice to the  government is that the validity of the existing process which allows for native title determinations by the NNTT is doubtful in the light of Brandy. So the essence of this proposal is a finding by representative bodies, which are obviously not judicial bodies, of who holds native title in particular areas. That has all the problems that we have all agreed there now are with the Native Title Tribunal acting in any judicial capacity and it is why the whole process must be dealt with in the Federal Court and not the tribunal.

 Maybe I should give notice of it now to give people a chance to look at it while we are debating Senator Harradine's amendment. When we discuss renewals and the right to negotiate, under amendment RN27 1(b) provides for earlier rights which were created on or before 23 December 1996 by an act that is valid, including because of division 2 of the Native Title Act. The clause was actually drafted at a time when the opposition was pursuing an earlier cut-off date of 1994: as a consequence, the date would have been 1994 and we referred only to division 2. As the amendment went through the Senate we also picked up, not just past acts, but intermediate period acts. So the date then went from 1994 to 23 December 1996. The reference to division 2 only refers, of course, to past acts. Division 2A refers to intermediate period acts. In order to obtain consistency and pick up the fact that we have agreed to extend the renewal capacity to cover both past and intermediate period acts, I suggest that the words `or 2A' be added after the words `Division 2'. So I will put that on notice at this stage. I do not think the government would have a problem with it because of its consistency.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>—We will need it in writing because the clerks are having trouble finding out exactly where it needs to be.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>XE4</name.id><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name></talker><para>—I will get someone to write it down, but people are on notice so we can come back to it straight after Senator Harradine.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>—Senator Harradine, do you want to move your replacement amendment RN4 now?

Honourable senators will recall the debate that took place on the registration test and my 
 attempt to have the registration test expanded so that those persons who would not qualify under the guidelines established by the government in its amendment to the legislation would be eligible to obtain registration. I will read to the committee this amendment which is to add to the registration test provisions paragraph 11. I move:</para></talk.start></continue><para>(RN4)	 Schedule 2, item 63, page 206 (after line 28), at the end of section l90B, add:</para><para>	 (11)	 For the purposes of the operation of paragraph (7)(b), a reference to a member of the native title claim group will be taken to include a reference to a parent of a member of the native title claim group who previously had, and would reasonably have been expected during his or her life to have continued to have, a traditional physical connection with any part of the land or waters but for things done (other than the creation of an interest in relation to land or waters) by:</para><para>		 (a)	 the Crown in any capacity; or</para><para>		 (b)	 a statutory authority of the Crown in any capacity; or</para><para>		 (c)	 any other person.</para><para>This was specifically designed to cover the `stolen generation' and to cover those indigenous persons and groups who were locked out by pastoralists or by any other means; in other words, it is the locked gate and stolen generation amendment. I will not go over the arguments that I advanced on the last occasion in support of this amendment. I am grateful for the support of the opposition at that time. The amendment was, however, lost, and I put it to the committee again in the hope that the committee might see its way clear on this occasion, at this late stage, to support the amendment.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>00:25:00</time.stamp><page.no>2484</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The opposition does support this amendment. I think most of us have actually been haunted by the injustice that has flowed from the first time we debated and decided on the registration test. I, for one, have been trying to grapple, in the last 48 hours or so, with how in fact do we try to overcome the fact that, in doing what we did a couple of days ago, we have actually done a huge injustice to at least one generation of Aboriginal people. The law, as it would now operate 
 if this bill was proclaimed, would provide for a registration test that would involve a registrar being satisfied that the factual basis on which it was asserted that the native title rights and interests claim is sufficient to support—and I stress those words `sufficient to support', as opposed to prima facie—a contention that at least one member of the claimant group currently had, or previously had, a traditional physical connection with the land or previously had, and would reasonably be expected currently to have, a traditional physical connection with the land but for the actions of the Crown, statutory authority or another person.</para></talk.start><para>This new alternative is the one we need to focus on because it is not a stolen generation clause, because it requires that persons must have previously have had a traditional physical connection with the land before they can pursue their interests now. It is a contemporary locked gates clause in that it only applies to people who are currently locked out but who also previously had a physical connection to the land. That is not the registration test that this Senate agreed to in December 1997. We do not have to revisit the whole heated debate that we had the other day, but let us remember that this is not the test that we agreed to in 1997 nor of course is Senator Harradine's amendment. But what Senator Harradine does do in his amendment is ensure that the stolen generations can return to the land and have some rights under the Native Title Act.</para><para>As I said yesterday, without going through the whole debate again, in practical terms, this provision would ensure that most of those, if not all, who would qualify under Justice Brennan's test in Mabo would be able to get in through this particular provision. I said yesterday that it is not our preferred one, but it goes a long way to meeting our preferred one. But let us remember that without it we will leave this debate denying particularly the stolen generation's justice.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>00:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>2485</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to ask a question of Senator Harradine in relation to this amendment.

After lunch we lost one of them when the sunset clause was recommitted and thrown out. If the Greens support this proposition, then it looks like after dinner we will lose the only remaining one of the four on which the Senate had supported the government's position. So the bill would therefore come out of the Senate without the government having received support on any of the four really critical areas for us.</para></talk.start><para>I can only restate what I said before on the question of the registration test. We think that for the registration test to operate effectively—particularly if in the case of the opposition parties' premise the right to negotiate is going to apply across 79 per cent of Australia—it has to be a good test. This amendment takes you back to a situation where, even though not one member of the claim group has ever had any connection to the land claimed, the claim can still be registered and give the claimants access to the statutory right to negotiate. That is one reason for our opposition to this. There is also the fact that we do not think a proposition like this can be made workable. I do not know how registrars would be meant to satisfy themselves on this. Parents who may well not be alive being taken account of in determining the question of physical connection seems to us impractical as well as so watering down the registration test as to reduce its effectiveness quite seriously and considerably.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>00:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>2485</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The reason I asked the question of Senator Harradine earlier on in relation to

I do not know whether `honest' is the right word but he has certainly been very frank, and he always is—I think I could add `honest', because I can be generous at this time of night. And he has said that the government will not accept this amendment either. So what are we doing? The bill is going to be laid aside by the House of Representatives in a few hours time, so what is this achieving? We did not reopen the debate—let me point that out—but we certainly are going to have it, because we are not going to be forced again to simply vote on an amendment which is very much not a second or third best. Actually, it is about a fourth best if you add up the number of amendments which are possible in this debate.</para><para>I am listening to Senator Harradine; I am listening to the government; I am listening to Senator Bolkus. But I have to say to you that we are not convinced at this stage that we should vote for this particular amendment. Even though I think it explains far better what Senator Harradine was attempting to do, it does not change the principle. The principle 
 that we have objected to all along and which we debated at great length not only two nights ago but before Christmas is that a simple physical connection test, whether you take it back one generation or not, is totally inadequate.</para><para>What would have been more helpful is for Senator Harradine to bring back either the Indigenous Working Group amendment or the Labor amendment, both of which we supported, because that would have given us some real options. It would have enabled us to really make some progress. But why would we reopen a bill that the government is going to reject—Senator Harradine's amendment is going to be rejected by the government—for hardly any gain but for a lot more pain again, I can tell you? This is the problem. Senator Margetts may like to add to my remarks.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>00:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>2486</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Honourable senators may have noticed that sheet 957 has been circulated, and I will be asking for recommittal in relation to the registration test. In a very short time you will see another sheet as well. Sheet 957 is basically re-putting the Greens (WA)-Democrats amendments of last time, with some slight variation.</para></talk.start><para>What you will see very soon is an amendment, in the name of the Greens and the Democrats, that last time was moved by the ALP. As Senator Woodley suggests, it was not us who reopened this debate. If we are going to open it, we should in fairness provide the option of choices again. Senator Bolkus has indicated that he has had some time to repent, so perhaps the repentance might go so far as to relook at his own amendment. I also would suggest that other senators in the place might consider it. I am sure Senator Bolkus will be prepared to support what is, in fact, his own amendment, but, of course, we need more than Senator Bolkus.</para><para>Given that the government is clearly indicating that it is not going to move any further with the bill in the form that the Senate has carefully dealt with it, I think it would be a positive, very conciliatory and very important note on which to conclude the debate to heed the concerns of the National Indigenous 
 Working Group, which made some strong statements today in the media and in public, and to look very carefully at rejecting the concept that a physical connection test is necessary for registration. So we will have two choices very soon. By the time we have voted on Senator Harradine's amendment, which I have to say I am still unable to support, we will have the new amendment 1 on sheet 969 that we hope the Senate will permit us to deal with again.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>00:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>2487</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—At the instigation of Senator Harradine, we are faced with a recommittal of all three options and a vote on those.

This is not the preferred one, but let us get back to where we were in December last year so that we give an opportunity to all those people who have a real spiritual and cultural connection with their land to be able to approach the registrar.</para></talk.start><para>I want to say a word of commendation for the people who are working hard in our offices. They have been so swift in this situation where the plan was to bring in the Harradine option and leave us to vote on that—take it or leave it—but they have given us back the strong options as well in a matter of minutes. The test here, of course, will come on to Senator Harradine in a little while to see if, with the Labor Party, the Greens and the Democrats, he stands strong on the position that we had in December last year. I am not going to call this an ambush move at the end of the committee, but I am going to say that it was a very fast response from the offices of the Greens and Democrats. It gives us the proper opportunity that we should have to vote on the three amendments.</para><para>Like Senator Woodley and Senator Margetts, I will not be supporting the weak, in the middle option that will be voted on first. We will be standing for the strong options, including the ALP's own option that was adopted by the Senate last year. I do not know why this has come right at the end. Maybe Senator Bolkus gave the hint when he 
 said they have been haunted by the failure to stand on the ground where they stood in December last year. For one thing, I will thank Senator Harradine for giving the opposition and himself the opportunity to be rid of the ghost, to go back to where they were in December last year, to hold their ground and to make sure that the strong amendment here is the one that we adopt.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>00:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>2487</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We have to face the facts here. The position is this: at the time the registration test was being put to the chamber, there was a likelihood—I will put it at that level—that there would be an outcome which would be reasonable, fair, just and honourable. That being so, it was incumbent upon the chamber, I believe, at that stage to look carefully at what the government was proposing in respect of a threshold test which would enable only genuine native title claimants to get registered. It has to be clearly borne in mind that this deals with only one of the tracks that is available in the legislation for the consideration of native title claims. There have been a number of comments made subsequently about that, and I will deal with those in a moment.</para></talk.start><para>Having regard to that, it was, I believe, incumbent on the chamber to examine as it did what was being said in the debate at that time by the government in respect of its own registration test. I am not going to canvass all of those arguments that took place on the last occasion. I do not think that would be proper at this time of the night. The reasons that were advanced by Senator Minchin on behalf of the government and the calls that have been made on a number of us to have a threshold test which would enable the registrar to revisit a number of the claims is believed by every stakeholder, including the indigenous people and the indigenous leadership, to be bogus and almost fraudulent.</para><para>That is what we were faced with, and what we are still faced with. If we are fair dinkum about this situation, that is what we are faced with even now. I have heard what the government has said. It may well be that the Senate on this occasion may adopt an attitude which was different to the last occasion.</para><para>The position was that the government's test was then supported. In my view, it was most inadequate in that it did not cover the stolen generation and those who suffered as a  result of the locked gates policy of certain pastoral leaseholders.</para><para>That view was also taken by the opposition, and the opposition supported the amendment that I put forward. It was at that stage that negotiations were taking place, which unfortunately are no longer taking place. That is a most unfortunate situation. But the Greens and the Democrats voted against my amendment—in other words, they voted against the locked gates and stolen generation persons.</para><para>I suppose one can say that they were not to know what stage the discussions had reached. They were not to know that it was possible to get something out of the situation with which we were faced. But I had to deal with this matter at a level of responsibility knowing what I did at that particular stage. I do not intend to deal with it in any other way—whether I knew or whether I did not know. But that was the situation.</para><para>I moved this amendment so as to cater for those two groups of people and did not agree with the test which the Greens and Democrats were talking about which would not really deal with the problem that was identified by certain of the leaders of the indigenous people as well as by all of the other stakeholders, et cetera. But, even with the support of the opposition, that amendment of mine was defeated and we were left with the threshold test of the government. I appeal to the committee to support this amendment.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>00:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>2488</page.no><name role="metadata">Woodley, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WOODLEY</name><name.id>HX5</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank Senator Harradine for his contribution. I, too, would like a fair, just and honourable outcome from this debate. I would suggest to the Senate that a fair, just and honourable outcome for indigenous people would be to support the position that they themselves have put. Fortunately, because Senator Harradine has recommitted this, we have the opportunity to do that. I am sure that, if Senator Harradine's amendment is not successful, the Labor Party and Senator Harradine will have the opportunity to vote for either—we do not mind which—the 
 Indigenous Working Group's amendment, which we will put, or the Labor Party's amendment. The Labor Party's amendment is not as good as the Indigenous Working Group amendment, but we believe that both of those are a great distance away from either the government's position or Senator Harradine's amendment.</para></talk.start><para>So there will be an opportunity for a fair, just and honourable outcome from this because it has been recommitted and we now have the choice of doing this in the order that it should have been done in fact last time we voted. We will have the opportunity now of voting either for the ALP's amendment or for the indigenous working group amendment if Senator Harradine's amendment is defeated. If the Senate votes for either of those, that certainly will be a fair, just and honourable outcome.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>00:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>2488</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—As I said earlier, this has been a debate which has rolled from one side to another. We have always come to this debate knowing that we had only 28 votes to protect and defend native title interests and to get a balanced outcome and to get certainty. We always had to build on those 28 votes to get to 38. Of course, part of that process has been to try to work out positions that could get support in this place.</para></talk.start><para>As I and Senator Harradine said earlier, there has been an enormous pressure on people in this chamber to try to overcome the prospect of a double dissolution based on race. We do have a responsibility as parliamentarians to ensure that the society that we live in is harmonious in its coexistence with each other. I for one have been able to feel the pressure, indirectly I must say, through a whole host of people who have been to see Senator Harradine. I have been able to feel that pressure reverberating into their offices, their aspirations, and into our offices as well. I have to say that no-one should consistently be subjected to that sort of pressure, as Senator Harradine has.</para><para>In terms of time, this debate gives a new definition to the word `marathon'. When we combine this process this time with the previous debate, we find the parliament has 
 spent some 87 hours and 42 minutes on this native title bill. The committee stage has been some almost 70 hours of that. That is an enormous continuation of pressure. For those who are on the parliamentary committees concerned—two Senate legal and constitutional committees and the Joint Committee on Native Title—it has been the best part of our lives. For Senator Harradine I think it has been as well.</para><para>But, no matter how much people tried to compromise, they were met with a brick wall from the government. Eighty per cent, 85 per cent, 90 per cent of the 10-point plan through this parliament but the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), still barricaded in his bunker, still digs in and says, `I want all. To the rest of you'—stakeholders, indigenous Australians, taxpayers and those who will become the victims of a race debate—`I really don't care because I want my 10-point plan.' How childish. How obdurate.</para><para>At the end of this debate what I think the Senate has to contend with is whether, now that all prospects of compromise are over, it is opportune for us to actually go back and say, `We tried in respect of the registration test—an important sticking point. We tried. But what this Senate has come up with is just not good enough.' You cannot leave this debate with the injustice of the stolen generations being deprived of access to their lands. You cannot leave this debate with people who have been locked out over the decades not having access. It is a sad reflection on this government that no-one expects the government to move in the interest of justice. No-one expects justice from the government; so it is up to us.</para><para>I will seek leave of the Senate to recommit my amendment N36, which was the amendment that was passed by the Senate last year and which provides for the three tests of access in the alternative and provides explicitly for the words of Justice Brennan as one of the three legs. I will seek leave to recommit that particular amendment. Now that all prospects of a compromise with the Prime Minister are out the window, I hope the Senate at least will give a commitment to justice for those who would be unfairly 
 deprived. I hope that, in those circumstances, not only will the Greens and the Democrats support it but also Senator Harradine will find it attractive now. We have tried to compromise. It takes two to tango, and the government has not been with us. In those circumstances, let us not deny access to those who should have a just access to the land.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>00:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>2489</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We have heard two things in the last half hour or so.

For us on this side of the parliament, the conclusion of 
 this debate marks a day of shame. There is no shame to non-government senators and stakeholders who have worked tirelessly and creatively towards an acceptable outcome; no shame to the thousands of Australians who have written, faxed and phoned urging a broadly acceptable solution to the dilemma visited on all of us by the Prime Minister; no shame to ANTA, which has blossomed over recent months, or its constituent groups and bodies; no shame to the indigenous people driven by despair to depart from this place before the conclusion of this debate, but bucketloads of shame to the divisive opportunists who have basically left us standing at the abyss staring at a double dissolution—a future filled with doubt, discord and fear.</para></talk.start><para>This is the debate that we did not need to have this time around. This is a debate that we do not need to continue to have. We could have had some months of experience of an enacted, amended bill by now. We could have had validation. We could have been on the way to sorting out the backlog of claims before the courts and the tribunal. Last December, this Senate sent a clear message to the government. It said that, if we were to get a compromise acceptable to all the players in this debate, then the government had to give some ground on those four key sticking points—the right to negotiate, the registration test, the sunset clause and the application of the Racial Discrimination Act.</para><para>For weeks, days and nights in the lead-up to this debate, all parties were involved in extensive negotiations with the government to try and find a way through. Indeed, up until even a few hours ago, Senator Harradine was trying his utmost to see if there was even the smallest glimmer of compromise on the part of this government on the most fundamental issue in the debate, the right to negotiate. But all efforts have been in vain.</para><para>I think Senator Harradine, like all senators in this place, continued his negotiation in the hope that we were dealing with someone who genuinely wanted to lead this nation towards an accommodation on the contentious issue of native title—a person who, despite the many indications to the contrary that he has given over the last few years, really wants to bring 
 Australians together to resolve our problems. But I think the evidence is that we were wrong. There was no hope. I regret to say I suppose there probably never was—and only for one reason, I must say, unfortunately, because it is only the Prime Minister who wants an early election. He wants to use the wedge politics that got him elected in 1996 to divide and conquer our nation again—Australian against Australian on the docks; Australian against Australian in the courts; Australian against Australian in the bush.</para><para>It was Dennis Shanahan, I think, who recently said that this Prime Minister has ignored the cooler heads in his cabinet. I must say, at the end of 87 hours of debating, arguing or whatever with Senator Minchin, I have come to the conclusion that Senator Minchin himself may well be one of those cooler heads who wants an outcome. Instead, the Prime Minister has turned to his gut instincts that have seen him let Australia down on social issues so many times in the past. 	We do not forget that it was the Prime Minister who was one of the leading opponents of sanctions against South Africa during the 1980s. We do not forget that it was this Prime Minister who spoke against the adoption of the Racial Discrimination Act in 1975. We do not forget that it was this Prime Minister who spoke out against Asian immigration in 1988. We must not forget also that it was this Prime Minister who led a party room revolt against John Hewson's plans to take a constructive approach to the debate on native title in 1993. What we cannot forget is that it was this Prime Minister who failed to stand up to the racist views of Pauline Hanson and who is yet to refuse her preferences.</para><para>We require leadership and we are not getting good leadership. It is not good leadership to take this nation to a deeply divisive double dissolution election based on race, an election which will divide black against white, city against country. It is not good leadership to act out of fear of Pauline Hanson.</para><para>It is interesting that the bushfire has been lit and, we see in the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> poll this morning, the National Party vote in Queensland has gone down some 13 per cent and the One Nation vote stands at 13 per cent. The Nation 
 al Party vote in Queensland has been halved by the bushfire that you have allowed to blow out of control. It is the National Party that could very well be the victims of the bushfire that they fanned.</para><para>Our concern, though, is that Australians will suffer. Farmers will suffer because they will not be given the certainty they deserve and which was theirs for the asking in the proclaimed bill last December. Stakeholders and miners will suffer because their ventures will be held up in the courts for decades to come and ordinary Australians will have to pay the bill. And our nation suffers in other ways. What is important is not what the international community thinks of us, it is how we think of ourselves and how we can live with ourselves.</para><para>I am one of those who thinks that there does not have to be an election based on this Senate amending, in minor part, this Native Title Amendment Bill. The government has got 90 per cent of what it wants. In respect of that, I think the government should now step back from the brink, take the bill, enact the bill, get on with government and let the nation lead a better future. If there is a double dissolution on this bill, there will not be a joint sitting of the parliament until early next year or late this year. You will be denying certainty to farmers, miners and stakeholders for a prolonged period. You could have given them certainty last December. For gross based political purposes you have been denying them that certainty for 12 months.</para><para>When this bill first came to the Senate I reminded the government of their covenant with the nation, the responsibility they took in accepting office, and the terms they inherited from the Keating government to continue to integrate the concept, expression and exercise of native title in the social and legal framework of this nation. That is still their challenge.</para><para>In closing, there are a few people I would like to thank because this has been a marathon effort. There have been some 87 hours of debate in the parliament: 56 or so hours last time and over 30 hours this time. I thank the Senate staff, Rosemary Laing, Kathleen Griffiths and Rosa Ferranda, and all the other 
 staff of the Senate Table Office. I thank my colleagues Kim Beazley, Gareth Evans, Daryl Melham, Stephen Smith and Neil O'Keefe, who form the core group of our native title working group, a group that has worked extremely well together and, contrary to all the expectations and propaganda of the government, has worked cohesively together. It could not have got here without the Whip and the Deputy Whip in this place and the work that they have done.</para><para>In terms of advisers and support staff, I would like to thank Anna George, Sarah Crichton, Julia Clifford, Christine Evans, Chris McGrath, James Cullen and Nina Gerace. Of the other people, and there have been heaps of people who have helped in one way or another, there has been a group of lawyers who do not get paid the amount of money that lawyers working for the top end of Collins Street get paid. Their dedication, their application, their tenacity, their strength and their intelligence cannot be underrated. We have had people like John Basten QC and Ron Castan, Chris Athanisiou and Angus Frith who have made enormous contributions and who have worked extremely well under pressure. These are people who basically give more than they will ever get paid for.</para><para>In the adviser boxes, Simon Banks from my office, James Fitzgerald and Mike Megaw together have been able to plough through the work, put submissions to us and ensure that a constructive alternative has been put to the parliament and to the nation. I thank all of them. In closing I say, once again: step back from the brink, we do not need an election on this issue.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>01:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>2493</page.no><name role="metadata">Woodley, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WOODLEY</name><name.id>HX5</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I, too, want to speak in the third reading debate tonight. A feature of this debate this time has been the changing and changed positions of all parties in this chamber apart from the government, sad to say. Although tonight I was going to be fairly critical of the ALP and Senator Harradine, I think the outcome we achieved in the last hour really makes me not want to do that.</para></talk.start><para>I have to say that we could have avoided some of that pain had we perhaps achieved the outcome that we achieved tonight before 
 we got to the point where we had to recommit a number of votes. The real people who have had to endure our dancing around in terms of amendments and all of the debate that we have had have been the Aboriginal people. I believe that, in terms of the bill which will now go to the House of Representatives in which the government has achieved virtually most of its objectives, it is the Aboriginal people who are the losers.</para><para>The Democrats were certainly heartened to see Senator Harradine reject the unfair six-year sunset clause and also to vote on the very recent recommitted amendment of the Labor Party, because we believe that that is the best option in terms of the threshold test. I have to say that I think all of us were chastened today when we saw the indigenous people leave this parliament in tears. They were in tears because they knew that they were not going to get a fair and just outcome. They knew that, despite all of their efforts, the intransigence of the government would result in a bad outcome for Aboriginal people, and they were right. We know that they are in a state of deep grief tonight. They have been on my phone in tears, trying somehow or other at this late stage to get a better outcome. Our hearts are with them.</para><para>It makes the Democrats very sad that it had to come to this before we would pay attention to the fact that the people most affected are those who, in the end, were not only the original owners of this land but the nurturers and keepers also of a land to which we came very late. But they kept it for us and they would like to make a contribution to the future of Australia, a contribution which is unique and valuable and precious which they alone can make. If we continue to shut the door against that contribution, then we will never be the nation that I am sure we all want to be.</para><para>At the beginning of the debate, we said that we would keep faith with the High Court's decision on Wik. We accepted that the 1993 legislation had some problems and needed some fixing to make it more workable, less vulnerable to ambit claims and fairer all around. But we said that we would not support extinguishment of native title rights 
 which may co-exist with pastoralist rights on leasehold land. We have maintained this position right up to this moment.</para><para>Throughout the process we have sought to represent the interests of the National Indigenous Working Group; a group established to negotiate their rights. But it takes at least two parties to negotiate and the government has not had a bar of it. I consider it a privilege to have been able to facilitate, to the extent that we are able, the indigenous position. It has for me been the most memorable—and in some ways sad in terms of outcome—experience of my parliamentary career.</para><para>On behalf of the NIWG, the Democrats co-sponsored—with Senator Margetts and the Greens—the working group's position in total. We did it in December last year and we would not flinch from doing it again. So it is in accordance with the wishes of indigenous people and in accordance with our sense of fairness, justice and humanity that the Australian Democrats will oppose the  Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 [No. 2] , as indeed we did in 1997.</para><para>In doing so, we send a clear message to Prime Minister John Howard and his coalition government. The message is this: as the trustees of the integrity of this nation, you have failed to serve all of your people; as the custodians of reconciliation, you have abrogated your responsibilities; and as the leadership of this nation, you have failed in your office. Justice has not been done with this legislation. It does contain Tim Fischer's bucket loads of extinguishment, to which we should now read `bucket loads of dispossession'.</para><para>We approached this bill, as we did in 1997, with an aim to make good the government's legislation, but the government has not shared that goal. The government has not approached this debate in good faith, I believe. It is unfortunate that, in the government's quest for a double dissolution, it is comfortable in the use of indigenous people as an electoral football.</para><para>For me the most telling part of this debate was when I asked Senator Minchin what the cost was to indigenous people of cultural decimation, the stolen generations and, in 
 deed, the cost of genocide. He did not have an answer. He has not been silent, however, on the alleged cost to industry of native title. That is the problem.	Today indigenous people walked out of this parliament, their eyes filled with tears and their hearts heavy with sadness. I share their sadness and I am not ashamed to say that I shed a tear with them.</para><para>Out of this debate one thing has been certain—that is, while the government have been successful in breaking the hearts of our indigenous brothers and sisters, they will never break their spirit. They are survivors in this land and long after we have gone their descendants will endure.</para><para>Politics has taken precedence over principle in this debate and that is sad. But ultimately the path to coexistence and reconciliation is on the ground with ordinary people working things out face to face. That process will continue, regardless of the laws made in this place and all the divisive rhetoric from the government. The Democrats will not be party to helping the government cynically manipulate this legislation for electoral purposes and that is why we reject the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 [No. 2] .</para><para>In closing I, too, thank all of the National Indigenous Working Group, but especially the person appointed to liaise with the Democrats, Aden Ridgeway, and all of the parliamentary staff—the greatest bunch of civil servants I have ever come across. They are wonderful people. I also want to thank the team which worked closely with me—Jonathan Tonge, John Davey, Susan Brown, Jim Downey and Vivienne Wynter—all of my colleagues who have stood with me in this debate and, of course, all Democrat staffers.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>01:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>2494</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is probably appropriate in my third reading contribution that I read out the words of the statement made today by Gatjil Djerrkura and Geoff Clark from ATSIC on the process.</para></talk.start><para>In a press release dated today and headed `Political process fails indigenous people', they say:</para><para>The native title legislation before the Senate is unacceptable to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and should be voted down.</para><para>We agree the National Indigenous Working Group on Native Title has done its best to communicate its concerns to Parliamentarians but can do no more.</para><para>The legislative package is unfair, unjust and discriminatory. As such it is setting the foundations for long-term and bitter division in the Australian community. Given the course of the debate so far, any compromise reached in the Senate today is certain to fall far short of the expectations of indigenous Australians.</para><para>The government has been single-minded in its determination to reverse the success indigenous people have achieved in the highest court in the land. Even when succeeding with most of its legislation, the government has come back to continue the job of destroying the prospects for exercising our rights.</para><para>We face considerable extinguishment of our native title property rights in a way that goes far beyond the common law.</para><para>Miners have been rewarded because the states that ignored the federal law have been allowed to validate mining titles issued without regard for the Native Title Act.</para><para>Pastoralists have been rewarded with the potential for a wide range of diversification despite the terms of their leases. The implications of this go beyond the concerns of indigenous people.</para><para>Let there be no doubt that the legislation as it stands will serve neither the interests of future generations of indigenous Australians nor non-indigenous Australians.</para><para>It seems we can have no faith in the government to protect our existing rights but we will continue to resist this legislation by all the legal means possible.</para><para>It became quite clear during the course of the last few weeks, but especially today, that there could be nothing but a shameful outcome to this debate. There is the chance for the Senate to still do something for the indigenous people of Australia, and that is to vote in such a way as to indicate they have listened to the call—the call made here by the National Indigenous Working Group and the call that I know many senators have heard from a wide variety of sources to vote down this bill.</para><para>People are watching not just to see the outcome of what the government will or will not do with its bill, and that is quite clear, 
 they also want to see what the intentions are of any alternative government in relation to this bill. That is why I implore, urge, beg the ALP to do the right thing now and state by your vote what you would do when you are next in government. Voting for this bill continues the shame.</para><para>I want to express my personal thanks to Matthew Fagan for his tireless work, to Alan Carter for keeping things together, to Gary Coor for keeping us sane and providing legal advice, to the National Indigenous Working Group for their amazing work, to my colleague Senator Bob Brown, to Margaret and Ben and the rest of our staff, and to Rosemary Laing and the Senate clerks.</para><para>I would also like to give a special thanks to Senator John Woodley and John Davies of the Democrats for their working with us so helpfully and closely to get a result which we believed would be much, much closer to justice than has been achieved tonight. I thank all those people who, when the times were tough, managed to get through letters, phone calls and faxes of support. As I say, the only potential for not bringing total shame may be that the Senate provides the message to the government and the community that this bill is unacceptable.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>01:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>2495</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I wish simply to commend this bill to the House of Representatives, to the Prime Minister, to the government and to the Australian people. I will be voting for the third reading. I believe that that is the responsible thing to do, because I have a firm view that this bill should become the law of the land in the spirit of recognition and reconciliation. It has provisions better than the bill that was presented to the Senate. It is a better bill for achieving a fair, decent, just and honourable outcome for all affected by the native title issue.</para></talk.start><para>This bill is based on certain fundamental principles. First, common law native title rights, as recognised by the historic Mabo decision, are preserved. They have not been further eroded, reduced or rendered valueless. I believe that that is the objective of all who have participated in the debate on this issue in this chamber: it may be their desire but, 
 unfortunately, the acts do not meet with their desire. But the bill does not further erode, reduce or render valueless those native title rights. Second, there is a framework for government, corporations and individuals to take into consideration those native title rights and interests when their activities may seem to be affected or reduced by them. Third, there is a recognition that the system for the recognition and determination of native title rights and interests must be workable and fair to all involved. Fourth, recognised weaknesses and shortcomings in Australia's native title law are reduced or eliminated by this bill.</para><para>With this bill the Senate has, I believe, achieved such an outcome. There have been many individuals and sources who have contributed to this result. Of the government's 90 amendments, I have supported probably 90 to 95 per cent of them. Other successful amendments were proposed by other parties within this chamber and by me. There is, in this bill, I believe, a just balance for both indigenous and non-indigenous Australians. This bill preserves the common law native title rights of indigenous Australians and, unlike the unamended bill from the House of Representatives, does not seek to bring about extinguishment of those interests when such interests have not been extinguished at common law.</para><para>The bill preserves the right to negotiate for registered native title claimants and does not restrict or diminish the areas in which this important entitlement applies. It is one of the guarantees which this parliament has given to our indigenous people to preserve and enhance their common law native title rights and interests. The government's proposals, I suggest, would have seriously reduced those rights, with no compensating benefits to indigenous Australians. New procedures, including significant involvement of state based systems, for the determination of native title are features of this bill. These are new and relatively uncharted waters, and I would have thought that the response by the states would have been more encouraging than it was late this afternoon.</para><para>The rights of indigenous people and their native title interests are further protected by 
 the new provisions in this bill on the relationship between the Racial Discrimination Act and the Native Title Act. Where any of the terms of the act or acts based upon such terms are ambiguous in their meaning and in their effect, such ambiguities are to be resolved consistent with the RDA. This is an important protection for indigenous interests. </para><para>A principal feature of this bill is the recast applications and registration procedure for native title claims. The bill introduces a claims procedure which should ensure that genuine native title claimants will have their claims registered. These claims will clearly set out the facts upon which the claimants rely for a community claim authorised by that community. The application to the land and other interests flows from their traditional laws and customs, observed by them as practicable. In this way, the claimants establish their descent and connection with the particular area where their forebears lived in 1788. The claims procedures have made provision for recognising the tragic history of families who have become part of the stolen generation or who, in respect of their traditional lands, were excluded by land-holders—the locked gates phenomenon. The claims process provides that the claimants will usually be certified by their regional or state representative body who is charged with the task of supporting claims on behalf of the true native title holders in a given area.</para><para>The draconian requirement that the claimants must establish to the satisfaction of the registrar all the native title rights and interests set out in their applications or suffer loss of their whole claim has been reversed. Claimants must now be registered in respect of all rights and interests for which they have facts and circumstances in support to the satisfaction of the registrar. This is the registration process for the right to negotiate and is built upon a new claims procedure through filing in the Federal Court for native title claims which might not meet the registration test or do not seek the right to negotiate. This is a revised system reflecting three years of experience and has a wide consensus of support among the stakeholders, state governments and indigenous communities. If the 
 government accepts the bill in the House of Representatives, this system should now bring virtually to an end the troubled episode of paper claims, widespread overlapping claims and other anomalies which have caused anger and frustration among both indigenous and non-indigenous Australians.</para><para>With the new threshold test which applies to claims filed since 27 June 1996, there is now the real prospect of a new start and the emergence of fewer but better researched and better based claims by genuine descendants of indigenous peoples who occupied various areas of Australia in 1778. I believe there are few non-indigenous stakeholders who are not now prepared to deal with genuine claimants with proper evidence of connection, descent and observance of traditional laws. Native title may finally begin to find its real place and level amongst the existing entitlements and the future development of our indigenous peoples. It is not a panacea for all ills suffered by our indigenous peoples, of course. It is truly regrettable that unrealistic hopes have been built around common law native title.</para><para>The new threshold and registration test is very important in this legislation—even the one that was adopted in the last hour. It may represent a unique opportunity for the parliament to re-establish a viable native title claims process. If we get the threshold test right, I believe the government, the state governments, pastoralists, miners and the indigenous communities will be the strongest supporters. There will be no satisfactory alternatives on the issues that I have mentioned if this bill does not become law. I seek leave to have the remainder of my speech incorporated into <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>.</para><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The speech read as follows</inline>—</para><para>To the major stakeholders other than the indigenous, I simply say this: Native Title claims will be more transparent, more detailed and better handled in contrast to previous experience. This system can work and should be made a focus of cooperation and involvement by both pastoralists and miners.</para><para>Finally, I say to the Government that in this Bill more than 80 per cent of its proposals have been adopted. It is a more balanced and just bill than the Government's initial proposal. The last three months have seen the Government extensively 
 amend the Bill after wide consultation. These amendments have been adopted, overwhelmingly.</para><para>There is no justification for the Government not to sign this Bill or even to contemplate sending the country to an election. It would be both unwarranted and unconscionable. It would also be completely worthless as a solution in the near future of the outstanding issues.</para><para>I do not believe that even in a worst case situation of a double dissolution there will be any speedy resolution to validation or to the claims process or to the other weaknesses in this legislation.</para><para>Any election on this Bill would mean the Government allowed political ideology to triumph over the national good and national reconciliation. It is a fearful prospect.</para><para>Australians both indigenous and non-indigenous deserve better.</para><para>This Bill may not be perfect. Little that this Parliament does ever achieves that standard. But this Bill is better than the Government's Bill and represents a significant improvement on the existing Native Title legislation.</para><para>All Australians, indigenous and non-indigenous are significantly advantaged. These advantages should be grasped immediately. This Bill should be voted into law by the Government in the House of Representatives .</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>01:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>2497</page.no><name role="metadata">Boswell, Sen Ronald</name><name role="display">Senator BOSWELL</name><name.id>YE4</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Firstly, let me put something to rest. The bill, as amended, does not deliver 90 per cent of what the government wanted. In fact, only two points of the 10-point plan remain substantially intact as a result of the Senate's deliberations. That is 80 per cent gone, not 80 per cent won. None of the four sticking points—the RDA, right to negotiate, threshold test and sunset clause—have gone through. Only validation and water management survive intact. The rest have all been amended in opposition to the government, some more than others.</para></talk.start><para>We can go through them point by point. One, validation: we will give that a tick, that remains satisfactory. Two, confirmation of extinguishment: that is not delivered because of the introduction of the concept of revival of native title interest. Three, provision of government services: not delivered and the situation is potentially worse than it is at present. Four, primary production: that has not been fully delivered because of the restrictions on diversification and off-farm activities.</para><para>Statutory access has not been delivered in its original form. The right to negotiate has been confirmed on pastoral leases. The proposed alternative state provisions have been rejected. There is no exemption for infrastructure. Renewal exemptions are heavily qualified. We are now up to point seven, future commercial and government development. This has not been delivered specifically on towns and cities and government infrastructure. Water we can give a tick to. Out of the whole 10-point plan, that is the second and last tick to get through.</para><para>The management of claims has not been delivered with the recent change tonight to the higher threshold test. The sunset clause went down. On agreements, the government opposed several amendments put by the opposition. On top of that there is the eleventh point, the RDA, which goes to the overall workability of the Native Title Act and seriously undermines it. So let us have no more about how much of the government's legislation has gone through, because so much of it has not.</para><para>I would like to now address the issue of a double dissolution. Just a couple of days ago we had the Deputy Opposition Leader, the former foreign affairs minister, Gareth Evans, make an offensive and extraordinary remark. He accused the Prime Minister of never being so happy as when he is bashing black fellas. This is a former minister of the Crown of the Commonwealth parliament, a QC and a person who entertained ambitions of leading the United Nations. If such a person finds the normal cut and thrust of politics too much, how will candidates new to politics in the heat of an election debate, with native title the big issue, be able to keep from making unhelpful comments? It is tempting to think that all debate in the public arena will be conducted as if it were in this chamber tonight during the committee stage. That debate was mostly restrained, careful and backed up by professional advice on complex issues. But come an election, the committee of the Senate will not be in charge.</para><para>So far throughout this debate the Greens and the Democrats have dominated the floor. This has resulted in a very uneven and unbal 
 anced debate. There are hundreds of thousands of Australians who have entirely different views. What we have heard over the past fortnight is generally the narrow left wing view that is shared by a minority of Australian people. Those are the hard political facts which were borne out recently by research into the opinions on native title around the country. If this were not true, then Senator Brown would be the Prime Minister and Senator Margetts would be the Treasurer. But for all their monopoly of the debate, they are way off the mark. The debate and a double dissolution will be out of their hands and run away to who knows where.</para><para>This has been a most frustrating debate for me and my constituents—the families of the bush, black and white, and the workers, black and white, who depend on our great rural and mining industries. Let there be no doubt that Labor has spearheaded the defeat of an acceptable regime for native title. Labor has given way to its left wing. The left wing has hijacked the debate. Labor has let down the blue-collar workers in their hundreds of thousands who work in agriculture and mining and whose families form the core of regional communities. Labor has put the ribbon wearers in front of the workers in mills, abattoirs, sugar mills, food processing factories and mines—the support services and their employees.</para><para>Labor has forgotten the true believers. Labor has abandoned black and white in regional Australia. Labor has said to them, `We don't need you. We don't want your families to have a secure financial future and jobs for your kids. We would rather see the $30 billion go offshore instead of into mining ventures.' Labor is saying, `We would rather see delay after delay, court hearing after court hearing, than see families get a break.'</para><para>We have heard about the tears of Aboriginal people tonight, but I want to tell you that I have seen other tears—tears of frustration in farming families trying to get their message across in this hostile environment here in Canberra. The debate in the Senate has been monopolised by the Greens. I believe that black and white families stand to gain more from a properly performing primary sector 
 which recognises the common law right of native title while settling appropriate parameters on the statutory right to negotiate. I believe the $30 billion forgone this decade in mining projects is a tragic waste of potential for black and white families.</para><para>I believe the government's proposal is the way forward for all Australians. That is the inclusive way. A double dissolution is the divisive way and the only democratic option left if this bill is amended beyond the capacity of a duly elected government. I ask the Senate to reconsider its position.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>01:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>2499</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I cannot support or commend this bill and certainly will not be—</para></talk.start><para><inline font-style="italic">Senator Boswell interjecting</inline>—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—Order!

They got what they expected because there was such consistency in the stand that we took in this legislative debate. I want to, at the outset, thank Margaret Blakers and Ben Oquist on my staff and the staff of all of those in the Democrats and Greens corner of this chamber. I also want to thank my fellow Green member, Dee Margetts, who has been such a remarkably good advocate for returning fairness to this legislation, and Senator John Woodley, who has also brought a great deal of the honour to this debate that Senator Harradine spoke about.</para></talk.start></continue><para> Why we will not be voting for this and why I suspect the Labor Party will not vote for it either is because, as Senator Bolkus has said, this amended bill gives the government 90 per cent of what it wants. Senator Harradine said it is 95 per cent of what it wants. Whichever way you look at it, that 
 sums it up. That means the indigenous people get 10 per cent of what they want or five per cent of what they want. You can take it variously.</para><para> Let me quickly reiterate what is lost as far as they are concerned—that is, their right to negotiate on the future of their lands and their lives in almost all respects into the future, the exception being mining, with some restrictions put on that. We recognise their claim after so long a period of suppression to their land but then deny them any say `in the future'. No wonder the National Indigenous Working Group, with tears, as has been commented on today, has finally turned their backs on this parliament, that they should have expected a better outcome from, and walked out today.</para><para> Let me repeat what they said. They described this bill, this Howard government 10-point plan, as an immoral and indecent proposal by the government which takes away fundamental rights of indigenous Australians. Whichever way you look at it, what we have ended up with in the Senate tonight is an immoral and indecent proposal by the government which takes away 90 per cent of the fundamental rights of indigenous Australians by the descriptions of others in this place. Moreover, the Indigenous Working Group says that this bill will be challenged every step of the way. They then made a call to the people of Australia to stand strong with them.</para><para> I want to quote the Prime Minister of this country when he delivered a personal apology to the indigenous people at the Aboriginal reconciliation convention in Melbourne in May this year. He said:</para><para>Personally, I feel deep sorrow for those of my fellow Australians who suffered injustices under the practices of past generations towards indigenous people. Equally, I am sorry for the hurt and trauma many people here today may continue to feel as a consequence of those practices.</para><para>. . .              . . .             . . .</para><para>Australians of this generation should not be required to accept guilt and blame for past actions and policies over which they had no control.</para><para>The problem is that there is grand theft of indigenous rights built into this legislation as amended, let alone the original proposition 
 that came into this place. There is the theft of those rights.</para><para>The Prime Minister has to accept guilt and blame for not only that larceny of indigenous people's rights but also the consequences which this country as a whole will have to bear as a result of that theft as we go into the next century. The indigenous people cannot be expected to simply give, give and give, while their aspirations for the future are taken from them. The point has come where I expect you can hear the signs, in the anger of some of the submissions we have had put to us in the last two weeks, that there will be a rebellion against this continued threat.</para><para>I finish with this. There was the stealing of the lands and the horrible history that we all have to live with following 1770 and 1788. There has been the disaster of the stolen generation. Here tonight, the Senate and this parliament, whether you look at the amended bill or the original one that came in here, is being asked to give its approval to the stealing of rights from the indigenous people of this country. Is there anybody who is going to be party to that theft who is going to say, `And they should cop it'? Is there anybody who really says, `We cannot understand that the indigenous people should be not satisfied with this taking away of their rights and that there should be no reaction into the future and that reaction is not going to affect all Australians'? It is going to be to the detriment of all Australians, and I feel ashamed that we could not get a better outcome from the rows of thinking, representative Australians that we have in this place. I will feel more ashamed if it is just left to the Democrats and the Greens to be here to vote against this piece of legislation. One of the problems is that the indigenous people have essentially had to put up with the frustration of not being able to take part in this debate and have had to contend with trying to lobby as best they could, take second best and then take the consequences without having a real say.</para><para>Finally, the working group has called on supporters in their press release today to ensure the 10-point plan is thrown out and to work closely with indigenous Australians to achieve this. I endorse that call. We Greens— 
and I am sure it is the same for the Democrats—will be endorsing that call if we do get an election, and it appears obvious that that is what is going to happen as a result of this legislation. There will be a great challenge on every thinking Australian to search their heart as to whether they want to be part of the theft that is involved in this legislation too. This is a matter for changing votes. This is a matter for people reconciling themselves to history and making sure they do not compound it into the future. The challenge is to hear what the indigenous people are saying and to stand shoulder to shoulder with them, no matter how turbulent the coming months are, to ensure that they get a better deal in the coming century.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>01:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>2500</page.no><name role="metadata">Minchin, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator MINCHIN</name><name.id>JX4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State;Minister Assisting the Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I conclude this third reading debate by saying that I personally am very disappointed by the outcome of now, I think, 87 hours of debate on this bill. The government has approached the period since December in good faith, has sought to consult, discuss and thrash around all the issues involved among the parties involved in this debate to see if there was any way in which we could resolve our differences and get a bill that was acceptable to the Senate within the framework of government policy. And in that vein we moved 99 government amendments to this bill in the course of this debate which were all in that spirit—designed to address concerns raised by the other parties in the original bill back in November-December. But, regrettably, another 100-odd anti-government non-government amendments to the bill have also been accepted by the Senate and we are not able to accept them.</para></talk.start><para>Our approach to this whole issue has been to try in a practical way to identify the real problems with the Native Title Act, to fix those problems after four years experience of that act and, most particularly, to incorporate the consequences of the Wik decision, which were manifest and quite significant, into the Native Title Act.</para><para>You have to keep remembering that the Native Title Act, for all the goodwill with 
 which it was passed, is not working for the benefit of Aboriginal Australians. We still only have two determinations of native title after four and a bit years of operation of that act, one of which resulted in the extinguishment of that native title. The other one is the result of an agreement by, of all people, the Queensland government for the exercise of native title rights on DOGIT land in Queensland. So it is a very bad outcome for Aboriginal people from the operation of the Native Title Act, which manifestly does not work. We have tried to fix it. From my point of view, we have spent two years now developing a package of amendments to this bill, and I am particularly frustrated that we still have not yet seen any amendments to the act.</para><para>Tonight the Senate has finally passed amendments to the act which are unacceptable again in four out of four of the key areas. For a while, we had two out of four, but that was before lunch. After lunch we lost one of them, and after dinner we lost another one. So we are back down to zero out of four from our point of view. They really are fundamental. It is not fair or accurate to say that we got 90 per cent of it and we should take it. If you get the building built, but the lifts do not work, the building is no use to you. Frankly, we have got a building where the lifts and the lights do not work.</para><para>Apart from the four key areas, there are also a range of amendments in other areas that we have not identified publicly but which cause significant concern and hardship to rural and regional Australia. Indeed, it would appear that the bill is actually worse than it was last December.</para><para>I would reiterate that, from our point of view, this bill always was a compromise. We had a lot of differences in our own ranks. We worked them through. We came up with a bill which everyone in the coalition could live with. It did not give any particular interest group in the community all that it demanded of us—not the Indigenous Working Group, not the mining industry, not the farming industry. We approached this from the point of view of our national responsibilities to produce legislation in the national interest 
 which did not give any interest group what it sought from us.</para><para>But the bill does fundamentally accept the Mabo and Wik decisions. It does seek in a fair and practical way to build those decisions into Australia's land management system. This is a difficult concept for all Australians—a common law, inalienable property right only available to people of a particular race. That is not an easy thing to build into 200 years of settled statutory law. We have tried hard, and we think that what we produced is fair and equitable. All the way through we have had as our criteria fairness, equity, practicality and certainty. We wanted a workable outcome. We have not got it. The Senate has passed amendments that do make the bill, in our view, unworkable.</para><para>I simply finish by thanking all those senators who have spent some 87 hours in here together debating this bill. I think it was debated in general terms in a spirit of goodwill and generosity, apart from a few differences that seemed to occur from time to time on that side of the chamber, which we watched with amusement. But I do think we have, as senators, established once again that the Senate is a chamber in which these very serious national issues can be debated fairly and sensibly, and without the rancour which often distracts those in the other chamber.</para><para>I particularly thank the Wik task force on my left who have worked long and hard to try to produce a sensible outcome. I think everybody on both sides respect their work. I want to thank my own personal staff, particularly Senate officials, for what they have done. I conclude by wishing everybody a very happy Easter.</para><para>	 Question put:</para><para>	 That the bill be now read a third time.</para></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>02:10:00</time.stamp><para>The Senate divided.	</para></division.header><para></para><division.data><ayes><num.votes>0</num.votes><title>AYES</title><names><name>Abetz, E. </name><name>Alston, R.

Despite the late hour, I felt the significance of recent journalistic events must be placed on the public record.

These comments are attributed to Bishop Chris Saunders. Bishop Saunders came to me last Friday, distressed by the article's untruths. To correct the public record, Bishop Saunders wrote to the editor of the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> on 5 April. He sought to disassociate himself from the headline and from some of the remarks attributed to him in the article, stating clearly that he did not say that Catholic priests would tell people to vote against the government.</para><para>It is obvious from his letter that the journalist deliberately attempted to position the Catholic church in a party political manner to incite the racial debate in line with comments by Gareth Evans reported in the same article. The <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> contacted Bishop Saunders and told him they would not print the letter unless it was revised. Bishop Saunders sent a revised letter dated 7 April 1998. On 7 April, Antony Lawes of the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> provided a letter to Bishop Saunders dated 5 April which he said the paper would be happy to publish. It was another blatant attempt by the paper to protect their own and position the Catholic church for the pending campaign. Bishop Saunders responded to Mr Lawes in a fax dated 7 April. He wrote:</para><para>I am in receipt of your proposed revision of my letter to the Editor. I am not satisfied that your proposed revision adequately communicates my dissatisfaction with the headline `Priests attack Libs in Race Poll' and some aspects of the article which followed.</para><para>In good faith I have already revised the letter once so as to emphasise the headline and not the report. However, the opening remarks attributed to me in the article are also of some concern for me as they are misleading, especially when placed in the context of the above headline.</para><para>I was at pains in my interview to be non-party political and I am much concerned that extremism and moral misconduct, during a race poll, is a distinctly dangerous possibility at the hands of any politician of any political persuasion.

Over the last two years I have had the opportunity to track this program and explore the role of OGIT and the Department of Finance and Administration in the process. As a result, there are a number of issues that are of great concern, largely going to issues of probity and the degree of public accountability attributed to some decisions regarding contracts let as part of or associated with the IT outsourcing program.</para></talk.start><para>There are several areas of concern. The first relates to how this government managed to completely compromise a model of selective sourcing that utilised the in-house strengths and still capitalised on the innovation our private sector has to offer. They have departed from the principles of competitive tendering and contracting out established by the Industry Commission report by excluding the opportunity for existing in-house services to benchmark their costs and subsequently 
 compete for the work. The whole approach won the support of only the Department of Finance and the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet in the original cabinet submission upon which the government justified the decision to outsource in this way. All other agencies voiced a plethora of concerns.</para><para>The second area of concern was the appalling disregard for the established competitive tendering process witnessed with the piggybacking of the Department of Finance contract on a pre-existing contract between IBM and the Department of Veterans' Affairs. There is no paper trail with the negotiations surrounding this deal. It was done over the phone—a practice that has since become established in the Department of Finance.</para><para>It is an interesting point that the agency heads involved in this deal were not prepared to sign off on it, although technically they could under the procurement guidelines—albeit they did, in my view, breach those procurement guidelines by bypassing the competitive tendering process. Ultimately, it was referred to the minister for signature. This contractual windfall for IBM was further expanded without competitive tendering processes being adhered to when DAS was abolished and the remaining sections integrated into the Department of Finance, subsequently called the Department of Finance and Administration.</para><para>An interesting point is that during this process issues of probity were raised consistently given that IBM indeed had a contract with the Department of Finance at the time relating to the outsourcing work that was being done by that department. The probity auditor subsequently appointed by the department to address concerns, Mr Stephen Marks, was appointed following a direct solicitation by Gillian Marks via a phone call after competitive tenders for this contract had all been rejected.</para><para>Another area of grave concern was the negative impact on Australian businesses. The government, in their laziness, opted for huge multi-agency outsourcing contracts that are only accessible by the big six IT corporations, permanently relegating Australian IT firms to 
 subcontract status. This lazy policy has angered our innovative Australian IT sector. Sadly, we have already experienced the downside of this model with Select, a local IT company, coming out worse off in a tussle with EDS. EDS recently won the Customs IT outsourcing contract, and Select, although they successfully positioned themselves early in what was proclaimed by Minister Fahey to be the shining example of a successful partnership between local and multinational, as I said, came off worse.</para><para>Minister Fahey went on to make hay with his industry development clause in the cluster 3 contract which, interestingly, attracted criticism from both the small and large players at the time. Again, this was lazy policy, but I will return to that industry development clause shortly.</para><para>Upon the awarding of the first contract under the program nine months after schedule, again the minister spoke patronisingly of a role eked out for local companies, and he revelled in the scope of industry development requirements that he claimed would be enforced under the terms of the contract. However, there is no scope to scrutinise the adherence to the industry development obligations provided for in this contract. The industry is forced to rely on the minister's word for it, and credibility is something that Minister Fahey does not have. Unless this information is available to be scrutinised publicly, it remains a farce, and all that puff and bluster about penalties means nothing when it comes from Minister Fahey.</para><para>The whole industry knows how obtuse he is. The whole industry knows that a minister who forces a formal, legally enforceable gag upon any interested party, including their spouses, has something to hide. Indeed, this is precisely what happened with respect to this government's IT outsourcing contracts. No-one is allowed to participate or to involve themselves either from a department point of view, as employees of the Public Service, or indeed as private sector parties expressing an interest, unless they sign this confidentiality deed.</para><para>I would now like to turn to what Minister Fahey, his office, and formerly OGIT, now 
 the Office of Asset Sales and IT Outsourcing, I believe have to hide. There has been a series of contracts entered into by the Department of Finance and Administration that raise serious questions of probity. The pre-existing relationships of the beneficiaries of these contracts are also of great interest.</para><para>Shaw Pittman Potts and Trowbridge, a US based legal firm, were engaged by OGIT on the instruction of Greg Barns, an adviser in Minister Fahey's office. Yasmin King, operating under the company name of Flexible Resources, was also engaged by OGIT in the same way. Both Shaw Pittman and Yasmin King provided advice to the former Premier of South Australia, Dean Brown, with respect to the South Australian whole of government IT outsourcing contract with EDS.</para><para>Although it was the former chief of OGIT, Andy McDonald, who entered into these contracts, it was apparently done with the explicit intervention of John Fahey's office. Dr McDonald's subsequent resignation has been shamelessly used by departmental officials—presumably at the behest of the minister's office—to deflect responsibility for these decisions, as was witnessed in the most recent round of Senate estimates.</para><para>I have previously reflected harshly upon the motivation of Dr McDonald's sudden resignation, but these issues cause me to reflect now upon his position as agency chief, having to acquiesce to the demands of the minister. I guess it is not so surprising that he pulled the pin.</para><para>With respect to Ms King's contract, worth $320,000, she was required to advise on industry development guidelines. She is quoted in the Adelaide <inline font-style="italic">Advertiser</inline> as saying, `I have a unique set of experiences and they saw some benefit in using them.' Shaw Pittman Potts and Trowbridge were also contracted to advise on industry development. Their contract is worth around $5 million but, as yet, remains ambiguous because it is set in US dollars and the final amount will relate to the exchange rate. A quite extraordinary fact relating to the Shaw Pittman contract is that estimates evidence shows that this multimillion dollar contract is only for three people 
 over a period of 12 months in that particular office.</para><para>Cutler and Co. was contracted to provide advice on industry development to the value of $70,000 and Gillian Marks has responsibility for industry development. There is another interesting link with Gillian Marks, which was also apparently involved in the provision of advice to the former Premier of South Australia, Dean Brown, on both the Adelaide Water and the EDS contracts. At the same time as all this advice was flowing to the government on industry development requirements, it is apparent that the Department of Industry, Science and Tourism drafted the industry development clause that ended up in the cluster 3 contract.</para><para>What is the net result of this? We have over $5 million being spent or allocated by the Office of Government and Information Technology, now the Office of Asset Sales and Information Technology Outsourcing, for the explicit purpose of industry development. None of these contracts was subject to competitive tender. The question has to be asked: who are these people working for? It is quite clear that the outcomes of the industry development clause that ended up in cluster 3 do not serve the interests of Australian industry. We heard evidence before the Senate inquiry into IT outsourcing, which has already reported to this place, that there is a great deal of dissatisfaction, frustration and anger amongst Australian IT companies. What next for Minister Fahey? What is the next step for the government's IT outsourcing program? <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><adjournment><adjournmentinfo><time.stamp>02:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>2506</page.no></adjournmentinfo><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senate adjourned at 2.26 a.m. until 2.00 p.m. on Tuesday, 12 May 1998, in accordance with the resolution agreed to this day.</inline></para></adjournment><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>2506</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tabling</title><page.no>2506</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following government documents were tabled:</para><para>Australasian Police Ministers' Council—Administration and activities of the National Common Police Services—Report for 1996-97.

The Refugees Convention is given legislative force in Australian law through the provisions of the 1958 Migration Act. 
</para><para>Under the Refugees Convention, a person should not be afforded international protection if they have effective protection from a country of their nationality (that is, a country other than that from which they fear persecution). You would be aware that in its decision on 2 May 1997, the Full Bench of the Federal Court decided on the nationality of East Timorese asylum seekers (the Jong case). The court found no legal error was made by the RRT in the determination that certain East Timorese people (including Mr Jong, the applicant in the matter) are Portuguese nationals. The question in that case, however, related to the effectiveness of Portuguese protection.

Such individuals had to have had close family links to Australia. This SAC is being closed because of changed circumstances in the USSR.</para><para>If a person of the Jewish faith living outside Israel makes an application for a protection visa, and it appears that this asylum seeker has effective Israeli nationality according to Israeli nationality laws, then that fact would be investigated and that person may not engage Australia's protection obligations.</para><para>With regard to the Portuguese citizenship rights of certain East Timorese, the Portuguese Government has made it clear that Portuguese nationals of East Timorese ethnicity have all the consequent rights and obligations of any other Portuguese citizen.

While every effort is made to keep formalities to a minimum, there are certain legal requirements that must be met by all applicants for a visitor visa to avoid abuses of the visitor program. Particular abuses, which have been of concern to successive Governments for the past 20 years, are visitors working unlawfully or overstaying their authorised period of stay. The legal criteria for the grant of a visitor visa require, amongst other things, that the applicant has adequate funds for their support for the period of the visit and that they intend a genuine visit to Australia. These criteria are the same regardless of the nationality of the applicant, or the part of the world where the application is lodged.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>National Landcare Program</title><page.no>2510</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 1095)</subtitle><id.no>1095</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>2510</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'Brien</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, upon notice, on 12 March 1997:</para></talk.start><para>With reference to a grant under the National Landcare Program in the name of the Boorowa Community Landcare Group for a demonstration site on the property of Mr David Marsh:</para><para>(1) Did the application for the grant include a commitment to the provision of fencing of wood lots.</para><para></para><para>(2) Was funding for the provision of fencing included in the grant for the project; if so, what was the level of funding provided for that purpose.</para><para>(3) Did the planned erection of the fencing not proceed because it was considered to be not economically viable; if so; was the funding provided for that purpose returned to the Department; if not, why not.</para><para>(4) (a) What action did the department take to recover the funds; and (b) from whom.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>2510</page.no><name role="metadata">Parer, Sen Warwick</name><name role="display">Senator Parer</name><name.id>KI4</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Resources and Energy</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answers to the honourable senator's questions:</para></talk.start><para>(1) The Boorowa Community Landcare Group (BCLG) applied for and received a National Landcare Program (NLP) grant of $19,780 in 1992-93.
