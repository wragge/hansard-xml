                            <para>No decision has yet been arrived at as to the continuance of the service; but the following report has been received : - &#34; A postal inspector has gone into the matter very fully, and his report shows clearly that the existing expensive service, although chargeable to the votes of this Department, is not necessary for postal purposes, and that the coastal schooner which was employed up to the end of 1904, at a cost of &#163;400 per annum, served our requirements almost as well, while the small progress made in the development of this portion of the State during the past decade (with the aid of a subsidized steamer), and the consequent smallness of the cargo to be carried to and from the various ports, will no doubt preclude the Department from securing a renewal of the steam service at any figure commensurate with its requirements. In the circumstances it would appear desirable that the State Government should be approached with a view to ascertain their views, as to the continuation of so expensive a service, which, it is presumed, would not be maintained were it not for the Phillips River Gold-fields, and as the necessities of these could perhaps be equally well, if not better, served by the inauguration of an overland service between Broome Hill and Ravensthorpe (the centre of the fields referred to), supplemented by the sailing boat from Albany, which still maintains a regular service, notwithstanding the steamer, and by which all coastal mails could be despatched, it is considered that a very substantial saving could be effected. As regards Esperance, the second town of any importance on this coast, an extension of the existing service between Norseman and that township would certainly provide all that is necessary, more particularly as the Government are now contemplating an early extension of the railway from Coolgardie to Norseman.&#34; </para>

There has been a deliberate conspiracy on the part of its opponents to talk about everything except the Bill itself. </para>

                        <para>- I withdraw the term &#34; deliberate conspiracy,&#34; and say that there has been an unanimous desire. I- think that is equally good. I did not mean the word &#34; conspiracy &#34; in an offensive sense, and the phrase which I have substituted for it will equally well suit my purpose. The Bill is an extremely simple one. It is very short, and is for the purpose of the authorization of a survey. Its opponents with one consent have discussed at length the cost of a railway which the Federal Government may think fit to advocate years hence. They have discussed at nauseous length the possible loss. They have drawn freely on their imagination. They have ignored all facts and all statistics which have been placed before them by their paid representatives, the experts who were employed to consider this question. When they had nothing else to say, they enlarged on the inequity of the Commonwealth dreaming of the construction of such a railway as this which, as they said, could benefit only Western Australia and South Australia. What I wish to ask the Senate, first of all, is why the opponents of the Bill have, almost with one accord, come to the conclusion that the expert evidence before them is unreliable; because that has been the basis of nearly everything that has been said so far. The railway experts who have made their report to the Federal Government, are, as I understand it, men who are at the head of their profession in each State. I will mention their names in order that their evidence may be challenged if honorable senators choose to do so. They are <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. H.</inline> Deane, New South Wales, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. William</inline> Pagan, Queensland, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Alex.</inline> B. Moncrieff, South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Maurice</inline> E. Kernot, Victoria, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. C.</inline> S. R. Palmer, Western Australia. These gentlemen, if not engineers-in-chief, are at any rate at the head of the engineering departments in each State. They are gentlemen upon whom their States must absolutely rely for the conduct of railway business. They are paid large salaries, and apart from their report, I have been absolutely unable to find&#39; a single objection taken to their professional capacity. </para>

                        <para>- The only thing about which they said they had not sufficient evidence was the water question, and they added&#39;, &#34; If we had the fuller information which we desired to have, we have every reason to believe that our estimate might be largely reduced.&#34; In fact, these gentlemen were so careful of their reputation that they gave an unduly high estimate of the cost of finding water for the construction of the railway. So much for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens&#39;</inline> suggestion that their reports were made on insufficient evidence. If the evidence was insufficient, it was used to the detriment of the project, and not for bolstering it up. The fact that this is a mere survey Bill has been left out of consideration altogether, and when, by way of interjection, I have endeavoured to call the attention of honorable senators to that fact, I have been accused of lack of intelligence. One honorable senator deliberately accused me and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> of a lack of ordinary intelligence, and of endeavouring to hoodwink the Senate. I want, at any rate, to commence by dealing strictly with the Bill that is now before us. The motion is that this Bill be read a second/ time, to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> has moved an amendment to the effect that the Bill be not further considered until evidence is laid&#39; upon the table of the Senate that the Parliament of South Australia has formally consented to the construction of that portion of the&#39; railway which would be in South Australian territory. That amendment is an extremely ingenious form of direct negative. It seems to have been left out of sight that this is a Federal project, and that we should be stultifying ourselves absolutely by going to a State and asking it in advance to allow the Federal Government to take steps for the construction of the railway. </para>

Only one who was absolutely prejudiced against this scheme would dream of looking at the matter in the way that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> asks us to regard it. The position is this : The Federal Government brings forward this Bill for the purpose of obtaining a survey by its experts. That survey having been procured, and full information having been placed in our hands, it will, then be for the Federal Government to go to the Government of South Australia and say, &#34; This is our project.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- Obviously, because the scheme could not be properly put before them. This is not a case in which a railway is being planned in the interest of one State alone, or of two States. This is the case of a Federal project which is essential to the completion of the unity of Australia. On those lines we ought to discuss the question, and not on the petty parochial lines followed .by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> and others ; and it is on those lines I hope the Senate will eventually vote. A question has been raised in connexion with the reservation of a belt of land on each side of the proposed railway. I do not deny that it would be undoubtedly to the advantage of the Commonwealth of Australia that such a belt of land should be reserved, because a stipulation of the kind would be made by any private promoter of a similar work. Projects were placed before the Western Australian Government, prior to Federation, in- connexion with the transcontinental line, and a subsidy of land was then asked for. What is the position? The Government of Western Australia have deliberately reserved from selection a belt of twenty-five miles on either side of the proposed line. </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable senator had paid the attention I have to the debates, or had read <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> he would have seen that the suggestion for a strip of land has been repeatedly made in a negative sense. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> complained&#39; that the Western Australian Government had- not reserved an area of land on either side of the line, and a similar statement was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles,</inline> as will be found on reference to <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> for 1904. Western Australia has made such a reservation; and it will be extremely simple for the Federal Government, when they introduce the Railway Construction Bill, to stipulate that this land shall be transferred. Tt is quite open to the Western Australian Government to refuse to comply with such a condition, as it would be for the South Australian Government, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> has pointed out,, to refuse to allow a line to be constructed on the route adopted by the survey. But I appeal to honorable senators, whether it is reasonable to expect that the South Australian Government or the Western Australian Government would so refuse? To assert that a refusal is probable, is forcing the most impossible arguments against the construction of the line. </para>

Any other line or project for spending Federal money, is approved, whether one, three, or six States are interested ; but once we approach this railway, which is essential for the defence of the whole of Australia, we find the narrow provincial view instantly coming to the front, and we are asked the question I have just quoted* A great deal has been said on the question of the cost of this proposed railway. I do not propose to go into the figures which have been vouched for by the experts. It would be folly for me to pretend1 to criticise them, seeing that I have not before me the data on which those estimates were formed.

The next point on which various honorable senators have dwelt at length is that of the loss which may fall on the Commonwealth if the railway is constructed. In this connexion, the experts are equally explicit. They point out that the loss on the working of the first year may amount to &#163;68,000, but that at the end of ten years the profit arising from the line will probably amount to &#163;18,000. </para>

At the very outside, there could only be a difference of one-quarter per cent., and that is what the honorable and learned senator refers to as a &#34;gross&#34; difference. To call the difference between 3J and 3f per cent, a gross discrepancy is characteristic of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson.</inline></para>

                <para class="block">That is a point I wish to lay stress on. In the Senate, no doubt, we are all more or less influenced by the political brief which we must hold for our constituents. One is prepared to make very large allowances for differences of opinion arising from that cause. &#39; But the gentlemen who made this report had nothing of that kind to influence them. The sole thing they had to consider, especially in a report made to the Federal Government, was, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Palmer</inline> has said, their reputation which they would lose if their figures were proved to be incorrect ultimately. If some honorable senators who have spoken on the question had given a little reflection to this point they would have hesitated before they said some of the things which they have said about these estimates. To show the way in which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> treats this matter, I point out that the honorable and learned senator at the close of his speech does not even remember what he said at the begin-&#39; ning of it. I must make some allowance for the fact that some few months elapsed between the commencement and the conclusion of the honorable and learned senator&#39;s speech. This is what he said last, year in reference to the South Australian Government - </para>

                <para class="block">What could be more conclusive as to the absolute necessity of this line than these remarks by Major-General Hutton? I know what honorable senators will say - that he went on to state that until the equipment and armament of the eastern States were completed, the railway would be of no value for defence purposes. That, of course, is equally sound; but do honorable senators suggest that because we have not yet quite completed our equipment- and armament on the eastern side we should delay this very necessary survey? Surely that argument would be a most ridiculous one to advance. Knowing that the survey must take several years to complete, are we to wait until, our military equipment is complete before we enter upon that work ? </para>

                    <para>No general defence of Australia can be undertaken unless its distant parts are connected with the more populous Colonies in the south and east of the Continent. If an enemy was established in either Western Australia or at Port Darwin, you would be powerless to act against him. Their isolation is, therefore, a menace to the rest of Australia. . . The interests of the whole Continent, therefore, demand that the railways to connect Port Darwin and Western Australia with the other Colonies should be made as soon as possible. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator will not find that many experts share his view. The majority of experts consider that the necessity for defending Albany, and that corner of Western Australia, is infinitely superior to the necessity for defending Port Darwin. In dealing with this defence question, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles</inline> has, by interjection, suggested that we should be put into a position to resist such&#39; attacks as may be made upon us. I do not suppose that any honorable senator has really any notion of the position of Western Australia in respect to defence. To quote from an appendix to the report of the General Officer Commanding for 1903-4, we have a force of 1,603 men according to the establishment, and with the men in the rifle clubs, who are used for filling up the ranks in time of, war; we have 2,700 men for the defence of the whole coast. The actual force, however, in the State is only 1,233 men. We have two breach-loading field guns, fifteen pounders, of a type now being discarded by the British Government. The men have no efficient instructors, and are trained to artillery practice with six muzzle- loading guns. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable&#34; and learned senator&#39;s policy was to take all &#34;the little boys and teach them to shoot. Are we to wait until the little boys grow up before we can be defended? What arrangement is to be made with foreign nations not to attack us in the meantime ? I wish to know whether section 119 of the Constitution has any value in the minds of honorable senators or not? Because section 119 deliberately provides that the Commonwealth shall be responsible for the defence of Australia. It does not say, as honorable senators would like us .to believe, that the Commonwealth shall be responsible for the defence of the eastern States. We have our experts telling us that it is essential for the defence of Australia that this railway should be built, and yet we actually have people cavilling at the expenditure of ^20,000 for a survey- of the line. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator evidently does not understand that in Western Australia expenditure has been limited bv the Federal Government, and in spite of all my efforts I have been unable to get more money spent for defence purposes in Western Australia ; because, forsooth - here is the ridiculous thing - the money is allocated on a population basis. One might as well say that, because there are no more than 150,000 people in Western Australia, foreign nations may be expected only to send an expedition against that State proportionate in number to her population. Therefore, the defence force of Western Australia is to consist of only 1,500 men. </para>

                    <para>The two States will benefit most enormously from having their territory opened up and rendered available for settlement and inspection as regards minerals, for I understand that some good land is to be found along a part of the route. The States will benefit from the increased settlement which must take place. It is idle to compare the direct advantages which they will get with any indirect advantages which can possibly accrue to the other States. To ask us to treat this proposal as if it were a Federal concern is an act of unfairness which I regret and deprecate. I find it most difficult to carry out my desire to deal with the question fairly, because my friends from Western Australia, who are so deeply concerned in this matter, have been unjustly accusing every opponent of it with showing an un-Federal spirit. </para>

He is a great authority on the tourist traffic. He appeared before a Select Committee of the Senate on the 13th January, 1902, and gave some very instructive and valuable evidence as to the tourist traffic. He had some very definite views as to encouraging the tourist traffic of Australia to centre in that marvellous little State of Tasmania. </para>

                    <para>I desire to point out that Tasmania is the only ocean State, separated from the mainland by 160 odd miles of sea. I think it is the duty, of the Commonwealth to take that matter into consideration. I believe that Tasmania has special claims on account of its attractive scenery and its healthiness, which are essential to the wellbeing of the Commonwealth, and that it must become absolutely the sanatorium, as well as the pleasure ground, of Australia. I have had considerable experience with tourists for the last thirty-five years, and I know that it is essential to many of the men and women of Australia, and especially for the mothers of young children, to visit Tasmania, not only for pleasure, but also, as a matter of health and for the proper bringing up of their children. </para>

                    <para>I have had it from perhaps a dozen men who are accustomed to travel between Tasmania and the mainland that it is an absolute advantage to lose an hour for the sake of letting the bad sailors among the passengers have a little quiet water between the Tamar Heads and Rosevears or Launceston. If a number of passengers, who are bad sailors, are asked to get out of the steamer, which is perhaps rolling or pitching, and to jump directly into a train, they would probably find it a very terrible ordeal. Going by the Tamar, I should like to see the distance shortened by perhaps an hour and a half, or an hour at least. The passengers would then have a sail on perfectly smooth water, and would thus have a chance of pulling themselves together. Many people cannot afford to go further than Launceston, and great complaints have been made as to the discomforts between Sydney and Hobart where travellers are three or four nights at sea. </para>

He was the advocate for the Tourists&#39; Association, and went straight-out for a subsidy from the Federal Government. Those arguments, he held, apply to the special means of communication with the little island of Tasmania, but he persistently refuses to apply them in the case of a railway to Western Australia. Still the honorable senator says that he is not parochial, and that the advocates of the transcontinental railway are. </para>

Indeed, the honorable senator adds to the argument; he shows how he can look at both sides of the question by maintaining that in his speech he first said one thing and then the other. </para>

                        <para>- I do not care who voted* against the bounty. What I say is that Western Australia has, without the slightest objection, paid its share of the cost in a truly Federal spirit. Yet the representatives of that State are accused of parochialism. Then there is Western Australia&#39;s share in the cost of administration, amounting to ,&#163;56,657 last year, with&#39; probably a similar amount to be paid this year. </para>

                        <para>- I say that the &#39; whole thing is humbug. The coloured labour, going out of Queensland must go out of it according to law. But the coloured labour that will remain in the State will work there, and therefore this is not a question of black and white labour, but it simply means that the sugar industry is being fostered to this extent as a protected and exotic industry. The coloured labourers who remain in Queensland must be employed. Do honorable senators suggest that they are to starve? I should advocate their deportation. </para>

Another thing to which we have to contribute our quota, without objection, though I opposed the matter when it was before the Senate, is the Pacific subsidy.

I make that statement on the authority of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker,</inline> who, during the discussion on the subject, interjected that that would be the effect of the measure. That statement is absolutely true. Then we have, in connexion with British New Guinea, another Federal expenditure.

The entire trade between British New Guinea and the Commonwealth is carried on between that territory and Brisbane, and other Queensland ports. Though .Western Australia derives no benefit from this expenditure, we are paying our share of it. I notice in the Estimates for the current year a proposal to inaugurate an expensive and luxurious telephone system between Sydney and Melbourne at a cost of &#163;34,000, with a balance to be brought forward later on, making the total cost &#163;50,000. The Government propose to spend this money on a luxury for the benefit of Sydney and Melbourne. </para>

                        <para>- It is quite right that South Australia should be consulted. Another expenditure to which we have contributed, though not without a word of protest, is that connected with the up-keep of Government House in Sydney. This costs &#163;3,000 per year, and though Western Australia pays her share of that expenditure she does not derive the least benefit, from it. </para>

                        <para>- I like to be accurate, and I admit that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> has stated what was said by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin.</inline> In that sense, we understood that the construction of this railway would follow on Federation. What is the position in connexion with Government House in Sydney ? Here also it is claimed teat there was an understanding, and that it was arrived at, not between the leaders of the Federal movement, but between <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain.</inline> The other understanding may be put on one side, but the understanding between. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain</inline> is not to be cavilled at or even questioned. It is the sacred inheritance of New &#34;South Wales. It is amusing to find honorable senators from Tasmania talking so much about the Federal spirit, because, as a matter of fact, even before Federation, Tasmania showed herself singularly lacking in any Federal spirit. My memory goes back to a meeting of the Federal Council of Australasia, held in Melbourne in&#39; 1889. Before that body there was laid a most important measure dealing with quarantine. </para>

                        <para>- I may say in general terms that I have six most interesting items of evidence to show an absolute want of the Federal spirit on the part of Victoria. I should like to refer to them, but I am debarred from doing so by the ruling of the President. What does it all amount to? The real objection to this line has never been brought to the surface. The real objection of the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> is that it would facilitate the emigration of persons to Western Australia from this State, which is going on day by  day  There is no doubt that, with the finest climate on our western coast, with our magnificent land, with our regular rainfall, and with unparalleled openings for investment, the entire stream of emigration which flows weekly from Victoria to both Canada and South Africa, would be diverted to Western Australia. I take it - and I make the remark with the conviction that it is absolutely true - that the opposition which is fomented by the newspapers in this State entirely arises from that cause. They are anxious that the people in the eastern States should be debarred from facilities to reach our glorious State. </para>

                    <para>- Speaking to the amendment, I wish to congratulate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> upon the splendid fight he has made for his State. During the. debate the representatives of Western Australia have presented the case in as strong a light as it could be put. If any honorable senator is wavering as to whether he should vote for the Bill or for the amendment, he certainly has had very fair reasons furnished in a number of the speeches to assist him in coming to a decision. Having listened to their speeches, both last year and this year, I regret to say that I cannot bring myself to vote for the Bill. I shall vote for the amendment, and, if it is defeated, against the second reading of the Bill. </para>

                        <para>- No ; I regret that safer reasons for supporting the Bill have not been furnished. I regret that the representatives of Western Australia, who, I am satisfied, voiced the opinion of a large majority of its people, have not been able to satisfy the representatives of other States that it would be a fair and equitable thing to pass this Bill. To put it briefly, they have a bad -case. A few months ago, I had the honour of being a guest of the Government of their State. I found amongst all sections of the community an almost unanimous opinion as to the desirability of constructing this line. I found that a large number of the people in all classes of business were of opinion that the State had been persuaded by false pretences to join the Federation. </para>

                        <para>- If any reason were wanting to make honorable senators vote for the amendment <inline font-style="italic">ji</inline> would be found in the speech delivered last Thursday night bv the Minister of Defence. It certainly must have decided the votes of two or three honorable senators, who were wavering in their minds. He laid it down clearly that the Government of South Australia desires a controlling voice as to the route. of the survey. He mentioned that the present Premier, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Price,</inline> is of opinion that the people and Government of the State should be able to direct the route of the survey. In most emphatic terms he declared that this was a question in which South Australia should have a controlling voice. We are now told in very forcible language by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> that the chief reason for the construction of the line is the necessity for perfecting the defences of the Commonwealth. So far, that reason has always appealed to me more forcibly than any other. If, however, that is the chief reason for advocating this project, I think it is not fair that South Australia should have a controlling voice as to the route. Surely that is entirely a question for the Parliament of the Commonwealth to .deal with. </para>

                        <para>- I am referring to the speech of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford,</inline> in which he said that he, as a resident of South Australia, decidedly agreed with the attitude of its Premier that the Government would not be justified in agreeing to a survey unless they had the right to indicate which route should be taken. It seems to me that the question is inextricably mixed, and that we are not justified in going on with the Bill. We should have a clearer understanding as to whether, in the event of the Bill being passed, the route of the survey is to be decided by the Commonwealth Government and its officials, or whether the Government of South Australia shall be able to step in at any moment, as they could db unless the Bill were altered, and refuse to allow a survey to be taken along the selected route. </para>

Where does the Commonwealth come in? Last Thursday night the Minister of Defence said that the Government of Western Australia were charging 100 per cent, more for carrying Tasmanian goods by rail than for carrying locally-made goods. To me that is the strongest evidence of parochialism that we could have. Perhaps the strongest argument which could appeal to the representatives of other States was furnished last night by the Treasurer, when he mentioned that since Federation three States had gained a large amount, and three States had Jost a large &#39;amount. New South Wales has gained &#163;5,941,408, Western Australia has gained &#163;&#39;580,079, and South Australia has gained &#163;49,244. Queensland has lost &#163;2,180,587, Tasmania has lost ,&#163;7,96,601, and Victoria has lost &#163;72,792. </para>

I regret that the representatives of Western Australia, who have made such a strenuous fight for the passage of the Bill, and have worked so hard to bring forward every conceivable detail in support of it, have not been able to make out a stronger case, quite apart from any feeling of parochialism or anything of that sort. Until fuller information is furnished I shall have to support the amendment. </para>

                        <para>- I bow to your ruling, sir, and withdraw the remark. At any rate, the amendment is a most ingenious method by which honorable senators may be able to avoid giving a vote on the direct issue. To ignore the right of South Australia to be consulted in a matter that affects her would be absurd. As a Western Australian, I feel quite sure that the position taken up by South Australia does not in any way warrant the amendment. The South Australian people merely ask that they shall be consulted by the Commonwealth; authorities in respect to the route to be chosen in order that an arrangement may be made satisfactory to both parties. There is nothing more reasonable than that such a course should be pursued. We, as Western Australians, can heartily indorse the position of the South Australians in that respect. But for this Senate practically to endeavour to compel South, Australia to express herself as to building a railway before the survey is made, is certainly an entirely different question. When an analysis is made of the whole of the facts the evidence may be such as to convince even some Western Australians that the project is one that could not be carried to a completion until years and years have passed. In that case they, as men having an idea of what is right and wrong, would probably consider seriously before attempting to launch the Commonwealth in a project that looked hopeless from the outset. I entirely oppose the amendment, believing that it is simply an ingenious attempt to evade the main question. </para>

                    <para>- May I point out in passing how exceedingly awkward it is to have one&#39;s remarks on the main question re&#39;ported in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> for one session, and one&#39;s remarks on the amendment in another set. But unless the Standing Orders are altered, I suppose that that is inevitable. I wish to address a few words to the Senate with reference to the amendment, which proposes the postponement of this matter until the South Australian -Government has shown a willingness to permit the construction of the line. It is clearly indicated in the quotations from the official correspondence, read by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> last week, and published in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> that while South Australia does not object to &#163;20,000 of Commonwealth money being spent upon, a survey, she most carefully refrains from any indication of her willingness that the railway shall be built if the Commonwealth desires to build it. Those who know anything of matters in South Australia are aware that that State is making a great and costly effort to provide shinning facilities in the Gulf that do not at present exist in the port of Adelaide. There is a strong feeling in portions of South Australia - I have no means of knowing whether that opinion expresses the views of the majority - in opposition to this proposal. </para>

                        <para>- I have no doubt that the honorable senator has more knowledge of the opinions of the majority in South Australia than I or any one else not living in has State can possibly have. But the fact remains that it is well known that the desire of those who wish to see the railway built is to bring about a terminus of mail routes at Fremantle, thereby taking from Adelaide the position of a place of call for mail boats. Undoubtedly that would be greatly to the disadvantage of South Australia, as is shown clearly by the official correspondence. It is for this reason that South Australia in the correspondence is so careful to say, &#34; You may spend as much money as you like, but we will not give the slightest promise that the line shall be built.&#34; I should like to be able to apply these remarks to the general question, but as I spoke on it last session, I cannot do so again. But I think it would be very desirable to add to the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> another amendment, that the Bill be referred to a Select Committee for inquiry and report. </para>

                        <para>D- I think it would be better for me to suspend operations with a view to take action at a subsequent stage of the proceedings if I think it desirable. But, meanwhile, I strongly emphasize my view that it is undesirable until South&#39; Australia has given an indication of her willingness that we should take further steps in regard to the construction of the line. I do not think we should be justified in spending the considerable amount of the Commonwealth money involved with the almost certain prospect of it being insufficient until we know the mind of South Australia. I would point out also that the Minister in charge of the Bill has carefully hedged himself by not limiting the amount. He does not indicate a belief that &#163;20, 000 will be sufficient. </para>

                    <para>- I desire to say that I am opposed to the amendment, because it is entirely unnecessary. No honorable senator has yet shown that the telegrams which have been received from the South Australian Government indicate any desire that its consent to the proposed survey shall be obtained. I think it is as well that honorable senators should look to the history of this matter. If they do so, I. am sure that there are some who will be surprised to know whom they are supporting, and what led to South Australia taking the attitude that she did in reference to the scheme. What is the history of this .......... . Up to a certain period South Australia was heartily in favour of this proposal, so much so that leading public men of the State pledged themselves to do their utmost to carry out this railway proposal on the accomplishment of Federation. </para>

                        <para>- It is, but consent to &#34; what? It is not necessary to get the consent of South Australia to make a survey. That State has never thrown any obstacle in the way of that proposal. What South Australia claims is that, when the question of constructing a transcontinental railway, arises, the Government of that State ought to be consulted as to the route. My point is that politicians and others of South Australia never raised this question of consent until they saw that a transcontinental railway constructed by the Federal Government would be likely to hinder the progress of the land grant system line which they favoured. Personally!, I do not believe that the people of South Australia regard the proposed Commonwealth railway in the light of a rival to the other scheme. In my opinion,, each scheme ought to stand on its own merits, and, under proper conditions, I should be prepared to vote for both. There is no doubt that the suggested Commonwealth railway interfered with the success of the land grant scheme, to which a large section of the public of South Australia&#34; were opposed, simply because it was a land grant scheme. The leader of the Labour Party in the State was against the land grant proposal; but the Jenkins Government, in order to further its interests, attempted in every way to block the Federal survey proposal. The whole of the letters and telegrams sent by the Federal Government to the State Government of South Australia, were couched in the most respectful terms, merely asking that the constitutional obligation should be carried out, and that the State Government should make known their views. On the other hand, the letters from the State Government to the Federal Government were written in most insulting and disrespectful language, calculated in every&#39; way to force a breach and to drag the Federal Government into disrepute. One of the blackest deeds which stand to the record of the Jenkins Government is their attempt to gain their object by means of such language. What is the attitude of the people of South Australia? I am not concerned with what is the attitude of the late Jenkins Government. That Government represented those who wished to give away one-half of the freehold of the State to people who were prepared to carry out an iniquitous gambling scheme. I am concerned with the attitude of the representatives in this Chamber of the people of South Australia. Is there an honorable senator from South Australia who was elected as a declared opponent of the railway in respect of which it is proposed to have a survey ? Is there one honorable senator from South Australia who was elected pledged to vote against and to block this Bill ? I have not heard of one. </para>

South Australia&#39;s attitude in regard to the measure is shown by the attitude of the representatives of that State within this Chamber in a more impressive manner than it is by the attitude of those who tried to engineer the land grant railway through the State Parliament. I am surprised that some of our Queensland friends, who in that State fought the greatest fight in Australia against the principle of land grant railways, should be prepared to take the opinion of men who tried to bring about the construction of a railway of the kind in South Australia- </para>

                        <para>- I have the assurance of the Premier of South Australia, given to me personally - and so has another honorable senator - that his construction of the telegram, which was laid before him, is - &#34;So far as we are concerned, you can survey any route you like, and as many routes as you like; the meaning of the telegram is that we are not concerned with the survey which we wish you to go on with, but what we ask is that, when the survey is made, and the Federal Parliament is asked to commit itself to a Railway Construction Bill, the measure shall be submitted to us, in order that we may be consulted as to the route the line is to follow.&#34; I say that that is a perfectly justifiable course to take. The Constitution gives the State certain power, inasmuch as the railway cannot be built by the Commonwealth through any territory, without the consent of the State concerned. The Premier of South Australia would be false to his trust if, while consenting to the survey, he did not notify that, before proposals for construction were introduced, he should be allowed to exercise the right given to him by the Constitution - that he should be consulted as to the route. It is a mere quibbling with the position to say that the State Government ever laid down any condition as to which route should be surveyed ; it is ridiculous to suppose that any Government would seek to bind the Commonwealth in that way. The surveyors themselves will not know the exact route until they have completed the survey, and, therefore, it is impossible for the State Government to tie us down to so many miles north or south of&#39; a certain line. The proposition has only to be looked at to reveal its absurdity. It has been said that South Australia objects to any route being selected, because the building of the line would make Fremantle the terminus for the mail boats. In the first place the Western Australian people generally have never expressed any such belief, and, as a Westralian, I have no idea of the sort. I do not think the time will ever come when any port of Australia will be the sole terminus for the mail boats. The disposition is not to shorten, but to lengthen the voyage of those boats, and propositions are already being made to extend the run to Brisbane. </para>

                        <para>- The mail boats would continue to call at Adelaide, especially in view of the fact that the expansion of the export trade of South Australia in apples, butter, and farm produce generally would make it worth their while. Are we to understand that the mail boats at present call at Largs Bay for the purpose of giving a few hours&#39; work to the crew - and not to lumpers and wharf labourers, who are not employed in this way- - in the handling of a few hundred mail bags ? Is that the awful loss that South Australia is to suffer? Is that the secret of the opposition which Ave are told exists in South Australia to this railway, but which, I think, I have shown does not exist? Is it not strange to see the wonderful anxiety on the part of Queensland members for South Australian interests ? </para>

No; it has to be left to our Queensland friends to discover that the whole State edifice of South Australia will tumble into ruin because a few mail bags are not landed at Adelaide, but, at Fremantle. I think that the people of South Australia should make some sort of presentation to those honorable senators in acknowledgment of their vigilant and valiant efforts to protect the interest of that State. </para>

You, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> were a member of the Federal Convention, and helped to frame the Constitution. When agreeing to the provision to which I refer I have no doubt it was your intention that South Australia should have the right to say in the last resort whether a certain railway should be built through her territory. We have a State Government charged with the duty of seeing that the Federal Parliament d&#39;oes not impinge on their authority. We have in this Senate six representatives of the State, whose particular duty it is to see that the rights of the State are not impinged on. The State Government of South Australia have not yet said that they object to the construction of this line, or that they object to this proposed survey. I understand that the six honorable senators representing the State here -will vote for the proposed survey. </para>

It is, therefore, hypocritical that an amendment of this character should be brought forward by an honorable senator representing a State within whose borders no part of the proposed railway will be constructed,, and which cannot be affected by South Australia giving up any of her rights under the Constitution in this matter. </para>

I hope to be able to get through my speech without saying anything to wound the susceptibilities of honorable &#39;senators from Western Australia. I believe I can suggest sufficiently strong reasons for opposing this measure without descending to anything of that kind. Whatever action may be taken, I trust that the Bill will be defeated or carried by an absolute majority of the Senate. I have already shown that I shall not be one to participate in any unfair tactics in order to defeat the measure. </para>

                        <para>- I make no excuses of any kind. I have not so far spoken on the Bill, and I have no need to make excuses for other people. I do not propose to discuss the question as to whether this so-called transcontinental railway shall be constructed or not. I admit frankly that the expansion of Western Australia, and of her sister State, South Australia, will probably in the near future afford a very much better justification for the construction of this line than any that now exists. I believe that the construction of a railway connecting Western Australia with the eastern States in the Federation will become a national necessity in a short time. The question we have to discuss is whether, as senators who have in a particular way intrusted to them the guardianship of the rights of their States, we can consent, to the Commonwealth directly, or by implication, assuming the responsibility for the construction of this line. Several honorable senators have stated that this vote of &#163;20,000 is asked for merely for investigation purposes. They have denied that they will attach any further responsibility to the action of the Federal Parliament than can be associated with the mere voting of this &#163;20,000 for this purpose of inspection. -I differ from honorable senators on&#34; that point, because, even in their speeches on this Bill, they have referred over and over again to the construction of the line. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Croft</inline> did good service for his State by dealing with technical matters which threw a great deal of light on the question. The honorable senator appeared to think there was some reason for showing that the construction of the line would not be so costly as some honorable senators assume. What was the honorable senator&#39;s object? The honorable senator also said that he would not ask any member of the Senate to vote for the construction of the line if the survey disclosed that there would be particular difficulties. With all due respect to the honorable senator, I say, &#34; Thank you for nothing.&#34; Who would think of asking the Senate to vote for the construction of a line if the surveyors reported that it would be inadvisable, or very costly ? To follow the argument used by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Croft</inline> and his colleagues to its logical conclusion, if we vote for the survey, and the subsequent report from the surveyors is to the effect that the line can be constructed comparatively easily, and for &#163;4,000,000 or &#163;5,000,000, the average estimate of its cost of construction, we shall be bound to support it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Croft</inline> and his colleagues will in such a case contend that we have committed ourselves. </para>

                        <para>- It is proposed to see if the two railway systems can be connected by a .line 1,100 miles long, and to carry out the inquiry at the expense of the Commonwealth. I admit that South Australia is associated with Western Australia in this matter, but the request for an inquiry comes from the latter State, which joined the Federation under specially favorable terms. I object to the Federation assuming a large responsibility of this kind until we are truly federated. Western Australia was allowed to tax the products of other States on a diminishing scale for a period of five years, and, acting with New South Wales, she secured the adoption of that wretched un-federal system known as the book-keeping arrangement. </para>

                        <para>- No; I desire all the States to be partners on even terms. I do not like the idea of Western Australia carefully conserving to herself every penny of her revenue during the time of prosperity and preparing to bleed the Commonwealth when the time of adversity comes round. With the enormous debt she is piling up, the time will come when she will be glad to get assistance and will come to the Commonwealth for it. The Constitution contains a provision which is said to have been put in for the benefit of Tasmania, and which allows the Commonwealth to assist a State in financial difficulties. I have always advised the electors of Tasmania to pay their way, and not to appeal for help to the Federation, no matter what expense it may have caused to them. This is a very great question, indeed, but behind it is a still greater question, and that is the nationalization of the railways of the States. What sort of a business proposition is the project to which we are now asked to commit ourselves, and the Commonwealth must look at it as a business concern ? Suppose that we offered this as a concession, with a land grant thrown in, to a number of capitalists, and said to them, &#34; Here you can come in, and construct 1,100 miles of railway under certain conditions. The position when the line is constructed&#39; will be that the front door of it will belong to Western Australia, and the back door to South Australia. The intervening section will be yours.&#34; How many capitalists would touch it? And this will be the ownership the Commonwealth will have. </para>

                    <para>The average number of passengers each way per week, between Fremantle and the Eastern States, for the last three years, has been about 400, and it has been fairly uniform for each of the three years. </para>
                    <para>Counting both journeys, this means 800 passengers per week, namely, over 40,000 a year, the majority of whom reside upon, or are connected with the gold-fields, and would consequently probably go by overland railway in order to save time, and to keep in touch with their business, unless it involves considerable extra expense. Instead of involving extra expense, however, it will, on the contrary (as is evidenced by tables &#34;A&#34; and &#34; B &#34; herewith), be, in many cases, much cheaper for them to go by overland railway, if constructed, than to go by sea. </para>

                <para>Side by side with the cost of travelling by rail from Kalgoorlie to Fremantle, and thence by water to Adelaide, this engineer put down the charges then made by the deep-sea boats, and also by the Inter-State boats. Since that time I understand that the rates on the latter have been reduced. But, adopting that basis, it seems to me, from a careful perusal of the report, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O&#39;Connor</inline> assumed that every one of these 40,000 passengers would forsake the boats immediately and travel by the transcontinental railway. </para>

                        <para>- Although the honorable senator deprecated the introduction of extraneous matter, still he erred a great deal in that respect. In my opinion, this calculation is relevant to the subject-matter of the Bill. At the rate laid dbwn by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O&#39;Connor,</inline> 40,000 passengers per annum would give a revenue of&#163;183,333 6s. 8d. His estimate of the total receipts was &#163;240,000. Apparently, he has only allowed &#163;56,000 for goods traffic. But it goes without saying that the goods traffic along 1,700 miles of railway would not be very considerable in competition with sea traffic, though there may be some intermediate traffic in stock and perishable goods. </para>

                        <para>- I was speaking of the whole line between Adelaide and Fremantle, because not much stuff is likely to be taken, on at Port Augusta. The traffic, if there is any, will be between Adelaide and Fremantle. But even if we knock off 600 miles, how many people will send goods 1,100 miles by rail when they can send them by water at one-half the cost ? I mention this to show the wretched manner in which this project has been put before us. No harm will be done if the matter is delayed. On the contrary, great good will be done if an opportunity is afforded to Western Australia and South Australia to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposal. Then they can come to the Federal Parliament and ask for Commonwealth assistance, in which case I venture to say that even the Tasmanian &#39;representatives will be prepared to give them a fair hearing. But if once we put our hands to the plough, and plough this furrow right out, we shall be initiating a departure from the very safe non-borrowing policy which the Commonwealth ,has hitherto followed. If there is one thing more than another which stands to the credit of the Labour Party it is the non-borrowing policy, for which I believe they are responsible, and for which I have. always given them every credit. But how are we going to construct 1,100 miles of railway at a cost of &#163;4,000,000, at the lowest estimate, without borrowing? Will Western Australia, which has no income tax and no land1 tax, consent to direct taxation to provide the money ? </para>

No doubt he is voting for the survey under the impression that he is not committing himself to go any further. I can quite understand that the representatives of South Australia feel interested in this line, and in obtaining information about it. They are deeply interested in getting the Commonwealth to construct the line without it costing their State anything. </para>

                        <para>- We have no report worth the paper it is printed on. I decline to accept a report signed by people who have not passed over the ground. The engineers themselves admit their inability to form a just estimate. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> knows something about surveying, and he knows that a mere traverse of the country is not sufficient to give any idea of what the cost of a railway will be. There are many other things in connexion with the line than the engineering difficulties. There is the possibility of sand-drifts covering up the railway altogether. When Federation has had time to develop, and we have fuller information, we may be more inclined to look at this matter in the light of a national work than we are able to do now. But at present, I doubt whether we should be justified in authorizing even the beginning of such a work on grounds such as have been put before us. The most that has been said in favour of it is that the line will possibly be useful for defence purposes. I am sorry that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> has proposed an amendment. I should prefer to defeat the Bill straight-out but I feel that it is my duty to support the amendment as it has been proposed, because we ought to take all fair means to postpone the consideration of this subject by the Federal Parliament until all the information which can be supplied by the States most interested is forthcoming. </para>

                    <para>- It seems to me that since this question has been under discussion, senators from two States Queensland and Tasmania - have been more particularly assailed by honorable senators who support the project. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> was very much put out this afternoon because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> had moved the amendment that is now before the Senate. Evidently, in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce&#39;s</inline> opinion. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> had no right to move in this direction, because he happened to come from Queensland. Nor had he a right to decline to vote for the project, because he wanted further information, and desired to have the assent of the State which, after Western Australia, is most deeply interested - not through its Premier, but through its Parliament. It is not sufficient that the Premier of a State should say that this or that thing should be done. During the course of this debate, we have had brought up the opinions of various men in politics before Federation took place in reference to the transcontinental railway. </para>

                        <para>- I can easily understand why the South Australian senators are in favour of the survey being made. But how many are prepared to pledge themselves to the construction of the railway ? That is another question altogether. If the Commonwealth were prepared to spend &#163;50,000 on a survey of a line from one end of Queensland to the other, I do not believe that a single senator from Queensland would object. The money would be spent in Queensland, and it would not be natural for us to object. Again, if the Commonwealth proposed to spend money on a survey of a line to Port Darwin, I do not believe that a single South Australian senator would object. And why ? Because the money would be spent in their State. But I do not look at the present proposal from that point of view. The question is whether we should be justified in spending this large sum of money when the people who are asking for something to be done for them are able to do it for themselves. If has been stated by Western Australian representatives that a former Western Australian Premier has re marked that his Government were prepared to do this work, but could not get the assistance of South Australia. I have heard <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest say that the State of Western Australia was prepared to put down her proportion of the money necessary to carry out the survey if South Australia would consent to do her part. But South Australia declared that it would not spend a solitary penny, but that if Western Australia could get the Commonwealth Government to step in, well and good. The position that is taken up by myself and others is that the two States most nearly concerned, altogether outside the question of defence, are South Australia and Western Australia; and that if one State is prepared to vote money for a portion of the survey, the other State should, at least, be asked to give its consent to the construction of the line before anything is done regarding either survey or construction. In my opinion, the survey is part of the construction of a railway, and the cost of the survey is merged in the whole cost all the world over. In Queensland I know that the cost of the survey is reckoned as part of the total expenditure on a work of this kind ; and when we are asked to pass this Bill I contend that we are asked to start the work of construction. </para>

                        <para>- As pointed out by the Minister of Defence the other day, South Australia does not intend, in his opinion, to have anything to do with the matter if the Commonwealth is not prepared to make the gauge 3 feet 6 inches instead of 4 feet 83^ inches. As the Minister said, the cost of that would be &#163;400,000, and South Australia is not prepared to go to that expense in connexion with a railway constructed for defence. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has expressed his surprise that Queensland senators support the action of the late Premier of South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jenkins,</inline> who engineered the biggest land steal ever attempted in the Commonwealth. The senators to whom reference is made have not been in the habit of supporting people who engineer land schemes of the kind, but, on the contrary, they have strongly opposed any lines being built in Queensland except by the State. At any rate, I am not prepared to be held up now as one who is following the lead of a man who carried, or attempted to carry, this great land steal. I take up my present position in regard to this Bill, in the belief that the great bulk of the people in the State which I represent are absolutely opposed to the construction of this transcontinental railway. </para>

                        <para>- I have dealt with the subject on the platform, and have heard the opinions expressed by my auditors. There is one little matter which I should like to clear up. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Croft</inline> was speaking the other day, he stated that every means had been tried to block this proposed survey, and he suggested that when I raised the question whether this Bill was in accordance with our Standing Orders, I was goaded on by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> That means, I- take it, that I was &#34;used&#34; by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> with&#39; the object of raising a point of order which he himself did not care to raise. That suggestion is entirely without foundation. The gentleman who directed my attention to the matter was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McDonald,</inline> a member of another place, and it was only when I was entering the chamber, two or three minutes before I raised the point of order, that I asked <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> his opinion. The honorable and learned senator was not sure about the matter ; but when I had laid the facts before him he, in an offhand way, said that my point of order seemed to be pretty conclusive. So far as I know, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> had not considered the point before, and I was influenced in no way by that gentleman when I drew attention to the matter. I make this statement in order that the credit of looking into the matter may be given to the right person, namely, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McDonald.</inline> We have heard a good deal about the attitude I took up in Queensland, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> heard me asked the question, when I was contesting an election for this Chamber, as to what my opinion was. I have been told by Western Australian representatives that I was totally opposed to this railway, and prejudiced in regard to it, before I entered the House, and that no proper consideration of the matter could be expected from a person like myself. When I was asked the question at the election meeting, I answered that, according to the information I then possessed, I was not in favour of the project; but that, when I came to Melbourne, I should get all the available information, and then, if I thought it to be a fair proposal, I should hold myself free to support it. I did not in any way quibble about the question, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie seems to insinuate. If senators in Western Australia are elected by shirking questions, that is not the way to which the&#39; people of Queensland are accustomed. </para>

                        <para>- When I came to Melbourne I got all the reports and other publications on the subject, and, having read them carefully, I asked <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie himself, on one or two occasions, whether there was any further information to be obtained. His reply was &#34; No ; the reports ought to satisfy any one.&#34; The reports might satisfy any one who had very little experience of Australia, but any one who knows anything about this Continent would not be induced by such information to vote for the project. In my opinion, the proper course is for the two States more immediately concerned to arrange this matter between themselves, and then to demonstrate to the Federal Government that this is a fair and reasonable enterprise. The only objection raised by Western Australian senators to this suggestion is contained in the words, &#34; You would not believe us.&#34; If that be their objection, the way out of the difficulty would be for the two States Governments to offer to bear the cost, and ask the Commonwealth to appoint the officials and carry out the work. The Western Australian senators, however, are not prepared to take a course like that. </para>

                        <para>- A great deal of information is given in the report about the income likely to be derived from this line when it is completed. But all who have had experience know that very few people travel overland when there is the competition of sea communication. A first-class return ticket between Brisbane and Melbourne costs &#163;12, which, in addition to 50s. for sleeping berths and meals, makes the cost of an overland journey something like &#163;16. For one passenger who travels by train from Brisbane to Melbourne a dozen travel by boat, for the simple reason that you can get a first-class return ticket by boat from Brisbane to Melbourne, for which you will be fed all the way, six days coming down and six days going back, for &#163;7 10s., or about one-half of what it would cost by rail without those advantages. </para>

                        <para>- I have only to say that the honorable senator&#39;s statement regarding the rate of wages paid to seamen on our coast is absolutely incorrect, and I speak as a member of the Seamen&#39;s Union. What is our experience of the railway line running between the two capitals - Brisbane and Sydney ? We have been told that all passengers from Western Australia will travel over the proposed line, not only those from Kalgoorlie, but also those from Fremantle, Perth, Coolgardie, and other places in Western Australia, who now go through Fremantle to the other States. According to this return, it is estimated that all those passengers will travel by this railway. No one with a grain of common sense can believe that that will be so. If we take the experience of the railway from Brisbane to Sydney we can say that for one person who travels by the railway between those places twenty travel by boat. </para>

                        <para>- Twenty at any rate. It is further said that because passengers from Coolgardie have now to travel from Fremantle to Coolgardie after coming from the other States by boat they will prefer to travel by this railway if it is constructed. In answer to that, I take the case of people travelling from Longreach to Sydney. They do not travel by rail. With the exception of very few, indeed, they come by rail to Rockhampton, and go from there to Sydney by boat, or they come by rail to Brisbane, and there take the boat for Sydney. The passenger traffic on the Inter-State line in Queensland is so small that the line from the border to Gowrie Junction, where it joins the Southern and Western Railway, has paid only about 1 per cent, over interest and working expenses. Now, as to goods traffic, what goods traffic is it expected will be taken over this line? </para>

                        <para>- Very little. There is some talk, about perishables, and we are invited to believe that fruit and vegetables will be taken for hundreds of miles by this railway. There is a great deal of fruit and vegetables leaving Brisbane for the North, but how much is taken from Brisbane to Rockhampton by rail? The distance is 340 miles by rail, and 500 miles by water ; but I venture to say that 90 per cent, of the produce carried from Brisbane to- Rockhampton goes by boat, though there is an additional disadvantage in that when it gets to Keppel Bay it has to be lightered and carried forty miles up the Fitzroy River, which involves two or three different handlings. Even with these disadvantages shippers of this produce find it to their advantage to send it by water rather than by rail. The same thing applies to all goods with the exception of small parcels carried from Brisbane to Rockhampton, and even to goods which have to be carried west from Rockhampton on the Central Railway. </para>

                        <para>- The railways of Queensland are doing fairly good work. The State is losing &#163;200,000 or &#163;300,000 a year on her railways, but a very great deal of good has been done in the opening up of the country by those lines. I have referred to lines in Queensland which can be compared with the proposed line to Western Australia, inasmuch as they have to compete with water communication. When we have such experience in other parts of Australia to show that water carriage can always successfully compete with railway carriage, we cannot expect that that experience will not also apply to this proposed line. I contend that this report is absolutely unreliable in the light of experience gained in other parts of Australia, where railways have to compete with water carriage. I do not know that I need go through the report. I read it very carefully, because I thought there might be something in it which would throw some, light on the subject, and enable me to support this proposal. I understand that <inline font-style="italic">it</inline> is estimated that this line with rolling-stock and all complete will cost something like &#163;4,400 per mile. I can take the case of lines running over the western plains of Queensland, far better country for railway construction than that outlined by the Minister of Defence when he &#39;told us that the route of this railway would traverse a belt of country with sand-hills 200 feet high. </para>

                        <para>- No, the patent sleepers used on that line are cut out of ironbark or gum trees. I do not know whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dawson</inline> has been over that railway, hut I know the rate of speed at which trains are taken over it. If rain has recently fallen, those in charge of the train must be very careful not to travel too fast. The justification for the line is that it serves the district better than a bullock dray would serve it. But we are dealing here with a line which is to carry passenger and goods traffic at a speed of forty miles an, hour, and the question is whether that line can be constructed at a less cost, including rolling-stock, than any line which we have been able to construct in Australia up-to-date. Even in Western Australia it is not claimed that they have been able to construct any section of their existing lines at the same price, including rolling-stock. </para>

                        <para>- I have been speaking of the cheapest railways constructed in that State, and apart from the cost of rolling-stock, they have cost from &#163;2,000 to &#163;2,200 per mile In his book, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coghlan</inline> gives the cost of railway construction per mile in each State. In 1903-4 the mileage in Western Australia was 1,541 miles on the 3 feet <inline font-style="italic">6</inline> inch gauge, and the cost per mile was &#163;5,812. In all probability light rails were used, and the rolling-stock did not cost nearly as much as it would have done had the 4 feet 8j inch gauge been adopted. </para>

                        <para>- When a Federal party was travelling in Queensland not long ago, the honorable senator was christened the seventh representative for that State. It is quite true that I have been in Western Australia only once, but I am not stating my experience. I am quoting the figures of. a statistician who I believe is a competent man. Seeing that, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford,</inline> the transcontinental line would pass through sandhills 100 feet high, the cost of construction must be very expensive. </para>

It is the duty of Western Australia and South Australia to demonstrate that this is a fair proposal for the Federal Government to take up, and the expense should be borne by those States. It is certainly no part of the duty of the Commonwealth to send out exploring parties. </para>

If honorable senators will go across the Darling Downs they will find railways traversing for hundreds of miles land better than any I saw in Western Australia. The land is pretty flat, the grades are very easy, and the cuttings were not very expensive. </para>

                        <para>- In some portions of the western district of Queensland railway construction cost about &#163;2,500 per mile, but that work was carried out under most favorable conditions, with easy access to the coast, and the cost of provisions was considerably lower than would be the case in Western Australia. I do not propose to quote the figures for the other States, but to point out that even in Queensland, despite the cheapness of railway construction, we have not been able to get a reasonable return from our expenditure. In 1903-4 the interest returned on the capital was z&#39;36 - that is a loss of 1*56 per cent, on the total outlay. While Queensland has spent a great deal of money on railway construction, and is still losing at the rate &#176;f &#163;300,000 a year, it is not in a position to help to build a railway in another State which would involve an expenditure of, at the least, nearly &#163;5,000,000. The proportion of Queensland might amount to only &#163;600,000 or &#163;^700,000, but it is asked to find this money for the building of a line which every one who has reported on the project has admitted cannot possibly pay. Every honorable senator who has occupied a seat in the State Legislature knows that a railway has never realized the anticipations of its advocates. I remember projects being introduced into the Queensland Parliament with very glowing accounts as regards the probable returns from the carriage of stock, wool, and passengers. It was very easy for the supporters of a proposal to demonstrate that the income would be more than sufficient to pay the working expenses and meet the interest on the outlay. But I never knew a case in which there was not a loss on the working of the line for a considerable time. </para>

                        <para>- I am glad to hear that they are, but for a good while the State was losing money on the working of its railways. The railway from Sydney to Brisbane has been worked for seventeen years. The length is 700 miles, and the fare is, I think, &#163;2 10s. second class, and about &#163;4 first class. In 1903-4 only 13,000 passengers travelled by.it. </para>

                        <para>- Although the line runs through a fairly thickly populated country, with towns and settlements along its route, still it does not pay. Except during a drought there has &#39;been practically no goods traffic. At that time some hay was sent up from the Hunter to the Darling Downs for feed. That, I believe, was the only time when produce of that kind was carried over the line. I have been twitted with having made up my mind and being (prejudiced against the project to build a railway to Western Australia and therefore I wish to say why I believe that, from the Federal stand-point, it is a bad proposal. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> quoted the names of the engineers who constituted the committee of inquiry, and wished to know if they, retain, their positions. I believe that they do. But when the inquiry was made they were practically limited to going to Port Augusta, calling at another little port, and then proceeding to a port at the far end, where information was gleaned from the reports of a few men. </para>

                    <para>To question No. 8 we find it very difficult to give an answer, in view of the fact that the monetary loss will, for the first few years, be considerable. The revenue may prove to be higher than we have estimated, and the deficiency may tend to diminish from year to year more rapidly than has been assumed. It will be for the Commonwealth Government to decide whether the immediate pecuniary loss is so serious as to outweigh the beneficial effects pointed out in our answer to question No. 7. </para>

They have gone 3,000 miles from the eastern coast, and taken cattle across. Does the honorable senator think that if the land which would be traversed by this railway were good the men who went to the north-west of Queensland would- not be prepared to take it up? Most decidedly they would, and they are men who understand country. </para>

I know they have had a drought for about six years, but in a considerable portion of the country, that drought broke up a good while ago. I would point out that men went out into the back country of Queensland, and made it habitable because it would produce grass, and there was plenty of surface water that could be made available for stock. If the country through which this railway is to go were as good as the Queensland country to which I refer, it would have been put to a similar use many years ago. </para>

                        <para>- No; it was simply because young men were sent out from the old country whose people had no use for them there, and were given a few thousand pounds Avith which to embark in the pastoral industry in Queensland, in which there was a boom at the time. Big profits were being made out of the land because the settlers were working their holdings economically. But when these young men came out with -a few thousands of pounds behind them, they bought up properties, probably for &#163;40,000 or &#163;50,000, the greater part of which they borrowed from the banks, and upon which they had to pay interest. </para>

                    <para>On the morning of the 16th June I made another start out northward, accompanied by two members of; the party, carrying five days&#39; provisions and water. I was anxious to thoroughly test this portion of the country for water, but our efforts were quite fruitless, and we had no better luck than on our previous trip ; Babington meanwhile taking the &#34;main caravan down the creek to the water discovered thirty miles below. </para>

                <para class="block">There is evidence time after time in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Muir&#39;s</inline> report that though he discovered land that was carrying fairly good grass, there was no water to be found, except just a little between the rocks. I think that the biggest supply of water which he found was a basin that contained about 10,000 gallons. He camped near it, and filled up his water vessels to allow him to go on. He points out that there are comparatively few water-courses in this country. Any one who has been in the back country, knows that if there is any rainfall there are bound to be water-courses. There are verv large water-courses in the back country of Queens, land, although there is not a large rainfall there! As you go further north where the rainfall is fairly regular, and you get 50 to 60 inches per annum, you meet with big rivers every few miles. In mountainous country where the water comes down with a rush, there are deep water-courses. Every ten or fifteen miles vou come across a large water-course. But this engineer who was sent out specially to report on this country, finds practically no watercourses. Why should we be asked to sup port a survey like this when everything points to the fact that it would be a very expensive job to put the line through? In spite of the evidence which we have had, we should certainly ask that the Western Australian and South Australian Governments shall prove that this is a fairly feasible project. When I spoke last year, an interjection was made to the effect that Western Australia had been to the expense of sending out a man who had done a good deal in the way of proving that it would be a good &#34; spec &#34; to construct a railway, because there was artesian water. I have read the report of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Castilia,</inline> and I do not gather that any artesian supply has yet been discovered. </para>

No doubt it was deserted simply because of the seasons, just in the same way as a considerable area has been abandoned in the western part of Queensland. When the drought came in Queensland the stock died, and the people were obliged to leave, just as I suppose the people were obliged to abandon their station on the route of the proposed railway. </para>

                <para class="block">It has been reiterated in this chamber that artesian water has been found, but, as a fact, the water mentioned in the report is all sub-artesian water, and has to be pumped up. Artesian water, as I understand it, flows over the casing without any pumping; and if sub-artesian water is regarded in Western Australia as artesian, that is the only place in the world where it is so regarded. I have read this report very carefully, and I see that at some distance away from Madura, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Castilla</inline> struck water at a depth of 2,101 feet, the flow being about 70,000 gallons. Why were not further steps taken to demonstrate that this is country where good water is obtainable along the proposed route? Do honorable senators think that when they read of water being struck suitable for stock, that it is water which can be used for engines? In Queensland there are bores returning water fit for stock and for human use, but it is not used by railway experts for engines if any other can be obtained. Wherever possible a tank is erected near a creek, and a man kept constantly at the pump, in order to supply the locomotives. There is not, so far as I know, a supply of artesian water in Australia that does not carry a considerable quantity of magnesia or other salts, which have a most injurious effect on boilers. </para>

During the great drought, mulga was used by settlers both in Queensland and New South Wales in order to keep some of their stock alive ; but, at the same time, it only grows in countries where the rainfall is very light. The soil in which it grows is practically useless for cultivation without a good rainfall, because it hardens very quickly. Indeed, in mulga country in Queensland, I know lanes which are just as hard as the streets in the city of Melbourne ; and without a heavy rainfall nothing can be done in the way of production. </para>

                        <para>- Western Australian parliamentary representatives some years ago asked the Federal Government to bring pressure on the Parliament of that State to induce them to build a railway from Esperance to the gold-fields, but the Federal Government did not see their way clear to accede to the request. I have in my possession a newspaper article written when I was in Kalgoorlie, and it is there stated that such a line would save hundreds of miles of sea and land carriage from the eastern States to Coolgardie and Kalgoorlie. Even if the transcontinental line were proceeded with, we know perfectly well that, as soon as that part of Western Australia was fit for development, the State Government would, by means of the suggested local Line, endeavour to divert the traffic. There is, therefore, in the hands of the Western Australian people, a solution of, at any rate, a part of the difficulty. This has been a question between the dwellers on the coast in Western Australia and the dwellers in. the back country. Those on the coast have had an advantage, owing to their larger representation in Parliament, those in the back blocks, while able to make a noise, not possessing much influence. I have given a few reasons why I intend to oppose this Bill. We are continually told that this is only a proposal for inquiry - a proposal that the Federal Government shall send out an exploring party to tell us what the country is like. I decline to be a party to any such undertaking. If the States concerned want an exploration to be made they should make it at their own expense. It is their duty to demonstrate to the Federal Government that the proposed railway is not only feasible, but reasonable, and to that end they should provide the money, even if the Federal Government have to appoint Federal officers to do the work. </para>

                    <para>- With reference to this question, I feel very great difficulty. Last session I was altogether uninformed on the matter, but I had a general feeling that the Bill ought not, at that stage, to be carried. If the question had gone to a vote last session I should have been against it, but I refrained from saying anything, being anxious to find reasons for voting in favour of the measure. I see a great many sentimental reasons why the Bill should be carried ; and I feel great sympathy with the people of Western Australia, and with honorable senators from that State. I have taken every opportunity in my power to acquire information on the subject, and the more I look into it, and the more I hear about it, the more positively my judgment is against the proposal. I feel that to discuss the question at this stage would be unwise, and I do not propose to occupy the attention of the Senate for very many minutes. But, broadly speaking, &#34;I feel that we do not know enough about the country to warrant us in taking this step at the present stage. Suppose we made the survey, and decided that it was a good railway to construct, the fact that we have not the power to carry out the work is another strong reason why I think we should not undertake this expenditure. The strongest reason of all, to my mind, is that if we take any positive action in this direction we shall be initiating a railway policy for the Commonwealth. I think that some day the Commonwealth will have to adopt a railway policy, but when it does, it should be on some general principle, and after mature and careful consideration. </para>

                        <para>- I hope we shall have the consent of the States when the time comes. In connexion with this particular railway, if it is made at all in the near future it seems to me that it ought to be made on the land grant principle. The Commonwealth, at present, has no land. There are continual suggestions that the Commonwealth should do something to facilitate immigration, but, as a Commonwealth, we have nothing that we can offer to persons abroad to induce them to come here, and if we make railways we ought to provide some means bv which the increment arising from (Federal expenditure shall go into the Federal exchequer. I think, therefore, that if this railway comes to be made by the Commonwealth, it should be only on such conditions as would give to the Commonwealth the increment which Commonwealth expenditure in connexion with&#39; it would create. If that were arranged for it might bring this question within the realm of practical politics, and of the possibility of accomplishment in the somewhat near future. But that can only be done by an overt act on the part of the two States interested. I would therefore suggest to honorable senators from Western Australia and South Australia that they should urge in their respective States the desirability of initiating legislation for the making of a definite legislative offer in this direction. There has been a good deal of talk as to whether we have, or have not, power to make this survey. My own view is that we have not the power. </para>

                        <para>- No chance of carrying it ! It is above hundreds and millions to one if he had no chance at all. Then the Minister of Defence, who represents South Australia, told1 us that that. State would not consent to the construction of this line unless it traversed a route that met with its approval, and was constructed on the 3 ft. 6 in. gauge. These are two conditions which I think extremely important. Therefore Ave may reasonably say that if we believe it is desirable to make this railway in the interest of the Commonwealth we are still not in a position to embark in an expenditure of this character until Ave get a more definite legal permission to proceed. I do not propose to further discuss the question, which has been argued until it is threadbare, but I say that my judgment at present is entirely against supporting this Bill. I should feel personally glad if there were reasons which would justify us in proceeding to make this line. </para>

                    <para>- I do not propose to occupy the time of the Senate by making a speech in support of the construction of a line from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie. During, the time I have been a member of the Senate, I have engaged the attention of honorable senators to a very limited extent. Being new to parliamentary life, I thought I could better employ myself in endeavouring to learn the procedure of Parliament and its methods of carrying on legislation. It has occurred to me, especially in the course of this debate, that, although honorable senators sometimes profess to have open minds on a subject, in most cases they decide, first of all, that they are for or against a motion. They then proceed to get up all the arguments which will back up the particular line they have decided to take; they carefully shut their ears to anything said on the opposite side, and refuse to believe it ; and in quoting from reports they select only such passages as suit their own side of the question, and they carefully avoid reading, in some cases, the whole of a report, which would justify the arguments of their opponents. </para>

                        <para>- I think that the statement made is an indication that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe</inline> has been listening to the debate, with his ears shut,, and it is an illustration of the old adage that there are none so blind as those who refuse to see. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> was leader of the Senate, and moved the second reading of this Bill, he was careful to point out that it is not. a Bill for the construction of the line, but a Bill to authorize a survey. If honorable senators who have spoken to the question had confined themselves more to the proposed survey, and less to the probable cost of construction of this line, very much valuable time would have been saved. The honorable senator who immediately followed <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles,</inline> who claims to be an expert in railway construction. That honorable senator made a long speech against the construction of the line. He disputed to some extent the statement that &#163;20,000 would be sufficient to defray the cost of the proposed survey, and, speaking as a railway contractor, the honorable senator expressed the opinion that at least &#163;50,000 would require to be spent on the survey before it would be one on which he could give an estimate as to the probable cost of the line. In the same breath the honorable senator proceeded to inform the Senate that the line, if constructed, would cost a certain amount of money, and he got up, I think, to somewhere about &#163;8,000,000. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> interjected that the line would probably  cost  &#163;8,000,000,  and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles</inline> proceeded to give figures to show that it would cost about that sum. </para>

                        <para>- In my opinion this is a Federal matter, although the State of Western Australia would probably benefit more than any other from the construction of the line, and South Australia might also derive some special benefit from it. We are assured by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles</inline> that the construction of this line would be the worst possible thing that could occur for the State of South Australia, and that practically it would half ruin the State. </para>

                        <para>- No. I do not think that South Australia would derive very great benefit from the railway for some time. It appears to me that some honorable senators will only look at this question from one point of view, and refuse to listen to arguments on the other sid&#39;e. Because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playfords</inline> who had such a reputation for being fair in the State Parliament that he was called &#34; Honest Tom,&#34; referred to some possible objection to this survey, and pointed out that Western Australia had been unfair in its treatment of the products from other States, especially from South Australia, one or two honorable senators interjected, &#34; Well, after making that admission you ought to withdraw the Bill.&#34; They appeared to suggest that it was entirely wrong for a member of Parliament to say anything on the other side of a question. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> rose to speak the other evening he said that he did not intend to occupy the time of the Senate at any verv great length, chiefly because he was weak physically. He made a very energetic speech, and finished by moving an amendment. If he was really honest in his action - if he thought that his amendment would be accepted by South Australia - he must have been weak mentally, as well as physically. At any rate, he must have formed the impression that the electors of South Australia have returned to its Parliament men who are mentally weak. Because his amendment simply means that, prior to a survey being made,&#39; the Parliament of South Australia is to practically agree to a railway being constructed without being consulted in the slightest degree as to route, or gauge, or the conveniences to that State. Suppose that a Minister of the Crown were weak enough to ask the State Parliament to pass a measure agreeing to the building of the line. The very first questions he would be asked by honorable members would be, &#34; Which route is the line to take, what sort of country is it to traverse, and is it likely to injure our State?&#34; They certainly would refuse to entertain the measure until a survey had been made. The reason why every honorable senator, no matter what State he may represent, should support the making of a survey is because the railway will ultimately have to be built. I am sure that the great majority of honorable senators think that there must be a railway built at some time, if it is only for defence purposes. </para>

                        <para>- It is the business of the Commonwealth to construct the railway if it is required for defence purposes, because it has control of the defences. Events are moving very fast in the East. It is the opinion of men best able to judge that in the near future, within the next fifteen or twenty years, the Chinese and Japanese may make up their minds that they would like to occupy Australia. That decision may be come to even during the next ten years. It is well known that a very large number of Chinese are serving with the Japanese army. The Chinese are learning Western methods of fighting, and when they are as well trained as the Japanese they may, simply in retaliation of the measures which we in Australia have taken to prevent an influx of Asiatics, decide to come in here by force. </para>

                        <para>- Nearly all honorable senators admit that this railway must be made at some time. Previous to its construction being commenced there must be a survey, and, whether it is made now, or next year, or ten years hence, it will cost just about the same amount of money. Any information collected as the result of a survey at the present time would be just as useful ten or fifteen years hence as now. If it were necessary for defence purposes to hurriedly construct a line to connect the western with the eastern States, the fact that a survey had already been made would be a very great help. </para>

                        <para>- It would save a very considerable amount of time if the railway had to be constructed for defence purposes. A good deal has been said by the last two speakers about the two States particularly concerned paying the cost of the survey. But South Australia has no more interest in the construction of the line than has Queensland. If Australia were invaded on the north-east or the west or the north, South Australia would be no more interested than any other State. If it wishes to spend a large sum on railway construction, undoubtedly it will do so on the line from Adelaide to Port Darwin. I believe that it will go on with the construction of that line, but whether it will be finished or not I am not prepared to hazard a guess. The line must ultimately be constructed, I think, for defence purposes. In an oft quoted report, Major-General Hutton said our defence system would never be complete until Western Australia and. Port Darwin were connected by rail. I ask honorable senators who have cavilled at the expenditure of &#163;20,000 on a survey to put themselves, if they can, in the position of the representatives of Western Australia, and consider whether they would not then look at this project from a different point of view. Here we have a very rich part of Australia not altogether undefended, but with nothing like the defence it ought to have. In the case of invasion, the people of Western Australia would be entirely helpless. It would be utterly impossible for any assistance to reach them from the eastern States by water, A hostile force would naturally come in ships, and any relieving force which attempted to go round to Western Australia by water would be very soon destroyed. The only way by which assistance could be rendered to that State would be bv land communication, and that is by a railway. Whether it is advisable to spend even &#163;4,500,000 on a railway at present I do not intend to argue at this stage; but I submit that it is advisable to make a survey, because it would save time hereafter, and when the formal consent of South Australia was given, the </para>

                        <para>- I ask why should these two comparatively weak States incur this enormous expense of &#163;20,000, which, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles</inline> and others, is too much for the Commonwealth to incur? That is a most unfair position, for honorable senators to take up, because the two States are no more interested in the line, for defence purposes than are Victoria and New South Wales. If a hostile force were to invade Western Australia it would gain a footing from which it could not be dislodged, and that certainly would be a verv bad thing for Victoria and New South Wales. </para>

                        <para>- I believe that the mind of every honorable senator has been made up for a considerable time. If the Bill is defeated now, and is introduced once or twice more, the cost of printing the speeches of its opponents will amount to quite as much as would be required to make the- survey of the line. If honorable senators are not iri favour of passing the Bill, and they have any real desire to obtain fuller information, a reference of the Bill to a Select Committee, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> suggested, would result in very valuable information being obtained, and the question could afterwards be discussed from a better stand-point. I intend to vote for the second reading of the Bill, and I sincerely trust that, in the interests of defence and of the .welfare of Australia, it will be passed. </para>

I am not allowed by the Standing Orders to go into that matter, except for the purposes of illustration. This Bill has found a place on the programme of every Government, for some reason or other. </para>

                        <para>- Take the case of the Minister of Defence, to whom I refer with a great deal of compunction. It is really painful to me to consider his position, because I have such a great respect and regard for him. He is, as we all know, a gentleman who believes in government by the people and for the people. He is a very strong democrat; and indeed, if I may say so in his presence, a very lovable person. His present attitude on this Bill, however, shows that he is not only a politician and a statesman, but a consummate actor. Any one who has watched the honorable senator throughout this debate, and has heard him cheer the supporters of the measure, and glory in the downfall of its opponents, must have come to recognise that the stage has lost a very eminent ornament. Speaking on the defence aspect of this question, the honorable senator said last week - </para>

He could then carry out his plan just as- effectively as if there were not a line between the two points mentioned. </para>

                    <para>I am highly amused at my honorable friends from Western Australia referring to what they call the transcontinental railway. I have never heard of a railway to run along a coast being called a transcontinental railway. The general understanding of a transcontinental railway is that it is one to run from the coast on one side of the Continent to the coast on the other side. But our honorable friends from Western Australia - that land of sin, sorrow, and sand - will insist upon using this high-sounding phrase of &#34; transcontinental railway.&#34; </para>

                    <para>I have some knowledge of the territory in South Australia; first, from having seen some of the land ; second, from talking with those who have gone over the route of the line ; and third, from having, when Commissioner of Crown Lands, sent out an expedition to report to me oh the Nullarbor Plains. The fact is that on the border line of Western Australia and South Australia there is an immense area of well-grassed land. The puzzle is that it grows good bushes and is well grassed. It is one immense crystalline limestone formation, in which all the water runs away, in which you cannot make a dam until you get to some granite outcrop. I thought that we might be able to get artesian water. When I was in office I suppose I spent over ,&#163;5,000, and I believe that South Australia has spent from &#163;10,000 to ,&#163;20,000 to that end. We sank to a depth of 3,000 feet, but we never got artesian water. ... It appears to me that our experience on the Nullarbor Plains will be repeated elsewhere along the route of the line. The country, with the exception of a slip round Port Augusta, right away to Kalgoorlie, with the exception of a slip round Eucla, has never been taken up by the pioneering squatters. If they could have made dams they would have taken up the land. It has not been taken up, not because it has no food for stock, but simply because it is waterless. For the whole distance from Port Augusta, except near that port, to Kalgoorlie, the railway would not pick up one ton of freight on the one hand, or one passenger, practically on the other hand. It would never pay. </para>

                        <para>- Why does not the honorable senator nave these proposals made in some substantial form? His statement is comparable to that of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walter</inline> James, that if we constructed this line Western Australia would pay her fair share of the loss for the first ten years, &#39; though he was not prepared to say what that share would be. I do not wish to go into the question of the value of the calculations of the engineers, but I may remark that their calculations are based on 3J per cent, interest being paid on loan money. But Western Australia itself, which is one of the richest of the States, has had to pay 4 per cent, for money  borrowed to complete the goldfields water scheme. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gardiner,</inline> the ex-Treasurer  of the State, on his return from England, stated that for some time the -States would have to pay 4 per cent, for any moneys they might require. The extra \ per cent, would make a considerable addition to the &#163;5,000,000 that would have to be paid for the construction of the line. Another point is that on the showing of the Western Australian senators this State is more prosperous per -head of the population than any other State in the group. In a pamphlet issued bv the Western Australian Government, entitled &#34; The Western Union Railway,&#34; various facts are given to prove the prosperity of the State. By the way, it is noticeable that since the criticism of the title, &#34; Transcontinental Line,&#34; the supporters of the measure have rather dropped that term. Probably they have done so largely owing to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford&#39;s</inline> remarks in 1903. Now it is termed &#34; The Western Union Line.&#34; In this pamphlet a great number of facts are given as to the prosperous condition of Western Australia. It is shown that the trade per head of the population of Western Australia is &#163;77 per annum, and, singular to 9.V, that is compared with the trade nlf Tasmania, which amounts to about &#163;33 per head. The prosperous State of Western Australia is asking the poorer State of Tasmania to meet the interest which will fall due for a great many years in connexion with losses on this line. </para>

                        <para>- The Standing Orders do not allow me to have a dialogue with the honorable senator. We have been told by some of the supporters of the measure, though not, perhaps, so emphatically as was the case last year, of the anxiety amongst Western Australians for the construction of this line, and of what may happen if the Commonwealth refuse to construct it. When I had the good fortune to visit Western Australia- along with other members of this Parliament, we were met in the great mining districts which this proposed railway is to serve, by men bearing banners and streamers, on which were the words, &#34; We want the Esperance Bay railway.&#34; That was the railway Federal members appeared to be asked to support ; and it is singular that in the pamphlet which I have referred to as issued by the Western Australian Government in order to convert people to this railway, the Bay of Esperance, although it occupied a prominent place in the debates, does not appear on the accompanying map; it is absolutely blotted out. Inasmuch as Esperance Bay offers a kind of alternative route, it ought to have found a place on that, map, so that we might have been seized of the facts from all standpoints. The real opinion of Western Australia is, I think, voiced by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Frank</inline> Wilson, attorney to the Collie Proprietary Coal Company. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wilson,</inline> speaking at the Wallsend mine, is thus reported in the <inline font-style="italic">West Australian : -</inline></para>

                <para class="block">It seems to me that that is more likely to represent the feeling of the independent-spirited people of Western Australia than the suggestion that they are coming to the Commonwealth, cap in hand, for the necessary money. The Bill itself - which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> was going to justify so conclusively, but with which, although he mentioned it, he failed to deal - is a Bill to survey &#34; a route for a railway from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie.&#34; There is not a&#39; single letter in the Bill which suggests to those who are to make the survey that they have to institute any inquiries whatever as to the cost of construction and equipment. That latter question has apparently been decided, and what the Government ask for is &#163;20,000 for a permanent survey of a route for a railway. </para>

It struck me that the distance between those places is about the distance that the proposed railway would traverse, The information supplied to me by the Commissioners was as follows : - From Melbourne to Sydney, a distance of 583 miles, the freight in the A division is 55s. 6dper ton; B division, 85s. nd. ; C division, 128s. id.; first class, 175s. 3d.; second class, 218 s. 5d. ; third class, 240s. 8d.

From Brisbane to Sydney, a distance of 723 miles, the freight is - A division, 58s. 4d. ; B division, 104s. 5d. ; first class. 198s. 6d. ; second class, 268s. 6d. ; third-class, 310s. 8d. From Brisbane to Melbourne, a distance of 1,306 miles, the freight is - A division,. 99s. 6d. ; B division, 164s. 2d. ; first class, 322s. 6d. ; second-class, 422s. 3d. ; third-class, 475s. 5d. The very lowest rate in the very lowest and cheapest class from Melbourne to Brisbane is &#163;4 19s. 6d.&#39; I consulted the steam-ship companies as to the rates of freight charged bv sea, and I was informed that it is anything from 12s. 6d. to ,&#163;2 per ton from Melbourne around to Fremantle. Honorable senators will very easily see from the difference between shipping freights and railway freights the improbability that the proposed railway would be remunerative in this connexion.

                        <para>- If_the price were higher than I have stated, it furnishes a further argument against this Bill. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest&#39;s proposal is to supply the water necessary for this railway by means of pipes from Kalgoorlie. If a work of that kind is proposed, a considerable addition, running, if not to . millions, at any rate to hundreds of thousands of pounds, will have to be added to the estimates of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson&#39;s</inline> experts. And if this idea of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest is not carried out, water will have to be condensed on the spot; and we have just been told that condensed water costs 7s. 6d., or even more, per hundred gallons. I am sorry to find that the supporters of this measure have been so emphatic from the first in their various statements regarding it. First, they based their claim on a compact which they said had been entered into between the people of the Commonwealth and Western Australia. </para>

                        <para>- As elected representatives, we hold a very Sigh place in the community., but, after all, what are the promises of three or four of us, when balanced against the wishes and determination of the rest of the four millions of people in Australia? I do not think they amount to very much. We find two Premiers of South Australia supporting this proposal, but we find other Premiers of that State taking the opposite view, men like <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jenkins,</inline> who has lately gone to England. It seems to me that, in their anxiety to have this proposal carried, honorable senators from Western Australia have been willing to interpret anything as a promise in support of this railway. I remember that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid</inline> made a speech some time ago at Fremantle. The right honorable gentleman avoided for some considerable time giving any reply on the railway question. He was interrupted frequently by persons amongst his audience, who asked, &#34;What about that railway, George?&#34; </para>

                        <para>-- That was after he became Prime Minister, and honorable senators must see the difference in the position. I do not wish to make any suggestions, but if honorable senators cannot read such signs for themselves, it is not my fault. I believe that if Western Australian representatives had come before us from the commencement with a proposal that the Commonwealth should inquire whether there should be a trans-Australian line running throughout the Commonwealth, they might have found a greater number of supporters. But they have come here, and have endeavoured to force us - because they have exerted considerable pressure, and Western Australia is to be congratulated upon having such strenuous advocates- </para>

                        <para>- I proposed, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> to refer merely as an illustration to certain things to which I shall not now refer in deference to your ruling. But <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest has told us that if we vote for the expenditure of this &#163;20,000 on a survey, we must vote for the construction of the line. He does not desire that any one should vote for this survey who is not prepared to back up that vote by supporting a proposal for the construction of the line. I take the view already voiced by some honorable senators that if honorable senators from Western Australia can induce us to vote &#163;20,000 for the survey of a line from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta the people of Western Australia will be able to say that we believe there is a compact between the Commonwealth and Western Australia for the construction of this line. It will be another piece of evidence to add to the promises of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Holder and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kingston.</inline></para>

                        <para>- I am prepared to show from the records of the Senate that for over two years, &#163;83,000 a month was sent through the Government Savings Bank to the wives and families of Victorian miners who were working in Western Australia. Yet some men have the sublime audacity to say it is a desert. For several reasons, I think that this railway ought to be constructed. It would complete the railway systems of Australia. No one can deny that it is absolutely essential that one of the open gates of Australia - that is Western Australia - should have one means of concentration apart from the sea. We have no chance of considering a proposal to establish a navy. We must have some other means of communication between the east and1 west, and that is a railway. I should not care if it were to be built on a sand bank, or to go over ice, so long as it connected our railway systems. This line ought to be constructed in order that we may be able, at the point of danger - Queensland in the north, or Western Australia in the west - to concentrate our forces to repel an enemy. &#34; Desert railway &#34; is a contemptuous term which has been used by the unspeakable press of Melbourne, and taken up in a parrot-like way by some honorable senators. To my mind, their action is absolutely disgraceful. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> know that the best paying railway in Queensland passes through country which is not settled. The line from Townsville to Charters Towers pays 12J per cent. It traverses poor .country, but when it gets to the terminus it pays. </para>

                        <para>- When the honorable senator talks of this country as a desert he conveys to the mind&#39;s of those who do not think that it is either a mountain or a plain of sand. It has a rich loamy soil which merely needs water. The country to Kalgoorlie was called a desert. Owing to the intrepidity and pluck of a man called Hannan they found a gold-field there,, and it is to-day a more prosperous city than Melbourne. The country from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta is also called a desert. But is that so? Have we not heard that a man went across this country with his 1 wife and family in a &#34; prairie schooner,&#34; without losing a goat, or fowl, or sheep? When a man takes his family in a covered-in cart he does not ride through the country like Lindsay Gordon would ride on Carbine. He must travel by easy stages with his stock, and have a camping place by night. A man travelled across this country without losing one head of stock. </para>

It will be a sorry day for Australia if it does not get railway communication between the east and the west. Do the opponents of this proposal think that Federation between the east and the west, is a mere breath on the atmosphere, or a reality? If it is to be a reality this line must be built. As one who represents a State which has suffered financially from Federation up to the present time, I support the Bill. </para>

                        <para>- That is quite another matter, and I say to our Queensland friends that when they are opposing this railway to Western Australia, they ought to remember that the people of that State, if vindictive and vicious, could refuse to support the bounty to the sugar industry. As we have been liberally and well treated, we ought to be grateful and patriotic enough to give to Western Australia a chance to prove its case. </para>

                    <para>- I do&#39; not think it proper to allow this measure to go to a vote without giving my reasons for my attitude towards it. The Bill provides that the Federation shall exercise the power contained in the 34th article of section 51 of the Constitution - that is, &#34;Railway construction and extension in any State with the consent of that State.&#34; It is clearly laid down by the Constitution that before the Federal Parliament can do anything towards the construction of railways in any State, it must have the consent of that State; not merely a telegram from the Premier of the State, Or an assurance or a letter from him, but an Act passed by the- .Parliament of the State assenting to the Commonwealth entering upon the business of construction. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> insist on the fact that we are not engaged in considering a proposal for construction. What is the meaning of this Bill? Do those honorable senators think that we are a lot of school boys who cannot see an inch before our noses? Is not this Bill a preliminary to construction ? My opinion is that the Senate ought not to embark on a policy of railway construction without very serious consideration. In the first place, this question ought to have been prominently brought before the constituencies at the last general election. We are asked to enter on a policy which involves a great many other things. It involves borrowing money. If persisted1 in, it will interfere with the railway policy of every one of our States. From whatever point of view one likes to regard it, one must see that it is one of the most serious matters that has been brought before the Federal Parliament. Although I, in common with other Queensland representatives, have been accused of coming here with a biased and prejudiced mind,. I can assure honorable senators from Western Australia that it would give me the greatest possible pleasure if I could vote with them. I know that they feel that their credit will be impaired in their State if they fail to carry this measure through the Senate. </para>

                        <para>- They feel that way, rightly or wrongly. Honorable senators have no right to impute motives to those who do not agree with them. I am not imputing motives to any one. I come here to do my duty, first to the Commonwealth, and secondly to the State to which I belong. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie thought more of the Commonwealth, than he does of the State of Western Australia, he would not be supporting a proposal of this character. Why should the Commonwealth embark on a policy of railway construction? Is it not incumbent on those who wish us to embark on this policy to give good reasons? The conduct of both Western Australia and South Australia on this question - more particularly of South Australia - has been absolutely contemptible, if I may use such a word with regard to a State. Just look at the dog-in-the-manger attitude of South Australia. That State says, &#34;You can go on, and spend Commonwealth money, but </para>

                <para>Ave pledge ourselves to nothing.&#34; Apparently it is that State which is conferring the favour of allowing the Commonwealth to build a railway within its territory. Instead of these two States spending their money, one of them - which, as its representatives are fond of telling us, is the richest State in the Commonwealth - asks the Commonwealth to spend the money of all the States. I was over in Western Australia lately, and heard and read glowing accounts of the prosperity of the State. It reminded me of Joseph when he went to Egypt. Joseph was a most successful young man. By-and-by his poor brethren came along, and if Joseph, instead of concealing his identity from them, had taken them round Egypt, and advertised all his magnificent surroundings to them, he would have occupied just the position that the Western Australians occupied towards those who went over from the other States. They said, &#34;Just look at this rich, glorious, magnificent territory of ours ! All that we want to make us comfortable is a little railway, which we invite you poor chaps from the other States - who have built your own railways - who have connected your capitals with the capitals of the other States at your own expense - to build for us.&#34; </para>

                        <para>-I am not saying what I talked about. I read of one mayor in Western Australia who gave as a reason why this railway should be built the fact that the mines in a certain district had paid &#163;20,000,000 in dividends. &#34; Yet,&#34; he said, &#34; the Commonwealth is afraid to spend a paltry three or four millions in building a railway for us !&#34; It occurred to me that the Western Australian Government acted very foolishly in not taxing such huge dividends as that, and retaining in its own hands a sufficient sum to build the. railway, if they thought it necessary. I do not wish to go into the merits and demerits of the proposal. We know very little about the country through which this line is proposed to be constructed. </para>

                        <para>- It is not my particular parish pump. I have not any parish pump. I try to think continentally. I do not wish to introduce the word parochialism, but if it is to be applied to any one I think I could fix it. If the people of Western Australia and South Australia are really in earnest about this railway, they ought to get the route &#39;surveyed themselves. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> suggested that the Western Australian and South Australian Governments should find the money, and that, so that we should not be accused of having no faith in the survey made under the supervision of those States, they should permit the Federal Government to spend the money for them. I think that is a very fair proposal. My honorable friends from Western Australia sneer at it. Of course it does not suit them. But if they have a good thing, and can show the people of the Commonwealth that it would pay to build the railway, I hold that it is their duty, seeing that they are the people who require the railway, to give reasons why the present policy of the Commonwealth should be departed from. It has been said that those who share my view do not represent public feeling in Queensland. So far as I know that public feeling, I do represent it when I vote against this measure. Whenever I spoke on the question - and that was not very often, because it was not really a burning question with us - opposition to the proposal was displayed. The people of Queensland argue that they have incurred a heavy debt in building their own railways - in fact, that they are so deeply in debt that it is not wise to borrow money even to construct railways that are absolutely necessary. In Queensland, the burden of debt is very serious, and it is not desired to add to it if that step can be avoided. I do not wish to enter into the question whether this railway is necessary from a defence point of view. A great many things are necessary for the defence of Australia. We require harbor defences, and not only a railway to Western Australia but a railway to Port Darwin, and also to the Northern Territory, opposite Thursday Island. In fact, if we had the money we could spend &#163;50,000,000 on works which are necessary - if we put it that way - for the defence of Australia. But we &#34;have not the money, and we cannot embark on those works, and for that reason &#39;we must be content to go on for some time as we have been going. I .have no doubt that some day, probably in the near future, the east and west will be joined by a railway. It is more than likely that the people of ten years, twenty years, or twenty-five years hence will see their way clear to carry out such a work, but it would be folly on our part, situated as we are, to embark the Commonwealth on an expenditure which might reach to even more millions than have been mentioned during the course of the debate. I intend to support the amendment, because I think that we ought to have had the consent of South Australia before we even considered the matter. </para>

                    <para>- I should not have troubled the Senate again but for the fact that the public opinion of South Australia on this matter has been questioned. I took part in a series of meetings in all the principal towns of South Australia, and at those meetings, and others, resolutions in favour of this railway were passed without, I think, a dissentient voice. South Australian opinion, so far as I &#34;can interpret it, is undoubtedly in favour of the proposals in this Bill, and that being so, I regard the amendment as a mere subterfuge. </para>

                        <para>- I withdraw the word, because I do not wish to throw a discordant note into the debate at the last moment. There need be no doubt about the public opinion of South Australia. South Australian public men both in the State Parliament and in the Federal Parliament, are undoubtedly in favour of this survey being made. If the rules of debate had been put strictly in force, I am afraid that many of the speakers, during the debate, would have been called to order for departing from the subject-matter of the Bill. We ought to keep the question of the survey before us ; and I am anxious that the matter should be left open for further investigation, if possible. Like other Western Australians, I am not afraid of investigation, though we have had to listen to many remarks to which exception might be taken as to the public opinion of our State on this question. </para>

I know it is difficult to speak to an amendment without dealing, in some degree, at all events, with the main question. But the amendment is simply to strike out certain words with a view to inserting others providing for the formal consent of South Australia, and that has nothing to do with public opinion in Western Australia or a Select Committee. I do not want to hamper honorable senators or to apply the rules too strictly ; but I ask the honorable senator to confine himself, as far as possible, to the amendment. </para>

                        <para>- I see no necessity for asking the consent of South Australia. That consent has already been given through the representatives of that State in the Senate, and in the telegram of the present Premier of the State. The consent asked for is also to be found in the resolutions I have referred to as passed at public meetings. The amendment will merely have the effect of causing delay, and I think there ought to be a straight out vote as to whether the Bill should, be read a second time. </para>

                        <para>- Before putting the question, I should like to say a word or two as to the vote I am about to give. I am going to vote for the second reading of the Bill. When I was before my constituents in South Australia I was asked on several occasions whether I would vote for the construction of this railway by the Commonwealth, and I said I would; and I am going to carry that promise into effect. Whether I was wise in making such a promise or not is another question, and whether I should make that promise again after what I have heard in the debate, is also open to doubt. But I made the promise, and I am going to keep it. </para>
