                        <para>- I wish to ask the Minister of Defence, without notice, a question arising out of his reply yesterday to my question regarding the number of meetings which have .been held by the Board appointed to inquire' into the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Richmond,</inline> in British New Guinea. He will remember that he said that one. meeting had been held, namely, on the 5th October. I wish to ask the Minister whether he thinks that the method adopted to investigate this case is an expeditious one ; whether Ft is fair to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Richmond</inline> to have his case so long undecided ; and whether, if the Board cannot soon come to a determination, he will endeavour to get a stipendiary or other magistrate appointed to take the place of any Commissioner who is unable to take part in the inquiry. </para>

I do not think he ought to ask me to comment on a matter which affects my colleagues, and of which I have no personal knowledge. </para>

                        <para>- I have conferred with the Postmas.ter-General. and have learned from him and from the Department that the question of calling for new tenders has received his earnest attention, and that it is now engaged in prosecuting a large number of inquiries for the purpose of obtaining information which is absolutely required before it can frame the conditions. That information is not expected to be to hand before, at the earliest, the end of this month, and it will not be possible to frame the conditions before the beginning of the new year, even if bv then. Under the circumstances, it will be impossible to lay upon the table the conditions on which the tenders for a new mail service will be called. </para>

                    <para>This Bill is necessary in consequence of the Sugar Bounty Bill which we passed yesterday. It provides that the Excise on sugar shall be 4s. per cwt., as against the present Excise of 3s. The present rate would, under the existing Act, remain in operation until January 1907. The Bill, as it passed the other House, imposes no limitation of time, but it has been pointed out to me, and my colleagues confirm the suggestion, that it would be well to adopt a similar system to that which has been adopted wilh regard to the bounty - so as to limit the operation of the Excise to the end of the year 1913, and also to have a sliding scale for the two last years. </para>

                            <para>- It is considered by another place that it would be advisable to make the latter alteration. My own opinion is that if we pass the Bill as it stands we shall confer an advantage, not only on the .producer of sugar by white labour, but also on the employer of black labour. That it is not proposed to do. </para>

                        <para>- The suggestion of the Minister in charge of the Bill is a most extraordinary one, in view of the long debate and the arrangement, finally arrived at yesterday. We spent hours and hours in calculating the payments that would be made and the money that would be received by the Treasurer. There was no proposition by the Minister that the Excise should be reduced or affected even by <inline font-style="italic">£I,</inline> much less by <inline font-style="italic">£4.</inline> It is simply playing with Parliament when, having made an arrangement in the expectation that the Excise Bill would be carried as presented to us, we find that the understanding; is given the go-by. </para>

                            <para>- On Friday last,, when the Minister introduced the Sugar Bounty Bill, I asked whether we might have the Excise Bill before us, so that it might be made certain that the additional Excise would be imposed before we consented to permit the payment of an additional bounty. Exclamations from all sides of the Sena'te showed that the general view of honorable senators was that the two Bills should be considered together. We have agreed to the one Bill, with certain amendments; but now a proposal is made by the Government for an alteration of a drastic character in the second. The suggestion that after a certain number of years the Excise is to be absolutely destroyed, and the revenue from sugar - which the representatives of every State who have spoken have declared to be very important - decreased, is most improper. The people are still expected to pay <inline font-style="italic">£z</inline> per ton additional duty, but there' is to be,, at the end of the period named by the Minister, an absolute cessation of the £4 per ton Excise contributed by the trade to the public Treasury, representing something like ,£800,000. Are we prepared, at the end of a given period, to strike off the whole Excise at one blow? The proposal is simply monstrous. </para>

                            <para>- I think I can make the matter clear in a few words. What I propose to do now is to set a period coterminus with the period imposed in the Bill with which we dealt last night. I propose now to ask the Senate to insert in this measure the words " until the 1st day of January, 1913." If honorable members in another place choose to suggest some other alterations, they will have to be considered by us. </para>

                            <para>- I shall be very glad if any sufficient explanation can be given for what seems to me to be a very unsatisfactory position.- The Excise Act, passed four years ago, certainly did provide for trie termination of both Excise and bounty at a certain time. We have agreed to an extension of the bounty for a number of years. It was quite understood that the arrangement entered into yesterday meant that at the end of that time the industry would have to be content with the difference between the Excise and the Customs duties. </para>

                        <para>- I am inclined heartily to fall in with the suggestion of the Minister. Whatever may be the merits or demerits of any proposal to limit the operation of the Excise Bill under ordinary circumstances, one has to remember, so far as this Bill is concerned, that we can only take ' it into consideration with due regard to the Tariff. I venture to say that long before 1913, this, or some other Chamber, will have an opportunity to discuss the whole Tariff question, and then can be reconsidered the extent and effect of the duty imposed on sugar under the Excise Bill. For the present, it seems quite immaterial whether the limit be fixed at 1913, or any other year. Parliament is simply left free to consider the whole matter between now and 1913; but the proposal throws on Parliament the obligation to reconsider the question if nothing is done in the meantime. Seeing that the Government have met us to some extent, and bearing in mind the absence of any disadvantages, I think we may fairly fall in with the proposal, and allow the Bill to go into Committee. </para>

                            <para>- In any case, I wish to make it clear that I object to sugar contributing anything to the revenue. At present, the Excise is <inline font-style="italic">£4</inline> and the bounty <inline font-style="italic">£5,</inline> while the Commonwealth revenue from this source is <inline font-style="italic">£1</inline> per ton. When the bounty is reduced to <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> the Excise will remain at <inline font-style="italic">£4,</inline> and the revenue will be £2, and so when, in the last year, the bounty is reduced to <inline font-style="italic">£1,</inline> the Excise will still be <inline font-style="italic">£4,</inline> and the revenue will be increased to £$ per ton. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford's</inline> prophecy is fulfilled, and there are 200,000 tons of sugar produced within the Commonwealth, we shall be in the happy position, from the indirect taxationists' point of view, of receiving £600,000 in revenue from sugar. </para>

                            <para>- From my point of view, it is one of the worst things imaginable that we should obtain revenue from sugar. We have removed the duty, not only from tea, but from kerosene. We have endeavoured to as nearly as possible have a free breakfast table within the Commonwealth, and yet it is now proposed to impose a crushing tax of this character, not to create an industry, but, as I said last night, to save the skins of the land monopolists and wealthy people of Australia. </para>

There are, however, other honorable senators who, unlike the gentlemen to whom I refer, do not understand their own policy. If we agree to this proposal with our eyes open, well and good. The only effect is to stave off the day of direct taxation, and make it more and more difficult for the people of Australia to break up the land monopoly. We are imposing burden after burden on the poor in order to relieve the rich. I ask honorable senators, who belong to the Labour Party, whether they are really serious in supporting this amendment. </para>

                            <para>- My proposal is that as the bounty is reduced the Excise ought to be reduced. The amendment before us, instead of making the position of the white man better, as compared with the position of the black man, will place the two more and more on a level - will make it more difficult to turn the black man out, and leave the white man in full possession of the industry. That may be the idea of my friends on the right, but it is not the policy of those who are faithful to the White Australia ideal. </para>

                <para class="block">Perhaps it will be convenient on this amendment to inform the Committee of the general scope of the amendments which have been made by the House of Representatives. Attached to the message there is a schedule in which are set out some forty five amendments, which the House of Representatives has made to the Bill as sent down by the Senate. The first amendment is to provide that, instead of the Minister for Home Affairs appearing in the original Act as the Minister administering the Act, reference shall be to the Minister " of State administering the Act." Honorable senators will remember that suggestions have been made at different times that some other Minister than the Minister of Home Affairs, such as the Postmaster- General, for instance, might possibly be charged with the administration of the Electoral Act. If any such suggestion were to be adopted at any time, if this amendment be agreed to, no further alteration of the Act will be necessary to give effect to it. When the Bill was before us, we made provision in several clauses for the express repeal of sections of the original Act, which had been framed with regard to the then existing conditions, in order that the preparation of the first rolls and the first elections might be held under the Act. The operation of those sections had become exhausted, and we provided accordingly in the amending Bill for the repeal of those sections. There were, however, some other sections of the original Act which we did not repeal, and the operation of which have become likewise exhausted - sections connected with disputed returns dealing with matters to be attended to until the establishment of the High Court. Those sections are repealed by some of the amendments passed in another place. Perhaps the most important amendment, or series of amendments, which the House of Representatives has made to the Bill is connected with the question of the distribution of the States into electorates. The original Act provided a scheme by which the States should be distributed, and that the scheme and plans of the distribution proposed should be laid before Parliament and approved before the distribution could have the effect of law. Amendments were made in this Bill when it was before the Senate to provide for. the appointment of three Commissioners to distribute the States into electorates, and it was decided that their distribution should not be subject to ratification or disapproval by Parliament. The House of Representatives, in striking out the amendments made in the Senate, have, in fact, restored the Bill to its original shape in this regard. Honorable senators will remember that one of the ground's for the redistribution of the States into new electorates as provided by us was that one-third of the electorates in any State should be out of balance ; that is to say, that the number of electors in one-third of the electorates at least should be either in excess or below the quota by a certain proportion. The House of Representatives has altered that one-third of the electorates to one fourth. We provided in one clause in dealing with the matter of when a redistribution should take place, as a final case, whenever the Governor-General so directed. In order to make it perfectly clear that that should lie an entirely separate matter, the House of Representatives have inserted words which I think were suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> in the Senate, providing that, notwithstanding anything in the preceding <inline font-style="italic">cases</inline> mentioned, a redistribution shall also take place when the Governor-General may direct. Provision was made in the Bill as it left the Senate by which the rolls might be used for State and Commonwealth purposes. There has been some redrafting of the provisions dealing with this matter. </para>

                        <para>- I think so. I think that the amendments made do not alter the spirit of the clauses as they passed the Senate. There was some surplusage in the clauses as we agreed to them, and the redrafting has reduced their volume without, I think, in any way altering the principle. In connexion with the claim forms by which applications are made for registration as electors,, the House of Representatives has made an amendment, which dispenses with the necessity to witness a claim form, so that, as a matter of fact, under the Bill, as amended in another place, an applicant for a vote will be able to send in his claim as he would ordinarily send in a letter. Honorable senators are aware that the Bill when before the Senate contained important provisions dealing with the abolition of revision courts, and we provided that returning officers and other officials might lodge objections to the name of any person being on the roll. The House of Representatives has made an amendment in connexion with that procedure, whereby it will be obligatory on officers making official objections in the way provided to make them in' writing and tq state the grounds. Under the original Act a minimum penalty of £5 was imposed on persons lodging frivolous objections. That provision in the original Act was made in connexion with the holding of revision courts, and was not included in the amending Bill, which provided for the abolition of those courts. But the House of Representatives has re-inserted the provision in this Bill, and asks the concurrence of the Senate. In the original Act there was a provision under which a person five miles away from his polling place on polling day, or who had reason to believe that he would be that distance away from the polling place on that day could obtain an absent voter's certificate and vote by post. When the amending Bill was, before us, we increased the distance to ten miles, and the House of Representatives has made an amendment which amounts, in fact, to a compromise, fixing the distance at seven miles. In discussing the clauses dealing with voting by post, frequent reference was made here to the fact that many applications for postal-vote certificates were made which were not in conformity with the spirit of the legislation providing for their issue. It was suggested that the provisions of the Act in this regard were open to grave abuse. The House of Representatives has made amendments under which these applications for postal-vote certificates, having 'been lodged with an official, would afterwards be open to public inspection, on application, until the time for an appeal against the election had elapsed. _ Considerable discussion arose concerning the classes of persons to be authorized witnesses in connexion with the postal-voting provisions. The House of Representatives, in amending the Bill as it left the Senate, has provided that they shall not be witnessed by persons in charge of post-offices unless they are permanent officials of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- I indicated that when the matter was under discussion in the Senate, and an honorable senator who had moved the omission of medical practitioners thereupon withdrew his amendment. An amendment has. been made in another place, providing that where an official votes for a blind person, he shall do so only in the presence &gt;of a witness. That, I think, is a very desirable provision. We agreed that public notifications in connexion with elections should bear the name of the persons authorizing their publication ; and the House of Representatives has made an amendment eliminating from the provision ordinary advertisements announcing merely the holding of meetings. There was considerable discussion in the Senate in connexion with the practice of canvassing at, or near, a polling booth. The Bill, as introduced, prohibited canvassing within a radius of twenty-five yards of the polling booth, but that provision was struck out. The House of Representatives has on this matter suggested what may be considered a compromise, and we are asked to agree to an amendment providing that canvassing shall not be permitted at the entrance to, or within a polling booth. </para>

                        <para>- As the clause left the Senate, we prohibited canvassing at the entrance to a polling booth, and the Committee, I regret to say, did not adopt a definite radius. These are, in the main, the amendments properly so-called - that is, alterations of the provisions in the Bill as it left the Senate'. There are some minor alterations which are merely verbal and of no consequence so far as substance is concerned. In addition to asking us to consent to those alterations, " the other House asks us to insert some new clauses. One of them provides that it shall be competent for a person who has been nominated for an election to consent to the withdrawal of his nomination up to the last hour for receiving nominations. Another new clause provides that in the event of a, person having been nominated for election dying before polling day his deposit may be returned to his personal representative. Another new clause provides that if a claim to vote has been given to a person, with the intention that he shall send it in to be attended to, and he has failed to do so, he shall be liable to a penalty, unless he can prove that his omission was purely <inline font-style="italic">bond fide.</inline> I 'believe that, under certain circumstances,,, persons have got claimants to hand to them claims to vote, and said that they would be sent along in due course, and that the claimants would be enrolled as electors; but, finding that their views were of the wrong colour, they have omitted to transmit the claims, and consequently when the claimants have gone to vote, they have found that they had not been enrolled. To prevent a practice of that kind from being pursued., it is provided that a penalty shall attach to any sucH omission, unless the receiver of the claim can show that it should not attach. Another new clause provides that, if necessary, employers shall allow to their employes a certain time off, not to exceed two hours, for the purpose of attending the polling place and voting, and that it shall be allowed without any disproportionate reduction of the men's wages. A further new clause provides that the Court of Disputed Returns, in dealing with any matter, mav report to the Minister the occurrence of any illegal practices in connexion with an election. Then the House of Representatives provides that in connexion with the Court, counsel or solicitors shall not be engaged on behalf of a party, unless with the consent of both parties. There is not even provision made that the Court itself may grant leave for the employment of counsel or solicitors. </para>

                        <para>- No. The honorable senator knows that if a candidate were to take advantage of those provisions, it would mean that the other person would have to be prosecuted on information or indictment, but under this new clause he could be punished summarily by a Court of summary jurisdiction acting under the Judiciary Act. We are asked by the other House to insert a. new clause, providing for a reduced rate in connexion with telegrams containing matter relative to an election, so long as they contain only - the names of divisions, names of candidates, and the numbers of votes polled for each candidate, and lodged for transmission on the day of or before noon on the day after the day of election may, subject to regulations, be transmitted on payment of the rates prescribed in the Second Part of the Second Schedule to the Post and Telegraph Kates Act 1902." </para>

                <para class="block">That js to say, at press rates. There is also a new clause to provide a reduced rate for posting election addresses.

                    <para>-I am obliged to the Minister for outlining this very lengthy list of amendments, which, under ordinary circumstances,, would, I think, have provided material for at least a week's work. The fact that, in order to consider the amendments, one has to be provided with the Act. the Bill as introduced here, the Bill as it left here, and a schedule of the amendments made by the other House, will give an idea as to the intricate problems which is presented to those who desire to ascertain what changes have been made. That is another argument in favour of the contention that the Government ought to have brought in an amending Bill, instead of proceeding as they have done. There are two amendments to which, at the proper time, I shall invite attention. It will be remembered that I took an active part with regard to an amendment to place in the hands of a Commission the duty of subdividing each State into electorates, rather than to leave the plans of the Commissioners to be submitted for the approval of each House of the Parliament. I propose to ask the Committee to adhere to its decision, for reasons which I shall submit by-and-by. The other matter on which, I think, it might reasonably be asked to express its opinion, is the insertion of a new clause which proposes to make considerable financial concessions to candidates for election. I am entirely opposed to that proposition. Of course, the Minister, in merely indicating the scope of the amendments was not required to address any argument in its favour. The Senate is largely ignored, and that arises entirely from the fact that we have been content to take a subordinate position. I cannot conceive of any argument justifying them which will at all outweigh the strong feeling which is found to be entertained throughout the constituencies if it is seen that the Legislature has conferred any special concessions or privileges upon those who constitute the Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- I have a few observations to make as to why this clause should not be omitted. There are two points to which I propose to address myself ; first, the merits of the proposal itself, and, secondly, the position of the Senate with regard to the other House in the shaping of the laws of this country. So far as the proposal itself is concerned, honorable senators will Be aware that it has been advocated on the ground that it is always difficult to expect a House of Parliament, the individual members of which are directly concerned, to be entirely free from personal bias or prejudice in matters of this kind. It was therefore thought by the Senate - and I hope we think so still - that this question should be taken altogether from Parliament, and placed in the hands of an absolutely impartial Commission, I could expand that argument, but the matter was before the Senate so recently that I do not propose to do so. But I would remind honorable senators, in justification of the fear expressed during the debate, that not long ago we had in the Federal Parliament itself subdivision schemes rejected with the result in the case of my own State - and I believe in two other States as well - a most inequitable representation of the people was secured. It was inequitable in this respect that on the one hand we had electorates of 10,000 and 12,000, and on the other hand, electorates of 30,000 people, having the same voice in the shaping of the laws of the country. The basis of our parliamentary system is. certainly equality of voting power. By general reasoning and experience we should be convinced that it is essential to remove from members, who are so directly and personally interested, the whole question of determining the boundaries of their individual electorates. I come now to what, to my mind, is an even more important reason why the Senate should adhere to its proposal. That the Minister should ask us to agree to the amendment of another place was inevitable. On a similar occasion some time since - though not in this session - I pointed out that it was unfortunate for the Senate, and one of the factors which was likely to weaken this Chamber, that we never could expect Ministers here to champion the rights of the Senate with regard to legislation; that whenever a dispute occurred between the two Houses, Ministers in the Senate were practically bound to support the. decision of the other House, and to ask us to surrender our will to the House of Representatives. That arises from the fact that a large number of Ministers are in the other House, and that' that House more directly controls the fate of Governments. I pointed out that the Senate was seriously handicapped in having those who conduct its business, standing as advocates of the rights of the other Chamber against the Senate. That position is illustrated to-day. I make these remarks without personally reflecting upon the Minister in charge of the Bill, or his colleague. The position seems to me to arise from the facts of the case. It would occur whatever Minister was in charge, and whatever members of the Senate held office. I direct attention to the matter not so much with a view of criticising Ministers, as of pointing out the facts that have to be taken into consideration, by the Senate, if it wishes to maintain the rights which the Constitution confers upon it. I have pointed out the disabilities under which the Senate is. placed in the fact that the Ministers who should be the natural leaders of any movement for the assertion of its rights naturally become advocates of the rights of the other Chamber. Another matter upon which I desire to touch is as to the right of the Senate to express its .will or to insist upon that expression being observed in relation to this matter. The chief argument, so far as I have been able to learn, against the proposal of the Senate is that this is .a subject which comes more exclusively within the province of the other branch of the Legislature, seeing that it affects the electorates of members of the House of Representatives. But I venture to say that there never has been brought before the Senate a proposal in which State rights were more closely involved than they are in this. The subdivision of a State into electorates affects the States, as States ; because the acceptance or, rejection, of a subdivision scheme may deprive a State of representation to which it is entitled, or may secure to a State representation to which it is not entitled. Let us take the case of a redistribution being necessary after a census has been taken. Let it be assumed that, as the result of that census, one State is entitled to more members, and another State to less, than it previously enjoyed. A subdivision scheme is designed. It is submitted to the House of Representatives, which rejects it. It never comes before the Senate, and it would not matter if it did, because the proposal of the House of Representatives is that both Houses must approve. In the case which I have indicated, where the redistribution would secure larger representation to one State and smaller to another, the rejection of the subdivision scheme by the House of Representatives would have the effect of depriving one State of additional representation, and of securing to another State representation to which it was not entitled. Therefore, I say that it is entirely a matter of State concern which, properly comes within the functions which the Constitution imposes upon the Senate;. For that reason I hope that the Senate will stand by its proposal. Honorable senators are aware that not long since a member of this Chamber, who took a very prominent part in shaping the Constitution, expressed his profound dissatisfaction as to the state into which the Senate was drifting as a coordinate branch of the Federal Legislature and I am sure that if honorable senators expressed their candid opinion they would share that dissatisfaction. The Senate has not taken up that strong position which it was expected to occupy when Federation was first launched. It is rapidly drifting into the position not of a glorified Legislative Council, but of a Legislative Council unglorified. </para>

That is the first factor which induces the belief that the Senate is assuming the character of a Legislative Council.

We have only to contrast the newspaper reports of the debates in this and another Chamber on the sugar bonus question. That question was debated without any squabbling in another place, and was reported at considerable length, although no amendment was there affected. On the other hand, very scanty notice was taken of the debate in the Senate, where an amendment was made. </para>

If I am correct, that the Senate is drifting into the position of a secondary Chamber, entirely contrary to the Constitution, it is quite evident that at some time we shall be absolutely ignored. If honorable senators do not believe in the proposal which. I have laid before them, I do not ask them to vote for it; but if they are convinced of its soundness, there is no reason why we should not insist on giving expression to our view. There is no better question on which the Senate could assert its undoubted constitutional rights. This is a matter which involves a question of deep-seated concern to the States, and also loyal obedience to the Constitution, which provides for equal representation. That equal representation can be obtained only by some automatic scheme applied to the several </para>

In my opinion, both Houses of Parliament ought to reserve the right to revise any electoral divisions made by outside persons. Parliament is responsible to itself and to the people, and ought to maintain this right of revision. Persons outside Parliament, who have this duty imposed upon them, may, for various reasons, though not want only, or with any wrong intent, mark out divisions which are not suitable; and, under such circumstances, Parliament ought to have an opportunity to express an opinion. </para>

                        <para>-C'ol. GOULD (New South Wales). - I can understand the attitude assumed by the Minister. In the first place, the proposal under discussion was not introduced by the Government, but by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> and, in the next place, the Government doubtless desire to get this Bill out of hand as rapidly as possible. Under the circumstances, there may be a somewhat clouded view as to the right of the Senate to insist on such an important amendment in the electoral law. In matters in which Parliament ana individual Members of Parliament are interested, it would be well if means were provided by which decisions could be arrived at by people altogether independent and impartial. That principle has already been recognised in the case of disputed elections. In many Parliaments such questions are dealt with by a Committee, and, unfortunately, party feeling enters unduly into their considerations. Very often decisions are given which could not be justified on the ground of abstract right; if any flagrant violation of the law can be kept out of the public gaze, party feeling enters very largely into the decisions. However, the Commonwealth Parliament is endeavouring to improve itself in " this respect, and, without any regard to the question of interference by one House with the other, I think that the House of Representatives is proceeding on altogether a false basis when it claims for Parliament the right to decide as to the reasonableness of electoral divisions. It might as well be said that one of the Houses of Parliament should have the right to direct the Judges in the administration of the law. Parliament lays down laws and prescribes certain punishments, but it is quite recognised that Parliament is not the proper tribunal to determine particular cases. A certain basis has been laid down for the demarcation df electorates, and we may take it for granted that fewer mistakes are likely to be made by an independent tribunal than by either House of Parliament. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has already pointed out that, owing to the absence, of agreement as to a scheme in the last  Parliament, constituencies were really gerrymandered, with the result that there was gross  inequality  in representation. No man can justify 12,000 persons in one electorate having the same power, weight, and influence in Parliament as have 30,000 or co. 000 electors in another electorate. This Parliament has one more session to live through; .and the population has shifted in such a way as to deprive one State of a member, and give an additional member to another State. Until there is a redistribution it is impossible to get these inequalities remedied, and if no agreement can be arrived at, the elections will take place on the old scheme and the anomalies will continue. In the next Parliament, the representatives of the people will have a keen eye to the elections, and it will be difficult for a man to reconcile his constituents to the fact that he assented to the loss of a-. representative without " putting up a good fight." </para>

                        <para>-Col. GOULD.- By that means, the representation was made disproportionate; it was altogether wrong, irregular, and contrary to the principle laid down in the Constitution. Although the representatives of Victoria have endeavoured to prove that they are entitled to continue with their present representation, cold statistics are too much for them. In my opinion, it is much better to allow all these matters to be dealt with by an independent tribunal. On the 26th October last, as reported on page 4144 of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> the division in favour of the proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> was carried by a majority of four, and I hope that the Senate will' adhere to its previous decision. It may be said that to insist on the amendment will' cause some difficulty between the Houses. It may be that we shall be unable to pass th'is measure during the present .session, but, in my opinion, it would be far better to insist upon our amendment, even at the expense of losing the Bill, and having to reconsider the whole question next session. The amendment we made in the Bill, as introduced, deals with a matter of very great importance, and it is one which the Senate had a perfect right to insert in any measure dealing with' the Electoral law. As representatives of the States, we are even more interested in the fair and equitable division of those States into electorates than are individual members in another place, who' representing particular portions of each State, are naturally anxious to keep them within such metes and bounds as will suit their purpose when they have to seek reelection. I make that statement without imputing any dishonorable motives whatever to honorable members in another place. </para>

The amendment agreed to by the Senate left the important question of the distribution of the States into electorates in the hands of a Commission, and declared that the Federal Parliament had nothing whatever to do with it. </para>

                        <para>- Let us deal with one thing at a time. We have no right to hand over our constitutional rights to an outside Commission. Why should we give outside Commissioners the right to distribute the seats, and say : " We shall not review your work, no matter how ridiculously you perform it." I hold that Parliament should always retain the power to revise the work that it in trusts to Commissioners. I hope that the Committee will not, in this matter, attempt to dictate to the House of Representatives. The amendment which was carried on the Bill, as introduced involves, in my opinion, dictation of a very offensive kind to honorable members in another place. The right thing for us to do is to comply with their wishes, and reverse the decision to which we came when we last dealt with this matter. </para>

                    <para>- I conceive it to be my duty to support the clause which I supported before. I am not concerned with the fact that certain honorable members in another place have criticised our action as an impertinence, and I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> that they will probably regret having expressed such an opinion. I am not in any way influenced by the statement that we are dictating to another place, nor shall I put the matter on the low ground on which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie has put it. We have not to consider the rights and privileges of honorable members in another place, but our duty to the electors of the Commonwealth. A vital principle is involved in the clause to which we agreed!, and I am not prepared to abrogate my duty in dealing with the matter. There is no dictation to the other place in what we did, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie has misstated the issue. We might mention one or two instances to show the danger of the course upon which honorable members in another place are asking us to enter. The Reid McLean Government was kept in office for some months by two votes - that is, by the support of one honorable member. I would ask honorable senators what would take place in that Chamber, or in any other composed of human beings, if the fate of the Government depended upon whether a certain Commissioner drew lines in one direction or in another, and the persons interested had to decide the matter. It is monstrous to suggest that we should in this connexion depart from the principle that men are not good judges in their own cause. We should remit the settlement of this matter, as we have done in many other cases to a judicial and disinterested tribunal. In Tasmania, when it was found necessary to alter the boundaries of two or three electorates, the Premier of the day, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Elliott</inline> Lewis, gave his consent to a redistribution of seats, which' absolutely wiped out his own constituency, and included most of it in the constituency of Brighton, which I used to represent. He decided not to oppose the gentleman who represented Brighton, and that gentleman was re-elected, whilst <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Elliott</inline> Lewis was defeated in contesting one of the Hobart constituencies. Although he was the ablest man in the Parliament, he was defeated, in consequence of the redistribution which had been made. If he had been a professional or party politician, with a following behind him, he could have found many reasons, honorable on the face of them, to prevent his old constituency of Richmond being wiped out. </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline>
                    in this matter. If is most unfortunate that it should be brought up for discussion on the last day of the session. If sufficient time were given for its consideration, I believe that the Committee would recognise the wisdom of the course taken in the first instance, and would adhere to it. Possibly the indirect threat that if we adhere to our amendment we may lose the measure, will have its effect, but! the principle involved is of so much importance that I hope such a threat will be treated as it deserves. The object of the amendment we made was to remove the settlement of this important question from the decision of interested parties. There can be no doubt that honorable members in another place would be influenced by their personal interests in dealing with such a matter and the same bias would no doubt affect the decision of members of the Senate if they were placed in a similar position.

                        <para>- This Parliament has already given the Minister of Trade and Customs powers exceeding those conferred upon any Minister in any other part of the world. He has been made the sole arbiter, under the Commerce Bill, in matters affecting the whole of the commercial interests of the Commonwealth, involving exports and imports to the value of millions of pounds. Every thoughtful man must agree that this is a question the settlement of which should be taken out of the hands of those who are personally interested, and placed in the hands of Commissioners, who will be entirely disinterested. I venture to say that if that were not done there is not a member of the other House who, if he "found that his political interests were likely to be prejudiced by a redistribution, would not immediately do his best to get it altered. There would be a scramble on the part of members of the other House to see that their electorates were so partitioned as to best serve their interests, for we cannot regard them as being superior to those selfish instincts which are inherent in human nature. Surely the members of the Senate who have no personal interest in the division of the States should be in a better position to deal with this phase of political life than the members of the other House can be. For that reason, I shall vote to adhere to our amendment, and I hope that the Committee will pay no attention to the threats, direct or indirect, about dropping the Bill, but will, as trustees for the people, do what in their opinion will conduce to the best interests of the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>- As the Senate is a co-ordinate branch of the Parliament, I cannot admit that the other House should have any more power with regard to the division of the States into electorates than it has. Each State is represented by six senators, and we are all supposed to take a broader view of questions than are the representatives of divisions of a State. Unfortunately, we have had a notable instance in which, from the want of a similar provision, New South Wales has been practically deprived of an additional member, and we cannot, without protest, admit that such a state of things should continue. Let us look at the provision in the new clause. The Commission would be altogether free from political ties, and would include a Judge of the Supreme Court of a State, the Surveyor-General, or head of the Survey Department of the State, and the Commonwealth Electoral Officer for the State, unless the Governor-General should think fit to appoint a gentleman to act on behalf of any one of them who could not perform the duty. It is our duty to see that the provisions of the Constitution are carried out. Why any politician should be at liberty to tamper with the Constitution, I fail to understand. In fact, our own action in appointing Judges to try disputed returns proves that we have found, by experience, that sometimes an outside authority will take a more impartial view than we can. I was on a Select Committee of the Senate in which, unfortunately, party feeling was carried to such an extent that, although we met over! and over again, we could not come to a satisfactory conclusion in regard to a petition against the appointment of a senator. I was very much struck then with the advisability of having an impartial tribunal like the Supreme Court to settle a matter of that sort. In like manner, I think that justice will more probably be done by adhering to our clause. Unfortunately, there is a tendency outside to look upon the Senate as a sort of revising Chamber. Even members of the other House have sometimes twitted us about it. Let us avail ourselves of this splendid opportunity to maintain the dignity of the Senate by adhering to our previous decision. </para>

                    <para>- I do not think that we ought to be influenced by the fact that members of the other House have expressed themselves in an unkind or improper way in regard to our action. We ought to view this matter from a right stand-point. I do not see any reason for departing from our previous judgment. In matters of this sort, it is in the highest degree desirable that any decision should be given by an entirely impartial tribunal. I have had, I suppose, as much experience in electoral matters as has the majority of the people. Time after time I have found that a correct decision has been prejudiced by the action of interested parties when they had to be the judges.

Therefore I trust that the Committee will firmly adhere to its clause. </para>

                    <para>- In his address, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie seemed to confuse the issue as between the right of Parliament to legislate and the transfer of that right to some other body. In my speech I endeavoured to explain that in our action we were really asserting the rights of the Parliament, because we were prescribing the conditions under which the Commissioners should give their decision. The Commissioners provided for in the clause would not be men of whom we should have no knowledge, but men with whom we should be thoroughly well acquainted, and upon whom we could rely to do what was fair, just, and reasonable. If a man has committed an offence, he is not tried by the Parliament, but by some authority whom it has appointed for that purpose. The Parliament was called' upon to provide for the division of the States into electorates, and it laid down the rules under which that work shall be done, and prescribed the persons by whom they were to be carried into effect. I think that if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie will look at the question from that clear stand-point, he will see that the Parliament is not asked to surrender any of its rights. </para>

Persons might be upon the boundary of a division, and it would be more convenient for them to vote at a polling place outside their own division than in that division.

                    <para>- I wish to understand the effect of the amendment made by another place. Hitherto it has been the custom to establish polling booths all over the State of Queensland, at which electors can vote outside their own divisions. For instance, a man can vote in Brisbane for any division in Queensland. If this amendment is carried, it appears to me that that arrangement will be knocked upon the head. </para>

                    (Tasmania- Honorary Minister). - This amendment will not interfere with the present arrangements, but is intended to meet certain classes of cases. Where it may be convenient for a number of electors living on the boundary of an extensive constituency to vote at a polling place in an adjoining constituency, they will be permitted to do so.

                        <para>- But that provision of the Bill did not seem to contemplate the appointment of special polling places. What <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> has described applies also to Tasmania. One can vote in Launceston or Hobart for any electorate in the State. But this amendment will clearly indicate the class of cases to which I have referred. </para>

                    (New South Wales). - The Minister's answer makes it clear that this amendment is either unnecessary or highly pernicious. First he says that this provision will not interfere with the existing arrangement. The Governor-General already has power to make a polling place for a division in another division a mile away from it, or 500 miles away. But, on the other hand, the insertion of this amendment will limit the Governor-General to the appointment of a polling place outside the boundary of a division. On the well-known principle that where a certain thing is expressed other things are excluded, the amendment ought not to be agreed to. If the Governor-General wished to appoint a polling place in Adelaide to be the polling place for some other part of South Australia, he would not be able to do it, because it might be said that the other division was more than ten miles away. I ask the Committee to reject the amendment.

                        <para>- I desire to take this opportunity to make a personal explanation. It will be remembered that just before the adjournment a dispute arose between <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> and myself as to authority for pairs. I have since ascertained that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has authority from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> to pair him, and that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> has given a " dead " pair, which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> can call for at any time. I have to say that I was entirely under a misapprehension. At the same time, it would be much more satisfactory if authority of this kind were exercised before the bells stopped ringing, so as to avoid misunderstanding. </para>

                    <para>-I draw attention to the fact that these amendments open up a question which was discussed when the Bill was originally before the Committee. The effect of them is to place those charged with the administration of the Bill in a possible difficulty.. As honorable senators are aware, it is quite optional whether those who administer the Act divide the electorate into subdivisions or polling places, or leave it as one division. The amendments have been passed on the assumption that there will be subdivisions, but if there are not, there can only be one roll for a division. The provision was that where there was. a subdivision roll, an electors could have his name on that roll, or, otherwise, on the polling place roll, but that when there was no polling place or subdivision roll, then the name went on the general roll. </para>

                        <para>- In any case, the electors have access to other public servants, whereas in the back-blocks the person in charge of the post-office may be the only official within a day's journey. It has been suggested that these persons in charge of post-offices may not be respectable - that they may be more amenable to questionable influences than other public servants. If they are not respectable they should not be permitted to hold even unofficial positions in the service of the Commonwealth. The suspicious frame of mind which seems to possess certain honorable senators is, in my opinion, a real affliction. They should proceed on the assumption that every man is honest until he has been discovered in the perpetration of some dishonorable act. Instead of that, every man who has not the hall mark of the Commonwealth Public Service, and is not stamped eighteen carat as a Public Service officer, is not regarded as an honest man. This is a flagrant libel upon a large section of the citizens of the Commonwealth. What we should consider is the convenience of the people for whom this system of voting was devised, and at times a person in charge of a post-office may be the only witness available to an elector unless he is prepared to undertake a journey which may involve the loss of a day in hunting up a legal witness under this clause. </para>

                    <para>-I regard this amendment as a positive insult to the unpaid magistracy. It is absurd to suggest that justices of the peace should not be capable of witnessing an application by a man to be entered on the electoral roll. I should look upon justices as the very best men for the purpose. </para>

                    (Queensland). - Being a justice of the peace myself, I naturally feel some delicacy in dealing with this amendment. It would appear that the letters "J.P. " after a man's name, instead of being the hall mark of uprightness, integrity, and honesty, are regarded as the sign manual of iniquity. That is how the letters have been interpreted by our honorable friends in another place. I do not consider whether individual justices of the peace have acted wrongly or rightly, but I look at the question broadly, and consider whether it would be a convenience to the electors if justices of the peace were permitted to witness these applications. I think that it would. The justice of the peace holds an official public position. If he abuses his office he ought to be brought to book in the ordinary fashion, but until he does so we should proceed on the assumption that the State has been justified in appointing him to that honorable position. In the bush it is almost impossible to get a public servant who could witness these applications, and justices of the peace are often the only persons available for the purpose. I hope the Committee will not agree to the amendment.

He must recognise that when this Bill left the Senate we included justices of the peace in the list of authorized witnesses, but the other House has ventured to strike that out. What <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> now asks the Committee to do, without the slightest tremor, and without any evidence of nervousness that I could discover, is to disagree with an amendment suggested by the House of Representatives. </para>

                        <para>- Because I happened to be sitting on this side, and because I believe in the proposal. I recognise that certain honorable senators have absolutely branded the Senate as the subordinate House of the Parliament, and have decided that its sole function is to fall in with any views to which the House of Representatives has given expression. On an amendment involving a principle of major importance, honorable senators have accepted the suggestion of Ministers that their business is merely to fall in with the views expressed in another place. As we have decided that we should do so in matters of vital importance, it appears to me to be a waste of time, of which we have not now too much to spare, to disagree with the House of Representatives on matters of much less moment. </para>

                    <para>- I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> that we should include justices of the peace amongst those authorized to witness these claims. It is absurd to say that whilst a policeman may be trusted to carry out this duty, a justice of the peace, who is appointed to his office as a man of integrity, standing, and position in the community, cannot be trusted to perform the same duty. A justice of the peace accepts grave responsibilities as such, and is invested with a power of imprisonment. Surely a man who is given the power to take away the liberty of another might be trusted to witness a document of comparatively little importance. Something has been said about the Senate being a recording House for the decisions of the House of Representatives, and the reference was: to the proposal made in the Senate to appoint Commissioners to distribute the States into electorates. </para>

                    <para>- I am at variance with certain honorable members in another place, who apparently have no faith in the eligibility of justices of the peace to act as witnesses to the signatures of electors. In my opinion, some of the assertions which have been made in* regard to these gentlemen are too sweeping and altogether undeserved. If the attention of the authorities has been drawn to cases in which justices of the peace have not exercised due caution and carried out their functions properly, they, should be removed from the commission of the peace. But to s,ay that because there are a few isolated cases of that kind all justices of the peace are to be placed in the same category is doing a manifest wrong to a large body of men who are performing responsible duties to the satisfaction of thousands of citizens throughout the Commonwealth. I believe that too many conveniences, cannot be provided for those who desire to vote. I wish to see that responsible persons shall be appointed for that purpose. I wish justices, of the peace to be shown that respect which they deserve. They are called upon to perform public duties, and apparently their only reward is abuse from a certain section of the community. I do not suggest that justices of the peace do not make mistakes at times. When we have a large army of honorary magistrates, is it to be expected that all their acts will meet with the approbation of every citizen? I voted for the post and telegraph officers being included in the list of eligible witnesses because they were Commonwealth officers, whose appointment would very greatly convenience a number of persons. If we cannot trust those over whom we have some control, whom can we trust? For these reasons I intend to vote against the amendment. </para>

In my opinion, it would be far better to allow the provision to remain in its present form.

                    <para>- I am opposed to the alteration of the new clause, because I desire that an, appeal of this sort shall be as free as possible from legal difficulties or heavy expense. Suppose that a poor man believed that he had been "jockeyed" out of a seat by underhand means, or by some means which in his opinion would justify an appeal to the Court. If the Court were free to allow the other party to engage expensive counsel, he would be greatly handicapped. I think that the provision to allow one party to be represented by counsel, with the consent of the other party, is a fair one. I contend that the Court should not be asked to decide whether counsels hall appear or not. We should not subject a poor man to the handicap of having to meet counsel feed without regard to cost. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator knows very well that in the old days many expensive counsel never fought a case for a fee, but fought merely for the love of equity and justice. They never reached out their hand to take a fee, but they kept in the back of their gown a pocket into which the money could be put - a fashion which is still followed. A high and mighty counsel who would be above taking filthy lucre for discharging a high and honorable duty always kept in' the back of his gown a pocket where he could not see the client putting in a dirty fee; but it got there just the same. It will get there just the same under this. The poor man who takes his case into Court, should not be handicapped by having to employ expensive counsel. Any one who is possessed of a fair knowledge of our election law is permitted to plead his own case. The Judge is supposed to be qualified, and there ought to be no need for counsel to assist him. If counsel's services are necessary, the Court should pay for them. </para>

Let me instance a case that might occur. Suppose a man new to public life found himself opposed in an election to the present Attorney-General,admittedly one of the leaders of his profession. Would it be fair that this untrained man should have no assistance in his contest with one of the keenest legal intellects in the Commonwealth ?

                    <para>- I intend to move an amendment to strengthen proposed new clause 206c, which deals with the case of any person who publishes any false or defamatory statement. The amendment which I intend to move has reference to a newspaper that publishes false or defamatory statements. Although it may seem to make a candidate a judge in his own. cause, my proposal would enable a candidate to apply to a resident or stipendiary magistrate for an order directing the person who has published the false or defamatory statement to afford space for a reply. In other words, it is an attempt to bring into electioneering the principle of fair play. It provides that where a statement is made criticising the action of the candidate, he shall be given, if the statement is made unfairly, an opportunity to place his reply before the public. If the person who has made the statement fails to carry out the order of the Court, a penalty is provided. It may be argued that newspapers are private property, and that by this amendment we should be interfering with private property. I reply that they are public property. They are powerful weapons for influencing public opinion. When the owner of a newspaper uses it in a public contest to prejudice a certain candidate, he should be prepared to give the candidate space to defend himself. In another place a similar provision was introduced at a late hour. Since then it has been re-drafted and carefully considered ; and I am assured that in its present form it will be acceptable to many of those who previously opposed it. The matter was not taken to a division elsewhere, and I feel sure that if the Senate adopts my amendment it will be accepted as merely carrying out the principles, embodied in the proposal sent to us by the House of Representatives. </para>

            <para>SenatorMillen. - The honorable senator is now dealing with the merits of the amendment proposed by the House of Representatives. That amendment provides that a candidate who complains of libel may, instead of seeking the protection of the ordinary Law Courts by a somewhat lengthy process, take summary proceedings and, temporarily, at all events, obtain an order directing the "cessation of the libel. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> now submits an amendment entirely foreign to the proposal of the House of Representatives. He proposes that a newspaper statement, which clearly cannot be libel, for that is provided for in 206c - </para>

These are not ordinary libels or slanders for which a man has a civil remedy ; and whatever objection there may be to the form or principle of my amendment, it is clearly only an extension of the principle adopted by the House of Representatives.

                    <para>- The remarks I have to make on the proposed new clause 206c will be equally applicable to the amendment proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline> I think that members of Parliament are becoming altogether too sensitive to attacks upon candidates for parliamentary honours. Under the existing law there is provision for the protection of any person against whom any false or defamatory statement is made. The ordinary process of law that is open to every individual in the community is equally open to candidates for Parliament, and I am unable to understand why they should be shielded by a special law. </para>

                        <para>.- That is perfectly true. But candidates should be open to criticism and, in my opinion, it is better that they should rely upon the existing law than that we should pass a special provision for their protection. If we provide a ready and simple means by which persons who make unjustifiable statements can be haled before a Court, I am afraid that we shall, to a great extent, destroy criticism which might be very useful. </para>

                        <para>- I admit that, but the difficulty is to determine when this is unfairly done. It does not necessarily deal with any reference to a man's personal conduct. The statement might be made that a certain candidate, whilst a member of Parliament, constantly absented himself from the House, and refrained from voting, and was, therefore, not a fit man to be returned ; whilst it might be that he had absented himself in consequence of illness or other sufficient cause. Why should a man who has made a statement of that kind about a candidate be liable to be haled before a. Court and fined £5? If I object to criticism on such occasions, I have my redress under the existing law. I think that some honorable senators are becoming too tender about criticism. I have suffered as well as other persons from unfair and unjust criticism, but I do not ask to be specially protected against it. </para>

                        <para>.- That is perfectly true, but I think we must be prepared for this kind of thing when we enter public life. Members of Parliament in the course of their speeches often make all sorts of aspersions upon people outside, and call in question their character and conduct, whilst those persons have no redress. This is allowed, because if is considered necessary that the utmost liberty of speech should be permitted to Members of Parliament, and that they should not be afraid to make their views known on all public questions. I believe that the electors may be seriously hampered in their choice if they are not given the fullest opportunity of knowing what a candidate's career and character is. I do not justify misstatements, but' I say that it is inevitable, if a healthy battle is to be fought in the open, that candidates must submit themselves to free criticism. I am content in the circumstances to rest satisfied with the protection of the law as it stands, arid not to ask Parliament tor some special means to protect my character and reputation. </para>

Free discussion, free expression of opinion, and the freest criticism is the salvation of a democratic community.

                        <para>- I am prepared to say on a public platform, and without parliamentary privilege, that, taking persons conducting the daily press of Victoria for a start, they are the most cringing beggars for privileges known to the newspaper world. They have secured privileges to enable them to wipe out their country rivals. They have fattened on them, and, like the fat man at the feast, they lick the grease off their chops with great satisfaction at their success. So much are they demoralized and degraded by t'heir excesses that they find it utterly impossible to tell the truth. The most simple matter that can occur here is utterly distorted in the daily press. They lie and re-lie, either directly or by insinuation. They have the privilege of representation in the parliamentary galleries, and though the reporter, who is generally, young and unsophisticated, may send in a correct report, his account is altered by the sub-editor or chief, and he is blamed for a misreport. My own idea is that the reporter fells the truth, but the newspaper does not publish his report as it is submitted. So far as deliberate and malicious misrepresentation by the press is concerned in connexion with ordinary parliamentary business, it does not matter very much. We who are the greatest sufferers from their malignant lying have the public platform from which to address the- people, and we can always get an audience to listen to us. But tha* is no reason why we should continue to permit abuse of privileges without penalty to those who ax running these lying and unscrupulous newspapers. By lying at the psychological moment they are able to damage the chances Of a candidate who is fighting an honest and open battle before the public, and they knowingly .libel and slander a candidate in order to beat him at the last' moment. In one contest in which I took an active part in supporting a particular candidate, who had an even chance of winning, the leading daily newspapers on the morning of the poll published a statement that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Marks</inline> had retired from the contest. It was then too late for him to say that he had not done so, and too late to have his name removed from the ballot papers. The result was that those who were prepared to vote for him voted for the next best man, in their opinion, and the conservative candidate got in. I very seldom trouble the Senate about any matter. I have been asked more than once: " For heaven's sake don't talk ; let us get to a vote." No one is more anxious to get to a vote than I am, and I have kept my tongue quiet times out of number, as I did last night, but I am going to have my say on this question. One of the greatest grievances or dangers to the democracy of Australia is the absolute immunity which is given to the lying daily press. I do not blame the press for taking advantage of the opportunities which are thrown in their way, but I do blame the representatives of various States for the condition of paralytic funk into which they have got, in order that the proprietors of the newspapers may use their power and influence. Instead of prescribing the penalty which is provided in this clause, I believe, at the instance of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. King</inline> O'Malley, I should be inclined to make those who, with a malicious purpose, deliberately set out to tell an untruth, in order to prejudice the chances of a candidate who is fighting an, honest battle, wear the King's brand- the broad arrow - and introduce them with all due ceremony to the gaol barber. That is about the only way in which they can be brought to their senses. If a senator gets up, and over-states a ease; if, in his ardour, he unwittingly tells an untruth, or misrepresent another senator, he is immediately pulled up. If, for instance, I were to over-state a case, to misrepresent the views of a senator, or1 to deliberately draw a wrong deduction from his arguments, I would be stopped by the  Chairman  j and. perhaps, "more promptly by the  President  if he were in the chair. The proprietors of newspapers are enjoying great privileges without a solitary check, and have taken full advantage of every opportunity which has been afforded to them. I blame certain members of the Parliament for this state of things. Have we been assembled here in Parliament for .nearly five years, without learning that with one or two solitary and heroic exceptions, the representatives of Victoria have absolutely had to bow down to the demands of the Melbourne daily press? Let me give a simple instance. Take the great conservative journal - the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> - which pretends to give faithful and accurate reports. I do not propose to quote the motto which they publish clay by day for the delight of the public - that they are compelled to tell the truth. From the opening paragraph, its report of a little incident which took place in the Senate yesterday is a misstatement of facts, an unscrupulous and deliberate untruth. It was utterly impossible for honorable senators to misunderstand the statements made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith,</inline> or for any one to misunderstand the remarks which were made in support of that statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> and others. It is utterly impossible for us to conceal the fact that the President had something to say on the subject. But in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> report, can one., find a statement which is consistent with the truth? Now, while we know the report in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> to be a lying one- </para>

                        <para>- Being an out and out free-trade newspaper, the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> is sure to be the biggest sinner. The report of the incident referred to is absolutely untrue. It is absolutely impossible for us to believe that the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> reporters, sitting in the gallery, within sound of our voices, and with their eyes open, even although they wear winkers or blinkers, did not understand what was taking place here. It would be a gross insult to them to refuse to say that they declined to put down what did take place, and deliberately put down what did not take place. What conclusion can we draw? It is that, when the report was sent to the office, it was not to the interest of the conductors of the journal that the whole truth should be told. There is a difference between the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> and it is that <inline font-style="italic">the</inline><inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> report, although condensed, was fairly accurate. The part of the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> report of which I complain is the statement that we had wasted an hour of time in calling attention to the perquisites of Members of Parliament. We drew the attention of the general public to the fact that it is not safe to rely on the statements, which are made in the public journals, including the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Age.</inline></para>

                <para class="block">In its original statement, the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> singled out Senators Smith and Neild for contempt, but to-day it admits that their names are not mentioned in the Auditor-General's report, and that it interpolated them into the report. What kind of honesty and decency is that ? The newspaper claims that it ran into its paragraph three paragraphs from the Auditor-General's report. Was there any indication given by a mark which is known to a newspaper reader, that the paragraph contained three items from the Auditor-General's report? Absolutely none. It was a deliberate and most malicious attempt to cast a slur upon, this Parliament. As this is true with regard to newspapers in Melbourne, so it is generally true with regard to the daily newspapers in the capital of every other State. </para>

                        <para>- The weekly labour newspapers will fight for their principles and party as vigorously as any other newspapers will do; but, at the same time, they will give fair play. If, for instance, the honorable senator were to feel aggrieved by a statement made in a labour newspaper concerning his principles, or his arguments, or his conclusions, he would be allowed space in which to point out that it was utterly mistaken. On the other hand, the daily: newspapers will blackguard a man, insinuate anything about a Member of Parliament, and will not publish a solitary line in contradiction of their statement. I have had personal experience of both the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> in that respect. It would be the quintessence of hypocrisy on our part to protect or shelter these miserable rags, and the contemptible humbugs and hypocrites who run them. For these reasons I am not only in favour of the new clause to which we are asked to agree, but also of the addition which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> desired to make, and I am very sorry that these maligners cannot be introduced to the gaol barber. </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator KEATING</inline>
                    (Tasmania - Honorary Minister). - The proposal before the Committee is to insert new clause 206c. I hope that
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline>
                    will not press his amendment, becaus.e, i in my opinion, the new clause will amply protect the most tender-skinned candidate from the abuse of free criticism at the time of an election. I agree with some honorable senators that there is a disposition on the part of certain persons in public life to too strongly deprecate criticism. I agree that there must be not only freedom of speech for Members of Parliament, but also a reciprocal freedom on the part of those who are called upon in the public interests to criticise their actions and their utterances. There may be certain newspapers which, in the opinion of honorable senators very often go too far, but whether we take daily or monthly newspapers, or newspapers which voice the aspirations of any particular class, they are all tarred with the same brush, and possess just the same amount of virtue and vice as does an ordinary individual. They have their partisan feeling, and they act in. just the same way as does a private individual with respect to public questions. Undoubtedly the newspapers exercise very great power, and influence the mind of the community very largely. I know from per.sonal experience that in many instances they do resort to tactics in connexion with elections which must be reprehended very strongly by those who become the victims of them. When I was standing for a country' electorate, a. newspaper brought out a most unblushing damaging statement regarding myself about three days before the date of polling. It arrived, and was distributed in the district on the evening before polling day, while I was on my way back to a town in Tasmania. I did not see the statement until the day of the elec tion.

                        <para>- It could not possibly protect me in that case because I was not in a position to take any action. On the morning of the polling day the newspaper came out with a statement to the effect that, following its usual fair practice, it did not publish any statements regarding candidates on that day. It published the, damaging statement three days before polling day, and got it distributed in the constituency on the evening prior to that date, when it was too late for me to get in any reply which could get back to the constituency. The new clause to which we are asked to agree provides that if a candidate be defamed as to his personal character or conduct, the person who is responsible for such defamation, whether he be the owner of the newspaper, or a ma,n who has simply circulated ai print got up for the occasion, shall be guilty of an offence, and liable on conviction to a penalty of £100 or six months' imprisonment. That means that the party aggrieved can take summary proceedings before a stipendary or special magistrate under the provisions of the Judiciary Act. It also provides that - it shall be a defence to a prosecution for an offence against this sub-section if the defendant proves that he had reasonable ground for believing and did in fact believe the statement made or published by him to be true. </para>

                <para class="block">In other words, any person who has been guilty of making an untrue statement, or of knowingly defaming a candidate, could be prosecuted summarily. It would not be necessary for the party aggrieved to wait for the tedious process of law connected with a prosecution for criminal libel if it amounted to that, or the tedious process of the law which is necessary for recovering damages in a civil action. But he can take the party straight into a Court of summary jurisdiction, and have him dealt with there ; and he may restrain a repetition of the offence by an injunction. That, I think, gives very ample protection to a candidate who may fear hostile criticism. </para>

                        <para>- I. do not know that under any Statute in any State of the Commonwealth discretion is given to such a tribunal to determine whether or not a published statement is unfair. In an action for libel, the Judge himself has no jurisdiction to determine whether the matter complained of is, or is not. in fact libellous. He has no jurisdiction to determine whether or not a newspaper has or has not in fact exceeded the bounds of fair comment. All that he can do is to day down principles. The jury alone can determine whether the matter complained of is libellous. The. jury has to determine whether or not the newspaper in question has gone beyond the bounds of fair comment. But here we are asked to give to a stipendiary magistrate a jurisdiction which is not even reposed in a Judge of the Supreme Court. I admit that newspapers, especially when they take a partisan view of politics, often exert a power which may absolutely crush a certain, candidate. But the clause as it stands enables a candidate to take proceedings in a Court of summary jurisdiction. It protects a candidate against unfair or unwarrantable criticism. He can take proceedings to restrain a newspaper. The honorable senator ought to be satisfied with the provision inserted by the House of Representatives. His own amendment would prove to be impracticable and unworkable. </para>

                    <para>- I hope that every honorable senator who values courage and manliness of character will vote against this amendment. The press, as a whole, is fair, though there are times when things are done which are to be regretted. But any newspaper of standing which values its position recognises the obligation to allow anybody who has been aspersed in' its column to give an explanation. There are newspapers in Australia which have not been true to that position; they have suffered in reputation in consequence. But could there be anything more unsatisfactory than the position of a candidate fighting his way through an electorate who has to admit that he has been a party to this provision ? It might do him more harm than any newspaper criticism could possibly do. I also draw attention to the self-evident fact that any criticism which appeared in a newspaper two or three days before an election could not possibly be affected by the amendment proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce;</inline> and it is statements that are published immediately before an election that are of the greatest importance. I do earnestly impress upon every member of the Senate who values his reputation for courage and manliness in conducting a political fight to vote against this proposal. </para>

                    <para>- I intend to move an amendment to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce's</inline> amendment. Some provision of the kind is really required. It is all very well for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford,</inline> who has the daily press of Sydney at his back, to talk about manliness and courage. We are all very courageous when we are well supported. But Parliament should legislate to protect the man who has no support behind him.. I agree with all that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dawson</inline> has said with reference to the daily press. There is no getting away from the fact that it is often grossly unfair. Fortunately for many of us, we have no reason to care about the unfairness of the Melbourne press. </para>

                        <para>- We are quite justified in inserting such a provision in the law with which we are dealing. The press is a great power, but a great responsibility rests upon it. We should impose some penalty for gross unfairness at election times. For my part, if I could formulate a law compelling the press to publish the truth at all times, and to punish newspaper proprietors for not publishing it when they profess to give an account of the proceedings of Parliament, I should do so. But I see a difficulty in the way of a proposition of that kind. As the newspapers exert a great power, I would place upon them a severe penalty for an abuse of the responsibility resting upon them. </para>

In order that fair play may be given to candidates who are unfairly attacked in reference to their public policy, an opportunity should be secured to them to reply. The same facilities should be given as have been taken to make the charges. Those honorable senators who vote against this amendment will vote against fair play in electoral affairs. Those who vote for it will support the principle that our great journals in political fights shall be conducted on the lines of fair play. Its opponents will enable the newspapers to carry on the despicable tactics to which they have resorted to in the past.

                    <para>- I was in hopes that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> would withdraw his amendment, which, I think, will be practically ineffective. According to the honorable senator's proposal, it will be an offence to publish anything which may prejudice the candidate's chances of election, unless the newspaper affords an opportunity for reply. But newspapers occasionally publish, in the public interest, statements which are absolutely true, but which undoubtedly prejudice the chances of a candidate. I speak with some little experience, and I have suffered from misrepresentation by the press. Miserable parochial untruths have been told of me, and there have been serious distortions of my public conduct. But the publication of the real truth was much more harmful at the time. The imposition of an income tax in Tasmania was a proposal of which myself and my colleagues were all proud, but it was that proposal which really condemned us politically ; and yet, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce'</inline> s proposal, a newspaper which made reference to facts which would prejudice our election- </para>

                        <para>- But the press pointed out all sorts of consequences that would follow the imposition of an income tax, and while these comments doubtlessly seriously prejudiced our election, I am sure that no judicial tribunal would, on that ground, have condemned the press. I wish it were possible to make the press act fairly and justly, but I am afraid that, by some of the proposals from another place which we have adopted, we are in danger of making ourselves ridiculous. We can no more make editors truthful or virtuous by Act of Parliament, than we can make people sober by the same means. </para>

                    <para>- I, too, am afraid that by legislation of this sort we may make ourselves ridiculous. Is it proposed that the press shall be allowed no liberty - that it shall be gagged? A free press is a most valuable institution in any community. There are truthful newspapers and lying newspapers, just as there are truthful men and lying men. Under the proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> although a candidate's character might be as black as night, no adverse comments could be made by the press on the ground that it would prejudice his chances. I have been in political life for thirty years, and I have always found the press, as a whole, willing to give me fair treatment, and to insert any contradictions which were necessary. We Shall stand higher in the public estimation if we avoid passing silly provisions such as this. Although' the press may sometimes go too far, it is too valuable an institution to be hedged round with undue restrictions. Personally, a section of the press in another State has been hammering at me for years past. The <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> has been " at me " for goodness knows how long, but I do not mind ; it does not affect me in the least. I have known cases of men being returned 'to Parliament for no other reason than that they had been persecuted by the press. If a candidate has a just claim, and is not too thin-skinned. he will get fair play, on the whole. </para>

                        (New South, Wales). - I wish honorable senators to realize the full meaning of this proposed clause. The question is whether this applies to a candidate in his political capacity, or whether it simply has reference to him so far as his personal character and conduct are concerned. There is a" law of libel, and any person who is defamed' may, if he thinks fit, have his character cleared in a Court of law without any application to a stipendiary or other magistrate for a summary hearing. I do not believe in this summary remedy proposed, which will be resorted to only at election times, when feeling runs pretty high, and may possibly cause people to recklessly make false statements or misrepresentations. It is far better to leave matters like this to be regulated . by the ordinary law, and not attempt to silence any person, or the press, in dealing with matters which may be of public concern. If we err at all, let us err on the side of liberty.

                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator KEATING</inline>
                (Tasmania- Honorary Minister). - This is a different proposal from that submitted by
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline>
                This is a practicable and workable provision, the essence of the offence being the publication of something which is false and defamatory. On the other hand, the essence of the offence in the- clause proposed by
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline>
                was that the statements were calculated to unfairly prejudice the candidate - purely a matter of opinion. The term of imprisonment provided is the maximum ; and, according to the Acts Interpretation Act, the offence is one cognizable summarily - that is to : say, under the Judiciary Act a case may be taken before a police, stipendiary, or special magistrate authorized to act in a Federal judicial capacity.
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline>
                has pointed out that 'an aggrieved person will also have the remedy at common law for defamation, but that might result in giving the remedy at a time when it was of little use. Therefore the matter may be dealt with summarily. There are other provisions in the clause, notably those in the paragraph marked
                <inline font-style="italic">"2,"</inline>
                by which the candidate can restrain the repeated commission of the offence. In other words, he can make application for an injunction to restrain the repeated publication of the defamatory matter. I think that this is a provision which might stand, as no candidate would be likely to take advantage of it who had not a very clear case to take before the Court of Summary Jurisdiction. It is not a provision such as the last, which we have negatived, and which would have the effect, if it were included in the measure, of restraining newspapers from indulging in faithful and honest criticism.

                        <para>- I should not be prepared to do that. If the candidate who feels aggrieved takes proceedings under this provision in a Court of summary jurisdiction, and the offender is fined, the effect of the libel throughout the community would be considerably modified. If the candidate were afterwards to take an action for damages for defamation of his character, the very fact that he had taken these proceedings and had vindicated his character would rightly weigh with a jury in estimating the damages to which he would be entitled. The jury would properly take into consideration the fact that his character had been vindicated by the operation of, this provision, and would act accordingly in estimating damages. </para>

                    (New South Wales). - It does seem to me to be extremely undesirable that we should be conferring upon candidates for parliamentary honours privileges not conferred upon the general community. The purpose of this new clause is to give candidates some privileges which they have not now and to relieve them of some expense which would otherwise be thrown upon them. I ask honorable senators not to agree to this amendment, that we may show the people outside that we are not prepared to obtain in this way concessions which we cannot honestly justify.

                    In whose interest will these election manifestoes be published? Evidently in the interest of the electors ; and in the circumstances it is not asking anything unreasonable to require the Postal Department to carry these documents at newspaper rates.

                    GOULD (New South Wales). - I point out that while under this clause a candidate is to be entitled to transmit through the post one copy of an election address or manifesto relating to his candidature to each elector whose name appears on the roll for the State or division for which he is nominated, it means that the manifestoes will be carried through the post for1d. for 20 ozs. Where there is a letter delivery, the letter-carriers will have the duty cast upon them of distributing the manifestoes, and possibly a manifesto will have to be delivered to each of eighty electors at a cost to the candidate of1d. Ordinary persons are not to be given this concession, and we do not propose, that it should be extended to candidates for the States Parliaments. I would prefer that Parliament should be invited to pay each candidate the whole of the expenses incurred in his candidature directly, rather than that concessions to candidates should be made in this way.

                    <para class="block">There are two supplementary appropriation Bills, one relating to the ordinary services of the Commonwealth, and the other to public works, which have to be passed. The Bill which I am now asking the Senate to read a second time appropriates a sum of ,£6,768, and a sum of ,£84,414 for certain purposes, which are all stated in the two schedules. The smaller sum of ^6,768 was expended by the Watson Government, in the financial year 1903-4, and the larger item of £84,414 was expended by the Reid Government in the financial year 1904-5. The Bill contains no item of expenditure which has been incurred by the present Administration. I have looked very carefully through the items in the schedules, and so far as I can see, they are all absolutely justified. The largest item in (the second schedule is that of £15,223 for electoral expenses. This expenditure was incurred in consequence of the number of policemen who had to be employed throughout the Commonwealth in delivering forms. No provision had been made for the service, and therefore the claims of the policemen had to be paid out of the Treasurer's advance account. The next large item is that of ^£6.373, to enable temporary charges to be made in respect of departmental printing. This money was really used to form a trust fund, out of which to provide certain stock in the shape of paper, and so on, for the purpose of printing. When we did the printing for the various Departments, we charged them with the stock which had been used. It was a necessary step to take, and as fast as the stock is used, the trust fund is replenished for the purpose of obtaining new stock. We are asked to appropriate £2,166 for the Tariff Commission, ,£1,305 for the Navigation Commission, and ^£196 for the Old-age Pensions Commission. The item of ,£2,066 for the protection of Victorian Customs revenue relates to what is known as "the fish case." A quantity of fish was imported from New Zealand, but the invoices showed short weight, and a smaller number of cases than had been sent. It was a clear case of fraud against' the Commonwealth, and a prosecution was initiated. These legal expenses had to be paid out of the Consolidated Revenue, but afterwards we gained the case, and' the whole of this sum has been repaid, with a little more in costs. There 33 an item of ,£5,010, to create a trust fund in connexion with the Naval Agreement. The Admiralty authorities have charge of a number of our men, who are being trained, and who are receiving pay largely in excess of that which is given to the ordinary sailors on board His Majesty's ships. It was anticipated that there might be some little trouble if it were discovered that there was a difference in the rate of pay, and therefore we made the arrangement. It is really only an advance which has to be repaid. We are also asked to appropriate ,£2,73(5 for conveyance of mails by railway in New South Wales in consequence of an under-estimate which had to be made up, and £16,118 as salary to Victorian officers under section 19 of the 'State Public Service Act. Shortly before the establishment of the Commonwealth was proclaimed, the Victorian Parliament passed a Bill which provided that officers in the Departments to be transferred should receive the same rates of pay as persons doing a similar class of work in the other States, but not to exceed £^156 a year. In the first instance, the Commonwealth objected to pay the increased amounts, because it did not know to what extent the State had paid the officers in the Post and Telegraph Department between the establishment of the Commonwealth and the transfer of that Department. This amount represents arrears which the officers claimed, and which subsequently had to be paid. </para>

                        <para>- The items in the Bill total a fairly considerable sum to be submitted at this late period of the session when we have only a very limited possibility of giving them that critical attention which all items of expenditure are entitled to receive at the hands of a careful1 Parliament. I observe that, with regard to electoral expenditure, the amount originally was £20,000, but that it has now been replaced by an item of £35,000. That is, rather difficult to account for. </para>

In connexion with the Department of Home Affairs, we have a vote of ^917 for temporary assistance. That is a considerable expenditure. There is also a vote of £800 to recoup the States for salaries of professional and clerical officers employed by the Commonwealth. Some time ago I moved for the production of papers relating to the displacement of State auditors with a view of replacing them by Commonwealth auditors. </para>

GOULD (New South Wales). - I beg to call attention to the item of .£400 which,, under the heading of the House of Representatives, is provided as "Allowances towards, expenses of candidates at elections which were declared void." I should like to know whether this money was paid under any resolution!, and also the names of the candidates affected. Have all such expenses been paid? </para>

                            <para>.- I am told the rule is, that where the hand-writing is known, the postage is debited accordingly, whereas if it is not recognised, the expenditure is charged to general account. This record places some honorable senators in an invidious position, because, while one may not have to write more than half-a-dozen letters a session to his constituents, or on public business, another may require to send forty or fifty. I think it would save a good deal of unpleasantness if the whole of the cost were charged to one general fund, reliance being placed on the discretion of members of the Parliament to use the Post and Telegraph facilities only when absolutely necessary. </para>

                        first suggested. Any telegrams or letters which a Member of Parliament has to send on public business connected with his constituency, are paid for by the Commonwealth. Some Members of Parliament have a vast amount of correspondence, whereas, in my own case, for example, a few shillings will cover the cost of the telegrams, and less will cover the cost of postage on letters that I have sent during the four or five years of Federation. That is owing simply to the fact that I am able to go to Adelaide every week, and see my constituents and others, and have, therefore, no special call for heavy correspondence. I can imagine, however, that senators from Western Australia, Tasmania, and Queensland, who cannot see their constituents frequently, are called upon to send many letters and telegrams. No hard-and-fast rule can be made in a case of this kind, but I think it is a subject which might well be inquired into by the House Committee.

                        <para>- I desire to call attention to a matter of which, under ordinary circumstances, I should scarcely have referred. In view of the class of criticism which has recently been directed towards Parliament, I submit that it is absolutely incorrect, and likely to convey a wrong impression, to include the item of£400, which has been referred to, as an allowance towards the expenses of candidates, under the heading of the House of Representatives. Such an item ought properly to Se charged to the Department of Home Affairs. As the item appears now, * some newspaper critic will jump to the conclusion that this ^400 represents some of the frequently-discussed perquisites we are supposed to enjoy. This expenditure is not occasioned by the House of Representatives, or its work, but is simply due to some defect in administration as conducted by officers of the Department of Home Affairs. I do not propose to move any amendment, but simply to call attention to the matter in the hope that, in future, such items will be debited to the proper Department. </para>

                        (South Australia - Minister of Defence). - With regard to Norfolk Island, a suggestion was made - that it should be taken over by the Commonwealth, and the Prime Minister of the- day desired to receive a report on the affairs of the Island before considering the suggestion. The Governor of New South Wales, who is also Governor of Norfolk Island, requested the Government of New South Wales to allow the late
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Alexander</inline>
                        Oliver to furnish the report. The Premier of New South Wales, in complying with the request, suggested that a quota of the expense should be borne by the Commonwealth. This was agreed to, on the understanding that the liability to the Commonwealth should not exceed
                        <inline font-style="italic">£75.</inline>
                        The report was' subsequently furnished by
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oliver,</inline>
                        and the 1^75 was paid to the State of New South Wales. Honorable senators are now asked to ratify that payment. The first objection raised to the item " Cost of locating Wakitipu Rock in Bass Straits - ^283," is that it should appear in the Estimates for the External Affairs Department, but seeing that the rock is in the middle of Bass Straits, it may fairly be considered to be beyond the range of the Home Affairs Department, and to have been properly brought under the head of External Affairs. The facts are that in October, 1903, a certain steamer, while on a voyage from Sydney to Launceston, struck on an uncharted rock in Bass Strait. The occurrence was drawn attention to by the press, who always get hold of these things, and by the Australian Steam-ship Owners Federation. As a result, the Commander-in-Chief on the Australian Station was asked to cause a careful survey of the spot to be made, but as it was impossible to withdraw either of the two surveying vessels on the station from the work they were then engaged upon, His Excellency was unable to accede to the request. I am informed that the matter continued to receive consideration, and in March, 1904, the Admiral recommended that the Harbor Master of Launceston should be instructed to take steps to locate the rock. In June, 1904, the Admiral intimated that he would not be likely to have any vessel under his command available for the work for some considerable time,, and
                        <inline font-style="italic">in</inline>
                        April of that year the matter was considered by the Prime Minister, who referred the papers to the Treasurer, with a view of ascertaining whether, in his opinion, the cost of engaging the
                        <inline font-style="italic">Wybia,</inline>
                        a vessel belonging to the Launceston Marine Board, for the purpose of locating the rock might be properly defrayed from the Treasurer's advance vote.
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline>
                        Turner, who was then Treasurer, replied that, as the uncharted rock was in the highway of traffic, the expenditure had better be incurred, but he pointed out at the same time that the case must not be regarded as a precedent. The Launceston Marine Board was then asked to make all necessary arrangements, and on the 24th May last a report was received that the
                        <inline font-style="italic">Wybia</inline>
                        had returned to Launceston after the exact location of the rock had been definitely determined. The time occupied was twenty-one days, and the total cost
                        <inline font-style="italic">£28210s.</inline>
                        We now have this rock carefully and properly located, and I have no doubt that by this time it is carefully marked on all the Admiralty charts. This has been accomplished at a cost of£283, and I think the money has been well spent.

                        <para>- Having regard to the item covering the cost of locating the Wakitipu Rock in Bass Straits, I should like again to mention a matter to which I have directed the attention of the Senate on several occasions, and in connexion with which, so far as I know, nothing has been done. Two years ago I asked that, a survey of the North-West coast of Australia should be undertaken by some vessel belonging to the Admiralty, and I was promised that the Government would have the matter looked into. Some time later, I drew attention to the fact that nothing had been done, and after the present Government came into office, I again raised the question with the same result. The matter involved is of great importance, and the Government should seriously consider whether something should not be done. Our mail services are dependent to a great extent on a thorough survey of the NorthWest coast. One mail steamer has already been wrecked on that coast owing to the imperfect survey, and honorable senators will recognise that if a coast is known to be dangerous, owners of vessels tendering for the carriage of mails along it will naturally ask for a larger sum than they would consider justifiable if their vessels were exposed to less risk. That fact should be considered in connexion with the matter, and also the desirability of considering the interests of people living in out of the way places. The Government should- seriously urge upon the Admiralty the necessity for a careful survey of the North- West coast. </para>

                            <para>- The survey work carried out under the vote appearing on these Estimates was done at the expense of the Commonwealth, and why should not the North-West coast be surveyed in the same way ? This Wakitipu Rock is as close to the coast of Tasmania as many of the reefs which have caused destruction of vessels plying on the North-West coast are to that portion of Australia, and yet the location of this rock appears to have been undertaken without any trouble at all, whilst the survey which I have repeatedly urged is left with an empty promise that the matter will be considered. The Government have communicated with the Admiralty, and some time in the dim and distant future the work may be undertaken. This grievance is of too long "standing, and it is high time that it was redressed. Until the coast is well surveyed,, we cannot reasonably expect the owners of ships to send them into that part of the Commonwealth. It cannot be denied that a very much better service is needed than is now provided. I hope that during the recess trie- Minister of Defence will take some definite action in this matter. </para>

                                (New South Wales). - I would ask the Minister, if it has not already been tabled and printed, to get the report on Norfolk Island printed and distributed for the information of honorable senators. The producers on the island have suffered very considerably from the operation of our legislation. Until the enactment of the Federal Tariff, absolute freedom of trade prevailed between New South Wales and Norfolk Island. Many coffee plantations were established on the island with the idea that a good trade could be done with Australia, but the high Federal duties practically rendered their products valueless to the planters. Either Norfolk Island will have to be annexed by New Zealand, or some step must be taken to bring it under the control or jurisdiction of the Commonwealth, or give preferential treatment to its products. I hope that
                                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline>
                                will look through the report and consider the possibility of doing something, by means of which the Norfolk Islanders may be able to exist and obtain a market for their products.

                    asked me if I had any explanation concerning this item to offer. I made an explanation, in which I. showed that, in consequence of a number of officers for whom provision had been made on the Estimates not having been appointed until six or seven months had elapsed, temporary assistance had to be obtained by the Department, and that, through its employment, it made a saving of over£900, simply because no permanent officers had been appointed. Yet he rises again and quietly asks me to give the explanation a second time. I was blamed because I was not supplied with information concerning an item of £93; but when I do give an explanation concerning an item of£917, I am asked to give the information a second time.

                            <para>.- I understand that all expenditure up to the 30th June this year is represented. I wish to emphasize the fact that the appointment of Royal Commissions is a means of spending a great deal of money. Sometimes they elicit useful information, but that is no reason why we should incur an excessive expenditure on account of them. We are now told that it is likely that the Select Committee on the Tobacco Industry will be appointed a Royal Commission. I hope that no such appointment will be made until Parliament has had an opportunity of expressing its opinion. Another ground of objection to the appointment of so many Royal Commissions is that, to a great extent, they relieve Ministers of the responsibility that properly attaches to them. If Ministers are not to take the responsibility for which they are paid, we might as well have a number crf clerks occupying their offices instead ot parliamentarians of experience. I certainly raise a protest against the appointment of Royal Commissions unless there is an absolute need for them. </para>

                        (Western Australia). Reference has been made to the Select Committee on the Tobacco Industry, of which I happen to be a member. The Committee has obtained a large and valuable amount of evidence, and has almost completed its work; but there are still four or live witnesses to be examined. Parliament is about to go into recess. If the Committee is not converted into a Royal Commission it cannot complete its work, and the consequence will simply be that when the Senate meets again next session I shall have to move for its re-appointment. The Commission, if appointed, will not be an expensive one. I do not think it will be necessary for it to go beyond Melbourne. The few witnesses who are to be examined have themselves expressed a desire that they shall be summoned. It has to be remembered that the work of the Committee directly challenges the financial interests of persons who are interested in a large industry. It would be unfair to allow a threat to remain hanging over their heads, as would be the case if the Committee did not bring its labours to a conclusion. The expense involved will not be considerable.

Cannot the honorable senator take the word! of the late Ministry, who authorized this expenditure to which he takes exception? Certainly not one member of the late Government would authorize expenditure of this kind unless it was perfectly justified.

                            <para>- Had a little common sense been exercised in the preparation of these Estimates, this sort of difficulty would not have arisen. In the case of exactly similar expenditure in New South Wales, a perfectly business-like method of setting out the facts is adopted, whereas, in the case of Victoria, we are presented with the mysterious phrase: "Protection of revenue." The uniform of an officer or a launch to enable naval officers to go from one ship to another might be included in the term " protection o£ revenue." The phrase gives no information, and is likely to mislead. I do not blame the Minister personally, but the honorable senator will admit that the officers of this Department have not prepared the Estimates, in such a way as to assist the Committee in their deliberations. </para>

                            <para>- They all appear in these Estimates, and I direct attention to the fact that the Commonwealth would appear to be really a fighting force. Both Houses of Parliament have been told a great deal about the under-valuation of goods and fraud on the part of commercial people, and on many occasions the commercial community of the Commonwealth has been maligned, and yet in these Estimates we are called upon to vote an amount of £454 to cover the verdict, costs, and' interest in a case brought against the Collector of Customs in Sydney, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lockyer,</inline> by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Goldring.</inline> I make special mention of this case amongst many in which the Commonwealth seems to have had to go to law, and has, I think, generally got the worst of it. </para>

                        <para>- I direct attention to the items "Towards cost of transport of rifle team competing at rifle association matches at Western Australia, £107," and "Transport of rifles into Western Australia, £58." I should like to know how these items are brought into these Estimates, when, as I understand the matter, the charges were supposed to have been met out of last year's provision for travelling expenses. I interviewed the Department of Defence in connexion with this very matter, and I was told that there would be no necessity for a special vote. Now I find that special votes are submitted. </para>

                        (Western Australia). - The explanation given does not apply to the vote of £107 to be found under division 87. I am very anxious to get this matter cleared up, because, when I went to see about the transportation of a rifle team from Western Australia to Williamstown, this year, I was told that a special grant could not be given, and that the money would have to be taken out of the amount which was set aside for travelling expenses. Therefore, the vote for travelling expenses was reduced by that sum. In the case of other States, last year there was a special vote, so that, as is usual when there is any question of special expenditure, Western Australia has not been placed upon an equal footing with, the eastern States.

The Minister of the day requested the Treasurer to pay, out of his advance account, this amount for the purpose therein set forth. It was paid before the end of the financial year, and now the Parliament is asked to approve of what he did.

                            <para>- That is quite right. It was all specially voted last year; but in dealing with Western Australia this year the cost has been taken out of the amount which was voted on the Estimates for travelling expenses. I went into the matter with the Minister and his secretary, but they would not grant a special vote for this purpose. </para>

In this case the Treasurer was asked for an advance, and the Parliament is now invited to approve of what he did.

For a time we refused to pay the increases, but afterwards we found that they had to be paid, and they were paid in a lump sum. Of course, the additional expenditure has been charged to Victoria.

                    <para>. - I informed the Senate this morning that it was my intention to move an amendment on the Excise Tariff Bill, which is now before us again, with a view to institute a sliding-scale in regard to the amount of Excise paid, on the same lines as the sliding-scale in the Bounty Bill. There was an express on of dissent from some honorable members, and I then said. " I will allow the House of Representatives, under the circumstances, to take it upon itself to say whether there shall be such an amendment or not. I will only now move the insertion of the words " until the 1st day of January, 1913," and another place will have an opportunity of considering whether a modification should be made by it on the lines of the amendment which we made in the Bounty Bill." That was the understanding. </para>

                        <para>- I certainly told honorable senators that it was my intention to propose a sliding scale in this Bill. I was then met with some expression of dissent. Thereupon I said that I was not very strong upon the matter. My own opinion was that we had better leave the Bill as it stood. I stated that,,- so far as I was concerned, I would not propose a sliding-scale, but would move such an amendment as would enable another place to express -an opinion on the question. </para>

                    <para>- The Minister has given us a version of what occurred upon the earlier stages of this Bill. I shall give my own version of what occurred, though I ask the honorable senator to accept my assurance that I quite believe he has not said anything with a desire to mislead any one. A misunderstanding has arisen, which is unfortunate for those who sit on this side of the Chamber. When the Bill was previously before us, the Minister stated that he had two amendments to propose. One of those was' the object of fixing a period which was to mark the termination of the operation of the measure, and the other was to provide for a sliding-scale. When, as he states, protests arose;, the Minister said, "If you will give me the one amendment, I will mot press for the other." </para>

                        <para>- I have no recollection of it. When the Minister said, " Give me one amendment, and I will forego the other," I took that to be an intimation that he would be satisfied with; the one amendment, and we readily met him with regard to it. We agreed to the second reading of the Bill, and went into Committee. What position do we find ourselves in now? Having conceded half of the Minister's desire, we now find that he asks us to concede the other half. What position are we in as compared with what we should have been in at the earlier stage of the Bill? The Minister knows as well as I do that this Bill is the natural complement to one with which we have dealt. As the voting was equal, we thought the Government would accept a fair compromise, and we believed that that compromise was effected when we expressed a willingness to accept one of the two amendments. It places the Opposition in an unsatisfactory' position if, having conceded one-half of the request of the Government, we are now confronted with a demand that we shall accept the other half. </para>

If the Minister in the other House had given a promise to abide by an arrangement made with the Opposition, I am sure that the Senate would have been asked to concur in that course. So it ought to be with an undertaking made with us in this Chamber. </para>

                        <para>- But the effect of that sliding scale is entirely minimized by the introduction of a corresponding sliding scale i» the Excise Bill. The effect of the Sugar Bounty Bill as amended was to say to the sugar-growers in Queensland : " We will give you a bounty on the sugar you produce by white labour at a diminishing rate until it finally disappears." That Bill was passed with' the knowledge that the Excise Bill provided a fixed amount of Excise without a sliding scale. If we now adopt the Government proposal, what happens is this - that whilst in the Bounty Bill we pay less during the tapering-off period, we receive less under this Bill. We might as well have left the two measures unaltered as alter them both in the proportion of the sliding scale set out here. The sugar-growers will get the .same net amount as they would have done if the two Bills had been passed as originally introduced. </para>

We pay them the same amount of bounty, spread' over a longer period, but we collect a lesser amount of Excise. That means that we are -giving them a larger amount of financial assistance; whereas the object of the Senate was to give them a smaller amount. The Government proposed a certain amount for five years. We gave them the same amount spread over six years.

                        <para>- But the point is that if we accept the proposal now made, we give a larger amount of financial assistance to the sugar-growers than would have been done if we passed the two Bills as originally introduced. I am not prepared to make larger payments to the sugar-growers: In the first place, it has not been shown that it is absolutely essential to the sugar industry that the growers should have the measure of assistance that we propose to extend to them, much less that they have a claim for a larger measure of financial assistance. Surely it is incumbent upon those who ask us to make these enlarged payments to show upon what grounds they justify the demand. The Minister may say that the sliding scale in this Bill corresponds with the sliding scale in the Bounty Bill. But under the Bounty Bill we only gave the same amount of bounty as the Government propose to give. "Under this Bill it is proposed to charge a lesser amount of Excise to the sugar growers. </para>

                        <para>- It makes a considerable difference of £86,000, but I am assuming that the figures which the Minister presented yesterday are correct. Even so, there is a discrepancy between1 the figures now, and the figures he handed to me yesterday. The sum of £2,000,000 was frequently mentioned in the course of the debate, showing that that amount was accepted as correct. If that be so, and the amount to be collected is , £914,000, we are proposing to give , £86,000 to the sugar-growers, principally of Oueensland. I enter my protest against giving the growers any such sum, whichever be the correct figure. Why should the growers be given a bounty over and above what was in the minds of honorable senators when they passed the Bill yesterday ? The Minister has not advanced a single argument why that should be done. We ought to have some reason given to us for the course proposed, beyond the mere fact that another place has passed an amendment. Why should the public purse be opened still further and a large additional sum granted to those who were generously treated under the first proposal ? </para>

                    <para>- The Senate finds itself to-night in an extraordinary position. On Friday last, when the Sugar Bounty Bill was introduced, I expressed the opinion that the two Bills ought to be considered together in the Senate, and honorable senators are aware of the understanding or expectation which was arrived at this morning. I objected to the Government proposal, but was willing not to vote against it when some of my friends intimated that they were willing to accept it. There is no question as to the gravity of the proposal before us. The figures which the Minister has handed to me show that, with an Excise duty of , £4, it is anticipated there will be collected £800,000 per annum, and it is proposed that, in the year 1910, one-third of that amount shall be given up, and the next year two-thirds. In other words, it is proposed that Australia shall give up £800,000 of revenue in the two years, and that in the following year not a farthing shall be collected in the shape of Excise duty. We know, of course, that it will then be open to Parliament to review the matter; but the idea in the minds of those who engineer proposals of this, kind is altogether antagonistic to any Excise duty. The desire is to give to those who engage in this industry immense sums of money which ought to go to the revenues of the various States. It was quite understood last night that the matter was settled on the terms which have already been referred to. It is proposed now, however, that the Excise duty shall be given up altogether, and the various States shorn of revenue. What do the representatives of Tasmania, Western Australia, Victoria, and New South Wales think of the proposal ? Can Victoria, for instance, afford to forego something like £240,000, and New South Wales £300,000? We must not forget that with the proposal to reduce the Excise there is no accompanying proposal to reduce taxation through the Customs. In every one of the years contemplated, this industry will go on collecting from the public <inline font-style="italic">£6</inline> per ton, or 200,000, and, instead of there being ^800,000 to divide amongst the States, there will be nothing. Surely that is a proposal which the most ardent protectionist cannot accept. It is most extraordinary that there should be an attempt to go behind the arrangement we made yesterday, and to launch a proposal of this kind in the last hours of the session, when a good many members, of both Houses have already started for their homes. This is a piece of legislation which, I fancy, has few parallels, and the proposing of which reflects great discredit ora the Government. </para>

                    <para>- I am very sorry there has been a misunderstanding. I am prepared to take the statement of the Minister as showing what he intended, or what his recollection of the events is. My own clear impression is that the understanding was that, if we on this side would consent to the term being limited, then honorable senators opposite would forego the idea of proposing, a diminishing rate. But for that understanding there would have been no object in honorable senators on this side agreeing to an amendment; we should simply have been .giving the position away. It seems, however, that there has been a misunderstanding. We know how legislation has been going on in another place recently - we know how easy it is, at this hour of the session, with a few simple words, which, perhaps, no one hears, to slip a Bill through. </para>

The reason for an Excise duty is to obtain revenue, even under the proposal made by the Government. Although a certain amount of protection would be given incidentally, it was expected that revenue would be derived; but, as matters are now, the revenue has been thrown away. </para>

                        <para>.- The honorable senator has a "bee in his bonnet " in regard to land taxation. We shall be making a serious mistake if we throw revenue away in the manner proposed ; and the measure is certainly an indication that there will be no more Excise duty collected after the expiration of six years. The position taken up by the Government is unreasonable, and it entirely defeats the intention of the Senate when the alteration was made in the Bill the other day. ' As I have already said, many honorable senators have .gone away under the impression that this matter was settled. </para>

                    has expressed the opinion that we ought not to derive revenue from sugar. Does the honorable senator wish the people of Australia to continue paying
                    <inline font-style="italic">£6</inline>
                    per ton, or more than £1,000,000 every year, without the revenue benefiting to the extent of a farthing? Surely that cannot be the honorable senator's idea? He does not recognise that we are not dealing with the Customs duty, but with the Excise duty, and the big Customs duty which the people have to pay on every ounce of sugar they consume is to stand. The honorable senator is supporting a policy under which the Government will take a larger portion of what the people pay, and hand it over for the benefit of certain people concerned in the industry. Though the people will contribute a gigantic sum in taxation, the revenues of the various States will be depleted. That is the position under the proposal now made, and it is a very grave position indeed. We should have some explanation on the subject from the Minister in charge of the Bill.

                    <para>- The Committee is asked to undo everything we fought for during the whole of yesterday. Under this proposal the revenue of the States will be depleted, and this industry - which is certainly deserving of some consideration - will be bolstered up to an extent which some of the States cannot afford. The sugar planters of Queensland must admit that the Federal Parliament has treated them most generously, whilst their own State Legislature has not done enough for them. Ministers should hesitate before they ask the State to deplete its revenue any further. Instead of a revenue of £4 per ton from sugar, during the last two years, it will get only <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> 13s. 4d., and £1 6s. 8d. respectively per ton. The Minister forgets that there were two reasons for the adoption of the sliding scale in connexion with the bounty. The first was to let the planters know that at the end of a certain period it would cease. </para>

                        <para>- We were given to understand that sugar would be an enormous revenue-producing item, and, as a matter of fairness, the industry could bear some kind of Excise. If honorable senators say that there is to be no Excise duty on sugar, let us reduce the Customs protection to £3 per ton. The questions of the bounty, the Excise duty, and the Customs duty must be considered together. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford,</inline> against his will, consented to notify the planters by adopting a sliding scale for the payment of the bounty, that it would absolutely cease in 191 3, and is intimating as plainly as possible that at the end of that time there is to be no more Excise duty charged. I believe that at 'the end of the term provided for, Ministers will be ashamed of what they have done. There will be a reaction throughout the States. This will become a burning question unless we settle it now, and I think that we should settle it now. Will <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> reduce the bonus of £4 per ton to , £3 "per ton, or make any fair suggestion ? </para>

                        <para>- That is so; but we can make this three-fourths for the last two years, and the Minister should consent to do so. We must consider the revenue of the States. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> will accept that suggestion. I am sure that the leader of our party will not object to it. Some day there will be even numbers on both sides in the Senate, or there may be a majority of one or two against the Government, and we shall then find out whether Ministers are justified in remaining dumb and consenting to do everything that another place desires. I do not recollect a single occasion on which Ministers in the Senate have not, where a difference of opinion has arisen, remained dumb, and consented to do exactly what they were told by another place. </para>

                    <para>- The speeches I have heard from honorable senators opposite strengthen me in the belief that I should consent to agree to the modification of our amendment proposed by the House of Representatives. I have never argued that we should derive increased revenue from sugar, and when I hear honorable senators urging that we should reject the modification because It would involve a loss of revenue, that is to me a sufficient reason for accepting it. If we genuinely desire to raise less revenue from sugar, we are here given an opportunity to do so, because we shall undoubtedly have an opportunity to revise the Tariff before the term dealt with in these Bills comes to an end, and this proposal will supply a good argument for reducing the import duty on sugar. That will lessen the return to the States Treasurers, and will tend to bring about more quickly what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> has indicated, namely, land taxation. I shall support the modification proposed by the House of Representatives in this instance, and when the Customs Tariff comes up for revision I shall be prepared to assist honorable senators opposite in decreasing the import duty on sugar correspondingly, so as to give the same amount of protection and at the same time decrease the taxation of the people upon this item of food which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> will admit is not as legitimate a subject of taxation as is the unimproved value of land. </para>

What is the proposal which he now submits ? He recants all that he said yesterday, and comes forward as the advocate of a proposal which, instead of giving the sugar-growers less, is to give them more. </para>

Having voted to give a bonus of 30s. during the period of six years, and the bonus not having been disturbed in any way, he now proposes to help to cut down the amount of the Excise duty. </para>

                        <para>- It is a sham and a fraud to put a possible reduction of the Customs duty down as a compensation for the larger measure of relief which is given in this Bill. Although we adopted a sliding scale, still we did not reduce the total amount of the bonus ; but the effect of the so-called sliding scale with the Excise is to reduce the amount collected. It means that, while we have not made a reduction of the amount we put into the grower's pocket, it is proposed to reduce the amount to be taken out of it. That is tantamount to giving a larger measure of financial help to the growers. For any honorable senator to say that we can equalize that by a possible amendment of the import duty at a. future date,, can only be described as an effort to mislead, not the Committee, but himself. What are the prospects of our dealing with the Customs Tariff?Senator Pearce knows perfectly well that when it is brought to the Senate, he and others who now vote with him will separate. He will not have the Government's help then, nor will he be in a position to help them. </para>

                        <para>- It is inevitable that the State Treasurers will lose an enormous amount as the result of the enactment of the Sugar Bounty Bill. I hesitate to say how much they will lose, but I believe that I am well within the mark in saying that from£750,000 to . £1,000,000 will not be in excess of the amount which they will lose during its operation. The chief fact to be remembered is that that enormous sum is to be withdrawn from the use of the States Governments, in order to be put directly into the pockets of the sugar-growers. Let me now consider what will be the further effect of the modification which is now suggested. It is somewhat difficult to say what the exact amount will be, because there appears to be a discrepancy in the figures supplied by the Minister, but it is quite clear that the difference between the two systems will be 3s. 4d. a ton per year. I do not know the actual production of sugar in Queensland, but it is quite evident that we are asked to take another sum of . £50,000 or £60,000 from the States Treasurers for the benefit of the sugar-growers. Noone, not even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> has ventured to offer a, reason why we should give them more than we were asked yesterday to give them. Yet, for some unexplained and unexpressed reason, the Minister has asked us to-night to make this additional grant, and honorable senators become rather indignant because we are not prepared to immediately fall in with the suggestion. Why should we throw £50,000 more into the industry when no one has shown that it is in need of further assistance? </para>

                        <para>- It is probable that my honorable friend is correct, but, taking my estimate, I submit that , £50,000 is an enormous sum to give away in excess of the amount which the Government contended, was necessary. Can the Government give any reason for making this proposal? May I ask those who are familiar with sugar-growing in Queensland, to say whether, after it has enjoyed a bonus for eleven years, the industry is likely to fail, unless it receives this increased assistance? Because, if so, the sooner we shall be brought face to face with the fact that the longer we extend the assistance, the greater will be the demand for increasing it. Apart from this proposal, however, it is somewhat appalling to me that honorable senators should be quite content to vote away these enormous sums without even asking whether it is! justifiable. I do not remember an occasion on which public men have so lightly handled the public money as honorable senators appear to be doing. They ignore the fact that many taxpayers who are face to face with a severe struggle, in order to make a livelihood, are taxed in order to contribute to the incomes of those who are fairly well off, and are doing well. Under this proposal, we are asked to levy a tax upon the users of the poorer lands of the continent, in order to subsidize those who occupy the richest lands in Australia. In Western Australia, prospectors who, perhaps, are fossicking for a bare living, have to pay a duty on their sugar in order to subsidize the latter class. In New South Wales we have very considerable areas of wheat-growing land which' average 8 bushels to the acre, or yield a bare living as the result of hard work attended with great risk. Yet these persons are to be taxed quite unnecessarily in order' to subsidize those who occupy and use the .richest lands in Australia. Surely those who oppose this proposal are entitled to be supplied with some justification for its adoption ! When honorable senators will not venture to put forward a single argument or statement in its support, what conclusion am I forced to arrive at? It is that the proposal will not stand examination, that it is a clear attempt to defraud the Commonwealth of its revenue in a 'way which cannot be justified. Even if we are impotent to do anything, if the representatives of the State whose sugar-growers are to get the whole of this enormous sum have not a word to utter in support of the proposal, then I ask those who agree with me, to place upon record a strong protest against this attempt to deflect a large sum of public money into the pockets of the sugar-growers of Queensland. </para>

                    GOULD (New South Wales). - I cannot help reiterating an argument which has been adduced, and that is that we are asked to give this large sum of public money to, at the very outside, 8,000 growers of white sugar in Australia. That is, assuming that the whole of the sugar produced in Australia is grown by white labour.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Maxwell's</inline>
                    report points out that there must be 8,000 growers in Queensland to enable all the sugar now produced to 'be grown by white labour. It is proposed to give millions of pounds to 8,000 selected individuals of this community to encourage them to grow sugar. We have imposed a duty of
                    <inline font-style="italic">£6</inline>
                    per ton to protect' them in the first instance against the outside world. There is a difference of only
                    <inline font-style="italic">£1</inline>
                    per ton between the Excise and the bounty. There is therefore really being given under our system
                    <inline font-style="italic">£5</inline>
                    on every ton of sugar. That amounts to 000,000 on 200,000 tons. In other words. 8,000 people engaged in the sugar industry are to be benefited to the extent of
                    <inline font-style="italic">£5</inline>
                    per ton for all the sugar they produce. We were told by a member of a previous Parliament that one result of the White Australia policy would be that the whole of the rich country along the Queensland coast would be absolutely thrown out of occupation through black labour being got rid of. But the alternative was adopted of paying a bounty to those who grow by means of white labour, with the object of keeping that country in occupation. We are now giving a handsome income to each individual engaged in this industry. If practically means that this country can afford to pay those people upwards of
                    <inline font-style="italic">£100</inline>
                    a year each to leave the sugar industry alone". Is that reasonable?
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline>
                    says that we may shortly have an opportunity of reducing the Tariff. Probably that is so. But the honorable senator knows that every man engaged in the production of sugar will stand up for a big Customs duty, and that the representatives of those people will not be ready to cut down the duty of
                    <inline font-style="italic">£6</inline>
                    per ton to
                    <inline font-style="italic">£3</inline>
                    or
                    <inline font-style="italic">£4.</inline>
                    It is absurd to put that forward as a reason for agreeing to the amendment of the other House. It appears to me that) the Senate is simply playing at legislation. We make amendments in Bills, and as soon as another place says, " We dissent from you," we are ready to throw up the sponge, and say, " 'Very well ; we recognise that we are merely elected for the purpose of further considering measures. If we can persuade you to change your views, well and good; but if you are not to be persuaded, we have no will of our own." Is not that remark applicable to the present instance? We are now asked to consent to the amendment of another place being agreed to, and to reduce the Excise by two-thirds and one-third. I assume that the determination at which we arrived in the first instance expressed the honest opinion of the Senate. Are we prepared to cave in at discretion, simply because another place asks us to do so? Why should not Tasmania ask us to grant a bounty on , the production of apples or cherries? She has just as much

                        <para>.- Am I to understand that the object is to play off the white grower against the black grower? It is surely a very artificial means of differentiation. I presume that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> will say that if we can get rid of the black labour, he is prepared to maintain the Customs duty, and to have no Excise on sugar. But that stage cannot be reached until there is so much competition in this country as to bring down the price of locally-produced sugar. In the meantime,' it appears that we are to keep up this artificial barrier, to the detriment of every individual in the community, and of every industry that uses sugar. We might very well have allowed this matter to stand over until next session, in order to give more consideration to it. The Government itself, in its previous legislation, indicated that it desired to grant bounties, not for a period of six years, but continuously. Now Ministers have abandoned the position they took up in the first instance. I cannot understand the attitude of honorable senators who have changed their views on this matter. Where amendments which are not vital are in dispute it is quite right that we should endeavour to compromise. But this is a vital issue. It is a matter of principle upon which we ought not to give our position away.. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> has. indicated a compromise which might be accepted. </para>

                        <para>.- There should not be a compromise on a matter of principle; but we could make an arrangement whereby the rights of the Senate would not be given away upon so important a matter. We ought to consider the position of the revenue. Some honorable senators argue that if the revenue is diminished it will force the country to land taxation. But I can assure them that land taxation is not going to be conceded to the extent that they desire. There will have to be a struggle throughout the length and breadth of this Commonwealth before anything of the kind is agreed to. If some honorable senators desire to deplete the revenue with the object of forcing forward <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart's</inline> favourite idea of a land tax, they are doing that which is absolutely improper. If we are to have land taxation, let it he determined by a fair and straight-out vote. We should not take advantage of the impecuniosity of the Commonwealth in order to carry out a system which every one must recognise to be repugnant to five-sixths of the people of the country. I make as, strong a protest as I can against the action of the Government in this matter, and am astonished to find that there are honorable senators who are prepared to go back upon the ideas that they expressed" in the first instance, and to reverse everything that they declared to be advisable within the last twenty-four hours. </para>

                    (New South" Wales).' - There is just one point I wish to emphasize before we go to a division. I think I am justified in concluding, from the remarks of
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline>
                    that those who support this proposal of the Government regard, as an alternative to it, the imposition of land taxation. I shall not enter into the merits or demerits of that system of taxation, but I desire to place it on record that those who support the reduction" of the Excise duty do so as one step towards the imposition of a land tax.

                        <para>- In the case to which I understand the honorable senator to refer, the land owners were taxed just as much as they volunteered to give. When I asked <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> why the Watson Government did not seek to give effect to their land tax faith, he replied, " Wait until the next Labour Ministry is in power." I do not regard that as a threat, but merely as a fair intimation of the policy to be put forward - as a fair intimation to the people of Australia that, so far as a big section of the Labour Party is concerned, one of their first objects, when they are again in power, will be to so adjust these duties as to necessitate a tax on freehold land. </para>

                        <para>- We shall get it partly from such a Bill as that which certain honorable senators are now trying to undermine. I shall lose no opportunity of emphasizing what appears to be the objective of the Labour Party, viz., to so adjust our fiscal system as to make the keystone, or the foundation, direct taxation for Federal purposes. I do not know that that is an object of which the party need be ashamed ; but it supplies the reason why I regard with considerable suspicion any attempt to minimise revenue duties such as those provided by the Bill. I suggest, as the more convenient way of testing the feeling of the Committee, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> move that after the words " shall be " the words "three-fourths" be inserted. </para>

When the people of Australia fully recognise what is behind all this, honorable senators will have occasion to regret it, and none more than the members of the Government who have engineered this very unworthy scheme. There is no doubt that the arrangement arrived at last night was considered by both sides as being final. </para>

                    <para>- I have not the slightest desire to delay the passage of the third reading of this Bill, but I certainly think that I am justified in taking advantage of this opportunity to say that I do not consider that the Government have kept the spirit of the compact entered into last night. After we had thrashed out a question for seven or eight hours, I was led last night to accept a compromise, in the belief that it would be accepted by the Government in another place. That assurance was given in connexion with the Sugar Bounty Bill, which, with this Bill, must be considered as part and parcel of the same legislation. I do not think that the radical alteration made in this Bill since it was introduced is in keeping with the spirit of the compact which the leader of the Government in the Senate offered last night. I have, however, this consolation in the matter : This Excise Tariff Bill and the Sugar Bounty Bill must be considered in conjunction with the Tariff, and the whole question must again come up for reconsideration and review at no distant date. Possibly the Government have taken the action which they have taken in connexion with this measure, because it is assumed that we are within a few hours of the close of the session. If it were not that I am absolutely certain that the whole question must shortly be reviewed again. I should be inclined to put up something of a "stone-wall." I am satisfied to let the Bill pass now, because I know that there is a sufficient number of honorable senators of my way of thinking to insure a review of the Question next session. </para>

                    (New South Wales). - I cannot find language sufficiently strong to express my disappointment; but it is satisfactory to remember that four years must elapse before the sliding scale in regard to the Excise will come into operation, and between this and then we shall have a general election. I shall be much mistaken if at that general election this very consideration of the tremendous loss of revenue to the States will not prove a strong point in favour of the party now sitting on the Opposition benches. Under the measure we passed last night, for the last two years of the period the bounty per ton will be reduced to £2 and£1 respectively ; but by this Bill a reduction in Excise for those years means a present of £2 13s. 4d. and£1 6s. 8d. per ton respectively to the sugar-growers, so that white growers will practically receive the equivalent of £4 13s. 4d. and £2 6s. 8d. per ton for the years alluded to.

                    Keefe stated that he would be inclined to " stone-wall " the third reading of this Bill, did he not believe that the question will have to be reviewed at a later date. I should be happy to join the honorable senator in the " stone-wall " if I thought that it would do any good.

                        <para>.- But they have voted differently. Twenty-four hours would appear to be sufficient to effect a complete reformation in the minds of some members of the Senate, when they understand that their masters in another place desire that they should change their views. We were assured that honorable members in another place would accept the Sugar Bounty Bill, as we sent it to them, but they have altered the Excise Tariff Bill in such a way as to leave matters very much as they were before. There can be no doubt that they are justified in regarding the Senate as being by no means a strong or a determined House, but as one. which may be blown over as easily as a house of cards. If the honorable senators to whom I have referred, had voted to-night as they did twenty-four hours ago, the majority would have been on this side of the Chamber, and if the Government did not regret the loss of the Bill they would probably have consoled themselves with the reflection that it could be' taken up next session. I am glad to recognise the truth of what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> has said. We shall have one, and possibly two, general elections, before the sliding scale comes into operation with respect either to the bounty or the Excise duty. We shall/ therefore, have an opportunity to reconsider the whole question, and by that time possibly we shall be able to induce <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> to vote again in the way we desire. </para>

                    <para>This is a very small Bill in which honorable senators have the right to insert amendments, because it deals with works and buildings. It appropriates the sum of £490, which was expended by the Watson Government on account of the financial year 1903-4 and a sum of £52,527 on account of the financial year 1904-5, which was expended by the Reid Government. A reference to the two schedules will show that with the exception of £44,050 for rifles, guns, and other equipment, the items are small. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner informed the House of Representatives that he would use any saving on the ordinary Defence vote for the purpose of providing special equipment which, as honorable senators are aware, has been done for some time. A sum of £44,050 was saved on the general vote for Defence, and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner allowed an advance of equal amount to be apportioned in a manner which is set forth on page 7 of the second schedule. It shows for what purposes the money was originally voted, and also what alteration was made in the expenditure. It was expended upon military equipment, which consisted of 5,000 magazine Lee-Enfield rifles of the new' pattern, ammunition, accountrements, camp equipment, material for small arms ammunition to be paid into a trust fund, artillery ammunition for fixed defences, tools and other materials, guns, harness, waggons, machine guns, medical stores, &amp;c. </para>

                        <para>- I desire to refer to the item of £110 for machinery and plant for the Government Printing Office and works in connexion therewith. This is a small item, but it is one of several items which have figured of late in the public accounts. From what I can understand, we are paying for the purpose of having our work done in the State printing office. If we are going <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> find plant and machinery, and to pay the same rates as though the State Government had found the plant and machinery, or the work had been placed with private firms, it seems to me that we are gradually approaching a point at which it would be much cheaper to have a Federal Printing Office. Am I right in assuming that this plant has been purchased by the Commonwealth and placed in the Government Printing Office here? </para>

                        <para>- In view of the large sum of public money which has been expended on the purchase of printing material and plant, I would suggest to the Minister of Defence that the time has arrived when the Commonwealth might well establish a printing office of its own. It has purchased the most modern machinery, which has been installed in the Government Printing Office in Melbourne, and which is being used for State as well as Commonwealth purposes. </para>

                            <para>- I have visited the printing works, and hold that the Victorian Government are pretty well suited with our up-to-date machinery. They get' along very well indeed with their work, and it is done in an improved manner, simply by reason of the fact that they have practically the free use of the latest printing machinery. I do not know that we are not justified in complaining of the present position. A few years ago the Premier of this State, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bent,</inline> was growling at public functions about our using their Parliament House, and using offices belonging to, or rented by the State. If I had only to consider my own comfort, I would not thank the State Government for the use of this building. On page 6, in the second schedule, there is an item of £1,160 for machinery and plant for the Government Printing Office and works in connexion therewith. The fact that we are continually renewing this machinery, and that we have a very good plant established in the State printing-office, leads me to think that it would be far cheaper and better if the Commonwealth were to at once establish a printing works of its own in Melbourne. </para>

                            <para>- There is a large plant which we use, and they use our plant. Undoubtedly our plant, being modern, is more up to date than the State plant, but the great advantage of the present arrangement to the Commonwealth is that when a rush of work takes place we have an immense plant of which we can avail ourselves. We should have to make a very considerable addition to our present plant in order to cope with a g,!Ut of work. The Treasurer has looked into this matter, and come to the conclusion that the present arrangement is more economical than the establishment of a printing office. We have had a great deal of trouble in connexion with the renting of premises. Melbourne is not' our abiding home; it is only a temporary abode, and we really do not want to erect a big building, to be used for only a short time. It is doubtful whether we could get a useful building for our purpose without having to make considerable alterations therein. So far as I can ascertain, the Departments are getting their work done more economically and better than they could if we were to establish a printing office of our own. But I shall ask the Treasurer to look into the matter again, and see whether, in the circumstances, we could not rent premises, establish our own' office, and do our own work at a reasonable rate. If. however, the State and the Commonwealth' can use a' building equipped with machinery belonging partly to one and partly to the other, and mutually assist each other and work economically, why should we not do so in preference to establishing an institution of our own? </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator seems to forget that we considered these votes, in the Estimates very carefully. I cannot say from memory that this particular vote caught my eye; but no doubt when I was looking through the Estimates for last year I noticed an, item of ,£250 for an armoury at Guildford, and it was passed. Guildford is one of our m&gt;st important country towns,, with the railway workshops not far away, whereas Northam is a little village. </para>

                            <para>- The Government does nothing but take responsibility. What I complain of is that Ministers resent any criticism. Even now the Minister does not tell us why this change was made. It concerns his own Department, and he ought to know in what directions money is spent upon public buildings. I have no doubt that the people of Guildford are wondering when the drill hall will be erected. When I go to Western Australia, I shall be asked on all hands when the work is to be commenced. I can give a case in point. Only a little while ago, there was a sum of money on the Estimates for the building of a post-office at Gwalia in Western Australia. Months have passed; but by a recent mail I received a letter from residents, asking when the work is to be commenced. Here is a similar case. I quite expect that when I go to Guildford I shall have people swarming round me inquiring why the drill-hall has not been built. Fortunately, I am taking the Minister of Defence to Western Australia with me, and shall refer the deputations to him. He will have the peculiar felicity of defending the policy of his predecessor. It is a farce to vote money in: specific directions, when it is not spent as voted. We might as well vote a lump sum. </para>
