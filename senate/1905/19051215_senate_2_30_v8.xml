                    <para>- If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> thinks that there is any chance of the prorogation not taking place until Thursday next, I think that he might ask the Senate to meet on Monday at half-past 10 o&#39;clock, if by doing so it would save a day. I booked my passage first for today, and then for Wednesday next, because there is always very great difficulty in getting a comfortable passage to Tasmania at this period of the year. </para>

                        <para>- Yesterday I made inquiries as to the progress made, and&#39;, on behalf of the Postmaster-General, I have to say that when he set out to consider the conditions of tender, he found that inquiries would have to be instituted into a variety of matters arising out of the developments of ocean communication, that those inquiries have been set on foot and that he does no) expect to receive the necessary information to enable him to frame the conditions before at least the end, of this month. He is not in a position at the present time to state the conditions on which tenders will be called. Inquiries will have to be made outside Australia, and the information which is desired is not expected to be to hand until at least about the end of the year. Under these circumstances, it will be impossible to lay upon the table of either House at this time any set of conditions which could be said to be the conditions on which tenders will be invited. </para>

                        <para>- There is a difficulty About this motion. The Senate has already decided that, at its rising, it shall adjourn until Monday. I quite understand that these formal motions for the adjournment of the Senate are simply moved to enable a senator to bring forward some matter of urgent public importance. But seeing that the Senate has already decided to adjourn until half-past 10 o&#39;clock on Monday morning - and the significance of that as affecting formal motions never struck me until this moment - it is difficult to meet the objection. </para>

                            <para>- The particular matters concerning which the Senate has cause for . complaint affect the alleged mail contract for the Pacific Islands mail services, and the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Richmond</inline> in New Guinea. Honorable senators will remember that last year some of us took great exception to the expenditure of j&#163;i 2,000 for the purposes of mail services for New Guinea. One of the grounds of exception was that, if there were to be increases of expenditure in these directions, tenders ought to be called for. There was placed before the Senate at the time a memorandum of a proposed agreement between Messrs. Burns, Philp and Company, and the Commonwealth Government. We understood that Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Company were &#39; to sign the proposed contract on the one hand, and that the Commonwealth Government was to sign it on the other, after some alterations had been made. Those alterations were communicated in some Ministerial replies given in the Senate last year. They were to the effect that in the new contract with. Messrs. Bums, Philp, and Company, there would be stated the passenger fares to be charged to and from the Islands, and the rates for freight - two very important alterations, in view of the fact that we were subsidizing a company which would compete with other steam-ship owners. Believing that the Department of External Affairs would see that those alterations were made in the contract, and that everything would proceed in an ordinary business-like way, nothing was done to raise the question again until some time this year. While taking exception to the expenditure of the .&#163;12.000, in view of the approach of the discussion on the Appropriation Bill. I sought for information concerning this particular contract. At first I gave notice of a motion that there should be laid on the table of the Senate a copy of the contract, or a copy of the agreement - I am not sure which word I used - with Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Company. I thought that that would be taken as a purely formal motion. But when it was called on, the Minister at the table said &#34;not formal.&#34; At the time I thought he did so under a misapprehension. </para>

                    <para class="block">The Minister having said &#34; not formal,&#34; I asked him at a later stage whether he had done so under a misapprehension. I asked the Minister of Defence whether he would make inquiries into the matter. I said that I understood that there was no such agreement in existence, and that there was a rumour to that effect. I asked him if he would make inquiries, because if no such agreement was in existence, it was useless to move that a copy of it be laid on the table of the Senate. The time for the consideration of the Appropriation Bill was approaching, and we wanted this information. We could not get it. The Appropriation Bill was brought before the Senate, and in Committee the matter was brought up again. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> had a message sent over to the Department of External Affairs, asking the Secretary to attend here, a message which should have been unnecessary, as the Secretary should&#34; have been present in the Senate when his Estimates were under discussion. When the Secretary for External Affairs put in an appearance the Minister was furnished with a memorandum concerning the Pacific Islands mail services. The Minister told us, acting under information from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Atlee</inline> Hunt, that it was a ten years&#39; contract. I call attention to those words, &#34; a ten years&#39; contract,&#34; because I wish to show later on that there has been a great deal of quibbling about the use of words. That information was entirely misleading.

                    <para>I do not blame the Prime Minister in this matter. I do not blame the Minister of Defence. No one can accuse the Prime Minister of want of energy. He is a most enthusiastic and energetic Cabinet Minister. I can well believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> is not to blame either. Both he and the Prime Minister had to look to the Secretary of External Affairs for information. It was from the Secretary of External Affairs that the Minister of Defence received the replies given in the Senate. I do not think that the Prime Minister would have undertaken to say - given a full knowledge of the fact, that the Senate had ordered a copy of this contract to be laid on the table - that he did not &#34; think it well to lay it on the table until it was signed. </para>

                            <para>- That I suppose is due to the fact that there have been so many changes of Government, and the Secretary of the Department has got either an exaggerated view of his rights and responsibilities, or thinks, &#34; Well, there is no occasion to be particular; it will be all right; there will be a change of Ministry in a few days, and nothing need happen.&#34; There is no good reason for concealment. I state candidly that the reason why I am anxious to get this information is that I desire to find out what the particulars of the contract are, and whether the terms promised by a former Government would be included in it, namely, that the rates for passengers&#39; fares and freights would be specified. I think that the Senate will support me in the view that I am right in calling attention to the neglect of the Secretary of External Affairs to have&#39; this contract prepared in time, and his failure to bring under the notice of the proper authorities that Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Company either will not sign the contract, or have neglected to sign it. In so doing, his conduct is likely to prove injurious to the Commonwealth. And there is this additional disadvantage - that, whereas all other mail contractors are under a penalty for failure to adhere to the terms of their contracts, in the absence of any signed contract Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Company can do exactly as they please. </para>

The Minister of Defence has had to cope with a most difficult Department, and has coped with it well. He has explained the difficulties, and we know what they are. It has taken him all his time to attend to his Department. The Prime Minister, we are aware, has been in office only a few months, and has had his hands sufficiently full in regard to Bills and affairs in the other House, without concerning himself very much with matters that had already been attended to by his Department. </para>

The vessels were to call at certain islands about New Guinea, but were not to call at or depart from ports such as Cooktown, from whence a vessel owned by Clunn and Son sails. Now, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hunt,</inline> the Secretary to the Department of External Affairs, has evidently, on his own authority, undertaken to vary the route, and we find a company, subsidized to the extent of &#163;12,000, starting from Cooktown, in opposition to a vessel owned by Clunn and Sons, who receive no subsidy. </para>

                            <para>- The case of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Richmond,</inline> like the other to which I have referred, is urgent, seeing that, according to the Minister, we shall go into recess not later than Wednesday or Thursday next. When Parliament is prorogued, the Senate will have no opportunity to discuss these matters, and their control will again be surrendered to the Secretary to the Department of External Affairs. The case of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Richmond</inline> is said to be under inquiry ; but I point out that he first complained about his suspension, in a letter dated the 27th August last, which reached us on the 26th September. If will be seen that three months and a half have elapsed since <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Richmond</inline> was suspended ; and, during the whole of that time, he has been under a cloud of disgrace, and, probably, receiving no salary. If, owing to our going into recess, there is further delay, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Richmond&#39;s</inline> funds may become exhausted, and he may have to leave New Guinea, and thus deprived of any redress. </para>

This, matter, which is described as &#34;trifling,&#34; has, owing to the questions asked in the Senate, proved to be an apparently gross case of injustice - a case which shows either dereliction of duty on the part of a high officer, or defamation of character by the chief of the Lands Department in New Guinea. The questions which I asked on this matter were set out in detail, as I have frequently to set out questions, in order to get the desired information. If a question be asked in a general way, the facts cannot always be obtained, and it is necessary to so arrange them as, to elicit definite replies. The first questions were evaded by the Secretary to the Department of External Affairs, and I had to ask the Minister next day whether he noticed that they had not been replied to. The Minister, I suppose, in his usual whole-hearted way, asked for definite and straight replies, which we then got. The questions had reference to the composition of the Council in New Guinea which suspended <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Richmond.</inline> We then discovered that the Council was composed of very few men, and that Captain Barton, who was accused, voted to suspend <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Richmond</inline> for disloyalty. </para>

                            <para>- Where there are so many Ministerial changes, it frequently happens that the secretary of a Department is the boss, and that Ministers are at his mercy. I call attention to these matters, because the session is likely to close soon, and there is the possibility of loss through the expenditure of &#163;12,000 in an irregular way. Perhaps I ought not to use the word &#34;irregular,&#34; seeing that it may be construed as a reflection on a vote of the Senate, but, at any rate, I may describe the position as unsatisfactory. There is a fear that the gravest injustice may be done to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Richmond,</inline> owing to the fact that in New Guinea there are a number of officials who have no sympathy whatever with Australian sentiment. The facts of this case, and the failure to furnish definite replies, show that the Secretary to the Department of External Affairs is in sympathy with those who compose the Executive Council in New Guinea. </para>

                    <para>- I have given this clause some additional consideration, with a view to making it effective without reflecting upon other provisions in the Bill. I regard this clause as likely to be more effective than most of the provisions of the Bill. It would be an abominable thing if people were to be brought here under what would be false pretences. I mentioned with very strong approval a provision which we have in South Australia, though it is not quite so good as this, affecting masters and servants. Last night I suggested the insertion of the word &#34; knowingly &#34; after the word &#34;contract,&#34; where it first appears in the clause, and I admit that in the hands of lay magistrates its use might be open to the objections urged against it. I think that perhaps it would be better to use the word &#34; wilfully.&#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> has indicated his intention to move that the words &#34; or is likely to be&#34; be left out, and there is no doubt that would be an improvement on the clause. I believe that it is not desirable to include sub-clause 2. I know from experience how these provisions work in a Court, and the effect of this sub-clause would be to put the immigrant into the witness-box with a stain on his character, because the first question asked him by the opposing counsel would be, &#34; Of course, you expect to share in any penalty imposed in this case.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- He would under this sub-clause profit by the punishment inflicted for a criminal offence. The magistrate might impose a fine of only 1s., but the man fined would have a conviction recorded against him for what is really false pretences. Under this subclause there is no doubt that the contract immigrant would go into the witness-box tainted with the expectation of profit from the penalty, and that would affect the weight which would attach to his evidence. The tendency of modern times in all British countries is to do away with the practice which is involved in this clause as rendering a witness amenable to the suggestion that he may be influenced by the possibility of participating in the proceeds of a penalty for a criminal offence. It should also be borne in mind, as has already been pointed out, that the contract immigrant&#39;s right of action where there is damage is left quite untouched, and, under other provisions of the Bill, the Minister will have power to award the immigrant, in certain circumstances, up to, I think, &#163;50, to enable him to return to the place from which he was brought, or to compensate him should he remain here for loss suffered while he is waiting until he gets other employment.

                    <para>- I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> will not accept the whole of the amendments suggested. I have no objection to the elimination of the words &#34;or is likely to be,&#34; or to the omission of the second sub-clause, but, in my opinion, the amendment now moved for the insertion of the word &#34;wilfully&#34; vitiates the whole clause. It should be necessary to prove merely that what is set out in the clause was done. The injury is done to the intending immigrant, whether it is done wilfully or not, and it is &#34;right that employers should have some reason to fear the consequences if they make any misrepresentations of the kind suggested. </para>

                        <para>- I am aware of that. Presumably, the contract immigrant would not have enough money to pav his passage out and to maintain him while he was looking for work, and that would be the reason why he was willing to come out as a contract immigrant. In the circumstances, of what use to him would a civil remedy be? He would land unknown in this country; he might be opposed by a powerful combination of employers-we know the proverbial law&#39;s delays -and he would have no means to engage counsel, or to fight the powers pitted against him by the other side. It is, therefore, idle to talk of his civil remedy. The amendment, if accepted, will render the clause useless. </para>

I am satisfied that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> would not mislead me, and, in conversation with the honorable senator, I asked his advice on a concrete case. The case I put was this: An employer makes a contract with an immigrant, and gives him to understand that the wages ruling in the place in which he is to be employed are 10s. per day. When he arrives at his destination, he finds they are11s. per day. He lays an information against the employer for misrepresentation. When the case is heard the employer says, I did not know that the wages were us. per day.&#34; The contract immigrant&#39;s counsel would say, &#34; Did you inquire or take any steps to find out what was the rate of wages,&#34; and, if the answer to that is &#34;no,&#34; a conviction would lie under the use of the word wilfully in this clause. I am assured by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> that a conviction would lie if it were possible for the employer to know the rate of wages, and he did not take the trouble to find out what it was. </para>

                        <para>- If, on the other hand, he took all reasonable precautions to find out the ruling conditions, and yet in some minor matters an inaccurate statement was made in the contract, a conviction would not lie, and I do not think that it should in such a case. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> puts the case: Suppose the trade union rate is us. a day, and the employer does not employ union men. But the answer to that, I think, is that the Court will decide every case on its merits, and, though the employer may pay a lower rate than the union rate, it will not necessarily be the ruling rate in the district in which the contract immigrant is employed, and the Court will be guided bv what is the ruling rate of wages in the district. If it were a representative trade union, and it recognised the standard wage for the district, the Court would observe that fact. </para>

I cannot understand how the Minister can possibly object to my amendment, because it does not affect either the principle or the working of the Act, but only enables the country, through Parliament, to know how it is working. Without a provision of this kind, Parliament will have no means of judging accurately whether the Act has had the effect of reducing wages or making the conditions of labour worse. </para>

                    <para>. - I am quite in accord with the object which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">&#34;Senator Pearce</inline> have in view, and that is to provide for the production of an annual return on this subject, but I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> has gone a little too far in asking that the return shall include the names and addresses of each employer, the rate of wages, number of working hours, and class, of labour. The law provides that the Minister shall not allow a contract to be entered into, or a contract immigrant to land unless the remuneration and other terms and conditions of employment are at least equal to those which are current here in that occupation. It is not necessary to provide for a return to contain all that information, because, at any time a member of Parliament could see a copy of any contract if he wished. I prefer to accept the proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> because I think it quite right that the Parliament should be provided with a return showing the number of contract immigrants, with their nationality and occupations, the number of contracts disapproved, and the number of contract immigrants refused admission. </para>

Of course, every return furnished to Parliament furnishes some information, but many returns furnish perfectly useless information. The proposal that we should have information as to the number of immigrants admitted commends itself to every one; but why ask for these further particulars? The information can always be obtained from the office. It appears that some honorable senators desire to pillory employers who bring in contract immigrants. They are making our legislation as offensive as possible.

                    amendment, which is very carefully framed, and which the Government have accepted, gives all the information one can desire. We have already struck out paragraph

                    is merely consequential, and, therefore, to retain the latter would be useless. There is not much harm in supplying information as to the number of employers engaged in contract labour, but the paragraph goes on to provide that the returns shall show the number of contract immigrants engaged by each employer.

                    (Queensland).- In regard to paragraph

                    it is highly important that Parliament should have this information each year. Honorable senators have expressed a desire that the wages and other conditions of labour in Australia shall not be lowered or altered in any way, and to that end it is necessary to know how the Act is working.

                    that he should not press paragraph

                    No doubt the information would be valuable, but it can be obtained by moving for a return, when necessary. An annual return might prove as bulky as
                    <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline>
                    seeing that, as all contracts differ, each would have to be shown separately. What would be the value of such a return ? Immigrants would be working under the contracts, and I cannot see in what way Parliament could take any action.

The honorable senator could only accomplish what he desires by striking out the words &#34; accompanying their employer to Australia,&#34; and to do so would be to open the door to any one who chose to call himself or herself a domestic servant or personal attendant, to come in without let or hindrance.

                    <para>- The Bill has now been fully considered, and honorable senators are in a position to make up their minds whether, as a whole, it is a good or a bad Bill. Certain honorable senators voted for the second reading in the hope that provisions in the measure to which they objected would be struck out in Committee. Certainly from my point of view none of the objectionable provisions of the Bill have been struck out in Committee. We have it on the authority of some honorable senators that the effect of the. Bill will be that there will be so many contract immigrants introduced under it that the annual return giving particulars of their contracts will be as bulky as <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> That may be an exaggeration, but it shows that the hopes which some honorable senators had in supporting the second reading of the Bill have not been realized. In order to give those honorable senators an opportunity to decide whether the Bill as amended meets with their approval, I intend to call for a division on the motion for the third reading. </para>

                    After having carefully watched the proceedings and taken very little part in the discussions on the two Bills which have recently engaged our attention, I am satisfied that in the Senate there is a certain section who are so well pleased with these measures that I cannot but view them with suspicion.

                        <para>-Senator Croft said that my question is the sequel to the passing of the Immigration Restriction Amendment Bill, but it is quite consistent with the attitude I have adopted here for years, and therefore I cannot understand his remarks. </para>

                    <para>- I regret that honorable senators have not provided in the Bill for the preparation of a return showing the rate of wages and the number of hours to be worked by contract immigrants. I believe <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Croft</inline> is right in thinking that the attitude of the Opposition is very significant. The Oppoposition, who voted for the second reading of the measure, refused to agree to an amendment to the effect that an employer should advertise that he could not get men locally. . </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator drew attention to a proposal made in Committee, and wished to saddle the responsibility for its rejection upon the official Opposition. If the official Opposition did something which justified the honorable senator in delivering his little moral lecture, he ought not to have referred specifically to only one section of those who voted in. that way. The circumstance justifies the prophecy in which J indulged last night - that if any particular section of the community objects to what we have done they will say that it was all the fault of the wicked Opposition; but that if they find any good in the Bill, they will take credit to themselves as, being responsible for its introduction and its good provisions. </para>

                        <para>- At any rate, a journalistic &#34; whip &#34; of a very urgent description was cracked the other day, and honorable senators on the other side responded very heartily to the crack. That fact ought not to excite any surprise. I do not join with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> in his references to the Opposition, because they have only done what I should naturally expect them to do. They belong to a political school which approves of what has been done in connexion with the Bill. </para>

                        <para>- It is possible for that inference to be drawn from the remarks of the honorable senator, but the division lists will show that the members of each party have voted in different ways. If the measure had been treated from a party stand-point that fact would show that some honorable senators had deserted their party. I am glad to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie&#39;s statement that he does not wish to make it appear that this is a party Bill. The majority of the members of the Labour Party voted against the second reading. Some of them voted in favour of it. </para>

                        <para>- I will take your ruling as to whether I am in order. I should not be saying what I am unless I thought it was relevant. It is necessary in the light of what has been said that some of us who have been attacked should make an explanation. I shall support the third reading for the same reasons as induced me to VOte for the second reading. I believe that&#34; this will be a useful Bill, and that in many respects it will do more to keep contract immigrants out of Australia than the original Act did. </para>

                    <para>- I shall vote against the third reading of this Bill, because I have been consistently opposed to it right through. It is a great mistake that the Federal Parliament is,_to a great extent, going back on the legislation passed in 1901. I quite agree that this has not been a party measure. But if there has been one party in this country that has taken kudos for our immigration laws, and has claimed that it has acted in the interests of those who have to earn their living by manual labour, it is the Labour Party, of which I am a member. We have pointed out from one end of Queensland to the other that, by passing the contract immigration sections, the Federal Parliament has taken out of the hands of those who are employing large numbers of men the power to lower the conditions of labour in Australia, and to reduce wages. Let us suppose that last year <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> had introduced this Bill as a member of the Reid Government. Does anybody think that he would have been able to get it through in a day and a half? I am perfectly satisfied that there is not an honorable senator on this side of the Chamber who does not think that it would have taken a week or two to get the Bill through. In my opinion, no matter whether the Bill was introduced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> on behalf of the Reid Government, or by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford,</inline> on behalf of the Deakin Government, it would be absolutely wrong. Had it been proposed by the late Government, I am satisfied that my own party would have been solid against it. I am prepared to make -this statement anywhere, because I realize that if there is one thing in con,nexion with immigration for which my party has claimed credit, it is that we have put very big obstacles in the way of men being imported under contract. I believe that this measure considerably weakens the law and puts a weapon into the hands of associated employers to lower wages and alter the conditions of employment of the workmen of Australia whenever they deem it .wise or in their own interests to take advantage of it. </para>

From my reading, of the Bill, it will be a two-edged sword. I do not wish to claim credit for any part of the Bill. L opposed it on the second reading, and I oppose it still. But I believe that very .soon the honorable senator who made the statement to which I have referred will be trying to sneak out of all share in it. It will be remembered that when we were

                    <para>- They had not the manliness to vote against it in 1901. But the provision contained in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">g</inline> has now been made stronger. I will admit that the law has been modified in respect of contract labour, but in regard to men who are under agreement to serve on particular ships honorable senators have &#34; given the show away &#34; absolutely. My opinion is that a Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company&#39;s boat cannot now carry a passenger between two InterState ports unless a contract is submitted to the Minister and his approval is obtained. </para>

                    <para>When the Customs Tariff Act was before Parliament, the question of the desirability of giving some encouragement to the manufacture of iron and steel from local ores was seriously considered ; and it was, I think, the opinion of the majority that some assistance was advisable, and that the best method was that of bonuses. Accordingly, there was inserted in the Customs Tariff Act what is known as &#34; Division VI.A - Metals and Machinery,&#34; which had for its object the granting of bonuses. Throughout the Commonwealth there are extensive and valuable deposits of both coal and iron ore. In New South Wales the deposits of coal and iron are in close proximity, and in Tasmania and South Australia there are also large deposits. At the present time the Broken Hill Proprietary are using iron ore flux in connexion with their operations at a place called Iron Knob, where there is a perfect mountain of ore of high percentage. I am not aware at this moment whether there are any deposits in Queensland. </para>

                            <para>- I know that iron ore is found in Western Australia, and, indeed, in every other State of the Commonwealth. All communities which have reached a high state of prosperity by means of manufactures have possessed) the advantages of large supplies of native iron and coal. England herself owes her manufacturing supremacy and her prosperity mainly to her wealth of resource in that respect, and the same may be said of Belgium and that part of Germany known as Westphalia, where the chief centres of industry are Dusseldorff and Essen. We have similar examples in Pennsylvania and other places in America. At the beginning of Federation it was, as I say, considered that the development of the iron industry could be best assisted by means of bonuses, and!, therefore, when the Customs Tariff Act was before Parliament, Division VI.A, to which I have referred, was inserted. The division reads - </para>

Proclamation to issue so soon as it is certified by the Minister that the manufacture to which the proclamation refers has been sufficiently established in the Commonwealth, according to the provisions of any law relating to bonuses for the encouragement of manufactures or to the establishment of manufactures under the direct control of the Commonwealth or State Governments, but no proclamation to issue except in pursuance of a joint address passed on the motion of Ministers by both Houses of Parliament, stating that such manufacture is sufficiently established. </para>

                    <para class="block">When the division should come into operation, a variety of iron products, including scrap iron and steel, pig-iron, ingots, blooms, slabs, billets, puddled bars, and? so forth, had to bear a duty of 10 per cent, <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem;</inline> but in the meantime, however, all these articles had to be admitted free of duty. Until the manufacture is established so as to supply all the requirements of the Commonwealth, it would be a hardship on manufacturers of machinery to impose a protective duty. A Bill,, known as the Bonus for Manufactures Bill, was introduced by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kingston,</inline> as Minister of Trade and Customs, and read a first time in the session of 1901-2, and a report of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kingston&#39;s</inline> speech, in moving the second reading, may be found in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> for 27 th May, 1902. On the vote on the second reading, there was twenty-four for, and eighteen against, or a majority of six in favour of the measure. On the motion of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watson,</inline> the Bill was referred to a Select Committee?, consisting of, in addition to the mover, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Braddon, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joseph</inline> Cook, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Winter</inline> Cooke, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. L.</inline> E. Groom, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes, Mr. Kirwan, Mr. Mauger, Mr. Watkins, Mr. McCay,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fuller.</inline> That Committee was appointed on the 2nd September 1902, ,and, if I remember rightly, their report showed that the Committee were divided - four members being in favour of the Bill, and four preferring that the manufacture of iron should be undertaken by the Commonwealth Government, or by the States Governments. The Bill was further considered on the 1 8th October, 1904 - when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chapman,</inline> who was then in charge, related its history. The second reading on that occasion, 9th December, 1904. was carried by twenty-seven votes to six. That was immediately before the prorogation, and the Bill was practically dropped. The trouble was that while some honorable members were of opinion that the bonus should be given without any condition, to either States or private individuals, others contended that the assistance should be confined to a Commonwealth or State enterprise. But there is a section of the Constitution which prevents any enterprise of the kind being entered upon by the Commonwealth; and that, I think, is most unfortunate. </para>

                            <para>- Does the honorable senator mean to say that it would be totally impracticable for the Government of New South Wales to inaugurate this industry ? In my opinion, the New South Wales Government could undertake this work without any trouble. However, I do not wish to be drawn into an argument on that phase of the question, but merely desire to explain the principles on which this Bill is based. The &#39;Government are of opinion that it is utterly futile to attempt the encouragement of the manufacture of iron by means of a bonus ; an attempt to pass a measure with that object not having met with sue- cess. It so happens that at the present time the New South&#39; Wales Government have entered . into an arrangement with a gentleman, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sandford&#39;,</inline> to supply all the requirements of, at all events, that State, so far as iron is concerned!. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne has, I believe, had conversations with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sandiford,</inline> and is of opinion that if that division of the Customs Tariff Act, to which I have already called attention, were amended by means of a measure, which, without any reference to a bonus, provided for the imposition of duties under certain conditions, the object we have in view, namely, the encouragement of the industry, could be attained. The duties are to come into operation only when the Minister for Trade and Customs certifies that the manufacture from Australian ore or material is sufficiently established, &#34; and the certificate has been affirmed by joint addresses passed on the motion of Ministers by both Houses of Parliament.&#34;&#34;&#39; </para>

This Bill repeals the reference to bonuses in the introductory words of the part of the Tariff referred to.

                            <para>- I make no personal references. As at first introduced, the measure left the proclamation to the Minister, and now the original provision leaving the matter to Parliament is also re-enacted. The Bill will render the bringing into operation of the part of the Tariff referred to in no way dependent on bonus legislation, or upon the will of the Minister, to whatever fiscal faith he may belong, but will leave to Parliament, as it should do, an opportunity to deal with the whole matter when&#34; the time arrives for action to be taken. This Bill of itself is of no particular advantage to anybody, nor is it calculated, as far as I can judge, to do a.nv harm to anybody. It amounts to a little more, but only a very little more, than the addition&#39; of another page to the printed matter in our statute-book. The only criticism I can offer to the measure is that it is one of those Bills which illustrates the strong tendency displayed bv some members <inline font-style="italic">of</inline> the Government - and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> isnot one of them, because the honorable senator always calls a spade a spade - to apply a verv large name to a very small thing. We had an instance of the kind in the Commerce Bill. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline> Playford  agreed with us on that subject, and* the Government subsequently adopted an amendment which, to some extent, limited the expression used in that case. Here we have a Bill &#34;for an Act to encourage manufactures in Australia.&#34; </para>

                            <para>- It reminds one of the frog in the fable, who blew himself out with the idea that he was giving himself the appearance of an ox. We have recently had a good deal of make-believe, but I do think that the policy of make-believe-and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> smiles in sympathy - is being carried a little too far. The titles of our Bills should. at least correspond in some way to their importance and utility. Still, if the Government prefer to dress this small matter up in peacock&#39;s feathers in this way, I do not grudge them the indulgence of that vanity, and I shall not move any amendment on the title. But I commend my observations on the point to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford.</inline></para>

                            <para>- It is exceedingly moderate. We are asked to say in this Bill that if Parliament pleases it may, at some future time, when an industry has been established, give that industry some encouragement so that it may be established. If ever there was an illustration in legislation of putting the cart before the horse, this measure is one. In connexion with one measure introduced this session, the Minister of Defence was frank enough to admit that it was a sham and a fraud, and I think that the same terms might be appropriately applied to the Bill we are now asked to deal with. I quite agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> that it will do neither harm nor good. The only qualification of the statement which I would make is that it may do some little harm by deceiving people. It will, certainly not add to the reputation of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne as solid protectionists anxious to encourage the industries of Australia. </para>

                        <para>- This Bill is short, but I cannot say that it is also sweet. It opens up the flood-gates of debate if honorable senators chose to take advantage of it. I am amazed at the audacityy or shall I say the foolishness, of the Minister in submitting such a Bill at a time when the life of the session is beginning to be counted by hours. It might lead to prolonged debate, and might even encourage one like myself to deal with the subject for a few hours. If I were not strong-minded I should be drawn into the vortex; but I propose to avoid it, and I hope other senators will do the same. I do not propose to discuss the matter from Dan to Beersheba. I shall not dwell, as I might do, on the iniquities brought to light in the attempts to prevent the importations of harvesters. I shall not permit: myself to be dragged into a discussion of the threats against the consumers of Australia in favour of certain manufacturers. I shall not take advantage of the opportunity to point out the efforts made to increase the burden of taxation without benefit to the Treasury. </para>

                        <para>- It is only on the assumption that the Government are laying down a new rule, under which it is to be usual to introduce legislation of a kind to which all sorts of ugly names can be given, that I can understand why such a piece of sham legislation as this is should be trotted out in the last days of the session. It would not require a very powerful microscope to show that there is no appearance of genuineness about this measure. I speak, not so much as a protectionist, but as one able to take a sober view of fiscalism at all times, when I say that I am unable to understand why this measure should be introduced at this stage, when we have a Tariff Commission at present engaged upon an inquiry into the question dealt with in this measure and similar questions. The Government should certainly have waited until the report of the Tariff Commission was before us before they introduced legislation dealing with this subject. Surely we ought not to pass the Bill until we receive the later information which will be contained in the report of the Tariff Commission. To introduce the Bill at this time is neither more nor less than to offer an insult to that body. No immediate good could be done by its enactment. Blast furnaces could not be erected, and pig-iron produced and converted into steel, in practically a day. Even if the furnaces were now in process of erection, considerable time would elapse before pig iron and steel could be produced. Not only have the ironworks to produce iron, but to produce it in sufficient quantity before division VI.A of the Tariff can be brought into operation. In view of that fact, what necessity is there for passing this measure? Really it is the greatest of the farces to which we have been subjected during the last week. The Government will act most fittingly by withdrawing the Bill, because it is only a laughing-stock. It must be remembered that the Senate is pledged to a policy quite opposed to that which it seeks to enact. After a calm and protracted discussion, it affirmed the principle of establishing national ironworks. To introduce a measure of this kind, therefore, is to fly in the face of that affirmation. I protest against the measure being sneaked in in this manner. Does the Minister wish to defy the Senate or to work in accord with its deliberate opinion? If he wishes to defy the Senate, what interest is now actuating him? He certainly is not urged forward by any public interest. He may be influenced by underhand reasons; there may be wire-pulling which is not apparent to us. I am fully satisfied that there is no public demand for the measure. That proof has been furnished very recently in the State which possesses the most natural advantages for the production of iron by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sandford</inline> - a gentleman who, I suppose, knows more about the iron trade than does any other person in Australia - who has undertaken the establishment of ironworks without waiting for this Bill to be enacted. When a bonus was asked for, undoubtedly his evidence went to prove to the Royal Commission that it was not necessary. Since Parliament is not prepared to grant a bonus to privately-owned ironworks, another means is being taken to attain the same end. To me this Bill is neither more nor less than an attempt to place the Senate in a position from which it could not very well recede. If we were to give our countenance to this measure, it would be alleged by-and-by that by our action we had encouraged certain persons to invest their money in the iron industry. After iron works had been established, and it had been found that there was not sufficient work to occupy the men, the iron-master would come along and say, &#34;Here are a certain number of men who are out of employment. Are you going to see these fine works, this fine industry, closed from want of protection ? Give us the protection that we want, and these men will all be fully employed, and the country will be prosperous.&#34; That, apparently,, is the little, game which the Government are playing, but if that be not their object, this proposal is a piece of hypocrisy from beginning to end. Protectionist as I am, I am not going to give my assent to a hypocritical measure of this kind, and to the placing of the Parliament in a position from which it could not very well recede, especially when it might be pointed out that there were many unemployed workmen in the community. There is only&#39; one thing I submit for the Senate to .do, and &#34;that is to clearly indicate that it adheres to its decision that if the industry is to be worthy of the financial support which it will require it should be a national one. I hold that the Senate will be best conserving the interests of the States by supporting the establishment of national ironworks instead of allowing them to be established in any one State, either by a State Government or by a private company. If the ironworks were established and controlled by the Commonwealth Government, the interests of all the States would be equally conserved; but if they were&#34; established by a State Government, and were to be kept going,, they would exercise&#39; a controlling influence over the Government railways throughout the Commonwealth, because the Australian market is only sufficient to keep one really up-to-date blast furnace going all the year round. I am glad that the States Governments have announced that they do not intend to start State ironworks, because if they did we should lind ourselves in the same predicament as we should if they were started by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sandford</inline> or any one else. To allow the ironworks to be in the hands of a State Government would be to create a monopoly which could control the price of the iron which would be required for the railways of the different States. How much greater evil would it be if the ironworks were controlled by a private company ! I . do not wish it to be understood that I am making any reflection upon <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sandford,</inline> because I believe that he is a good citizen, deserving of every reasonable encouragement which/ can be given to him to establish iron-works in New South Wales. What we have to consider is the interest of the whole Commonwealth, and that, I submit, can best be conserved by the establishment of Commonwealth ironworks. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> has stated that the Prime Minister, when he was Attorney-General Jil &#34;the Barton Government, expressed an opinion which is quite opposed to that view. I interjected that he was wrong in making that statement, and I now propose to read the opinion which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> gave on the 18th July, 1903, at the request- of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kingston,</inline> the Chairman of the Bonus Commission. </para>

                    <para>Under sub-sections (I.), (II-), and (III-), taken together (trade and commerce, taxation, and bounties), the authority of the Commonwealth over industrial development is of the largest; but though it allows of control, regulation, and guidance, it in no respect points to direct establishment or management of any industries. </para>

                    <para>The manufacture of iron may be incidental to the execution of many such powers, <inline font-style="italic">e.g.,</inline> defence or the construction of railways. The Commonwealth might clearly undertake the manufacture of any goods for its own use; and probably if it did so, and it were incidentally advantageous to the interests of the economical working of the undertaking that it should also manufacture for other consumers, such manufacture would also come within its implied powers. Except as above, it does not appear that any power to establish and conduct manufactures can be implied from the Constitution. </para>
                    <para class="block">In view of tha last paragraph in the opinion, I hold that the Commonwealth has power under the Constitution to establish national ironworks, and that until that Course is taken there will be no satisfactory settlement of this question. In Australia, the principal consumers of iron are the States Governments, because their railways consume practically nine-tenths of the raw iron imported. If the ironworks were established by a private company, the States railways would be at the mercy of a monopoly. If the works were to be kept going, and we were to see that they had sufficient trade, we should have to give them practically whatever price they might choose to demand for pig iron, steel rails, or other raw iron material which might be required for the States railways. Apart from that, there is another interest to be considered, which should appeal to the Victorian and South Australian senators more than to those representing,&#34; my own State. We know that the interests of manufacturers who use iron - such as ironfounders, engineers, and boiler-makers - would undoubtedly be best conserved if the iron-works to be established were a Commonwealth concern. It would be in the interest of Australia to supply raw material to those iron-works as cheaply as possible. I have &#34;had the opinion of one of the principal manufacturers of Australia on this point. He, seeing the clanger of his raw material being considerably enhanced in price if the iron industry gets into the hands of private monopolists, said that it would be better for the manufacturers that it should be under the control of the Commonwealth Government rather than of a private company. Considering the present stage of the session - that this is almost the last day - I think it is unwise to pass a measure which cannot possibly affect the industries concerned in less than twelve months. Inasmuch as the Senate has already come to a decision on this question after a very extensive debate, it would, I think, be very wrong indeed to pass the Bill. I hope that, no matter what our fiscal opinions may be, we shall set them aside for the present, in face of the fact that we have a. Commission inquiring into the whole question. Tq go behind that Commission would be a mistake. We can best deal with the question by throwing out this Bill. If we pass the measure a crop of misery may have to be faced, which we shall be sorry for having brought about. </para>

                        <para>- lt is not unreasonable to say that the obligation rests upon those who criticise a measure to submit some suggestions for its improvement. I listened attentively to the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> in which he criticised the title of this BilL I naturally expected that he would follow up his criticism by offering suggestions for removing the defect to which he drew attention. I- was surprised that he did not do so. Naturally, I commenced to study the title, and I recognised at once the wisdom which had marked the abstention of my honorable friend from making any suggestion. I invite honorable senators to consider whether they can conceive of any effort of draftsmanship which could devise a title adequately expressive of the purpose of this Bill. What is it for? </para>

                            <para>- Then we might call it &#34; a Bill for an Act for the Encouragement of Humbug.&#34; That might be a truthful and expressive way of stating a fact. But if I were to be asked to suggest a title I should call it &#34; a Bill for an Act to Save the Face of the Government.&#34; Many suggestions could be made, but every one would be a novelty, inasmuch as it had never appeared upon the statute-book before. This is a Bill to tell us that Parliament may, at some future time, do something which it has power to do, whenever it thinks fit to do it. We are reducing the proceedings of Parliament to a farce when we, deliberately meeting here&#39; - two Houses of the Legislature, with all the dignity which surrounds them ; occupying time which might be devoted to more important matters, and involving the country in some measure of expense- are asked to place upon the statute-book a declaration, a placard, a proclamation that at some future time this sovereign Parliament may please itself as to what it does ! What an utter absurdity ! Surely we might as well have been asked to take one bite at the cherry, and at once do the thing which this Bill declares that we may do at some time. Why has the measure been brought in? When we narrow the question down to that, we get a little side-light on the real purpose of the Government. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator overlooks the fact that we are putting through a Bill now, and that a resolution will afterwards be required under it, if it is to have any effect. Surely it would be easier to put a Bill through now, without the necessity for a resolution at a later date, than to pass this Bill requiring a subsequent resolution. </para>

                            <para>- I do not believe that the Government has brought in the Bill without an object; and that object is sufficiently explained by the provisions of the Bill as originally introduced. There was some purpose in that. It proposed - instead of proclaiming that Parliament might at some future date please itself - that Parliament should divest itself of its sovereign powers, and intrust them to one <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne. The other branch of the Legislature having thrown- that out, one may well ask, &#34;Why does the Government proceed with it in this form?&#34; There again it is not difficult to find the true explanation. We know that for some months past the Government has been proclaiming its honest desire to assist the so-called crippled trades and struggling industries of Australia. Not long since, the Prime Minister addressed a communication to the &#39;  Chairman  of the Tariff Commission, urging him to expedite matters, as much as possible. On another occasion we had the interesting spectacle of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chapman,</inline> two members of the present Ministry, struggling with one another as to who .should have the credit of launching an Iron. Bonus Committee. All these were evidences of the earnest desire of the Government to assist the industries of the country. And having taken up this stand, having declared its intention to do something, I presume that the Government thought it necessary to introduce this measure as a justification for those declarations. But, really, is it worth while to pass a Bill which means nothing? Would it not be just as well to tear a page out of a newspaper, or a chapter out of some well-known work, and order that to be printed in the statute-book? It would mean just as much - or just as little. If we pass the Bill we shall merely be making an empty declaration that Parliament, having sovereign powers., may at some future time do something which it has always had the power to do. Is it worth while to encumber the statute-book with a measure like this? </para>

                    <para class="block">Honorable senators have received a vast amount of literature in connexion with the matters dealt with in this Bill - matters which have been under consideration for a long while, and have been discussed on many occasions. The period covered by the Sugar Bounty Act of 1903 expires on the 31st December, 1906. In the paper laid before Parliament on the 18th October, 1904, containing a communication from the Premier of Queensland, together with a memorandum from <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Maxwell,</inline> the director of the Government Sugar Experimental Station, it is shown how exceedingly important this industry is to that State. The Premier of Queensland in that letter wrote - </para>

                        <para>You will admit the importance of the industry when I inform you that one-fifth of the cultivated soil of Queensland is under sugar cane, that two-thirds of the value of her agricultural exports must be credited to sugar, and that about one-twentieth of her white population are dependent for their livelihood on the cultivation and manufacture of sugar. The State Treasury has also a large direct interest in the question, for no less than half-a-million of public money has been invested in the erection of central sugar mills. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">These were the statements made by the Premier of Queensland when he was expressing a desire that the operation of the original Act should be extended for a period beyond December, 1906. Honorable senators are doubtless aware why that Act was passed. The sugar industry in Queensland has always to a large extent been carried on by means of kanaka labour, and the object of the legislation was to assist in the realization of a White Australia by the deportation of these coloured workers at the earliest possible moment. To that end, Parliament felt it to be its duty to encourage to the utmost the carrying on of the industry, not only in Queensland, but in New South Wales, by means of white labour. Section 2 of the Sugar Bounty Act 1903 provides that there shall be paid out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund a bounty on sugar-cane delivered after the commencement of the Act in July, 1903, and before the 1st January, 1907, in the production of which white labour only has been employed, after the 28th February, 1903, or employed for a period of twelve months immediately preceding delivery for manufacture. Section 3 of that Act provides for a bounty of 4s. to 5s. per ton of cane, calculated according to its sugar contents. This is equal to a bounty of &#163;2 per ton of sugar. By the </para>
                    <para class="block">Customs Tariff Act of 1902, the duty on imported sugar-cane is <inline font-style="italic">&#163;fi</inline> per ton, while, according to the Excise Tariff Act of the same year, the Excise duty is fixed at <inline font-style="italic">&#163;3</inline> per ton. The employment of white labour against black labour is thus protected to the extent of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2</inline> per ton of sugar equal to about 4s. 5d. per ton of cane. Section 3 of the Pacific Island Labourers Act 1 901 provides that no Pacific Island labourer is to enter Australia after 31st March, 1904, and by section 4, that no such labourer is to enter Australia before 31st March, 1904, except under licence. AH agreements for the employment of coloured labour terminate on the 31st December, 1906, and bv section 8 of the Act just mentioned, the Minister may cause a Pacific-Island labourer found in Aus.tralia after that date to be deported. I do not suppose that these kanakas will be deported all in one batch ; but the operation will be carried out as speedily as possible twelve months hence. I think I can best explain to honorable senators the position in regard to the sugar bonus if I read the report of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Maxwell,</inline> in answer to a series of questions put to him by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne. Before I proceed to do that, however, I may say that in 1904 the whole question was laid before the Government, and a request made, as I have said,&#39; for a continuance of the bonus after the end of next year. The letter of the Premier of Queensland, an extract from which I have already read, also contains the following : - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>But it was held by those best acquainted with the Queensland sugar industry that the term during which the bonus would be payable was too short, and that it should be extended to at least ten years, in order that the industry might accommodate itself to the altered conditions. The experience of three years has proved the wisdom of this view. There is no hope tha-t two years hence the industry will be independent at once of coloured labour, and of the bonus granted for white-grown cane. There is no hope that within the next two years it will be so firmly established as a white labour industry, a-s to bc able, without the bonus, to pay the wages which white labour has a right to expect for such work. Such being the case, nothing can be more reasonable than the contention of the cane farmer that, as the Commonwealth Parliament has decided that, after igo6, sugar must not be grown by kanaka labour, it is the duty of the Commonwealth Parliament to provide a means by which sugar can be profitably grown, after that date, without the aid of the kanaka. And the only means consistent with the policy of excluding coloured aliens, and of finding sufficiently remunerative employment &#39; for our own race, is the continuance of the bonus now given for white grown cane. Unless this action is taken, there appears to be little hope for the sugar industry of this State. In view of the fact that no bonus may be granted after 1906, cane growers are restricting rather than extending their operations, and, indeed, it is probable that large areas now under sugar cane will soon pass out of cultivation. So far as Queensland is concerned, this result, harmful in any circumstances, would be disastrous in existing circumstances. </para>

                    <para class="block">That means that after a certain period, unless we are prepared to continue the bonus for a further term, the effect on sugar cultivation in Queensland will be most disastrous.

                            <para>- The quantity of sugar grown by white labour has consider-, ably increased, though there has also been an increase in the sugar grown by black labour. The owners of plantations and the number of persons employed in connexion .with white-grown sugar have increased year by year since the bonus has been in operation. In the larger plantations in the north, which employ many people, there has been an increase in the output of sugar, partly due to better seasons. There has also been a considerable increase in the number. of owners and cultivators of small plantations; and this is a branch of the industry we desire to encourage as &#34;far as possible.

                        <para>Question 1. - For what further period does it appear necessary to extend the system of paying bonus on white grown cane? </para>
                        <para>Answer. - In order to estimate this question, it is necessary to briefly review the results of the operations of the bonus legislation from its enactment to this date. Three years of the first period of five years &#39;have matured, and the fourth year is close to completion. The results are indicated, in the first place, by the increases during, those years in the number of white cane-growers, and in the areas registered to earn the bonus, in the several districts of the State of Queensland, as shown by the official figures. </para>
                        <para class="block">Then Df. Maxwell gives a table showing the areas registered for bonus, and the number of white cane-growers. According to this table, the number of growers in 1902 was 1,521, as compared with 2,048 in 1903, a considerable increase. In 1904 the number of growers had increased to 2,429, a further increase of nearly 500, and in 1905 the number had increased to 2,681. </para>

                            <para>- Those figures are not given in the report, but I should point out that the increase in the production of sugar by black labour does not represent a proportionate increase in the number of black labourers employed but is due to the larger area brought under cultivation, and the good seasons experienced. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Maxwell</inline> goes on to say : - </para>

                    </continue>
                    <para>It is seen that very notable increases have been made in the total number of white growers, and in the gross areas registered to earn the bonus. </para>
                    <para class="block">I have not given the areas, but they are as follows: - In 1902, the number of acres cultivated by white growers was 36,538 ; in 1903, 53,571 acres; in 1904, 63,277 acres; and in 1905, 72,606 acres. So that there has been a gradual and steady increase, first of all in the number of white growers, and secondly, in the area of land they have cultivated. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Maxwell</inline> goes on to say - </para>
                    <para class="block">The full results of the operations of1905 are not yet to hand, but the figures given under this year in the table indicate that these increases are steadily progressing. The table shows further that the increases in the number of white growers and of registered areas have transpired mainly in the Southern and Central Districts, and that a small relative progress has been made in the tropical north. </para>
                    <para class="block">It is but natural that the number of white growers should increase in the colder districts rather than in the tropical districts of the north. The report continues - &#34;The total number of all cane growers in Queensland at the beginning of this year was 3,422. The number of white growers according to the latest official figures is 2,681, or 78 per cent. of, the whole. </para>
                    <para class="block">When the figures are analyzed it will be seen that, although 78 per cent. of the total number of growers are white growers those who cultivate with black labour are those who own the larger plantations and cultivate the larger areas. That accounts for the fact that the total output of sugar grown by black labour is greater than that grown by white labour. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Maxwell</inline> says further - </para>
                    <para>The increases in the number of white growers, and in registered areas, do not necessarily convey a correct indication of the actual progress that white cane production has made, relative to the whole. At the close of the third year of the current period of the bonus operation the crop of 1904 comprised as follows : - </para>

                        </item>
                    </list>
                    <para class="block">So that, although 78 per cent. of the total number of growers cultivate sugar with white labour, they produce only about one-half of the quantity produced by black labour. The report continues : - </para>
                    <para>These figures show that, at the end of the third year&#39;s operations of the bonus legislation, less than one-third of the sugar production of Queensland was eligible for the bonus. Something more than two-thirds of the whole was black grown. The figures covering the crop of 1905 will not be fully available for some three months, lt is estimated, however, that the proportion of current year&#39;s crop that is earning the bonus will be at least one-third, and may amount to, or exceed, 35 per cent. of the whole. </para>
                    <para>The actual situation is, therefore, that after four years operation of the bonus, approximately one-third of the sugar crop of Queensland is produced by white labour. In connexion with this summary result, it has to be repeated that the progress has taken place almost wholly within the Southern and Central Districts, which are the districts of densest settlement, and of the more temperate climatic conditions. The figure in Table &#34; A &#34; shows that in the first year of operation of the bonus,1,485 growers were registered in these districts, and only thirty -six in the districts of the north. These numbers show that more than one-half of the total number of white growers registered at this date were prepared for and actually entered upon production solely by white labour the moment that the legislation was enacted. These early registrations included farmers upon the smallest areas. </para>

The honorable senator will be able to discuss all these matters in debating the second reading of the Bill. I have no desire to lead honorable senators to believe that by consenting to continue the bonus for another period of live years, we shall put an end to the trouble. </para>

Those concerned in the industry must pass through an exceedingly trying time when the deportation of the kanakas commences, as it will do next year. In the circumstances, unless we give them encouragement, and pass a measure under which the bonus will be continued to them, there is great danger that large areas of country will go out of cultivation by sugar, because those now engaged in the industry will not know whether they will be able to carry on at a profit. I repeat that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Maxwell</inline> says that an extension of the bonus for a period of seven years can claim the greatest measure of support, and that on the maturing of such further period, the situation will again come under consideration.

                            <para>- So far as we are concerned, it will end at the close of the five years&#39; period provided for in this Bill, and it will then be for Parliament to say what should be done in the circumstances. We are doing now what was done four years ago. We are proposing the passing of a Bill to continue the system of bonuses for a period of five years, and we leave it to Parliament then to again review the situation. In five years&#39; time Parliament will be in precisely the same situation, and must again review the whole matter. The question for Parliament to consider now is whether the bonus should cease at the end of the term already provided for, and we should run the risk of inflicting enormous injury upon one of the chief industries of Queensland. It must be &#39;borne in mind that people who have been cultivating sugar in Queensland for many years past with black labour are being compelled to give up that labour. They must be given time to prepare for the altered conditions under which the industry is to be carried on, if it is to be continued, and what honorable senators are now asked to consider is whether, in the circumstances, it is proper to continue the bonus, at all events for another five, years. We must do it. We cannot get away from it, unless we are prepared to destroy the industry. I am a believer in the White Australia policy, the majority of the community believe in it, and surely we are not going to say that the State of Queensland shall suffer immense loss in consequence of the action we have taken in compelling the deportation of kanakas ? </para>

                    <para>SenatorPLAYFORD. - The sugar planters are aware that the Queensland Parliament passed a law providing for the deportation of the kanakas many years ago, but when they were brought face to face with the question, they were afraid to give effect to the law. They found that they could not do so without the risk of fearful loss, and the result was that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith, and others, who had been instrumental in passing a law to provide that the kanakas should go at a certain date, turned round and passed another law to say that they should not go. That was the position when Queensland became a part of the Commonwealth. I have given honorable senators <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Maxwell&#39;s</inline> answer to the question as to the period for which it appears necessary to extend the system of paying a bonus on white grown cane. The second question was - </para>
                    <para>Should the bonus continue to be paid in its present amount, or are there reasons for a revision ? </para>
                    <para class="block">That was a very intelligent question, to which the expert furnished the following answer : - </para>
                    <para>The purpose of the bonus is to substitute white for coloured labour, making it thus, in the first place, a matter of cost. In a report furnished by me to the first Federal Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton, in1901, it was shown that the relative costs of labour were : - </para>

                        <graphic href="030332190512153_28_0.jpg" />
                    </para>
                    <para>The present schedule of bonus was based upon the cost of labour, and upon other considerations, existing when the legislation was enacted. With the progress of white production, white labour must continue to command a higher compensation in the form of wage, and of better domestic provision for workmen. The existing measure of bonus must, therefore, tend to fall below, and not to exceed the cost of substituting white for coloured labour. It is the possibility of failure of the present measure of bonus to meet the difference in cost between coloured and white labour which is, in part, confirming the larger employers of wage-earning labour in holding to the use of aliens. </para>
                    <para>This question can be understood as also relating to the relation between the excise and bonus, the arrangement enacted being that the bonus shall not exceed two-thirds of the excise. If the results of each year are considered separately, it will be found that in some years the bonus is less, and in others more, than two-thirds of the excise. In the average of years it is indicated that the mean of the bonus paid in the several districts will be almost exactly two-thirds, or a fraction less. </para>

                    </para>
                    <para>Should a reducing scale be adopted with a view to the gradual diminution and extinction of the bonus? </para>
                    <para>Inreply, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Maxwell</inline> wrote - </para>
                    <para>To propose a reducing scale at this time would be to assume that this great experiment of substituting a white labour power for a coloured labour power, in a tropical industry, that is in its course of trial, were approaching maturity; that its purpose is already successfully established, and that it is at once time to begin the removal of the machinery by which it is being conducted. The experiment has made a very notable progress; the results set forth under Question No.1 show, however, that the present measure of accomplishment covers only one-third of its purpose. There are still two-thirds of the total sugar crop of Queensland being produced by a coloured alien labour power. </para>
                    <para>The measure of achievement has not yet been reached that would render the adoption of a &#34; reducing scale &#34; applicable to the situation at this time. To enforce its adoption prematurely can undo the present success, and threaten the future promise that waits upon the experiment. </para>
                    <para class="block">I may inform honorable senators, as no doubt they already know, that in another place it was moved that there should be a sliding scale, to commence at a certain rate, and to gradually taper off until it terminated at a given time. The proposal was, of course, defeated, because the Government took the view of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Maxwell</inline> as one which they could safely follow. </para>

Of course, they cannot regulate the price wholly, because if it were made too high black-grown sugar would come in from Fiji and other countries, and compete with their article. Within tha* limit, however, the company can raise the price at their own sweet will and pleasure. The seventh question reads - </para>

                        <para>It is required that the fundamental regulation governing the eligibility of land to register to earn bounty shall be modified and broadened. It is necessary that areas that have not been yet brought under white conditions shall not be at any time prevented from doing so by restrictive regulations. It is also to be advised that provision shall be made for the re-registration of areas which were placed under white conditions, but which have lapsed, and become again ineligible for earning bonus. These primary registrations were made in good faith, and the lapses have been due, in the most part, to the unripeness of the conditions necessary to the change from black to white production. Unless such modifications in the administration are made, the progress of the bonus legislation will be blocked by its own provisions. </para>

                        <para>I have bad prepared in the form of a table an estimate of the quantity of white grown sugar that will be produced from 1907 onwards. The estimate is based upon an excise duty of &#163;4 per ton, and upon a bounty of&#163;3 per ton. From 1907, until 1911, it is estimated that the annual consumption of sugar within the Commonwealth will be approximately 200,000 tons. This will represent, by way of excise, a sum of &#163;800,000 per annum. The estimated production of white grown sugar in 1907 is set down at 107,000 tons; in 1908, at 122,500 tons; in 1909, at 138,000 tons; in 1910, at 153,500 tons; and, in 1911, at 169,000 tons. </para>

                            <para>- I cannot say now, but I shall be. able to give the information when we get into Committee. Honorable senators will, of course, understand that I have had so many Bills to master within the past few days that I have not been able to obtain full details concerning them all. But by the time we get into Committee, I hope to have obtained all the information that can be desired. As to the Bill itself, it provides for the extension of the bounty from 1906 to 1 91 1. The amount of the bounty is to be altered, so that instead of&#163;2 being repaid to those who grow sugar by white labour, we shall give them &#163;3 ; and, instead of the excise being &#163;3 per ton, it will be &#163;4. There is nothing more in the Bill, except machinery provisions to give effect to what I have outlined. </para>

                        <para>- I should like to make a suggestion to the Minister, and to, the Senate. Those honorable senators who have studied the Bill will recognise that there is really only one point to discuss. That being so, it will be quite competent to take the debate in Committee. The Minister has told us that he has not available the figures which it will be recognised are essential to a proper understanding of the subject. As he has promised to obtain all the necessary information, I suggest that we should allow the Bill to go into Committeepro <inline font-style="italic">forma,</inline> and discuss the important features of it on Monday. </para>

                    <para>- I do not &#34;desire to delay the Senate, but I urge upon honorable senators the necessity for remaining at their posts until Parliament actually goes into recess. I understand that there is a movement on the boards to try to substitute Lake George for Dalgety in the Act of Parliament fixing the Capital site. If honorable senators stay away, it is very likely that that movement may succeed. I urge them to post themselves up in the reports of the Commissioners on the various sites, in view of the suggested substitution of Lake George for Dalgety in the Bill which is coming from another place. </para>

                        <para>- If honorable senators are satisfied that Lake George is the site that ought to be selected in preference to Dalgety, by all means let them vote, for it. But Knowing that this movement was on foot, I looked up the Commissioners&#39; reports, and found that though, when Lake George is full of water, it presents a very beautiful aspect, it is only full occasionally, and sometimes it is absolutely dry. 1 ask honorable senators whether they are going to vote for building a Federal Capital which is to last for all time, on the borders of a stagnant sheet of water, which will give rise to all kinds of diseases, including typhoid. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has asked me what has been done in regard to the- promise I made relating to public servants who are hot allowed, in certain cases, to take positions on municipal bodies, and so forth. T may inform the honorable senator that the matter has not been lost sight of. It has been brought under the notice of the Government, and submitted to the Minister of Home Affairs, who will call attention to it in Cabinet at an early date. The record of. the attendance of honorable senators is always printed, but I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> that it would be far more interesting and useful if a printed list showing the attendance at divisions were issued. Under the present method, an honorable senator may attend for only a few minutes, and yet he is recorded as having remained for the entire sitting. This affords no real criterion as to the amount of attention any honorable senator may give to his parliamentary duties; and a return of the attendance at divisions would afford more information. </para>
