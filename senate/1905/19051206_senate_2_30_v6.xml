I have no wish to take advantage of honorable senators, but, in case Order of the Day No. 1 were disposed of very hurriedly - which I do not anticipate - I could then submit a motion in connexion with this message, and, if necessary, the debate could be postponed. </para>

                    <para>- I hope that the Senate will not agree to the motion. There is any quantity of business on the notice-paper to engage our attention to-day. For instance, it includes a motion for the ratification of the agreement with the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company, a motion to adopt a report of the Standing Orders Committee, and a motion relative to the cable services. In my opinion, the consideration of these items cannot be concluded at this sitting. </para>

With our Standing Orders as I read them, taken in conjunction with the report of the Standing Orders Committee, I confess that I do not quite see where the Government gain the power. We had a standing order, No. 234, which, on the 30th August was replaced by others, under which it is clearly necessary, before a Bill comes back to the Senate, that it shall have been proceeded with in the other House by request, . and I do not believe that any such resolution has been passed in respect of the Trade Marks Bill. I suppose that the other House relied upon the report of the Standing Orders Committee, which begins as follows : - </para>

                        <para>- It was manifest that the Standing Orders of both Houses concerning lapsed Bills were deficient. Each House referred the question to its Standing Orders Committee. The two Committees met as a joint Committee, and agreed that the Standing Orders did not sufficiently carry out the wish of both Houses. It was then determined that new standing orders should be made, which it was hoped would be sufficient. But there was a class of Bill which had been treated - at all events in the other House, a Bill had been treated - as a lapsed Bill, under the standing order which it was proposed to repeal, and, in order to meet that case, the Senate resolved on the recommendation of the Standing Orders Committee, that any action already taken in either House respecting a lapsed Bill should be given full effect to by each House up to the final determination of the issue raised therein. That I take it, is an agreement between the Houses. This resolution was passed by them in order to meet the class of cases referred to. Although it cannot be said that the Trade Marks Bill can be treated as a lapsed Bill under the new standing orders, it was exempted from them, and a specific course in respect of it was agreed to by both Houses. Therefore I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> is in order in moving the motion, and that at would be a breach of faith with the other House if we did not treat the Trade Marks Bill as a lapsed Bill. </para>

                        <para>- We have adopted the report and I think that we ought to adhere to it and keep good faith with the other House. Besides, what is a standing, order but a resolution of the Senate? It can alter a standing order by a new resolution.. Therefore, I think that the Senate meant, when it passed the resolution in August, that this Bill, or any Bill of a similar nature, should be treated as a lapsed Bill. </para>

Whether we were right or wrong in doing so, the honorable senator must see that, if he persists with his intention to move to disagree with my ruling, he will place the Senate and himself in an absurd position, seeing that we have already dealt with a Bill this session in a manner similar to that now proposed. </para>

In the meanwhile <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor,</inline> who was Vice-President of the Executive Council, had assumed the position of a Judge of the High Court, and I was appointed to fill his place. The discussion on the motion at that time turned on one point. A Conference in connexion with the Pacific Cable Board was proposed to be held in London at some subsequent date, and the feeling amongst honorable senators was that we should not ratify this agreement until the Conference had met, had discussed the question, and had made any recommendations which it might deem to be necessary.

                        <para>- I shall not go into unnecessary detail, but I shall refer to the history of the matter sufficiently fully to enable honorable senators to thoroughly understand the whole position. When <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> proposal to lay the Pacific Cable was under discussion, the Eastern Extension Company had what might be called a monopoly of the cable communication between Australia and the rest of the civilized world, and they thought that by making a proposal to construct an All-Red line, from Cornwall to the Island of Ascension, thence to St. Helena, to the Cape, thence by a land line to Durban, from there to Keeling Island, and eventually to the shores of Australia near Fremantle, and continuing by a cable round the coast as far as Adelaide, they might make a satisfactory agreement with the Australian Colonies. They dealt at first with three of the Australian Colonies only, and proposed to enter into an agreement with them. They proposed to reduce the cost of messages to South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania. In the case of Western Australia and South Australia., they proposed to reduce, the cost of ordinary messages from 4s. od. to 4s. per word - a reduction of od. per word - - of Government messages from 3s. 6d. to . 3s. per word - a- reduction of 6d. - and of press messages from is. od. to is. 4d. per word. In the case of Tasmania they proposed a reduction on ordinary messages of from 5s. 5d. to 4s. per word, on Government messages from 4s. 2d. to 3s., and on press messages from 2s. 5d. to is. 5d. The agreement was made on 14th ApriL 1900, that is, -before the Pacific Cable was laid. It was not laid until 8th December, 1902, or practically the commencement of 1903. The other line, the route of which I have described, was laid on the 1st November, 1901. The agreement entered into between South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania and the Eastern Extension Company is contained in a number of articles. Article No. 1 provides for a reduction in charges. Article 12 relates to the laying of lines. Article 14 provides that the South Australian and Western Australian Governments shall provide suitable places for stations at Glenelg, Adelaide, Fremantle, and Perth, and that such rights and faculties as may be reasonably required must be provided. Under article 15, South Australia was to provide for the use of the company a special wire between Adelaide and the Victorian frontier, and another wire between Adelaide and the New South Wales frontier. These wires have been constructed, and there are connecting wires between the South Australian frontier and Melbourne, and between the New South Wales frontier and Sydney. Article 16 provides that the company shall, on and after the opening for traffic of the Pacific Cable, be entitled to open local offices, and collect direct from, and d&#39;eliver direct to, the public, messages in Perth, Adelaide, and Hobart forming part of the Australian traffic. Article 17 provides that the senders of messages shall say whether their cablegrams are to go by way of the Cape route to England or by the Port Darwin route. Article 21 provides that the agreement shall remain in force until rescinded, by mutual consent, in writing. This is the most important part of the agreement between South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania and the Eastern Extension Company. I may say, in passing, that another agreement was subsequently entered into between the company and New South Wales, to which I will allude in a few minutes. The words &#34; shall remain in force until rescinded by mutual consent expressed in writing &#34; practically made it an interminable agreement. I suppose we should have some power of breaking the agreement by paying suitable compensation to the company, but I do not think we could break it unless we paid compensation for any loss which the company might consider that it had sustained in consequence of its being broken. It is a most singular agreement, inasmuch as it contained no mention of the specific terms under which it might be abrogated; it must be&#39; by mutual consent, and must be in writing. The Commonwealth stands in the place of the three States that I have mentioned in respect of the agreement. We are bound by it as though each of the separate States was still a party to it. </para>

                        <para>- In one sense yes, but in another sense no. This agreement having been made between the company and South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania, negotiations were at the same time proceeding with New South Wales and with Victoria. Victoria absolutely declined to become a party to it, but New South Wales did not. She entered into the agreement after Federation was. accomplished, but before the Post and Telegraph Department had been taken over by the Commonwealth. Our Constitution provided that directly the Commonwealth was proclaimed certain Departments should be taken over. For instance, Customs and Excise were taken over at once. But other Departments might be taken over bv proclamation. The Commonwealth had been established some little time when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Crick,</inline> who acted on behalf of the New South Wales Government at the time, entered into an agreement with the Eastern Extension Company in behalf of that State. I am informed - I do not pretend to know - that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Crick</inline> was clearly within his rights in acting as he did in behalf of New South Wales, because the State Government was then administering the Department. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know that I can absolutely fix that opinion upon any one in particular, but I have heard it so stated by more than one person. Indeed, I think there can be no doubt about it. The Department at that time had not been taken over by the Commonwealth. It was being administered by the New South Wales Government. Therefore, New South Wales had a perfect right to enter into any agreement it chose. I do not think that can be controverted. The point was brought up when this subject was under discussion in 1903, and the opinion which I then formed was that, no matter whether the contract which New South Wales made was a wise one or not, the Government of that State had a perfect right to enter into it. The agreement with New South Wales was to take effect from the 1st January, 1901. The agreement between the company and the other three States mentioned was made on the 14th April, 1900. The agreement with New South Wales contained all the articles which were in the agreement made with South Aus/tralia. Western Australia, and Tasmania, except parts 5, 9, 12, 17, and 21. Article 1 provides for a reduction of charges. Article 14 provides that New South Wales is to maintain a special wire for the use of the company between Sydney and the South Australian frontier. That has. been done. The article with reference to the reduction in. charges on cablegrams between New South Wales and Europe was to take effect on and from the 1st January, 1901. I may add that, although the Eastern Extension Company had entered into an agreement to reduce its charges from 4s. 9d. to 4s. a word, in- accordance with its. contract with South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania, it had actually in the meanwhile reduced its rates from 4s. to 3s. 6d. per word for ordinary messages, and from 3s. to 2s. 6d. for Government messages. New South Wales at that time was paying 4s. nd. per word for ordinary messages. The company reduced that rate to 3s.. 6d. The rate paid on Government messages in New South Wales had been 3s. 8d. Under the agreement it was reduced to 2s. 6d. Press messages had been paying is, iod. That rate was reduced to is. 4d. </para>

                        <para>- I am not sure that the company was compelled to make the further reductions mentioned, but it was done probably with an object. That object was, 1 believe, from the very start unmistakably a business one. The company wanted - naturally from its point of view - to kill the Pacific Cable if it could*. Another reduction was made immediately afterwards - in June, 1902. The rates were then further reduced to 3s. for ordinary messages, as compared with 3s. 6d. ; to 2s, for Government messages, as against 2s. 6d. ; and to is. for press messages, as against is. 4d. The company also reduced the rate for messages from these States to the British Government to is. 7 Jd. per word. When these reductions were made as affecting New South Wales, Western Australia, South Australia, and Tasmania; Queensland and Victoria were still paying - Victoria, 4s. iod. a word for ordinary, messages, 3s. ?d. for Government messages, and is. iod. for press messages ; Queensland, 5s. jd. for ordinary messages, 3s. iod1. for Government messages, and is. 1 id. for press messages. Honorable senators can well imagine that the people of Victoria did not like this state of things. Victorian merchants did not like to see New South Wales merchants paying 3s. per word for their messages whilst they themselves1 were paying 4s. iod. They, therefore, made representations to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton, who was then at the head of the Commonwealth Government, that something ought to be done. He looked into the matter very closely, and, after considering the terms of the agreement, and the fact that it was interminable, he came to the conclusion that it would be a good deal better if the Government entered into an arrangement at once for a fresh agreement for a limited period of years, at the end of which time it could be terminated without any further trouble. He made a proposal to that effect to the company which was agreed to. An agreement was drawn up which contained exactly the same articles as are contained in the New South&#39; Wales,, and the South Australian, Western Australian, and Tasmanian agreements, with the exception that it terminates at a certain time, and that it gives the same privileges to Victoria and Queensland as the other States had secured under their agreements with the Eastern Extension Company. </para>

                        <para>- We are close to the end of a calendar year now, and we can easily arrange that matter. I have given honorable senators a brief history of the events which have led up to the. present position. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton considered that iti would be a great deal better to have an agreement, made by all the States, terminable in a given time, than an interminable contract, in which only four of the States were involved, and which could not be upset, unless, possibly, at considerable expense. We now come to the Conference, &#38; report of which was laid upon the table of the Senate on the 13th September of this year. There are really only two points which we need take into consideration. One of these points is contained in paragraph 6, as follows : - </para>

                        of 1st June, 1903, that &#34; by reducing the term of the agreement to a reasonable period, the Commonwealth has obtained for the Pacific Cable a very great advantage, which cannot fail to be of immense and increasing value.&#34; But we feel that this advantage is not definitely secured so long as any doubt remains whether the agreement will or will not be actually terminated after it has been in operation for ten years. We, therefore, earnestly trust that the Commonwealth Parliament will not ratify the agreement unless clause 25 is amended so as to read &#34; This agreement shall remain in force until the 31st day of October, 1913, and no longer.&#34;

                <quote>
                    <para>We are advised that the recital in the preamble of the Commonwealth Agreement, that it is desirable to substitute one agreement for certain other agreements, including the New South Wales agreement, and the similar agreement with South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania, cannot safely be relied upon to prevent the revival of those agreements on the termination of the Commonwealth Agreement. We therefore think that an express provision excluding such revival should have been inserted in the Commonwealth Agreement ; and we trust that such a provision will be inserted before the agreement is ratified. </para>

As to whether the termination of this agreement in 1915 will revive the agreement between the Eastern Extension Company and the States of South Australia, Western Australia, Tasmania, and New South Wales, I have the opinion of the Attorney-General, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Isaacs,</inline> who as plainly as possible states that there is not the slightest ground for any supposition of the kind.

                        <para>- I have looked up the terms of the agreement, and there appears to me to be no doubt that the Attorney-General, to whom, of course, we have to trust in matters of this kind, is quite right. It was for these reasons that the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company were never asked to include these points in the new agreement. In the first place, we were quite sure that the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company would not agree to that course, and, in the second place, we did not think there was any necessity to make the request. This agreement was passed by the other House without a division, and, practically, without any objection. </para>

                        <para>- Since then however, the Government have received some information. In consequence of the two companies working here, both are put to considerable expense, which would not be caused if the receipts were pooled. The Eastern Extension Telegraph Company have to keep open offices, with a staff for the purpose of collecting and despatching telegrams. </para>

I know that the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company have a wire, but whether it is that particular wire or not, I cannot say. A wire was provided which suits the purposes of the company as between the two places. </para>

                        <para>- What we know is that the company have had a wire for a considerable length of time, and that until this provisional agreement was entered into the Melbourne people were paying considerably higher rates for their telegrams. When the tentative agreement was entered into by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton, effect was given to it immediately ; and I think the Senate know of the fact. The Senate also knew that the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company had special offices and special consideration given to them, and certainly that they had a special telegraph line, which they were using by means&#39; of their own operators. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know the date, but I believe that it was made very recently. The Eastern Extension Telegraph Company said they would not entertain the proposal except for a period of thirty years, or more, and then only on the distinct understanding that at the end of the term all the State agreements into which they had entered - the agreements made with South Australia, Western Australia, Tasmania, and New South Wales - should be revived. </para>

                        <para>- I do not believe that they care whether we ratify the agreement or not. &#39; In my opinion, it will be more advantageous to us than, to them if we do. I believe they have perceived that there was. no necessity for them to enter so hurriedly into the agreement. They imagined that they would meet with a great deal more competition from the Pacific Cable than they get. We do not want to approach the company and ask them for a variation ; we wish the agreement to be carried out exactly as it was approved by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton, and confirmed by the other House. Why do we not wish to vary the agreement? Because we are anxious not to have an interminable agreement. Suppose that the Senate did not pass the motion, and that the arrangement fell through, in what position would the Commonwealth be left? Victoria would be released to a certain extent. We could prevent the company from having a special wire between Melbourne and Adelaide, and between Melbourne and Sydney, but we could not prevent them from sending telegrams through the Department. Nor could we stop them from canvassing for telegrams. They are a great deal more up to date than are the Pacific Cable Board, I am sorry to say. The latter do not act on business lines. If a merchant sends a number of telegrams to Europe or England, the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company will open an account for him, and he can pay monthly ; but if he wishes to send a cablegram by the Pacific Cable, he has to pay cash every time he wires,. </para>

                        <para>- I contend that if we ratify the contract, we shall be in a better position, not to-day, but in the future. So great is the advantage which the agreement offers that, after looking into the whole matter very closely, I have every confidence in asking the Senate to ratify it. : <inline font-weight="bold">Senator STANIFORTH</inline> SMITH (Western Australia). - We must all admit that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> has put the case as strongly as it is possible to put it on behalf of those who advocate the ratification of .this agreement. He has been on a Conference with regard to the Pacific Cable, and has studied this matter for a great many years, and therefore, advocating warmly as he does, the ratification of the contract, he is enabled to put the case as strongly as it can possibly be submitted. We, in endeavouring to answer his arguments, have not the advantage of the official information which is possessed in the Department, and therefore we are not able, perhaps, to refute as fully as could otherwise be done, the various statements which he has made. I think that ever since the Pacific Cable was laid down,, the attitude of the Commonwealth towards this great British enterprise has been unsympathetic and unfederal. We, as the largest partner in the undertaking - owning, as we do, one-third interest - are much to blame for the apathy we have shown. A previous Government came to an agreement with the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company, which vitally affected the Pacific Cable Company, and against the unanimous representations of every one of our partners, as well as the Secretary of State for the Colonies, they endeavoured to force the agreement through each House of this Parliament. The Senate, rightly, I think, refused to ratify the agreement until an expression of opinion had been obtained from our partners in this joint enterprise. A Conference has been held, and its report contains certain recommendations. It is proposed now by the Government to practically defy our partners, to disregard their decision, and to ratify the old agreement just as if no Conference had been Held. What was the good of our going to the expense of holding a Conference if the Government were determined to ratify the old agreement, no matter -what decision might be come to by our partners ? If we are not going to carry out our Empire obligations - and this certainly is a most important one - not only shall we destroy the usefulness of this Pacific Cable, and &#39;make it a financial incubus on the partnership, but. it would probably result in this being the first and last enterprise which would be undertaken jointly by the various people of the Empire. So far, we have been actually assisting the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company to defeat our nation-owned Pacific Cable, and that fact is, I think, mentioned very clearly in the report of the Pacific Cable&#39; Conference. </para>

                    <para>- I shall come to that point immediately. We gave to the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company a special line between Melbourne and Adelaide, which there was no occasion to do, and which I think we had no right to db, and by an Executive act the Ministry allowed them to open two offices in Melbourne, in face of the fact that the Commonwealth Parliament had refused to ratify the agreement. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> has just said that the Government have not refused to give the Pacific Cable Company similar advantages. Seeing that the various telegraph offices are receiving depots for the Pacific Cable Company, it was quite competent for the Government to give them a special wire from Melbourne, to Sydney, and from Sydney to Southport, to be reserved for cables sent over the Pacific route. But that has not been done. </para>

                        <para>--By our action we have practically injured the Pacific Cable Company, and given gratuitous advantages to the other company, which they had no right to demand, and which, I venture to think, if we had been loyally carrying out our partnership arrangement, we had no right to give. If we take an impartial review of the whole situation, we are forced to conclude that, even under the disadvantages to which I have referred, the Pacific Cable has proved a great boon to Australia, and has more than justified its construction. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> has admitted, for the first time, to-day, the reduction we have had in cable rates is solely due to the construction of the Pacific Cable. It is interesting to remember that before the Colonial Conference of 1887 sat, but after the invitations were sent out by the Secretary of State for the </para>

Last year, 2,403,112 words of ordinary messages were sent by cable from Australia. The difference in the cost of sending those words as represented by the difference between 9s. 4d. and 3s. per word is equivalent to .&#163;750,000 per annum. </para>

Last year, Government messages representing 107,527 words, and press messages representing 274,851 words, were also sent, and in connexion with them a very large saving was made. So that we can say, and be well within, the mark, that the Pacific Cable enterprise has saved to the people of Australia not less, than &#163;800,000 per annum. </para>

                <para class="block">That means that we are richer every year by that amount, and that so much less wealth annually leaves Australia as the result of the reductions in cable charges due to the construction of the Pacific Cable. Another very important benefit conferred by the Pacific Cable is that it has given us direct communication with the great English-speaking continent of North America, and with the British community in South Africa. I say this because it is admitted that the Eastern Extension Company built their line to South Africa to forestall the construction of the Pacific Cable. We are, therefore, in this, position - that as a result of the construction of the Pacific Cable we have secured a saving of , &#163;800,000 a year to the people of Australia, and direct telegraphic communication with every continent in the world, with the exception of South America. </para>

                        <para>- It will be admitted that these are immense advantages to the Commonwealth. I have gone into the question of the advantage derived by the Commonwealth from the construction of the Pacific Cable, because of the constant press misrepresentation to the effect that the Eastern Extension Company voluntarily reduced the cable rates, irrespective of the Pacific Cable. Now what do these immense advantages cost the Commonwealth ? </para>

                    SMITH.Our share of the annual cost of the Pacific Cable. I point out that so far as we are concerned, this is only apparently the cost to us of the Pacific Cable, because really it has not cost us one penny. Until we decided to lay the Pacific Cable, we were forced by the Eastern Extension Company to pay them heavy subsidies, greater than we have ever had to pay for the Pacific Cable. From 1879, when the Eastern Extension Company laid their cable from Banjoewangie to Broome, in Western Australia, up to 1891, Victoria and New
                </para>
                <para class="block">South Wales paid in subsidies to the Eastern Extension Company &#163;34,000 a year. From 1891 to 1899, the six States continued the subsidy. So that for twenty, years Australia has paid , &#163;34,000 a year to the Eastern Extension Company, or a total of &#163;680,000. Further, when the company reduced the cable rate to 4s. per word, we guaranteed them against loss, and had to pay &#163;35,489 under that guarantee. It will, therefore, be seen that the payment which we at present make towards the cost of the Pacific Cable is merely a transfer of a subsidy, though at a reduced amount, from one company to another, whilst by this means we are building up a valuable asset for the Commonwealth, whereas the subsidy which we previously paid passed into the coffers of the Eastern Extension Company. </para>

                    . is not bound to remain to listen to me. I have shown that the Pacific Cable, instead of increasing the burdens of the Commonwealth, has considerably reduced them, since we have effected a considerable saving in expenditure as the result of its construction. I wish now to go a step further and to show that we participate largely in. the revenue of the Pacific Cable Company, as none of the other partners in the company do. We charge terminal rates, whereas New Zealand, Canada, and Great Britain charge no terminal rates, and only the ordinary telegraphic rates on internal messages.

                        <para>- The Board may not be right in everything. The Board is not unanimous on the point to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> refers. The fact; remains that we do charge terminal rates, and so actually participate in the revenue received from the cable, whereas the other partners in the company do not. For even&#39; ordinary word sent by the Pacific Cable at the rate of 3s. per word, the Pacific Cable Board takes 2s. 7d., and the Commonwealth takes 5d. On Government messages, the Commonwealth takes 4d., and on press messages 2d. per word. This is not done by any of our partners, and if these terminal charges which we make are calculated, it will be found that we participate in the revenue derived from the Pacific Cable to the extent of something like &#163;18,000 a year, which must be set against the payment we have to make of &#163;25,000 a year towards the cost. Now, I propose to compare the Eastern Extension Company&#39;s Cable with&#39; the Pacific Cable. The working expenses of the Eastern Extension Company are equal to three times, the working expenses of the Pacific Cable Company, because they have three lines, three sets of stations, and officers, and a number of canvassers, whom we do not employ. </para>

Of course, I am not dealing with the Cis- Indian and China traffic of the Eastern Extension Company.

                        <para>- On the whole of the business of the cable. That profit goes towards meeting interest and the very large sinking fund to which we are at present paying. Further, it must be remembered that two of the Eastern Extension Company&#39;s cables cross a volcanic belt, which necessitates constant repairs, and those cables are old, whereas the Pacific Cable is new. We have a line that fulfils our requirements. It is laid in deep water, it&#39; passes over no volcanic belt, and is, therefore, not liable to breakages ; and I do not think there has been a single breakage in the cable since it was laid down. It is also the speediest line of communication between Australia&#39; and the old world. It is interesting to note that whenever it is necessary to transmit from Australia any specially urgent message, it is sent by the Pacific Cable. The results of the cricket test matches are always sent over the Pacific Cable, because it is faster. The result of the last test match played in Sydney was cabled from the Cricket Ground to England, even without any special clearing of the line, in three and a half minutes. That was a world&#39;s record for cabling, under ordinary conditions. Of course, on occasions when the lines have been specially cleared right through, messages have been sent in less time. I wish honorable senators to recognise that if we adopt this agreement we shall be absolutely bound and gagged by the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company for the next ten- years. We shall be hampered under an agreement, the terms of which are the most indefinite and badly-worded I have ever read. It is drawn in such a manner that I believe it must lead to an immense amount of litigation if we agree to it. We have the statement of the Attorney-General that at the end of ten years the offices opened in the various States could not be revived. But according to the report of the Pacific Cable Conference, there is very grave doubt about that matter. Without any disparagement of our own Attorney-General </para>

                        <para>- We actually put the company in a better position in this respect than the sovereign States of the Commonwealth. Even at the end of the time, there is some doubt as to whether the agreement would not be revived. If there had not been a doubt in the minds of the Government, the opinion of the Attorney-General would not have been obtained. The Government would not adopt the recommendations of the Conference, and yet it asks us to accept an agreement drawn up by the company. It allows the Eastern Extension Company practically to squeeze the Pacific Cable to death for ten years, when there may be costly litigation, with an appeal to the Privy Council, which will be enormously expensive. If there is any doubt about the matter, why not adopt the proposal of the Conference, and say that the company shall enjoy its privileges for ten years and no longer? A great deal has been made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> of the point that if we do not adopt this agreement the company will for all time have offices in four States. Even if that be so, the company would have no rights and privileges that the Commonwealth has not got at the present moment, if it chose to exercise them. </para>

                        <para>- On the other hand, the Pacific Cable has certain rights and privileges which the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company will not have if we refuse to ratify this agreement. We have the power to close the company&#39;s offices in Melbourne, and to prevent it from opening an office in Queensland. The Pacific Cable Board can open offices in every State,, whilst the Eastern Extension Company can have offices in only four. Then again, the Pacific Cable can adopt some of the methods of the Eastern Extension Company by employing canvassers. In New Zealand canvassers have been employed, with the result that three times the number of messages are sent over the Pacific Cable as are sent over the Eastern Extension Company&#39;s cable. Let me point out what privileges are offered to clients who send their messages <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> the Eastern Extension Company which are not afforded to those who send by the Pacific Cable : (1) All messages to Europe, except Great Britain, are sent by the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company from 6d. to is. 6d. per word cheaper than by the Pacific Cable. Surely that is a matter which ought to be rectified at once. (2) A promise under the proposed agreement that if the company&#39;s traffic shows a certain increase, a reduction to 2!s. 6d. per word for ordinary messages will be made. This offers an inducement to people to patronize the Eastern. Extension Company, in order to get a cheaper rate. (3) They have been allowed special lines from Sydney and Melbourne to its cable station in South Australia, under the control and management of its own officers, who are specially selected men. Cables <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> the Pacific have to be sent over the ordinary Government lines, which are clogged by State and Inter-State traffic. (4) The Eastern Extension Company will take cheques from reputable firms, and, in many cases, allow a monthly account, neither of which privileges is allowed to those using the Pacific Cable. The advantage of these privileges, especially after banking hours, is manifest. (5) The Eastern Extension Company has practically exclusive rights in Tasmania for the next four years, as it has an absolute monopoly of the cable between Tasmania and the mainland. (6) It&#39;s offices are more central, and employs a number of canvassers, (7) The company&#39;s cable forms are free, and are left at all leading hotels, stock exchanges, &#38;c, marked <inline font-style="italic">&#34;Via</inline> Eastern.;&#34; while the Commonwealth charges 4d. per 100 for Pacific forms, and they must be obtained from the post-offices. (8) All repetitions of mutilated words, whether the fault&#34; of the sender or of the company, are obtained without charge. By the Pacific route, a cash deposit&#39; has to be lodged in any case, and if the word repeated comes back the s,ame, the cost has to be paid by &#34;the recipient. (9) The Eastern Extension Company would! telephone messages received after office hours to the receiver&#39;s private residence. If will also receive short messages by &#34;telephone, in order to save time; or it will send one of its own messengers round for the cable. The Government offices refuse to do any of these things. (10) The company will code messages for the senders in any public code, which the Government offices refuse to do. (11) The company allows a person to register as many indicators as he likes, whereas the Commonwealth makes a charge of, I think, 10s. for each indicator in respect of cables <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> the Pacific line. Under these circumstances, it does seem to me to be a remarkable thing that while we have given no assistance whatever to the Pacific Cable - while we have practically said that we will not put ourselves out of the way to induce the public to send messages by the Pacific route, and have placed facilities in the hands of our rivals that we have withheld from our own company - nevertheless, we have sent half as many messages from Australia by that route as the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company has done. I believe that if we did the same* as New Zealand has done, and adopted the same system as the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company adopts, to induce cablers to patronize the Pacific route, we should be in a position to get at least half the total traffic of the Commonwealth for the Pacific line. For my own part, I do not think we should desire more than that. I have no ill-feeling against the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company. It came to Australia thirty years ago, and conferred great benefits upon the people of this country. But, at the same time, it has made an immense profit from its monopoly. With a subscribed capital of &#163;1,500,000, the company has made profits to the amount of ,&#163;6,500,000 during the thirty years. It charged 9s. 4d. per word for between twenty and thirty years, whereas, enjoying a monopoly of the Australian business, it could have made a reasonable profit by sending messages at 3s. per word. But while I have no desire to deprive? the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company of the whole of its business, I certainly think that the Pacific Cable should at least take one-half of the cabling of the Commonwealth, and I am satisfied that that could be done if business-like methods were applied to this great international undertaking. </para>

                    SMITH.There is very little fear of the Marconi system being a competitor in respect of long distant cables, at present. That is a statement which was made by the chairman of the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company at their last meeting. We have only to adopt a business-like arrangement in order to so increase the receipts from the Pacific
                </para>
                <para class="block">Cable as to make that enterprise not a burden, but rather a source of revenue. We ought to follow the example of New Zealand, and send the bulk of our messages over the Pacific Cable; because if that cable is not made a success, it will be the last of all joint undertakings. Seeing that this matter was held in abeyance until the Conference, I do not blame the present Government for any delay ; but I do blame the Government, now that the Conference has been held, for asking us to ratify the agreement. If we do ratify the agreement, we shall be acting contrary to the wishes of the other partners, who have all asked that it shall not be carried into effect. It was in deference to the wishes of New Zealand, Canada, Great Britain, and the Pacific Cable Board that the Conference was held ; and yet it is now proposed to flout every recommendation made by that Conference. We shall be practically telling our partners, that, while we allowed the Conference to be held, we had no intention to be bound by its findings; that we shall force through this agreement, which the Conference condemned in the absence of vital alterations. That is not the position which this Commonwealth should take up. If we have entered into a great international agreement, we should do nothing to vitiate the letter or spirit of a single undertaking made or implied&#34;. We shall, however, vitiate in both letter and spirit the undertaking we entered into if we ratify this agreement as it stands. Surely&#39; this would be a bad commencement for the system of Empire cables which has been outlined. At present, Great Britain and Canada are being urged to lay a cable between Vancouver and the old country, as an instalment of Empire cables which shall girdle the planet. If we show that we regard the partnership arrangement as unsatisfactory, and that we desire to feed the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company at the expense of the Pacific Cable Board, there will be proof that confidence cannot be maintained between the different parts of the Empire, and that the great scheme I have indicated must fall through. In time of war, it would no doubt be a great advantage to the Empire if there were State-owned cables. At present there is nothing to prevent the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company from selling their undertaking to any foreign nation. </para>

If every one of the shareholders of the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company is now British, every one could be made French, German, or Russian, while it would still remain the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company. There is always the danger that any foreign Government which desired to isolate Australia, and thereby obtain some advantage, could afford, for national reasons, to give a larger price for the undertaking than would be justified by commercial reasons. It is necessary, for the integrity of the British Empire, that there should be these State-owned cables encircling the globe. </para>

                    SMITH.Senator Playford has, from its inception, opposed the Pacific Cable. I ask the Senate to grant the prayer of every one of our partners. I ask the Senate not to flout the wishes of those partners, but to refuse to ratify this agreement, and to take up the same position as that assumed by New Zealand - to appoint canvassers and make use of the advantages presented by this cable. We should then be able to give such a good account of the Pacific Cable that it would cease to be a financial burden on the partners within the Empire. That would be something towards the inauguration of a larger system of reciprocity throughout the Empire. If, however, we continue to favour the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company at the expense cf the Pacific Cable, the latter will be injured, and continue to be a burden, thus presenting a bar to joint enterprises of a similar nature in the future.

                    <para>- If no honorable senator proposes to speak in favour of the ratification, I should like to say a few words in opposition. As one who has always favoured a Pacific Cable, I have reason to complain of the manner in which this proposal is submitted to the Senate. In a motion which I have on the business-paper, this very question is dealt with, and the debate stands adjourned. I did not, as I might have done, take the point that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford,</inline> with the present proposal, was anticipating the motion which stands in &#39;my name; because I was quite satisfied that tha matter could be debated as well on one motion as on the other. Honorable senators will see, however, that many of the remarks to-day might have been made in discussing, my motion. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> appears to us to-day as the friend of the Pacific Cable. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister of Defence said that one of the reasons for ratifying the agreement was to be found in the fact that the company had been granted special lines. In 1903, the then Government introduced an Appropriation Bill, voting several thousands of pounds to the construction of the special lines, in order, as we were told, to carry out the agreement. Honorable senators who were opposed to the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company, and favoured the Pacific cable, contended that it was not right to vote this money, when the agreement had not been ratified. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford,</inline> who was piloting that measure through, is reported on page 6044 of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> as saying, on 13th October, 1903 :- </para>

I do not believe that he would do such a thing.

                <para>He did not tell the House of Representatives that the Senate struck out the words so that neither the Government nor anybody else should be able to point to this special wire as an indication that it had agreed in any way to the proposed ratification of the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company&#39;s agreement. What did the Government do after the Senate, because it had confidence in the Minister, had passed the vote? Apparently they went to the representatives of the Pacific Cable Company, and said : &#34; We have granted! the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company a special line. We are committed to this agreement ; we have allowed the company to open offices, and we, therefore, ask you to accept this agreement for a period of twelve years.&#34; If the Conference had been attended by a representative of the Senate, who understood the position, he would have said that the offices were not opened by the company until after the Senate had held up the agreement. I remember being informed that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton told <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Warren</inline> not to open his offices, not to do anything in Melbourne until the agreement had been approved by both Houses, but that gentleman. with the audacity which characterizes his company, opened his offices, and special lines were granted to the company, after twenty senators had signed a document to the effect that they would not even consider the agreement until a Conference was held. A senator said, to-day, that we objected to the agreement because a Conference was not held. But that was not the only reason for our objection. There are many senators who objected to the agreement on the ground that it&#39; would give the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company privileges to which they were not entitled, and which should not have been given by any one who had the interests of Australia at heart. Of course, when we obtained a victory, we were quite prepared to allow the proposal to go without stating that we were absolutely in opposition to it. We did not press the senators who said that they would oppose the adoption of the agreement because a Conference, had been held, to go further, and say that they were opposed altogether to the agreement. I ask honorable senators who have at heart the interests of Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom, to realize that the position to-day is just as iti was on the 6th March, 1903. when the Prime Minister of Canada, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Wilfrid</inline> Laurier, sent the following telegram to the Prime Minister of Australia: - </para>

                        <para>- If we keep Victoria and Queensland for the Pacific Cable, we shall have a base from which we could work. We could then send the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company out of this State, and refuse to allow them to canvass for telegrams. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> has stated that, under the Post and Telegraph Act. we could not prohibit the company from canvassing for telegrams, opening offices, and receiving wires. If that is the view taken by this Government, when the Act gives the Postmaster-General absolute and exclusive control over the receiving, collecting, and delivering of telegrams, what hope have we that they will ever do anything against the company? They say that the company will still be here. If the .company could do as well without offices, why did they ask for an agreement? They wanted an agreement because they knew what a tremendous advantage it is to have open offices and special wires. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> mentioned what the Pacific Cable Board would not do in Australia, and pointed to their lack of business methods. Who is to blame in this connexion but the Commonwealth, through its Postmasters-General, for not giving the same privileges to the Pacific Cable Company as have been granted to the other company? Surely, if there had been any business enterprise in our Postmasters-General - surely, if they had been dealing with their own money - they would have adopted some method of trying to attract business to the Pacific Cable ! Nothing has been done. No one seems to have an interest in the Pacific Cable. They have not an office. Judging from the way in which it has been treated by Postmasters-General, and by the officials, one would think that the Commonwealth Government have no interest in the Pacific Cable. The other day the Government could not tell me even the names of the representatives of the Commonwealth on the Pacific Cable Board. They are doing nothing to attract business to the Pacific Cable, and giving all the privileges to the other company. What does <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Horace</inline> Tozer, one of our representatives on the Board, say in reference to the disadvantages under which the Pacific Cable labours, and also in reference to the pooling scheme?

                    <para>We are fighting an uphill battle. The Eastern Extension Company is getting three times as much business as we are. We ought to get at least half the Australasian traffic. We transmit messages just as quickly as they do. The fact is, however, that the State Governments are strangely apathetic. They are letting things slide. Why, this very day I saw a cable message which had come from the British Government, and which was_ received over the Eastern Extension Company&#39;s route. That was not as it should be. All the Governments interested in the Pacific Cable agreed to send their messages over it. I believe the States have done this, but here is an instance of the British Government patronizing our competitor. All the States, as I said, are apathetic. They do not push our interests in any way. They just sit still, and let things happen. </para>

But the other day, when I asked for the correspondence in reference to this matter, I was told that there was none. Now where did the Government get the information which was laid before the Senate to-day by the Minister that under a pooling scheme, the Pacific Cable Company proposed to take 35 per cent. of the receipts, and the other company to take the balance? Did that information come from the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company? If it did not come from that company, it must have come by way of correspondence, and if it did, why was it not laid before the Senate? Why were we told that which apparently is not a fact? </para>

In another case, we were told that negotiations were being conducted concerning the pooling. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> read a memorandum to say that my motion was under the consideration of the Government, and that there were certain negotiations going on which might have the effect of inducing them to urge me to alter its wording. Surely these negotiations could only be the result of correspondence ! There is too much mystery about the whole thing, and I suggest to honorable senators who have entered the Senate since this matter was discussed in 1903, and who, owing to the Government keeping this motion in the background, have not had an opportunity of expressing their opinions, that they should take the advice of those who. for some years, have been deeply interested in the cable service, and that is to reject the proposed agreement. and endeavour to make the Pacific Cable a financial success. </para>

                        <para>- That is what I wish to know. If that be so, I cannot reconcile it with my convictions to vote for the ratification of this, agreement. I am not saying a single word against the Eastern Extension Company. There can be no doubt whatever that it is a well-managed concern. It is ably and cleverly managed, and in that respect, of course, has a considerable advantage over any concern controlled by the Government. From the information I have received from the large firms in Melbourne and elsewhere, I find that it is universally admitted that they get more attention from the Eastern Extension Company than they do from the Government, representing the Pacific Cable Board. I can well understand that, because we know that the &#34; Government stroke &#39; &#39; comes in, and what is everybody&#39;s business is nobody&#39;s business. I can easily imagine that, in the circumstances, the Eastern Extension Company will get the business, because of their special attention to the work. But I would ask why did four Colonies break the agreement entered into, and virtually destroy what they had themselves agreed to? The four Colonies to which I refer clandestinely made an agreement with the Eastern Extension Company, and that, in my opinion, was a monstrous thing to do, because it was a breach of faith with Great Britain, Canada, and the other Australasian Colonies who were originally responsible for this undertaking. </para>

                        <para>- I am glad to say that Victoria and Queensland stood out from the beginning ; but I can tell honorable senators that had it not been for <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner, Victoria would not have stood out. The Postmaster-General of Victoria at the time was actually a party to the agreement, but when he asked his Premier, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner, to ratify it, that right honorable gentleman - to his credit be it said - refused to do so. Let me say to honorable senators that if this agreement is not ratified, and Victoria and Queensland continue to stand out, the Pacific Cable will be able to hold its own, because Victoria commands nearly half of the whole of the cabling business, and the business of Queensland is considerable, and is increasing. </para>

                        <para>- I will not argue that point. The fact remains that Victoria controls a very large portion of the business. When the Governments of the four Australian Colonies entered into the agreement with the Eastern Extension Company, they did so behind the back of Canada, New Zealand, and England, all of whom protested. </para>

                        <para>- Precisely, and I say the action of the New South Wales Government was taken deliberately. I cannot dwell upon it, because I can hardly trust myself to express my opinion of it. At that time, offices were opened by the Eastern Extension Company, and they are open now illegally. The Minister must be aware that these offices have been open for all &#34;these years illegally, because once the Senate refused to ratify the agreement they should have been closed. They are open illegally now. In saying that I do not suggest that I would act harshly towards the Eastern Extension Company, because I admire their ability and their business habits and tact, but I do say that the Eastern Extension Company&#39;s offices are now illegally open in Victoria and in Queensland. Another matter to which reference should be made is that a special wire was erected by the then Government for the Eastern Extension Company, although for years previously the business had bean carried on over the old telegraph lines, and it: has not greatly increased of late ; in fact, it must have decreased very materially during tha year of the drought. The Government went out of their way to give the Eastern Extension Company a special wire, thereby further handicapping our own line, because the special wire naturally gave the Eastern Extension Company an advantage. I could have understood the action of the Government if they had constructed a wire over which both companies had equal advantages. </para>

                        <para>- That would be absurd. To erect wires for which there is no necessity would only be to incur useless expenditure. I contend that the &#163;30,000 expended on the erection of the special wire for the Eastern Extension Company was a useless expenditure, inasmuch as they could have done very well without it. It was only a sop to the company; it was throwing money away, and was very bad business on the part of the Commonwealth Government. It is shown throughout that the Eastern Extension Company, even in the Commonwealth, have been given advantages to which they are not entitled. All I ask for is fair play all round. I will not for a moment do any injustice to the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company, but we are doing a distinct injustice to our own company when we give special advantages to the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company. </para>

                        <para>- Then it is quite easy for the Government to find out all about it, and the Senate is entitled to the latest and best information. We should not be treated like children, and kept in the dark. We are entitled to all the in formation in connexion with this matter that is in the possession of the Government. It has often been said outside that the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company reduced the cable rates; but I say, with knowledge, that the company never lowered the rates by one farthing until they were compelled to do so. Any one who is well posted in the matter must be aware of that. They are, therefore, not entitled to the thanks of the community, of the bankers, merchants, and traders of Australia for having reduced their rates. Up to the very last moment they kept their rates as high as they could. </para>

                    <para>- If I had heard any better scheme propounded for the settlement of this longstanding grievance than that which is submitted by the Government, I should certainly support it. In the absence of any workable scheme for overcoming the difficulty, I am obliged to support the motion. This matter has been before the Senate time and again, but, as the Americans say, we have &#34; cut no ice.&#34; We have never got any &#34;forrarder,&#34; and we are now just where we were in 1903. Nothing has been done, no progress has been made, and no new light has been shed on the question. In allowing matters to drift, as we have done up to the present, we have actually been playing into the hands of the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company. Existing conditions will suit them much better than the agreement submitted by the Government. I have listened to the debate on the matter from both sides, and I am pleased to think that it is a matter in connexion with which no party feeling has been introduced. The debate has, in consequence, been logical and reasonable; but, so far, no workable scheme (has been submitted to overcome the difficulty with which we have been faced from the very inception of Federation. We are all aware that this difficulty is a legacy which the Commonwealth has taken over from the States. It is not the creation of the present or of any other Federal Government. It was brought about before the Federal authorities had any control over the Post and Telegraph Department, and I am sorry to think that the manner in which it was brought about reflects no credit on one of the States of the Commonwealth. The Government of New South Wales signed the agreement with the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company under very suspicious circumstances. To the credit of the Victorian Government be it said that, notwithstanding the fact that the Postmaster-General of the day signed a similar agreement, the Government and Parliament to which he belonged repudiated it, and would have nothing to do with it. I cannot understand <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> blaming the other States for having brought about the present position. If the honorable senator had made himself acquainted with the whole of the facts, he would have known that three of the States to which he referred had nothing whatever to do with the present agreement. </para>

                        <para>- I can assure the honorable senator that Western Australia, South Australia, and Tasmania entered into their agreements with the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company before there was any Pacific Cable at all. The agreement, so far as those States were concerned., was entered into under very favorable circumstances, as they paid no subsidy. No advantages were given to the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company, such as had been given in arrangements which the other States entered into. Therefore, so far as those States were concerned, the agreement was a reasonable one, and no blame can be attributed to them. </para>

                        <para>- I think that, from a monetary stand-point, they made a very good bargain indeed. Look at it from the point of view of Western Australia. She had no direct cable communication prior to the construction of the new route between Western Australia and Cocos Island to South Africa. That gave us a shorter route to Europe, and a much better one than existed before. </para>

                        <para>- I have yet to learn that the Pacific Cable Board ever proposed to lay a cable from Western Australia to South Africa. Its scheme was confined to the Pacific, and did not propose to cross the Indian Ocean. There is no getting over the fact, however, that the present position is intolerable. If I saw any possible hope of making the Pacific Cable a successful concern, by not entering into an arrangement with the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company, I should gladly say : &#34; Let us enter into active competition with the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company, and let us do all we can to enable the Government concern to come out on top.&#34; But I do not see how we can hope to compete successfully against the company. I can, on the other hand, see that we may lose a great deal of money, and that, having lost it, we shall be no better off than we are now. If we consent to the agreement introduced by the Government, there certainly will be a period when we shall be able to say that the whole of our relations with &#34;the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company have come to an end. </para>

                        <para>- At the end of twelve years, the agreement will come to an end ; but under the present position of affairs it will be perpetual. All the advantages that the company has at the present time - and they are many - will be continued for all time. In the face of that strong position, surely something practical must be done. I have already said that the present position is intolerable, and I see no better way of ending it than to enter into a fresh agreement, putting the whole matter on a more satisfactory basis than it is at present. Regarding the matter from that stand-point, and recognising the fact that those who have opposed the proposal of the Government have not advanced a better scheme of their own, I feel justified in supporting it. </para>

                    <para>- There are several matters connected with this agreement which cause exceedingly grave doubts in my mind as to whether I ought to vote for it. In the first place, I wish to point out that the agreement contains a recital. Now, any one who has even a superficial knowledge of legal documents, will be aware of the value of a recital. The recital sets forth that it is desirable that the provisions of the old agreements and the provisional arrangement - shall, subject to the modifications hereinafter appearing, be combined in one agreement, which shall be in substitution for the said recited agreements and provisional arrangement. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">That is an expression of a desire and an intention. But I wish to indicate emphatically that this agreement which we are asked to ratify contains no operative words in any part of it whatever to give effect to that recital. I say, without fear of contradiction, that there is nothing in this agreement, if we assent to it now, that will prevent those old agreements with the States coming into force again when this new agreement lapses. </para>

But if not provided for in the operative part, the statements in the recital form no part of the agreement. I point out another feature.

But what are they? The position is that four States in the Commonwealth are, to use a phrase, &#34;in the toils&#34; of the Eastern Extension Company. They entered into their bargain voluntarily. This new agreement proposes&#39; to drive the remaining States of the Commonwealth into the same toils, I will admit for a limited term of twelve or thirteen years. If this agreement is not ratified, the four States will remain in the same toils; but if the agreement is ratified, we shall add two more States for the twelve or thirteen years; and, in my opinion, we shall leave the other four States still in the toils of the company at the end of that term. </para>

Seeing that this doubt has been thrown upon the matter by four gentlemen, whose repute is beyond suspicion, and who not only sign this report, but distinctly say. &#34; We are advised &#34; - and when they say that, we must, of course, understand that such men would be well advised, or they would not have quoted the opinion - surely a senator should hesitate to make the States run the risk - because that is what we are going to do - at the end of the agreement of being in the s.ame toils as they have been in preceding years. If there were no other reason - and there are others - why I should refuse to be a party to the ratification of this agreement, </para>

                <para class="block">I say, deliberately, that that information is abundantly sufficient to justify me in refusing to assent to an agreement which is., at any rate, clouded with such doubt as to its real contents. There is another matter, which I mentioned two years ago. There is no question of policy about the matter at all, because 1 brought the same point under the notice of a previous. Government. This new agreement has been prepared as the result of negotiations. I have been unable to discover by whom those negotiations were instituted - whether by- the Eastern Extension Company or by some preceding Commonwealth Government. I should like to have some information on that point, although I may not be able to get it. I have said with regard to my own State - and I must be expected to look after its interests - that when those negotiations were commenced, it was perfectly easy for the then Government, just as it was for the present Government, to have made it a condition to leave Tasmania out for the remainder of this cable subsidy agreement. It is onerous, burdensome, and iniquitous to her, especially since s.he has entered into Federation. Tasmania suffers under the hardship of paying largely in excess of what she would have to pay if she were now free to make terms. This or any other Government, whose duty it is to look after the interests of every State in the Commonwealth, regardless of position, size, or other considerations, might, very well, when entering into these negotiations, have made a notification and expressly provided that Tasmania should escape, to that limited extent, from this special cable subsidy. </para>

                    <para>- I feel myself in a somewhat peculiar position in regard to the ratification of this agreement. I recognise that four out of the six States are, to quote words already used, &#34; in the toils &#34; of a very unfortunate series of agreements with the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company. I do not desire to prolong the debate, or reiterate arguments already used, but I must say that I do not feel Justified in voting for the ratification of this agreement. My objections would disappear to a very large extent if I were satisfied that this agreement would be in complete substitution for the agreements now in existence between the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company and the four States. </para>

The plain fact remains, however, that we are to a certain extent caught in the toils of the objectionable agreements at present in force. The question is whether it would not be better for us to submit to what we regard as unfair conditions for a certain term of years, if at the end of that time we are absolutely certain that the objectionable agreements will cease and determine. </para>

What objection can the Government have to asking the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company to make this point absolutely clear? If the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company positively refuse to make it clear that the old agreements shall cease at the end of ten years, we shall know exactly what the game of the company is- we shall know their motive for refusing. Acknowledging, as we do, that we should like to be freer from the operations of this company than we are, the best course would be to adopt my amendment. </para>

                    was very emphatic when he stated that the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company had not given any reduction of rates until compelled to do so, and that statement excited considerable sympathy from those who are opposed to the ratification of the agreement. I find from the official papers, however, that so long ago as1891 the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company offered to. and actually did, reduce their rate from 9s. 4d. to 4s. per word under a guarantee.

                    <para>- The Eastern Extension Telegraph Company also offered to lay a third cable, which was done. Two years afterwards the different Colonies urged that under the guarantee there was a loss of &#163;55, 000, and asked the company to raise the rates. The companv, however, urged that the experiment of the 4s. tariff should be continued, but ultimately agreed to make the rate 4s. 9d. per word, which continued until 1900, or thereabouts. These facts show that the company were not anxious for high rates. </para>

                        <para>- This shows that the company were anxious to encourage business, and when the Colonies withdrew from the agreement, the company continued the low rate, in spite of heavy losses to themselves. The discovery of gold in Western Australia in 1896 led to an enormous increase in the Australian traffic, and in the three years succeeding the discovery the guarantee was exceeded by &#163;i23&#62;233&#62; &#163;170,515, and &#163;121,016 respectively ; so that there was no loss to the Colonies. According to the information given to me, although these large receipts suddenly fell away again, they had put the company in a position to renew their offer to lay the Cape Cable with a reduction in the tariff, but without . any demand for subsidy or guarantee. We hear complaints of injustice being done to the Pacific Cable Board by reason of the fact that they do not enjoy privileges which are extended to the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company I have no particular reason for being a friend of the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company, but only want fair play. The question is, whether having regard to the interests of the whole of Australia, there is any better course open to us than to ratify the agreement now presented. It is said that the company have been given a special wire. On the 29th July, 1903, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton said that this provision &#39;was necessary  in order to facilitate the international traffic. He quoted the following extract from a. letter by the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company : - </para>

                    <para>It would materially expedite the cable traffic to have a line and system wholly devoted to it, and where it would not have to take turn with the large intercolonial traffic. It would also be a convenience to the public that they should be in direct communication with the agency that carries their messages from one end of the world to the other, instead of through the intermediary of the local Telegraph Department, whose jurisdictions end with the boundaries of the respective colonies. The international telegraph traffic is almost wholly a code, is of a special nature, and is worked under complicated and extensive rules and regulations. </para>

Practically nothing, except that we know that the cable is making a loss, and that the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company have offered to reduce their rate to 2s. 6d. a word, if the receipts will allow it. I do not know whether honorable senators have in their hands the papers which were circulated in 1903, and which. I think, are well worth reading.

                    <para>. - The discussion has tended, I think, to bring the minds of many honorable senators who entertained diverse views on the subject into closer unanimity than at the outset. I have listened with a great deal of interest and attention to the speeches of Senators Higgs and Staniforth Smith, but so far as the motion is concerned, I would venture to say that interesting as their remarks have been, they have failed to point out how or in what way the Government could act better in the circumstances, than they have proposed. This agreement was entered into some time ago, and has been in operation since it was signed, subject, of course, to the ratification of the two Houses. The ratification of one House was given two years ago, and it is unnecessary for me to repeat the history of the agreement since that time. So far as the States are concerned, I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton, in agreeing with the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company on the lines indicated in this memorandum of agreement, chose the lesser of two possible evils. There is no doubt that the company, in connexion with Australia, as elsewhere, were out for profit, and like all other business concerns, they endeavoured to make the most of the opportunities which arose. They do not pose, I suppose, as a philanthropic institution, but desire to make the largest possible interest on their capital. I have no great affection for the company. I recognise thoroughly that they have been motived by profit from the be ginning, and! although, in many instances, they may have endeavoured to get concessions from the States in the guise of persons who were endeavouring to benefit the people in the States, and in other parts of the Empire, still, to use the words of Thackeray, they always kept their eyes on the main chance. We are asked by this motion to ratify the agreement, and after some discussion. I think that honorable senators on both sides recognise that it is the lesser of two evils which it asks them to accept. The amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;</inline> Keefe goes very much further than I think any honorable senator would like to go.

Those are the agreements which would be affected by the ratification of this agreement ; but I am pointing out now that there are here recited some eight agreements, and, with the exception of No. 4, concerning Tasmania, all the others seem to me to be agreements that have been entered into by this company with the various States Governments or Administrations in respect to matters incidental to the carrying on of their business in the several States, the leasing of land, the acquisition of the freehold of land, and so forth. I have not been able to read them all through, but I quote agreement No. <inline font-style="italic">2,</inline> for instance - </para>

                        <para>An agreement dated 24th day of June, iS/5, between the Governor of the Colony of New Zealand of the first part the Governor of the Colony of New South Wales of the second part and the. Extension Company of the third part. Whereby by article 2 the Extension Company was empowered to lay a submarine telegraph cable be- tween New Zealand and Sydney in the Colony of New South Wales the terminal point on the coast of New Zealand to be at a point called Blind Bay or Golden Bay and the terminal point at Sydney to be at the telegraph station there. By article 6 the Governments respectively agreed to afford to the Extension Company all proper and reasonable facilities to enable the Extension Company to lay the said cable and keep the same in repair and to acquire any land necessary for their terminal stations in the said colonies including a free grant of any Government land suitable for that purpose. By articles 7 and 8 the Government of New South Wales agreed to afford to the Company certain facilities for working the cable at Sydney and by articles 12 and 13 provision was made for the indication of route without charge and limiting any terminal charge of the Government of New South Wales to the lowest ordinary rate. </para>

The motion which he has now moved is one that might, and I believe would, find acceptance by the Standing Orders Committee.

The Committee has never had a meeting without the President quoting a number of precedents and authorities on the questions at issue. For that reason alone I put it to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> that it is a matter of courtesy that the matter should be referred to the Committee. </para>

                        <para>- But it had before it the question involved in the proposed new standing order. It was felt that by reason of certain decisions that had been given honorable senators were unduly limited in dealing with Bills by the Standing Orders themselves, which stated that only matters relevant to the subject-matter could, be discussed. It was &#39; suggested to the Standing Orders Committee that greater liberty might be given. At present, the Standing Orders practically amount to saying that it is competent for the Committee of the Whole to deal with instructions which have been given to it relevant to the Bill before it. Such an instruction is of no use whatever. The Standing Orders at present, therefore, are of no assistance in the way of granting further liberty. It was, consequently, considered that we might provide that power should be given to the Committee of the Whole to consider such amendments as did not deal entirely with the subject-matter of a Bill. When the Electoral Bill was under consideration, certain amendments were moved affecting portions of the principal Act. Those amendments were held to be irrelevant. It was felt to be a hardship that we could not, in considering a Bill amending a large number of machinery and other sections of the principal Act, turn back to other sections for the purpose of amending them. Of course it is very difficult to determine exactly the form of words which would enable us to obtain the increased liberty that we desire. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has now drafted an amendment to meet the end in view. The Standing Orders Committee, having considered! the subject without coming to a decision. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> appeals to the Senate itself to carry out its own wishes in this regard. So far&#39; as I have been able to gather, his motion does not carry out the wishes of the Senate. I think, therefore, that we should take the responsibility of &#39;affirming this proposed new standing order. If anything would be gained by referring it back to the </para>

                <para class="block">Committee, I should agree to that course. But if the general sense of the Committee is taken, and it is conclusively indicated by the majority that we must have a standing order to this effect, then will be the time for the matter to be referred to the Committee, upon whom the duty will be incumbent to determine the form of the new standing order. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> is hardly consulting the best interests of the Senate in the amendment which he has moved. Let us take the sense of the Senate. If it is determined that we ought to have a standing order in the direction suggested, we can refer the matter to the Committee to settle the form. If objection be taken to the verbiage of &#34;this motion, let an instruction be given to the Standing Orders Committee to prepare a standing order to the effect desired. </para>

                    <para>- It is probable that a large majority of honorable senators agree as to the desirability of some amendment of the standing order dealing with- instructions to a Committee of the Whole. If that be so, it does not appear to me that there is any great urgency for dealing with the matter. The Senate would commit a grievous mistake if it adopted this standing order straight away, without giving the Standing Orders Committee a proper opportunity to consider the whole question. If this motion be put without reference to the amendment, I shall be compelled to vote against it, and I hope many other honorable senators will take the same course, for the reason that we have not yet adequately considered the question. Further, the wording of the proposed standing order is most unsatisfactory. If I understand the matter aright, this question arose in consequence of a difficulty encountered in giving an instruction to a Committee of the Whole when we were dealing with an amending Bill. I have already expressed my view on this matter, but it was held by you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> that certain amendments proposed were contrary to the Standin&#39;g Orders; and a desire was then made manifest to extend the powers of a Committee of the Whole. I venture to suggest to Senators Pearce and Dobson that what we have to consider is the limit of the instruction that can be given to a Committee of the Whole on an amending Bill. In my opinion, on an amending Bill it ought to be competent for us to submit an amendment which is relevant to the subject-matter of the original Act. </para>

I think, however, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> might withdraw the proposed standing order, which appears to me to contain an absolute contradiction. If amendments are relevant to the subject-matter of a Bill they cannot deal with an entirely different matter; and, in the contrary case, they would, in nine cases out of ten, be dealing with an entirely different matter. If the debate cannot be adjourned, I urge honorable senators not to pass the standing order as presented. I am prepared to consider any amendment which will give further time to the Standing Orders Committee to deal with the matter, with a view to the submission of some standing order. </para>

                    <para>My sympathies are entirely with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> in their attitude towards the motion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford.</inline> Having regard to the rates charged by the two cable companies, I feel that we owe very much to the Pacific Cable Company. There is no doubt that the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company would not have reduced their rates as much as they did had it not been from a fear of what the Pacific Cable Company might do. I recognise that the latter represents the British Empire to a larger extent than does the former, and as such I feel that it ought to be encouraged by us to develop its interests in the Commonwealth. At the same time, I cannot shut my eyes to the facts which have been submitted by the Government in connexion with the agreements entered into by four States with the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company. It is difficult for me to conceive how such <inline font-style="italic">agreements</inline> could have been entered into. It is altogether out of the ordinary routine of business details that agreements which are binding for ever should have been made by any Minister on behalf of a State, and I cannot understand how they came to be confirmed. We have, however, to deal with the agreements as they are. and it appears to me that the offer of the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company to the effect that they will enter into an agreement binding themselves to a definite period is the only wise one which the Government could ask the Senate to accept. We have to bear in mind what the consequences of the agreements with the States would be if we did not accept that offer. I should not like to take the responsibility of voting against the motion. The question as to whether the interpretation put on that agreement by the Attorney-General is correct or not can only be regarded from a layman&#39;s point of view, and when lawyers differ, we may come to the conclusion that -on one side or the other there is an error. We cannot shut our eyes to the fact that even in the law Courts of the Commonwealth there is a very large difference of opinion. We find that in three cases out of four the appeals from the ordinary Courts to the higher Courts are disallowed. If that is the case in ordinary legal affairs, laymen are justified in wishing it to be made absolutely clear that in voting for the motion they shall do so with the knowledge that in 1915 the agreement, so far as it binds the States, shall be cancelled. It is only from a fear of the consequences which might otherwise ensue that 1 feel obliged, in the interests of the Commonwealth and the four States concerned in the making of this extraordinary arrangement, to vote for the motion. I do <inline font-style="italic">not</inline> wish, and. I am sure that no other honorable senator wishes by his vote, to throw cold water upon the efforts of the Pacific Cable Company or any other company. I feel that I am interpreting the wishes of honorable senators generally when I say that our sympathies are entirely with the Pacific Cable Company, but at the same time we feel that, from a purely business stand-point, it would be folly on our part not to realize the consequences which would flow from our voting against the motion. For these reasons, I intend to vote wilh the Government. </para>

                    <para>- I have to complain of the very incomplete information which has been placed at our disposal by the Government. One would have thought that in connexion with this important matter the Senate would have been provided with exhaustive information with regard to every aspect of it. Instead of that, we have the bald proposition of the Government asking us to ratify an agreement which has been entered into provisionally, and if any one wishes an explanation, he gets one explanation from one Minister and another from his colleague, and is consequently left in a most hazy state of mind. I object to this sort of thine. I think it is desirable that we should know exactly what we are doing when we vote upon this most important question. In the first place. I have been anxious to discover what the position of the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company will be at the end of 19 15 if we ratify this agreement, but&#34; I have not yet been able to find that out. I have not been supplied with any definite statement on the point. Until I am satisfied on the point, I shall vote against the motion. I con- fess that at the first blush I was inclined to vote for the motion, but as the debate proceeded I considered that I found that the result of adopting the agreement would not be what I desired. I fondly imagined that if we ratified the agreement we should at the end of twelve months relieve ourselves of an incubus, whereas at present the company have a right in perpetuity to operate in four of the States. The Government, if it desired the motion to be passed, ought to have taken care to have supplied the Senate with all the information available. The Pacific Cable Company is an experiment in Imperial Socialism. </para>

                        <para>- At the end of that period the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company could not, without our consent, open offices, get special land wires, or restrict us in our terminal charges. They would be absolutely in our hands to do whatever we pleased. Of course, we could not take their cables from them, but they would be absolutely in our hands as regards carrying on business in Australia. </para>

This agreement shall be in substitution for the two agreements, and the provisional arrangement mentioned in the fourth recital of this agreement. This agreement shall expire on the thirty-first day of December, nineteen hundred and fifteen.&#34; </para>
                <para class="block">I quote the fourth recital, for the benefit of honorable senators - </para>
                <para>And whereas the present rates for the transmission of the Commonwealth traffic are governed by the two agreements and the provisional arrangement next hereinafter mentioned that is to say (a) An agreement dated the 14th day of April, 1900, and made between the Government of the State of South Australia (then called the Colony of South Australia) of the first part the Government of the State of Western Australia (then called the Colony of Western Australia) of the second part the Government of the State of Tasmania (then called the Colony of Tasmania) of the third part and the Extension Company of the fourth part. (4) An agreement dated the 16th day of January 1901 and made between the Government of the State of New South Wales (then called the Colony of New South Wales) of the one part and the Extension Company of the other part. <inline font-style="italic">(c )</inline> A provisional arrangement made on behalf of the Federal Government with the Extension Company for applying to the other States of the Commonwealth the rates for transmission of telegraphic messages provided by the said recited agreements. </para>
                <para>So far as I am able to discover, the amendment goes a long way to meet what I desire. I wish to place my position clearly before the Senate. There is no doubt a good deal of difficulty connected with this matter, and a very great deal to be said on both sides. But we have to decide one way or the other now. What appeals to me is this : If we ratify the amended agreement, it will absolutely expire at the end of 1915. I suppose that no attempt would&#34; then be made to renew it. In any case, the people of the Commonwealth, through their representatives in Parliament, would have the whole matter in their own hands. If we do not ratify the agreement, where do we stand? The company will have the right, in perpetuity, to operate in four of the Australian States. When I have to choose <inline font-style="italic">between</inline> the two positions, notwithstanding the very forcible arguments advanced on the other side during the present debate, I am compelled  to  come  to  the conclusion that  the  course proposed by the Government,  if  amended  as  suggested, is the more beneficial  one.  It  is  advanced in opposition to this that, if we ratify  the  agreement, by  1915  there will not be any Pacific Cable,  and that our first great experiment in Imperial Socialism will have been written down a lamentable failure. I hope that nothing of that kind will happen. I remind Senators Higgs and Smith that the comparative failure of the Pacific Cable to date has been due to the laxity of the Commonwealth Post and Telegraph Department, which has not shown the business enterprise and capacity of the local managers of the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company. </para>

                        <para>- I am not aware of that; but if they are in the field to do business they should try to do business. At any rate, they might do one thing which is done by the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company, and that is codify messages for business men. They have not been doing that hitherto. Seeing that the two cables are competing keenly for whatever business there is to be done, it is only due to our partners in the Pacific Cable Company that our managers here should at least exhibit the same enterprise and capacity as the managers of the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company do. It is not enough to say that we have Great Britain, Canada, and the Australasian States behind us. We cannot on that account afford to lie on our oars, and the authorities of the Post and Telegraph Department of the Commonwealth should rouse themselves to get a much larger proportion of the business than they have hitherto obtained. It has been advanced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs,</inline> and also, I believe, by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith,</inline> that if we refuse to ratify this agreement we shall Have complete control in Victoria and in Queensland. The population of those two States amounts to a little over one-third of that of the entire Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>-About 40 per cent., I think, is the proportion. In answer to this argument, I point out that, so far as Queensland is concerned, the Pacific Cable gets the lion&#39;s share of her business now. I admit that there is much room for improvement in the way of increased business in Victoria. But, while we should have a monopoly of the business in the two States named, we should have to enter into active competition with the Eastern Extension Company in the remaining States for all time. I do not suppose that any one here imagines that the Commonwealth is going to permit this company to retain its footing in Australia for ever. Whether we ratify this agreement or not, the day will ultimately arrive when the Commonwealth will have to come to terms with this company, and I believe the present is as favorable an opportunity to do so as will ever occur. If we ratify the agreement, at the end of ten years we shall be in a position to terminate all our arrangements with the Eastern Extension Company. If we do not, the company may carry o business in this country for a century to come. That, it appears to me, describes the position at the present moment. After the assurances given by the Government, I find that there is no other course open to me than to support the motion, if amended as proposed. I trust that if it is carried the Government will bring a little pressure to bear upon the management of the Pacific Cable in Australia to induce those responsible to &#34;hustle&#34; a little more in order to get a bigger share of the business, and show that an enterprise of this kind can be as efficiently carried out under Commonwealth control as by a private company. </para>

I have been reading through <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton&#39;s reply to the Premier of New Zealand, dated 1st June, 1903. One or two paragraphs in that letter give the reasons for the new agreement in a more concise form than I could give them, and 1 therefore propose to quote them : - . </para>

                </continue>
                <para>I hoped that you would attempt to show (1) in what way, other than the one it has adopted, the Commonwealth could have relieved itself of the virtually perpetual obligations of the contracts made with four of its component States, which by the Constitution devolved upon the Federal Go.vernment ; (2) in what way the Pacific Cable is likely to bc injured by the new agreement. You have, however, done neither of these things. </para>
                <para>When the Government of the Commonwealth assumed control of the Post Office, agreements were in force between the Company and the States of New South Wales, South Australia, Tasmania, and Western Australia. These States, in consequence of the agreements mentioned, enjoyed lower rates than the other two, where similar agreements were not in force. The citizens of Victoria and Queensland were, therefore, compelled either to pay the additional rates demanded by the Company, or resort to the inconvenient method of forwarding messages to Sydney or Adelaide for despatch at. the cheaper tariff, paying in addition the overland rates. </para>
                <para>It was obvious that in the Commonwealth this stale of things should not be allowed to exist longer than was absolutely necessary. The Commonwealth was obliged to assume the burden of the contracts then in existence, and the first problem that confronted this Government was how, consistently with its obligations under these contracts, it could secure uniformity of treatment to the citizens of Australia. The contracts could only be rescinded by mutual consent, and it is not to be supposed that the Company would surrender its undoubted advantages without receiving some compensation. </para>
                <para>The matter then became one for negotiation between the Government of the Commonwealth and the Company. The objects of the Government during these negotiations were twofold - (1)&#39; To secure uniform treatment; (2) to set, if possible, a reasonable limit to the operation of the agreement which bound us. The negotiations were protracted and difficult, and it is the opinion of this Government that the result will be very satisfactory to the people of the Commonwealth, and of distinct advantage to the partners of the Pacific Cable. </para>
                <para class="block">Further on the letter says - &#39; </para>
                <para>The Pacific Cable is not for a day, but it is to be held for all time, and it is surely the province of those responsible for the Administration of a country not to limit their views to momentary advantages, but rather to look ahead and proceed in such a manner that their actions will be of permanent benefit to the people whose servants they are. There can be no doubt that in reducing the term of the agreement to a reasonable period, the Commonwealth has obtained for the Pacific Cable a very great advantage which cannot fail to be of immense and increasing value. </para>
                <para class="block">Lastly, the letter says - </para>
                <para>The matter has been fully considered by this Government. The agreement was not entered into hurriedly - in fact, the negotiations extended over twelve months - and it is with full confidence that its adoption will be for the benefit of the Commonwealth, without injuring Pacific Cable, which, however, will in the future reap distinct advantage, that Ministers propose to ask Parliament to ratify their action. </para>
                <para class="block">The Pacific Cable has the support of the people and Government of New Zealand. It is an extraordinary idea that the cable will not continue to be worked if this agreement is made. New Zealand1 is one of the most go-ahead countries in the world at the present time, and does a great amount of cable business. The Pacific Cable also has a share of the Australian business. I think it is our duty to carry the amendment, and I trust that the Senate will be unanimous. </para>

                <para class="block">It is quite clear that the policy which the Government has adopted with regard to this matter has been very truly described as a policy of drift. It &#39;is natural that such a policy should have been adopted, but it is not business, and is not in the interest of the Commonwealth. The Government accepted this agreement as a kind of legacy from its predecessor, who, in turn, accepted it as a legacy from the States ; and while I admit that the Government was faced with a difficult position, I cannot admit that it has done all it might have clone to carry out the wishes of the Senate. The Senate objected to confirm the agreement in 1903, with the object of having a conference of the partners to the cable. That Conference has since been held. I hold in my hand a copy of its report. The document is rather a disappointing one; but it is, I think, disappointing because the Commonwealth Government has. been luke-warm in the matter. It appears almost to study the interest of the Eastern Extension Company rather than of our partners. Consequently, the managers of the Pacific Cable seem to have been disheartened. A tone almost of despair runs through the report. It cannot be. admitted that it is recommended that the agreement should be ratified. I do not think the Conference recommends that it should be ratified ; but it says that if the agreement is ratified - and the impression that it would be could only have been gathered from the Commonwealth Government - two amendments should be made. After pointing out that the Senate,, after discussing the agreement at several sittings, adjourned the ratification for the object of securing a Conference of the representatives of the partners to the Pacific Cable, the report goes on to deal with the circumstances under which the Conference was held. Then comes this paragraph- </para>

                <para class="block">Nothing could better illustrate the lukewarmness of the Australian Government with regard to the Pacific Cable and the backing given to the Eastern Extension Company than this fact. What does it mean? Although the Senate declined to ratify the agreement, and although twenty of us signed a petition backing up the action of the Senate, and urging that a Conference should be held, the Government has allowed the Eastern Extension Company certain facilities in Melbourne in defiance of our wishes. Is it possible for the Government to contend, in face of facts like that, that it has done its duty lo the Pacific Cable Company? What is the meaning of such conduct I am unable to understand. </para>

                        <para>- The whole tone of the report of the Conference shows that it was influenced by the feeling that the Commonwealth Government was working against the Pacific Cable. Why do Ministers appear to flout the wishes of the Senate in this way? What was the use of our declaring that we would not confirm the agreement when the action of the Government virtually confirmed it, and gave to the company facilities which New South Wales, prior to Federation, made such a fatal blunder in granting? The action of the Federal Government has been, of course, most dis heartening to all those who desired to see the Pacific Cable placed in a proper position. I can quite understand, therefore, why the Conference came to such a very negative determination. Let honorable senators recollect that the Pacific Cable was laid down not only for the purpose of enabling us to have two strings to our bow, but also as an Imperial cable - an Imperial link. Is it a proper thing for us to leave our partners in the lurch, and absolutely try to back up the Eastern Extension Company? That is what has been done all through. The company itself has done nothing which honorable business men should not do. But at the same time it has done everything possible to throw a damper on the Pacific Cable. Before it was constructed, the company&#39;s agents talked about the cost and the impossibility of constructing and working it. I do not blame them. I do not accuse them of being guilty of anything but honorable practices. They have been active and diligent in pursuing the interest of their company. But is that a reason why we should do everything to help the company against our own partners ? The managers of the Pacific Cable now &#39; find that they do not get the business from Australia that they expected, and the fact that the Commonwealth Government is playing into the hands of the Eastern Extension Company naturally makes them hesitate to incur further expense in opening offices of their own. They feel, of course, that the Government is not only not helping them, but working against them. Another paragraph in the report of the Conference says - </para>

                <para class="block">That confirms what I have just said, that I believe that the Pacific Cable managers would, under other circumstances, have applied for terminable facilities; but the Government, in spite of the decision of the Senate, granted such facilities to the rivals of the Pacific Cable. Is it any wonder that the managers of the Pacific Cable do not know what to do? They looked to their partner, the Commonwealth Government, and they find that partner going against them and supporting their rivals by giving them facilities in spite of the action of one of the Houses of this Parliament. </para>

It understands the canvassing, and is apparently in touch with the Government.

                        <para>- That is a nice position for the leader of the Senate to take up ! Of course, there was a decision bv the House of Representatives, but the Senate refused to adopt that decision. Then the Ministry flouted the Senate, and practically confirmed the agreement as far as they could by their actions. Does the Minister suggest that it is, not my duty to &#34;rant,&#34; as he calls it, against that sort of business ? </para>

                        <para>- Is it right of the Government to grant concessions in spite of the contrary decision of the Senate? All the facts show how unbusiness-like has been the action of the Government. I do not accuse the Government of deliberately acting unfairly to anybody, but they must see that our partners have the right to complain. The members of the Board were not likely to use any but diplomatic language; but it is, clear from the sentence I have quoted that they1 are bitterly disappointed with the action of the Government- </para>

The conditions are that it must be &#34;clearly understood that these concessions are tentative only, and that in case of the refusal of either House of Parliament to ratify the agreement, these privileges are to instantly cease, the office to be closed, and the use pf the telegraph line to revert to the Postmaster-General. In such an. event, no claim is to be made by the company for the loss of the privileges or for any expense incurred in connexion with fitting up or opening the office, or in connexion with any arrangement made for the tree of the telegraph line. </para>

What was the use of our sending representatives to the Conference when, in the meantime, the Government made tentative arrangements under which the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company obtained all they desided ? </para>

The moment the Senate refused to ratify the agreement, and referred the matter to the consideration of our partners, the company ought to have had notice to quit. </para>

                        <para>- Every honorable senator can see perfectly well that the Pacific &#34;Cable Board have had the worst of the negotiations. When the suggestion was made to confer as to what should be done, the position was given away, and the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company got all the facilities they desired. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> has said that no one has pointed out in what way the Senate can improve the position, or .what better plan can be adopted than the confirmation of the agreement. From the point of view of the Ministers, I can quite understand that they see no better way. They have made up their .minds to push this agreement through both Houses, and they have acted on the assumption that the agreement will go through in spite of the Senate&#39;s decision. A better way would be to show loyalty to our partners ; the Government have been disloyal. A better way would be to bow to the decision of the Senate; that decision the Government have tried to flout. A better way would be to back up the Pacific Cable Board in every way, as our partners say we ought to do; the Government have not helped the Pacific Cable Board at all(, but have directly and positively helped their rivals. </para>

                        <para>- How can the Minister, or anybody else, tell what the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company may do until the matter has been fully discussed, and the amendments are submitted to them ? When two lawyers are endeavouring to settle or compromise an action, it is very common for one of them to say, &#34; I shall go so far, but not a step further &#34; ; but every negotiator takes much the same course, and nobody takes any notice of such words. A weak Government, however, have done so in their efforts to push this agreement through by the aid of all the arguments they can conjure up. The Eastern Extension Telegraph Company are entitled to fair play and justice, but not to the sympathy, support, and help of the Government as against the Pacific Cable Board. The Eastern Extension Telegraph Company have received that help, and that is the ground of complaint. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> commenced his remarks by &#34; running down &#34; the Pacific Cable Board; he could not submit this motion without showing his sympathy with the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company. </para>

                        <para>- I have to thank the Minister for withdrawing the words, and to offer to withdraw any words which he may regard&#39; as offensive. We cannot see what is in the heart or mind of the Minister, but must judge him by his actions ; and it does appear to me, as I think it must appear to the public, that the Government seem to favour the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company more than they do our own partners. I hope that in the future the Government will keep their sympathy for the Pacific Cable Board, and show that sympathy by their actions as well as by their words. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe</inline> appears to have consented to the agreement extending for twelve years. I admit that a ten years&#39; agreement, with two years&#39; notice, is a twelve years&#39; agreement ; and the fact only indicates to us what thorough men of business control are the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company. The company induced <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Ed&#39;mund</inline> Barton to assent to an agreement for ten years, and then managed to get inserted the longest term of, notice of which I have ever heard. Here is a company in hourly communication with their head office in London, and yet they stipulate for a notice of that length. Did anybody ever hear of such a long notice? </para>

For twelve years the company will have the whip hand and occupy the same premier position they occupy now. They will have the run of the Commonwealth, and will continue their canvassing. They will have their terminal offices, and the Pacific Cable Board practically say that it would hardly be worth their while to open rival offices, the report of the Conference suggesting that it would be better for the two organizations to negotiate. </para>

I would far rather let the company do the best they can with the facilities which they obtained most improperly from New South Wales after the Commonwealth was established, and before the Departments were taken over. But in the two States which have not given up their rights, the Pacific Cable Company would have a far better chance of getting business. </para>

                        <para>- No : I have no doubt that in the future, by compromise, a working agreement would be come to, but SenatorPlayford, like every other Minister who. wishes to get a proposal adopted, will not listen to any alternative. He will not admit that negotiation could achieve anything. He insists that the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company will not go beyond the terms of this agreement. Therefore, it is exceedingly difficult to move the Government in any direction. I think that the Senate will regret the day, if the agreement be confirmed. For twelve long years it would place the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company in a better position, and at the end of that time I suppose they would have a larger proportion of business than they now get. I think that the Minister ought to have read more carefully the report of the Conference, and considered the suggestion that the two companies should confer, and see if they could nob come to an arrangement. If the Pacific Cable Company agreed to a compromise I, of course, should not dissent, because I presume that they would derive a benefit therefrom. No one can foresee the harm which we shall do to our partners if we confirm the agreement. We shall be practically surrendering the power of helping the Pacific Cable Company if we give the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company the right to have terminal facilities in Victoria and Queensland. We are losing . &#163;80.000 odd a year, so that during the next twelve years we shall probably lose&#163;1,500. 000, together with compound interest. I believe that if the Government would only negotiate with the old company they could arrange much better terms. I protest against what is being done. I prophesy that the agreement will prove to be disastrous to the Commonwealth&#39;. I consider that the Government will be very much to blame if they allow the motion to pass. I quite agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator demons</inline> when he says that Tasmania has been absolutely forgotten. The Tasmanian agreement is nothing to the rich Eastern Extension Telegraph Company, but it is everything to a State which has lost&#163;150,000 a year by the operation of the Tariff alone. We have a right to complain that no Commonwealth Government has handled this question as it ought to have done. Considering that our duty is to conserve the interests of our partners the action of every Government has been unintelligible. </para>

                    <para>- I intend to vote for the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe,</inline> but against the main question when it is put, because I do not wish to see the agreement ratified. No State has. suffered, or is suffering more, on account of the action of the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company than is Queensland. For years after agreements had been entered into between the company and some of the other Colonies in the group, Queensland was paying double rates for every cable message which was sent direct therefrom. For instance, in Queensland the Government were paying, I think, 9s. 4d. a word, while in other States the Governments were paying about 4s. 7d. a word, simply because the former State stood out of the agreement) which was sought to be entered into by the company. I admit that most of the private cablegrams used to be sent from Queensland to Sydney, to be transmitted thence, but of course they were subject to the ordinary telegraphic charges between point and point. At the present time Queensland is paying about &#163;2,000 a year simply because it stood out, and wishing to do something to assist its people, constructed the cable which runs from Bundaberg to New Caledonia, and which was considered at that time to be the first link in a cable service to the States. But apart from all that, what we are asked by this agreement to do is to give to the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company something which they have never yet been able to obtain in Queensland, and that is the right to open offices to carry on their business as they have been able to do in other States. I for one decline to give the company any additional concession. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> says that this is a piece of Imperial Socialism, by which we are going to do something to benefit the Commonwealth. I share his belief ; but I do not think that we are going to attain our end by entering into an agreement with a company who have done everything in their power first to burk the construction of the Pacific Cable, and next to endeavour to get agreements made with the States and to make arrangements which would cripple that cable as far as possible. By giving the company further facilities, how do we assist the Pacific Cable? We are simply putting more obstacles in its way by ratifying this agreement. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. Although the honorable senator is a bit of a Socialist, yet he is afraid of competition, even with the wealth of the Commonwealth at our back. I take it that as business grew, people would be inclined to use the State-owned cable, but the honorable senator says that we should be afraid to compete with the other company on equal terms. I do not think that we should. What is the use of the honorable senator talking about Socialism when he suggests that a company could come along and wipe the floor with the Pacific Cable Company ? I do not believe that any company could. From New Zealand <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> has received reliable information to the effect that because the Pacific Cable Company have adopted business methods similar to those which are practised by their rivals, three cables are being sent by the former to one sent by the latter. If that can be done in New Zealand, it could be equally well done in Australia. There is no reason why better facilities should be given to the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company, nor is there any reason why two of the States which are already free from their thraldom should be dragged in by this agreement, when I believe that by remaining out and adopting other methods, we should be able to make the Pacific Cable a financial success, even to the detriment of the company who have had Australia in their grasp for many years. What object have we in view when we start an enterprise in connexion with the State? </para>

                <para class="block">If we are to immediately climb down when a private company comes along, it is of no use to advocate that the Commonwealth should enter into a business enterprise at all. We should leave Queensland free.- A very large proportion of Her business is now sent over the Pacific Cable. If business methods are adopted, there is no reason why the same thing should not be said of New South Wales. Victoria is at present free from the&#39; Eastern Extension Company, and if similar methods are adopted in this State, considering that the rates are the same, there is no reason why a very much larger share of Victorian business should not be sent over the Pacific Cable. </para>

                        <para>- There is a difference of 6d. per word on messages to the Continent of Europe, but the rates to Great Britain are the same. From information I have, I am aware that the Pacific Cable holds the record for the speedy transmission of messages, and that should certainly lead to increased business. Many years ago, communications were entered into between Queensland, New South Wales, and some of the other States, with the object of establishing the Pacific Cable, and we know that all the obstacles imaginable were thrown in the way of that proposal by interested parties. It was only when the Canadian Government took up the matter seriously, and sent representative men to Australia to interview the various Australian Governments in connexion with the matter, that any headway was made. I believe it was the visit of those Canadian representatives to Australia that enabled us to secure the construction of the Pacific Cable. Every one must know that so far nothing has <inline font-style="italic">beith</inline> done to induce people to use the Pacific Cable, whereas the Eastern Extension Company have canvassers out collecting cables from their customers, and have clerks employed to code messages. </para>

If they require that done, they must do it for themselves, or go to the Eastern Extension Company, who do it practically free of charge. We have no one going round to make known the facilities offered to people to use the Pacific Cable, whilst the Eastern Extension Company have canvassers amongst the various business places, endeavouring to secure business. The Eastern Extension Company are perfectly justified in adopting, these methods to increase their business, but the Commonwealth Government, as partners in a good concern, are not doing what lies in their power to make the business in which they ave interested a success. If this were a business concern in which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> held a third interest, I am sure the honorable senator would feel that he was bound to do all he could to make it a success. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, to free them at the end of ten years from now. But during that time, if Queensland and Victoria remain free and adopt business methods for improving the returns from the Pacific Cable, there is no reason why that cable should riot be_ doing considerably more than half of the total cable business of the Commonwealth. Why, then, should we seek to enter into any agreement with these people? The States were under no obligation to them, and the Pacific Cable would be able to take their business, and it is now taking the business of the New Zealand Government. In those circumstances, of what use to the Eastern Extension Company would be the agreements they have now with the four States? The States are not bound under their agreements with the company to pav them any compensation, or to treat with them in any way. The Governments of the States concerned are not compelled to use the Eastern Extension Company&#39;s cables, and they can send all their business over the Pacific Cable as soon as they please. There is no undertaking that any business, whether private or State, shall be sent by the Eastern Extension Company&#39;s lines. If this is Socialism, all right, but when we come into competition with a private <inline font-style="italic">company,</inline> I am one of those who believe that  with  the power of the State behind an enterprise the State is able to carry it through successfully, and to secure the bulk of the business. I intend to vote for the amendment, because I believe that it will improve the motion ; but I intend also, when the original question is put, to vote against it. </para>

                    <para>- I should like to say a few words on the amendment, especially as I desire to indicate my attitude not only towards the amendment, but towards the motion in its proposed amended form. It seems to me that if these amendments had not been proposed, the Commonwealth would have been committed to an agreement which, while it would have been of no value to it, would have been of very great value to the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company. That was quite sufficient for me in dealing with the original motion. I am glad that the Government, after making a strong attempt to resist the efforts made to put the proposed agreement in a proper form, have shown a disposition to agree that it should be amended. However, I wish to go further than is proposed by the amendment. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley,</inline> that this agreement should be thrown out. I shall vote for the amendment, because it will improve the agreement, but I shall vote against the motion, even if it should be amended in the way proposed. I should like to indicate briefly one of my reasons which, affects the State of  Tasmania.  Speaking from knowledge I obtained elsewhere, I say deliberately that if we refuse to ratify this agreement, the Government will be in a position to enter into negotiations with the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company, which are very likely to result in the remission of the penalty Tasmania has had to pay for so many years. If this agreement is not ratified, and the Government have any regard for the interests of Tasmania, they will be given a good opportunity to rectify a blunder, and to put Tasmania into  a  Federal position in this respect. I ask honorable senators from whatever State they come to consider the position. </para>

                <para class="block">Tasmania is paying the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company a subsidy of &#163;4,200 a year. If honorable senators representing other States do not care very much for Tasmania, I can safely assume that they would prefer to consider her interests rather than the interests of the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company. When I put my demand on that ground, they will admit that there is some force in it. If we can secure the rejection of this agreement, and the Government will take up my proposition, I have good reasons for believing that Tasmania may be relieved of this subsidy. As honorable senators are aware, it is not a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> contribution, and this subsidy of &#163;4,200 a year is levied on and paid by Tasmania alone. I may mention that Tasmania has herself granted facilities which have been to the advantage of the whole of the Commonwealth. It is not long since the Tasmanian Government recognised that the cable rates to and from that State, which were necessary, because of this subsidy, were rather heavy on people who wished to communicate with Tasmania from the mainland, and on Tasmanians who desired to communicate with the Continent. They decided to reduce the rates, and that resulted in benefit to the whole of the Commonwealth, while I admit that it also benefited Tasmanians. The Tasmanian Government undertook the responsibility of reducing the rates, but if they did so, they had to guarantee to the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company that its full receipts should be &#163;5,600 a year. That meant that if by the reduction of rates the receipts of the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company in Tasmania fell below &#163;1,400 - the difference between the amount of the subsidy and the total amount the Tasmanian Government made themselves liable for - they would have to make up the balance. In the circumstances, the Tasmanian Government have certainly some right to expect that the Commonwealth will&#39; pay some little regard to the interests of that State. </para>

                        <para>- I think that I can show that I am. The amendment has been moved in substitution for one which I drafted, and I say advisedly that if the amendment which I drafted had been carried, the agreement with Tasmania would have gone by the board, and certainly nothing could have suited me better. The amendment, as now proposed, leaves the agreement with Tasmania still in force. Although for that reason it is utterly unsatisfactory to me, I recognise that it will be for the benefit of the rest of the Commonwealth, as compared with the motion. I remind honorable senators that the agreement which we are asked to ratify recites other agreements than those to which .reference is made in the amendment. We have heard some talk with regard to the attitude of the Commonwealth, towards the two cable companies, and I point out that Agreement No. 8, recited in this agreement, is one which was entered into bv the State of South Australia since Federation, lt gives certain facilities to the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company, grants them / and, undertakes to build a wharf for them. find to deepen a channel. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> has told us that if we ratify this agreement, and limit the agreement to the period ending 19 1 5. the two agreements mentioned in the preamble will be superseded. But there are several other agreements concerning the leasing of portions of land and so forth&#39; which will still be in force. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> seems to have been misled by the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> as to the company carrying on business in the Commonwealth at- the end of 191 5. </para>

This Pacific Cable is a bit of State Socialism. It is owned by the Governments of Great Britain, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia. This cable will be one of the very channels of our commerce. It is a bit of State Socialism which has compelled a tyrant monopoly to bring down its rates from 9s, /)d. to 3s. a word. </para>

                        <para>- I am making these remarks for the benefit of honorable senators who think that the competition with the Eastern Extension Company will not still be in existence in 191 5. Let them consider the facilities which the company have been able to obtain from the present Commonwealth Government and the previous State Governments. No fewer than 467,493 words have been sent over the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company&#39;s Cable, as against 86,168 over the Pacific Cable. In New Zealand, however, where the Government is doing its duty by its partners, the Eastern. Extension Telegraph Company secured business to the extent of 79,213 words, whilst the Pacific Cable secured 285.744 words. Mark the difference ! </para>

                    <para>- It appears to me that we are going from bad to worse. We are discussing everything from Dan to Beersheba. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> has argued all round the universe, and I do not know what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> has not been doing. The matter is really not quite so involved as some have tried to make out. I do not think - as I believe some honorable senators know very well - that Australia, has benefited very much at the hands of the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company, and I am not at all overwhelmed with sympathy for that great concern. But at the same time I think we have to do what is best for the Commonwealth under the circumstances, and I fee&#39;&#39;, after weighing, as far as I have been able, the arguments that have been used, th:t it is to the advantage of Australia that the agreement should be ratified. </para>

                    <para>- When I submitted this motion this afternoon, I pointed out that so far from there being any necessity for making specific provision for the termination of the agreements that had been entered into between the States and the company, the Attorney-General had advised to the contrary. I read his opinion. But as the wish was expressed that there should be no doubt upon the subject, we gave way, and accepted an amendment. Now, we are blamed for giving way. We were blamed in the first instance for holding our opinion, and, secondly, we are blamed for accepting an amendment to make the matter sure. As to the chance of the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company being able to get a special wire to Brisbane if this agreement is carried out, I mav say that the company has to secure three times as much business in Brisbane as it did in 1902, before it can secure that facility. In1903 the amount of business done by the company in Brisbane was 24,064 words. In 1904 the amount was 1,711 words. There has, therefore, been a great falling off. It is not likely, therefore, that the increased business will be done in Queensland to secure the special wire that has been mentioned. I trust that honorable senators having assented to an amendment to make the agreement quite ciear, will be satisfied to ratify the agreement. </para>

I do not think that the company is specially anxious about the confirmation of this agreement, which I regard as an excellent compromise on the part of the Government to extricate us from a difficult position. As I read the agreement, if the Government desire to get any benefit from it at all, they will have to confirm it in exactly every word as it is printed. If the proposals before us be passed, the company will only have to refuse to consent to any fresh terms being imposed, with the result that the Government will not achieve what they regard as an excellent settlement of the trouble. </para>

                <para class="block">I did not avail myself of the opportunity to speak on the main question. I think we ought to congratulate ourselves that, after the debate of to-day, we have reached a position in which everything is actually as clear as mud - as easy to see through as a brick wall six feet thick. I take an exactly similar view to that entertained by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley.</inline> I shall,  of  course, support the amendment I now submit, but I shall then exercise my right  to  vote for wiping out the whole agreement. It has been submitted - very graciously, I think - by almost every honorable senator that four of the States are practically within the clutches of a great octopus, and must remain there for a considerable time yet. What that time will be none of us know. I am satisfied that the members of the Government themselves are by no means sure as to the road on which they are travelling. If there are four States in such a deplorable position, I cannot for the life of me see how we can work out their salvation by sending the other two States to perdition with them. That position seems about the most illogical that could possibly be taken up, and yet we are told that it represents the only hope for the four States. </para>

                        <para>- My remedy is to wipe out the whole agreement, and do our duty towards our own cable, allowing the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company to find their own feet. This agreement was signed irrevocably by the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company in 1903, the Commonwealth being left to accept or reject it at any time within a&#34; period from one to ten years, or, for aught we know, a hundred years. We are now at the end of 3 905., and this agreement was signed by. the Prime Minister, subject to the ratification of Parliament, early in 1903. Suppose, for argument sake, that we irrevocably ratify this agreement to-night, I desire to know whether the company will have the same option that we have had to regard it as a document which may be signed by them any time during the next five years, ten years, or hundred years. It is evident that everything in connexion with this cable business has been done in the most slipshod fashion, and nobody will take any responsibility. The matter has been done, and the agreement is simply there for us to accept or reject. That is a most cruel way to submit important business to an assembly of men who have to look after the welfare of the several States. I submit the amendment in order to make sure that, if the agreement is ratified, there shall be no uncertainty - that the company shall not be allowed to regard it as an agreement which may be signed in generations that are to come. </para>

                    <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> has raised an important point, which I think has been overlooked bv the Government; and I feel sure that the amendment will be accepted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> as one that is eminently reasonable. In March, i&#39;903, this agreement was signed by the Prime Minister, subject to the ratification of Parliament ; but the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company signed it irrevocably without any conditions. It was competent for the Commonwealth to refuse to ratify or to ratify that agreement immediately, or in one year, or ten years. To use a colloquialism, we had the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company &#34;on toast.&#34; It occurs to me, however, that, conversely, the company might get the Commonwealth &#34;on toast,&#34; if we ratify this agreement unconditionally. The company may take up the position that they can keep the agreement beside them,, and sign it when they please, in order to see how the enterprise works, and then, in two or three years- </para>

                        <para>- It appears to me that the company might, under the circumstances, accept or reject the agreement whenever they liked, within a reasonable time. What objection can there be to the amendment? It is quite possible that the manager of the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company may send this agreement to London to receive the assent of their Board at the head office. But surely they can &#34;do that within a space of four months. No doubt <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> worded his amendment with the object of giving the manager plenty of time in which to obtain the assent of the head office. It merely says that with&#39;in three months from the 1st of January next the company must accept the agreement, otherwise it shall lapse. It practically means that the company cannot hang up the agreement and say, &#34; We shall do as you have done. Within a period of two and a half years you have not intimated your decision to us, and now we are going to see how the cat will jump - how the thing will work out - and when it suits us we shall sign the document ; but if at that time it should not suit us, we shall not sign it.&#34; I think that the Minister will agree to the amendment. </para>

                    (South Australia - Minister of Defence). - I do not think that I can agree to the amendment, because it is only fair to treat the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company in the same way as they have treated us. The agreement was entered into subject to ratification by Parliament ; but in two years there has been no ratification, and the company has never made the slightest objection. If the agreement be ratified with the amendment asked for, the result will be that within a reasonable time the company will have to sign it, and the Government will take care that they do; but they are not going to tie themselves up to three or four months.

                        <para>- I suppose that there are certain ways in which we could compel the company to sign the agreement. I do not think we ought to be unreasonable. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson,</inline> who has moved the amendment, intends, if it be carried, to vote against the motion. Therefore, I do not look upon the amendment as a serious one. I now come to a serious point, which has been raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best.</inline> He has pointed out that, in consequence of the variation of clause 25 of the agreement, the company will have the power of saying, &#34;All right; we shall not accept it.&#34; I want them to be placed in that position. We have said all through that the agreement contains a provision that the agreements which have been entered into with the States shall not be revived. The Government believe that to be the proper interpretation of the clause. The Attorney-General holds that opinion. But some doubts have been expressed on the other side, and we have taken them into our consideration. We have put in clause 25 words which make absolutely clear the interpretation we put on the agreement, and if the company refuse to sign it, then we shall say that they were playing false with us from the very first. They will have admitted that they had up their sleeves something which they ought not to have had there, and that they were trying to get an unfair advantage from the Government. </para>

If they do not at once sign the agreement they will enjoy all the facilities which they would get thereunder. They may wait a year still enjoying all those facilities, and something may then- turn up which we cannot foresee, and which may induce them to back down. It is because I wish to prevent that that I intend to support the amendment.
