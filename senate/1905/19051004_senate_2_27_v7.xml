                    <para>In attention to the request of the Honorable the President for information as to the practicability of complying with the requests of Senators for an earlier supply of the reports of Friday's Debates in the Senate, I have the honour to state that similar requests by Members of the House of Representatives have been met by the issue early on Wednesday morning of corrected "proofs" upon galley slips. Many Members of both Houses strongly object to any circulation, however limited, of proofs unrevised either by themselves or by the Reporting Staff. It would therefore be impracticable to arrange for their issue before Wednesday. Galley slips could then be regularly supplied to any <inline font-weight="bold">Senator requiring</inline> them. </para>

One of the emigrants, John Stagg, stated that a number of the settlers on the northern rivers were dissatisfied with their lot, and would clear out if they only knew where to go. He was brought up on the land. He had seven sons and two married daughters. 'Some of my sons,' he said, 'have arrived at man's estate, and I have tried to get land for them to select and start in life on; but I have found many obstacles in the way of a man anxious to get a decent piece of land, and have decided now to go to South America, in the hope of getting there what is denied me in my own country. I have no fault to find with this country as a country. There is abundance of splendid land in the State; but it is not get-at-table by men who could turn it to account. Ever since I can remember, I have heard the cry of Land Reform, but it has never been more than a politician's cry. The majority of people in the part of the country I came from are dissatisfied with the conditions under which they toil. Living conditions in South America can hardly be any worse than here, and may be decidedly better' " ? </para>

                    <para>- In my view this is one of the most important clauses in the Bill, because it proposes to make our law entirely subsidiary to the Imperial Act dealing with copyright. In fact, if the clause is to remain as it stands the time which we have bestowed upon the Bill will have been so much time wasted, because the Imperial Act would apply without it. And if the Imperial law is to run concurrently with our law, and the latter is to be merely subsidiary to the former, I do not see the necessity for its enactment. I believe it to be exceedingly desirable that we should assert our full power of self-government, as granted in section 51 of the Constitution Act, and I entirely dissent from the view that our legislation must be either subsidiary to, or merely concurrent with, Imperial legislation. Further, if we do not take steps to protect our right of self-government in every matter, the probable result will be that it will be either filched from us or pared away until there will be practically very little left. I take it that it is the business of the Parliament of Australia to jealously safeguard this right and to be in no respect subsidiary to any other Parliament. I ask honorable senators to recollect that the Constitution, which gives us power to legislate with regard to copyright, is an Imperial Act, and that the Imperial Parliament has given us full power to deal with copyright in common with other matters. I shall be extremely delighted to find the Ministry - who for the time being are the guardians of the Constitution, and who, subject to Parliament, are also the guardians of the rights of the people of Australia, whom they are called upon to govern - adopting the attitude which was taken up by the Government of Canada in reference to the Canadian Copyright Bill of 1889. I should like Ministers to approach the consideration of this matter from the Australian, and not from the English point of view. The Government of Canada fought the Imperial Government on this matter, and the rights of the Canadian Parliament were fully conceded to them. </para>

                        <para>- If honorable senators will turn to the discussion which took place between, the Canadian Government and the Imperial Parliament, at the time the Canadian Act of 1889' was in dispute, they will find it to be most interesting reading. A statement put before, the Imperial authorities by the Canadian Minister of Justice will well repay perusal. I do not intend to quote largely from it, but there are one or two passages which I would like to cite for the information of the Committee. The document from which I quote will be found amongst trie parliamentary papers of the House of Commons for the year 1895, vol. 70. It is a despatch sent to the Colonial Office by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> S. D. Thompson, who, as I have said, was the Canadian Minister of Justice, and who in this document has asserted the Canadian right to legislate upon this subject. After referring to an adverse opinion expressed bv the law advisers of the British Government, he says in paragraph 29 of his despatch : - </para>
                    </talk.start>
                </continue>
                <para>In face of such eminent authorities he would hardly venture to press upon the attention of Her Majesty's Government the view of the Canadian Government which he has above presented if it were not, to his mind, perfectly plain that the people of Canada would hold him culpable if he failed to assert what was the only interpretation under which they received the Constitution, and under which they were willing to be content with that Constitution. </para>
                <para class="block">He there points out that the only interpretation of their Constitution which the Canadian people would be willing to accept, was that they had a full right to legislate upon the subject of copyright. He then proceeds to cite judicial decisions in support of his view that the Constitution Act gave full power to the Canadian Parliament to legislate exclusively upon- all matters referred to in section 91 of that Act, which is similar to section 51 of our Constitution. He points out that the section is part of an Imperial Act, and that the Canadian people insisted that it gave them full plenary powers to legislate upon every matter which was thus brought under the authority of the Dominion Government. I should like very much indeed to see the Australian Government and the Australian Parliament take up a similar attitude. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Thompson goes on to say in paragraph 43 of his despatch : - </para>
                <para>If the view which His Lordship takes is correct, it will be impossible for the Parliament of Canada to make laws in regard to any one of the twenty-one subjects which constitute the " area " of the Canadian Parliament when such legislation is repugnant to any legislation which existed previously, applicable to these subjects in the colonies. </para>
                <para class="block">In that passage he emphasizes the view that if the Canadian Government gave away anyone of its powers, it might be demanded that it should give away them all. Exactly the same remark applies to us. If we give away one iota of the full and plenary powers conferred upon us by the Constitution, we are likely to have them filched from us, and our right of self-government so pared down and1 refined that practically it will not exist at all. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Thompson points out frequently in this despatch, that the Canadian Parliament, in respect of every one of the matters referred to it by section 91 of the Constitution, has full plenary powers to legislate, that the Act conferring the powers was passed by the Imperial Parliament, and, further, that the Canadian Parliament, or any other Parliament, constituted by Imperial Act, could not, in any respect, be said to have delegated powers, but powers that were full and complete. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Thompson goes on, in clause 45 of the despatch, to say : - </para>
                <para>It is respectfully submitted that, in respect to all these subjects, the Parliament of Canada must be considered to have the plenary powers of the Imperial Government (to quote the words of the Judicial Committee), subject only to such control as the Imperial Parliament exercise from time to time, and subject also to Her Majesty's right of disallowance, which the British North American Act reserves to her, and which no one doubts, will always be exercised with full regard to constitutional principles and in the best interests of the Empire when exercised at all. </para>
                <para class="block">Honorable senators will notice the language used in that passage. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Thompson points out that the Imperial Parliament can only exercise its controlling powers by a specific Act of Parliament, and, further, that the only right of veto or disallowance is that which is possessed by the Crown - a right that can be exercised in reference to Imperial Acts, in common with all other Acts passed by a Parliament within the Empire. That is a power which no one intends to dispute, and which we must all recognise. His Majesty, for the time being, has power to disallow an English Act, or an Act of ours, or an Act of any other Parliament constituted under the Crown. But notwithstanding that power of disallowance, our right to legislate upon the subject of copyright in common with all the other subjects enumerated in section 51 of the Constitution, is in no degree impaired nor is our legislation rendered subservient to any Act passed by the Imperial Parliament, in paragraph 34 of his despatch, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Thompson says - </para>

                    Thompson, in that paragraph, points out that any power which the Imperial Parliament may possess, must be enjoyed under an Act passed subsequent to the passing of the British North America Act, which is the Constitution Act of Canada; and that therefore the Canadian Parliament possesses full and absolute rights to legislate on all the matters referred to it under section 91 of that Act, which, as I have indicated, is similar to section 51. of our Constitution. That is the attitude which I should like to see the Commonwealth Government take up in this matter. I should like to see them assert our full right of self-government just as the Canadian. Government did. I am exceedingly jealous of our right of self-government. If we are going to permit it to be limited in such a way as is proposed - making an Act of ours which is within the area of our jurisdiction merely subservient to an Imperial Act - we may have it practically taken from us. I have framed an amendment which meets my views, and if it is passed, it will be necessary to make an amendment in clause 60, which I understand the Minister will be willing to recommit for the purpose. My amendment will not injuriously affect : any rights which are possessed under the Imperial Act. It will leave them as they are. It will not impair or injure the property of any holder of a copyright, or performing right. But it will assert our right to say that our authority to legislate on the subject of copyright which is intrusted to us by section 51 of our Constitution is supreme. Further than that, it sets out in the first line that the Imperial Act within this Commonwealth is subject to our Act. That is the position which I wish to emphasize. I have no desire to labour the point., I think that the reasons which I have enumerated are sufficient. I have shown that the Canadian people, at the time they were dealing with a similar subject, maintained their right in conflict with the Imperial Parliament after a very long discussion. I hold that the same reasons are applicable to our situation .: and I trust that honorable senators will agree with me that we ought not to legislate upon this subject at all, without asserting our full and complete right to legislate altogether independently of legislation which has been passed, or which may be passed, relevant to this subject, by the Imperial Parliament. I beg to move -

I hope that whatever attitude the Committee may exhibit towards the principle contained in it they certainly will not give it their support. I take it from what the honorable senator has said that he is motived by a; desire to jealously guard the self-governing rights which we enjoy. I, for, one - an3 I think every other honorable senator - will not yield place to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> in that jealous regard. I believe that in passing our legislation we shall always exercise a jealous care to maintain the rights of self-government, which we enjoy. </para>

                        <para>- We are not making our Act subject to the Imperial Act at all. We are doing nothing of the kind. But we must face the position exactly as it is; and in the enactments which we put upon the statute-book we must have regard to the position we occupy in relation to Great Britain. The honorable senator has made special reference to the case of Canada. He has cited the Canadian Constitution in connexion with Canadian copyright legislation, and urged that the Australian Government should follow Canada's example. But I would point out that the position of Canada is totally different in this regard from the position of Australia. In this and in many other matters Canada's peculiar situation calls for special consideration. She is situated immediately north of the great rival of Great Britain - the United States ; and those who know anything about the history of copyright legislation in Canada are aware that the whole of the agitation originated in the peculiar set of circumstances that arose from this proximity. </para>

                        <para>- I shall deal in detail with that matter directly. The circumstances are as I have indicated; and the people mainly responsible for the agitation in Canada were not the general public, but those interested in the printing and publishing of books. I go even further, and say that if it were competent for us to legislate as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> proposes by his amendment, and we were to do so, we should be doing something distinctly disadvantageous. Copyright legislation occupies a peculiar position. It is one of the subjects of legislation provided for in what may be called the thirty-nine articles of section 51 of our Constitution, in regard to which we should, as a matter of policy, as far as possible, work with the United Kingdom, even if we were not compelled to do so by force of circumstances. The whole trend of legislation on the subject of copyright has, of late years, been towards international ism. I contend that the interests of authors, and of all concerned in the community, are better regarded by viewing this subject from the international, rather than from the local stand-point. I only say this in connexion with the possible position - which, I contend, does not exist - that we have power to legislate in. this way. It is not for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens,</inline> or any other honorable senator in supporting this motion, to bring into the discussion such terms as " subserviency " and so forth ; we are compelled to accept the position as it is. Although <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> would have the Committee believe that Canada asserted the principle, and that the principle has been maintained, I venture to say that the honorable senator is the only authority in the Commonwealth, or outside, who would be bold enough to make that unqualified assertion. </para>

                        <para>- But the honorable senator goes further, and deals with copyright which, though enjoyed here, has been acquired outside the Commonwealth by virtue of Imperial legislation. According to section 51 of the Constitution, we have power to make laws regarding copyright. The effect of this is not to confer on the Commonwealth any power not enjoyed in Australia before, but simply to apportion- the existing legislative power which was before vested in the several States. That is how the Constitution has to be read. This1 article of that measure is not to be regarded as a grant to us by the Imperial Parliament of the powers which the Imperial Parliament previously held in reserve for itself, but simply as an apportionment of the powers separately and severally enjoyed previously by the States - as giving to the Commonwealth the sum total, or aggregate, of those powers. Nothing more is intended than to combine and make Federal the powers previously held by the States. Before 'Federation, an excellent hand-book on the subject of Imperial law as applicable in Victoria, was published bv <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thomas</inline> Prout Webb, who deals with this matter, not in the heat of controversy, but calmly and judicially. That hand-book was published in 1892, and shows the position with regard to copyright in Victoria. As I have argued, the Constitution confers no extended legislative powers, but simply allocates the pre-existing powers of the States in a different way. At page 127, in his edition of 1892, Webb says, in Note V.- </para>

I have already urged in my opening remarks that even if we had exclusive jurisdiction it would probably be unwise for us to take advantage of it, or to set up a separate system, because we would be denying to our own authors and bur own reading public the benefits to be derived from the international treatment of the whole subject.

To come a little closer to Canada and to the curious position which she occupies, and which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> would have us try and get ourselves into, I would point out that in a very recent book which I have had the opportunity and advantage of quoting previously in this Committee, and an edition of which was brought out only last year - I refer to <inline font-style="italic">Copinger's</inline><inline font-style="italic">Law of Copyright</inline> - the author deals somewhat extensively with the position.

For over half a century the copyright laws have been a constant source of friction between Canada and the mother country, and the trouble does not appear even yet to have been finally removed. </para>

                <para>It must be remembered that the Imperial Copyright Act of 1842 confers upon any person first publishing in the United Kingdom copyright, not only in the United Kingdom, but in the colonies and the dominions of the Crown. It seems to have been considered in Canada that the Act of 1875 virtually repealed the Act of 1842 so far as it concerned that colony, and that, consequently, Canadian publishers were free to republish English copyright books in Canada without any consideration whatever, but this idea was dissipated by the decision in <inline font-style="italic">Smiles</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Belford.</inline></para>
                <para>This case is referred to in the Ontario Reports for 1877, page 436, and a later case is reported in the Ontario Reports for 1900, vol. 32, page 393. <inline font-style="italic">Copinger</inline> goes on to say - </para>
                <para>This Imperial -Act is therefore in force in Canada - bearing out exactly what the Court in Ontario said in the case of <inline font-style="italic">Black</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">The Imperial Book Company -</inline> and by section 17 of that Act it is forbidden to import into Canada or any other part of the British Dominions a work copyrighted in the United Kingdom. Canada, however, having taken advantage of the Foreign Reprints Act, this prohibition was suspended. </para>
                <para class="block">It was expressly suspended because advantage was taken of the Foreign Reprints Act, by which the importation of reprints was allowed on condition that a certain percentage or charge in the nature of an import duty was made the proceeds from which were to go to the authors. Even that proved to be a source of trouble between Canada and the mother country, because it Was urged that the Canadian authorities did not always collect the duty, and in consequence authors did not always get what they were entitled to. On the next page the author says - </para>
                <para>The state of the law as to copyright gave great dissatisfaction to Canadian p'rinters and publishers. They complained that they were damaged, on the one hand; by authors belonging to the United States publishing in Great Britain, and thus securing copyright in Canada, and, on the other hand, by British authors making arrangements with United States publishers whereby the latter secured the Canadian as well as the United States market, the consequence being Canada was flooded with cheap -American reprints which Canada had no power to exclude, to the great detriment of their trade. </para>
                <para>And I ask honorable senators to mark this- </para>
                <para>The Berne Convention only added to these grievances; as it enlarged the class of persons who could obtain copyright in Canada without republishing there. </para>
                <para>Canada actually wished Great Britain to allow her to be excluded from the operation of the Berne Convention. Then after dealing with the Act of 1889 - the Act of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> has spoken so highly - and giving the substance of it, the writer of this work goes on to say - </para>
                <para>The passing of this Act - conceived in the interests rather of Canadian printers and publishers than of either authors or the reading public - led to a long and bitter controversy between Canada and the mother country, which was not terminated till the year 1900. It does not fall within the province of this work to enter into the merits of this controversy, but the home Government resolutely refused to give its necessary assent to the Act, and the Act never became effective law. </para>
                <para class="block">It was passed by the Canadian Parliament, but was never assented to. <inline font-style="italic">Copinger</inline> further says - </para>
                <para>When, in the year 1891, after the passing of the United States Act, known as the Chace Act, British authors were enabled to obtain copyright in the United States <inline font-style="italic">on</inline> condition that they printed and published there, the discontent of the Canadian publishers was greatly increased. </para>

                <para>At length, in the year 1900, a compromise was effected, and the assent of the Crown was given to a Dominion Act amending the Copyright Act 1S86. </para>
                <para class="block">Then at page 521, and this is the last extract I shall quote from <inline font-style="italic">Copinger</inline> on the subject, dealing with the Copyright Act of 1900, he concludes by saying - </para>
                <para>This Act applies to books only, and, further, only to books that are copyright in Canada, for the' " Copyright Act " mentioned in section 1 means the Canadian Copyright Act of 1886. The objectionable feature of the 1889 Act, whereby an author practically would have lost his copyright in Canada, unless "he acquired local copyright also, is removed. The Act does not touch Imperial copyright, and whether a British author takes advantage of the Act or not rests entirely with himself. </para>
                <para class="block">This is the Act by which, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens,</inline> Canada practically asserted a plenary power in the Canadian Parliament to deal with copyright, <inline font-style="italic">Copinger</inline> says - </para>
                <para>If he desires to do so, he must make arrangement with a local publisher, and a special Canadian edition must be printed in Canada, though the type need not be set there. _ Thereupon the Canadian publisher will acquire local copyright for the Canadian edition, and the author, or anybody else, will be prohibited from importing copies of the work into Canada, but, otherwise, the authors of Imperial copyright will not be affected. If, on the other hand, the author does not desire to take advantage of the Act of 1900, that Act has no effect upon his rights whatsoever. </para>
                <para>The Act has, it is believed, worked satisfactorily in practice, but, unfortunately, a section of the Canadian printing and publishing houses do not appear to be yet satisfied, and there are indications of another agitation in favour of the more stringent provisions of the Act of 1889. </para>
                <para>Canada is not a party to the British Copy, right Treaty with Austria. </para>
                <para class="block">Incidentally I might mention that none of <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> Australian States is a party to that treaty either. The whole of these references go to show that the Dominion Parliament has not successfully asserted the right to plenary power equal to that of the Imperial Parliament in dealing with this subject. They show that there has been a great deal of trouble between the Canadian and Imperial Parliaments, and that the great cause of the trouble has been the proximity of the United States and the action from time to time of United States printers and publishers. They show, also, that the people most interested in fomenting the agitation and keeping alive the trouble have been the printers and publishers of Canada, and, as <inline font-style="italic">Copinger</inline> says, the Canadian Acts have been framed with a greater regard for their interests than for the interests of either authors or reading public. Recent negotiations between Great Britain and Canada go to show that the Act of 1889 derived no force or effect until the compromise effected between the two countries, as the result of which the more stringent and objectionable provisions of the Canadian Act were deleted. The present position under the Act of 1900 is that Canada does not in any way attempt to assert her right to control or affect Imperial copyrights. In 1902 an edition of MacGillivray's work, <inline font-style="italic">The Law of Copyright,</inline> was published. In this work the author deals briefly with Canada, and I quote two extracts bearing on the question. He says, at page 188 - </para>

                <para class="block">Honorable senators will remember that on the second reading of this Bill I indicated that, in consequence of legislation passed by Canada, which gave rise to some doubt as to whether it was within the competency of the Canadian Parliament, the Imperial Parliament had to pass a special Act providing that Her Majesty's Assent might be given to it. As mentioned here, that was necessary " to resolve doubts which would otherwise have arisen as to whether the Canadian Copyright Act was not repugnant to the provisions of the Foreign Reprints Act 1847, and the order in council thereunder applicable to Canada.

                <para class="block">That is all we propose to do in connexion with this Bill. In the main this measure affirms in a legislative form certain provisions which are in many instances taken from Imperial Acts, and in other instances from decisions which have been given by the Courts. There will be no necessity for persons working under the Act to have any recourse to Imperial statutes. But if the Imperial statutes which at the inception of the Commonwealth had force and effect throughout His Majesty's dominions, should in any particular! be in conflict with, or should not be touched by, our legislation, then they will have force and effect. </para>

In addition, we have expressed in legislative form the decisions upon most important principles which have been given, and followed repeatedly until they are well-established law. So far as other matters are concerned, these are the cases for which the Bill provides. There are certain Acts of the Imperial Parliament, notably the Act of 1842, which provide that upon the fulfilment of certain conditions copyright shall be obtained throughout the British Empire; we cannot derogate from that right. The Act of 1842 made it necessary for a man to publish! in Great Britain, in order to get copyright throughout the British dominions. But the Act of 1886 affirmed this principle : That if a man published his book in any part of Her Majesty's dominions, he should get copyright throughout <inline font-style="italic">them.</inline> In this clause we are simply saying that those rights shall not be in any way lessened.

                        <para>- I am certain that these rights cannot be lessened. If we were to insert this amendment, and affirm that hereafter it would; not be competent for the Imperial Parliament to pass a Copyright Bill which should have force throughout the British dominions, we should be taking up a position which we could not sustain. Canada was forced - bv a combination of circumstances, perhaps - to take up the attitude she did-. Set far from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> being right in connexion with the result of her action, the authorities I have quoted go to show that he has not been fully informed of all the circumstances, and that the difficulty, so far as Canada is concerned, has not yet been overcome, that her law is not in the satisfactory state which my honorable friend thinks it is, and that the assertion of plenary power in this matter has been met by continued and successful opposition on the part of the Home authorities. If we had the power to establish a separate system of copyright for Australia, given the circumstances in which we are placed, we should be very unwise indeed if we were to exercise that power. We should fake advantage of the relations which exist between the principal countries of the world, except, perhaps, the United States, which, be it said, has had to climb out of her, isolated position. By the Chace Act of 1891, the United States has empowered the President to declare that certain countries are, so to speak, most favoured countries, and that the residents thereof shall be able to obtain copyright in the United States on the same terms as individuals, or residents of the latter. In pursuance of that power, the President has declared Great Britain to be one of those countries. Under our present circumstances an author who brings out his work in Australia is entitled to copyright, not simply in Australia, but throughout His Majesty's dominions, Germany, France, and every other country which is a party to the Berne Convention. We, on the other hand, have to reciprocate. Great Britain on behalf of the British dominions reciprocated, and since then she has been a party to the Convention of Paris, by which, too, I think we are bound. She also made a separate Convention with Austria-Hungary, and expressly excluded from its operation the whole of the then six Australian Colonies, the Colonies of the Cape and Canada. Then there is the Act of 1886, in which the Imperial Parliament expressly declared the power of Colonial Legislatures to deal with the subject of copyright, but only in a limited way. We can best deal with the subject if it is regarded entirely from the international, and not purely from the local stand-point. </para>

                    <para>- The position in which we find ourselves in regard to the clause is in a sense interesting, but from another point of view it is almost} ludicrous. If we inserted this amendment, it would be worth nothing, and even if inserted it would be a disadvantage to Australia if it could have effect. No provision in the Bill could take away from or lessen the protection which is enjoyed under any Act of the Imperial Parliament in force in the Commonwealth. Therefore the clause is absolutely redundant and unnecessary, because, if omitted, the rights which it seeks to protect would still be safeguarded. I am prepared to vote with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> to strike out the clause, but I cannot assist him to insert any provision in place of it. </para>

                    a very long and interesting disquisition, which did not strike me as being of particular point in regard to the amendment. He seems to be so desirous of protecting his little bantling that he immediately kicks up a terrific dust when any one approaches it, even with friendly intentions. His speech would be all right if delivered by a member of the Imperial Parliament who was jealous of the Imperial power, but it is not all right when it is delivered in the Australian Parliament by one who apparently is willing to give away, or allow to be filched, a power which has been conferred upon us by an Imperial Act. When the Minister was trying to refute mv statement that we should adopt the same attitude as Canada, in order to assert our plenary power to deal with this subject, his only argument was that the two positions were entirely different, that Canada was forced into that position by reason of her proximity to the United States, and her liability to be constantly flooded; with cheap literary productions from that source.

If we take up the position which he desires us to assume in this case, that fact will be used against us when we attempt 'to 'legislate on other subjects. The honorable and learned senator said that where an Imperial Act applied to the British dominions, before our Constitution Act was passed, we have no power to enact any provisions which would conflict therewith. Take the position of any State before the Commonwealth was established. The criminal law of England applied to every Colony in Australia before it was presented with a Constitution. Does the criminal law of the Imperial law apply now to the States? No. </para>

                        <para>- The criminal law of England applies to every part of the British dominions, whether it has powers of self-government or not, until it is superseded by local law. It will be just the same with our copyright law if we only have the pluck to assert our position. The Imperial Act will apply in just the same way where it is not in conflict with our Act, but the latter will be supreme on the particular matters with which it deals. I maintain that, subject to our Act, the Imperial law should apply with full force, as it does to-day. But it must be subject to our Act, and wherever our Act is in conflict with the Imperial law ours must apply. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> also urged that we should work in with the Imperial Government. I have no objection to do so, and my amendment does not assert the contrary. If it is carried, there will be nothing to prevent us working in with, the Imperial Government. But we should be in a position to work in with it as a Commonwealth possessing independent powers, not as a mere fag end of the British Empire, having no rights except of a subsidiary nature. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> quoted a great authority in opposition to my argument - Professor Harrison Moore. But what that ,T great authority" said was that our power was "apparently" limited. He did not assert that our power was actually limited. If this great authority, who is evidently in favour of limiting our power by making the Imperial Act always supreme, can say no more than that our power is " apparently " limited, I do not think that the argument amounts to much. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> also quoted the case of our power to legislate in regard to bankruptcy. But, as a matter of fact, the English bankruptcy law does not apply even in the States. Until" the States' laws were passed, the British Bankruptcy Act did apply ; but after they were passed the States' laws were supreme and the Imperial law was superseded. What position would the Commonwealth be in if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> were right? If, in relation to the fifty-one subjects which have been relegated to us, we had merely a subsidiary power, I maintain that our right of self-government is a myth, and that this Parliament would be nothing better than a farce. The time that we have spent on this Copyright Bill would be wasted, because the Imperial Act would remain in operation even if it did not become law. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> says that the Imperial authorities were all against the opinion expressed by the Canadian Minister of Justice. Of course they were, because they were jealous of their own powers and privileges. But after the Canadian Minister had argued the matter with them for some time, and after representations had been made to the Imperial authorities - which are on record - the Imperial Parliament passed a special Act enabling the Royal Assent to be given to the Canadian Copyright Act of 1889. That was not done because it was absolutely necessary ; but, as was admitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> himself, the special Act was passed to remove any doubts that might arise. So that it is admitted that there was a doubt as to whether it was necessary to pass the special Act. Towards the close of his argument, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> said that it would be competent for the Imperial Parliament hereafter to pass an Act dealing with copyright, and that, therefore, if my amendment were carried we should be asserting something which was not correct. So that it appears that, notwithstanding that we are attempting to legislate with regard to copyright, the Imperial Parliament can pass an Act which will largely nullify ours. If that be so, our authority to deal with the subject is a farce. </para>

                        <para>- If it were attempted - although I must scout the possibility of it - I venture to say that it would require the assent of the Australian people before it became effective, just as an Act of the Australian Parliament requires the assent of the Crown ; and I am perfectly certain that the people of Australia would not assent to it. Therefore, an Act of that sort would have to be backed up by force, and that is a position which I do not think any one desires to see. I unhesitatingly say that full powers of self-government have been granted to us by an (Imperial Act, and embodied in our Constitution, which enables us to legislate upon all the matters mentioned in section 51, and upon all other matters which are referred to as being- within the area of our jurisdiction. We shall be false to the trust imposed in us by the people of this country if we do not assert to the full the powers that we possess, or if we allow it to be supposed that our powers are merely subservient to those of the Imperial Parliament in respect of the legislative functions intrusted to us. </para>

While it is perfectly true that we have certain rights conferred upon us by our Constitution, we have to recognise that those rights were given by an Act passed by a Parliament which stands supreme in all matters connected with the British dominions. Whatever legislation we may pass can be disallowed by the Crown within a certain limited period. This Commonwealth has no power to enter into treaties or conventions with foreign nations. That power is reserved for the Imperial authority alone ; and while we remain a portion of the British Empire any treaty or convention that Great Britain may enter into is binding upon us, whether we like it or not.

                        <para>.- The British Government can do so if it thinks fit. The honorable senator misconstrued what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> said when he attempted to make it appear that he had stated that it was impossible for us to pass any legislation in opposition to legislation passed in Great Britain. He has quoted the criminal law and the navigation laws, and has pointed out that, with regard to those matters, this Parliament can alter the law as it stands in Great Britain. That is perfectly true. But there is no treaty between Great Britain and foreign powers, binding the whole of the British Empire, in respect of those matters, nor did the Imperial Parliament when passing_legislation in reference to them declare that the Imperial law was to be binding upon the whole of His Majesty's dominions. But in reference to copyright and performing right the Imperial Government has, under a convention, entered into obligations with foreign nations, and it would be utterly impossible for us to go behind the convention. To do so would be for a subordinate Parliament to destroy an engagement entered into by the Imperial Government itself. That can only be done by the Imperial Parliament. We must remember that whatever powers we enjoy have been conferred upon us, and that those powers cannot be exercised in derogation of treaties entered into by the Imperial authorities with foreign powers. Were it otherwise, the whole Empire would be thrown into a state of ferment, in the event of any treaty being made by the British Government with a foreign Government. A part of the Empire might say, " We are not going to be bound by this ; this little portion of the Empire is going to be lopped off." Under such circumstances a foreign nation would feel that it was no use to enter into a treaty with a power which could not control its own subjects. </para>

                        <para>.-Then those self-governing portions are expressly excepted. In the convention entered into with Austria-Hungary, it is expressly provided that the provisions shall not be applicable to self-governing States; and we could clearly do anything we liked in regard to that country. But I am quite clear, and I feel sure that' <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> must, in his own mind, be convinced, that we cannot interfere with a treaty that has been entered into by the Imperial authorities and other nations - a treaty which the Imperial authorities declare is binding on all British subjects. Whether it is necessary to insert the clause suggested, is another question. My own opinion is that it is not. We might insert this, or any other provision, but if it should prove to derogate from an Imperial treaty from which we were not expressly excluded, it would not be worth the paper on which it was written. It is certain that the Royal Assent would not be given here to a measure containing such a provision ; it would be reserved, and sent Home, where it would be quietly put on one side. The time and trouble devoted would have been wasted. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> may think that, under such conditions, it is utterly useless to have a Parliament in Australia. There are, however, numbers of subjects which are absolutely under the control of the Australian Parliament, and. in regard to which the Imperial authorities would never attempt to interfere. But once Great Britain has entered into a treaty with foreign nations, the Australian Parliament has no more power to interfere, than would a municipality or any local governing body in Great Britain itself. </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator KEATING</inline>
                    (Tasmania- Honorary Minister). - I understand, that in the legislation of the States, in many instances, a provision of the kind I suggested has been inserted. I do not know what the origin of this course was, but in the Western Australian Copyright Act of 1878, and in the Victorian Copyright Act of 1890, there is, in each case, a clause declaring that nothing in the Act shall be deemed to affect the law of copyright " applicable to this Colony by any Imperial statute now in force." It is common to have a provision of the kind in many other State enactments, which deal with matters likely to be the subject of Imperial legislation. The amendment proposed by Senator Givens will not affect the purpose that the honorable senator intends, and may very seriously embarrass us in getting the Bill assented to by the Crown. There is another argument which may be advanced against the amendment. In Tasmania, and also, I believe, in Queensland, there is no separate State copyright legislation, all copyrights being enjoyed by virtue of Imperial legislation. The only piece of copyright legislation in Tasmania is the Newspaper Copyright Act, and in Queensland, I think, copyright is mainly dependent on Imperial statutes, Under the circumstances, rights enjoyed in either of these States under Imperial enactments, could be lessened according to the amendment.

                    <para>- We have invested certain States Courts with Federal jurisdiction, but I am not sure that it is right to say that an appeal under this clause should be to the High Court only, for that is what it means. The Minister might consider whether it would not be well to provide an intervening Court of Appeal between the Court to which application is made in the first instance, and the Federal High Court. </para>

                        <para>- I think so. Such applications as are contemplated under this clause are not very often made. A State Court, in exercising jurisdiction under this Bill would be exercising a Federal jurisdiction directly under an Act of the Federal Parliament. I think it is desirable that finality in such cases should be reached as soon as possible, and therefore that the appeal should be direct to the High Court. Probably no one is better aware than is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> that we have similar provisions in our Mining Companies Acts for the rectification of registers. I think, speaking from memory, that under the Tasmanian law an appeal in the case of an application for the rectification of a register of a company is made direct to a Judge of the Supreme Court, or to the Court itself. </para>

                        <para>- No; but I think there should not be too many steps in a case like this, especially where we are expressly conferring a statutory Federal jurisdiction upon a State Court. I think it is desirable that the appeal should be direct to the High Court. I might mention that in the first instance it was thought that perhaps the application should be to the High Court, but I think it is desirable that every facility should be given in this case, and therefore provision is made that the application may be made to the Supreme Court of any. State or a Judge thereof. If persons interested desire to go further, we should not, I think, prolong the process, and the appeal should only be to the Federal High Court. </para>

                        <para>- This being merely an amending Bill, and therefore largely free from matters founded on any great issue, possibly it is one which invites closer attention in Committee than at this stage; but at the same time there are certain principles underlying the amendments, and to these I particularly propose to address myself. If there is one law on the statute-book which ought to be clear and understandable it is that dealing with our electoral machinery. It is not merely of interest to honorable senators, but of considerable interest also to the States as States, and to individual electors. There fore, every effort ought to be made to so frame its provisions that they can be understood by the average elector. I admit at once that electoral machinery has necessarily to be a little complicated, but every effort should be made to reduce that complexity to a minimum, so that the ordinary elector may at least understand without very much difficulty what he is required to do in order to secure a recognition of his electoral rights, and how he can exercise them. The Electoral Act is not a simple Act. It is a complicated one, and I am rather afraid that this amending Bill is going to add to rather than reduce that complication. I shall endeavour to indicate one or two portions of the Bill wherein simplicity could be obtained by certain alterations, but wherein the complications of the principal Act are made still more complicated. In view of the extreme desirability of having simple legislation dealing with our electoral machinery, and of the multiplicity of the amendments provided in this Bill it would have been far better for the Government to have brought in an entirely new Electoral Bill, instead of merely an amending Bill with a provision to the effect that the principal Act whenever reprinted shall be altered as amended. It would have been very much better for the average man if an entirely new Bill had been submitted. It would not have taken a very much longer time to deal with a measure of that kind, because the clauses which it was not desired to amend would go through Committee, as honorable senators well know, at a very rapid rate. In taking the other course we run the risk of proposing certain amendments to one clause that may have a bearing upon another clause which may escape our notice at the time. I shall indicate a provision of that character. Clause 15 reads - </para>

                    <para class="block">Possibly it may be shown by some legal method of reasoning that there is no great conflict between those provisions; but I hold that there is an overlapping, and that certainly is not desirable in any Act of Parliament, much less in an Act dealing with electoral machinery. I could multiply instances of that kind, and, in Committee, I shall point to them. I only desire now to suggest the nature of the difficulty which, I think, is likely to arise where we proceed by an amending Bill to make so many alterations in the existing law as are here proposed. I desire to point to the growing tendency, as illustrated by. this Bill, to legislate by executive act rather than by the ordinary machinery - that is, the Parliament. By this time honorable senators are painfully familiar with the frequency with which Bills provide that, by regulation, the Governor-General in Council may do this, that, and the other, until, little by little, the power of Parliament is steadily being appropriated by the Executive. This Bill goes a little further in this regard than any other Bill which I can at present call to mind, and it does so in some important particulars. It is the natural history of any evil that if it be allowed to go- unchecked it will tend to grow. It would be quite reasonable that Ministers who observed a tendency on the part of Parliament to grant them power to legislate by regulation should see nothing abnormal in asking for a further extension thereof. In Committee, I shall point out that there are several matters left to the Governor-General in Council which might, at the time of their arising, be highly controversial, which might come to be utilized for the purpose of a strong party advantage, but which could now be legislated upon definitely. At this stage, I shall not refer to the weightier matters of that kind, which it is sought to provide for by regulation, but shall just deal with some of the minor matters. Clause 5 provides - </para>

                        <para>There shall be a chief electoral officer for the Commonwealth, who shall have such powers and functions as are conferred upon him by this Act or the regulations. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">Either the words "or the regulations" are useless, or it is proposed to give to this officer a power which the Bill does not confer. Again, clause 14 proposes to amend section 23 of the principal Act, which provides for a redistribution of a State into electorates, whenever the Governor-General in Council "may deem it necessary. It is proposed by clause 14 to replace that section with a provision beginning, " Such proclamation may be made," leaving this elastic power in the hands of the Ministry, when it ought to be specifically set out. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think it is; but even if that be so, the Minister's interjection is no argument, hardly an excuse. The question is - Ought it to be specified or not that such a proclamation may be made under certain circumstances? Here, again, for the purpose of avoiding even the appearance of party intrigue, of seeking a party advantage, there ought to be specifically set out in the Bill when and in what circumstances the State not " may " but " shall " be redistributed into electorates - because the sub-divisions may affect the whole basis of our electoral system, founded as it is on equality of voting power. Passing on to clauses 31, 33, 34, and other clauses dealing with the conditions under which the rolls shall be prepared, revised, and printed, honorable members will notice that the whole of the machinery is at the discretion of the Minister. The rolls may be prepared when he likes; they may be supplemented when he likes ; they may be printed when he directs. I should like to believe that all this machinery would be utilized fairly by the Ministry of the day. But we ought not to give to any Ministry the power to utilize our electoral machinery to secure a party advantage, or, to express my meaning in other words, to so work the electoral machinery that they might defeat the real wishes of the electors. Take, again, clause 46, which refers to the limitation of the electoral expenses of candidates. It provides - and it is a very necessary provision, I think' - that the returns which candidates have to make as to their expenses shall be available for public inspection on payment of a prescribed fee. I only refer to this small matter, because it illustrates the general tendency to legislate by regulation instead of by enactment. The prescribed fee might be one shilling, or it might be £100 The Ministry might, by regulation, make the fee so prohibitive as to render the provision a dead letter, inasmuch as no ordinary elector would venture to claim the right to look at the return of expenses made by a candidate. The object of that clause, I take it, is to provide that, whilst there shall be no vexatious examination of accounts - no invitation to any dissatisfied elector to come forward and harass a candidate unnecessarily - still they shall be reasonably open to any one who. for sufficient reason is inclined to examine them. Why should not the Government put in the Bill itself what the fee shall -be to entitle any one to examine the accounts ? We should then know whether the idea of the Government as to what was a fair fee was also our own idea. I repeat that I am referring to these matters as showing the extent to which this power of dealing with legislative subjects by regulation is growing up, and as <inline font-style="italic">a.</inline> preface to the action that I shall take in Committee to endeavour to secure amendments in the direction I have indicated. I admit at once that it is necessary to leave a very great deal to administration. "That goes without saying with regard to many cases, and particularly does it apply to a measure like the Electoral Act, which, with its elaborate machinery, lies dormant for three years, and then requires to be put in operation. But I wish to point, as a proof of the desirableness of leaving as little as possible to administration, to the remarks made by the Committee of the House of Representatives which inquired into the conduct of the last general election. That Committee submitted a report, with which I have no doubt honorable senators are fairly familiar ; but there are one or two passages in it to which I wish to direct attention in support of my contention that it is not only right and proper, but extremely desirable, to limit the scope within which the administration shall move as much as possible. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> in submitting this Bill, referred to the fact that the Committee had brought in what he described as a satisfactory report. Well, of course, it would be gratifying to all of us to know that, after an examination of the facts, the Committee was enabled to bring in a report which was termed by itself, and which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> terms, " satisfactory," especially as it followed a perfect tornado of criticism and </para>

                    <para class="block">I say, again, that it is marvellous that, in view of these facts, the Committee should have affirmed, as they did, that the number and nature of the complaints was not such as to justify the adverse criticisms upon the Chief Electoral Office. I do not know what stronger condemnation there could be of an electoral office than the admissions made in this report - that it left off the rolls numbers of men who were entitled to vote, that it allowed men to vote who were not on the rolls, and that men were allowed to vote on State electoral rights whose names were not on the Commonwealth rolls. All these matters, it seems to me, make the strongest possible indictment against the Administration under which they existed. In consequence of what then happened, I naturally desire that, apart . from the general principle involved, we shall see that this Bill sets out as clearly as it possibly can in every word the wishes of the Legislature, leaving as little as possible to regulation. Now I turn to the features of the Bill itself. Here again, in the very first portion of part 3, we have the pernicious principle of leaving everything to chance. Clause 9 provides that a quota shall be ascertained in each State "whenever necessary." What is meant by " whenever necessary " ? It ought to be possible to state when the quota shall be ascertained; because the ascertainment of the quota would determine when the redistribution of a State was necessary. Who is to determine when it is " necessary " ? Surely it ought not to be left to an individual to say that he thinks, or does not think, that it is necessary. I can quite understand that the latter part of the provision might provide that the redistribution shall take place when the quota having been 'found proves it to be necessary. But the verv first step towards the ascertainment of the quota is to be taken " whenever necessary." How is it possible to know when it is necessary, until the quota is found? </para>

                            <para>- Unfortunately for the Minister, the. same term is used in .that Bill-" whenever necessary." .It is , left optional with the officers whether they shall take action under it. It ought not to be left to a Minister or an officer to say when a thing of this sort shall be done. The Bill should set out in express terms the conditions under which the machinery shall be set in motion for the purpose of ascertaining the quota, and dividing the States into electorates accordingly. Passing from that, point, I wish to invite the attention of the Senate to the means by which these electoral divisions are to be adjusted. Honorable' senators will see that the same option is left with the Minister to put the law in motion or not, just as he pleases. The present Act, in sections 19, 20, and 21, provides that the Commissioner appointed by the Government shall prepare a scheme of distribution, that that scheme shall be submitted to Parliament, and if both Houses of Parliament approve it shall be adopted by proclamation. A subsequent section in the Act provides that if either House of the Parliament disapproves, the Minister "may" direct the Commissioner to propose a fresh distribution. Honorable senators will see there, again, the same pernicious principle. If tooth Houses approve, all is right, but if either disapprove, then it is provided that the Minister, " may " direct the further distribution. This Bill, which seeks to amend the principal Act, still leaves the option, even in a more important particular, with the Minister. Clause 13 amends section 22 of the principal Act, the new words to be inserted being - </para>

                        <para class="block">The word ' ' may " does not occur - there is no option in that clause. That looks definite enough, but we have to remember that this new sub-clause is to be attached to section 22 of the main Act, which provides that if either House disapprove, the Minister " may " direct a further distribution. Clause 13, which applies to the Commissioner only, becomes operative if the Minister has exercised his option and directed the Commissioner to propose a fresh distribution. There is no compulsion on the Minister to send that direction to the Commissioner, because, as I have already pointed out, section 22 of the principal Act remains. If the Minister does send a direction to the Commissioner, the latter must prepare a new scheme, but if the Minister does not choose to take that step, the Commissioner is not in a position to revise his work. Unless the word" may," in section 22, is altered to " shall," which finds a place in clause 13, it will be open to a Minister, who may desire to obtain an unfair party advantage by preventing the electors at that time from expressing a verdict which might' be adverse to the Government in power, to hang up a redistribution scheme indefinitely. If there is one thing that honorable senators, irrespective of party, ought to earnestly labour in common to do, it is to provide in this Bill for such directions as will prevent the possibility of any particular Minister or party, tampering with the electoral machinery. The provisions ought to be so drawn as to place it beyond the option, discretion, or power of any individual to do anything which may not merely affect the composition of the Houses of Parliament, but may prevent the electors from' registering their wishes in the only way open to them - that is by electing their representatives. Let me point to further indefiniteness in this division. Clause 14 is intended to amend section 23 of the principal Act, which reads: - </para>

Clause 14 provides that the proclamation may be made whenever certain contingencies arise. Why should we not say that a proclamation "shall" be made, instead of saying that it "may " be made? We know what we mean to enact. The conditions under which a proclamation ought to be made, and under which the Bill says it may be made, are : - </para>

                            <para>- Certainly; and I thank the honorable senator for the word. I should, in passing, like to point out what appears to me to be a serious error in drafting in clause 14. It will be noticed that the paragraphs 1 have quoted are connected with the word " and," .whereas, in my opinion, the word ought to be "or." Clearly we desire to be able to direct the redistribution under any one of the contingencies set out, and not only when all three occur concurrently. Although this may appear to be a slight error, it is one which might have an important bearing on the operation of the clause. As to the word " may," we have had some reference to its use quite recently in this Chamber; and honorable members are aware of the perfect humility with which I received an avalanche of legal authorities that were hurled at me bv <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> and other lawyers. I have since then been 'fortified, but not by such an array of authorities as. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> was able to bring to bear. I desire to show that there is in existence an Act of Parliament which lends great support to the view I advanced, namely, that when we intend "shall " we should say "shall," and that when we mean " may " we should say " may."

                            <para>- Exactly. I quite recognise that this section is in no sense applicable to Federal legislation. But I draw attention to the fact that one Legislature, at any rate, has had the courage to break away from the obsolete traditions of the past, and to recognise that whatever there may have been to justify the use of the word two or three centuries ago, when Acts passed were addressed to the Crown, the necessity for the word has passed away. There should be- no diffidence on our part in following the lead of New South Wales in this connexion ; in other words, we should give " may " and " shall," when used in an Act of Parliament, exactly the same meaning that they carry when otherwise used. </para>

                            <para>- That is exactly what it is ; but the reason for its use in days gone by is understandable enough. In the early clays of Parliament, when an Act was really a resolution or petition printed by the Crown, in which Parliament probably may have stood in some awe, the word may have been- appropriate enough. But circumstances are different to-day, when the power of legislation, not merely in name or theory, but i'n actual fact, rests with the Legislature. However, I was referring to the clauses under which a redistribution takes place. The effect of the Bill, following, the original Act, is that a redistribution scheme, when it has been prepared by the Commissioner, comes to Parliament for approval or otherwise; and this opens up the whole question of the advisability of maintaining this parliamentary veto. I very much regret that the Government have not had the courage to break away from the existing law and practice which has already been shown to be pernicious. In my opinion, a redistribution scheme ought to Be prepared by authorities so high and so competent that whatever possible defects of detail there might be, it could be accepted. The very last body which I should regard as competent to exercise a veto is Parliament itself. </para>

                            <para>- Without wishing to make invidious distinctions, [ point out that Parliament, from its very nature, is opposed to any change. It is only human nature that members of Parliament, particularly of another place, where they represent local districts; should see in any change something to cause, at any rate, a feeling of temporary anxiety. Honorable members there are a force which must resist change. While they may believe they are acting for the public good, they are always, more or less, and, perhaps, unconsciously, biased by the fact that they are interested parties. It would have been much better if the Government had made a departure, and proposed the appointment of three commissioners one of whom might be a Judge of the Supreme Court of a State in which the Commission was called upon to act. Such a Commission should be intrusted with the duty of dividing a State into electoral divisions, leaving it open to any one to present objections; but when those objections had been listened to, and the Commissioners had finally revised the scheme, that scheme ought to be given the force and effect of law without any further reference to Parliament. The more we put the machinery of our electoral law above the suspicion of party or personal influence, the higher it will stand with the electors, and the better, in the long run, it will be for Parliament itself. I now come to that division of the Bill which deals with the electoral rolls, and here I would point out the confusion which I think may arise if this portion of the Bill be passed in its present form. It is provided, in the proposed substituted clause 30, that joint rolls may be adopted by the States and the Commonwealth; and, at first sight, I must admit that I was very much impressed with the practical advantage of this on the ground of economy. As a general principle, I quite accept the idea underlying this proposal, because it is very desirable if possible for the Commonwealth and the States to work together. But after carefully considering the clause, I have arrived at the opinion that a great deal of confusion might arise, the effect of which would be to leave the elector in a more unfortunate position than that he occupies to-day. Economy is important, but I think it will be false economy if, as a result of saving the dual cost of preparing the rolls, we left the elector in such a position that, so to speak, he did not know exactly where he stood. The proposed substituted clause 30 is as follows : - 30. (1) The Governor-General may arrange with the Governor of a State for the preparation, alteration, and revision of the Rolls, in any manner consistent with the provisions of this Act, jointly by the Commonwealth and the State, to the intent that the Rolls may be used as Electoral Rolls for State elections as well as for Commonwealth elections. </para>

                    <para class="block">The effect of this clause as it stands would briefly be that State electors who are not Commonwealth electors could be enrolled, and would be indicated as being only State electors. There is no provision for indicating Commonwealth electors who are not State electors. That may have been an oversight in drafting the measure. What is wanted is a roll which will indicate three sets of electors - those who are Commonwealth electors only, those who are State electors only, and those who are electors for both State and Commonwealth. The Bill provides for the classification of electors under only two headings. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Garran</inline> prepared a memorandum on this subject for the present or the previous Government, and he evidently intended that there should be provision made for three classes of electors, but in this clause provision is made for indicating only two classes - those who are State electors and those who are Commonwealth electors, and there is nothing to indicate electors who are entitled to vote at both State and Commonwealth elections. The clause says - provided that it is clearly indicated in the prescribed manner that those persons are not enrolled thereon as Commonwealth electors. </para>
                    <para>The effect of that would be that every Commonwealth elector could vote at a State election, but every State elector could not vote at a Commonwealth election. It is clear that something has been omitted there. I refer to this clause at some length, because it proposes the introduction, not of some amendment of the main Act, but of a new principle. The effect, in my opinion, will be this : We shall have electors, on seeing their names on a roll, assuming that they are there for all electoral purposes. An elector will ask if his name is on the roll, and he will be told that it is. He will not take the trouble, or will not know that it is necessary that he should take the trouble, to see whether he is qualified to vote at both State and Commonwealth elections. This may seem an extraordinary statement to make, but we know that at the last Federal elections it was proved that a number of electors on looking at the rolls found that their names were not there. What would happen if a large number of careless electors, seeing their names on the roll, and going away quite content, found out at the last moment that they were on. the roll for one purpose only, and not for the purpose of the particular election at which they desire to vote? I am inclined to think that this provision in respect to joint rolls ought to be limited to those States whose franchise is similar to our own. If that were done there would be no trouble. </para>

                            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> volunteers the startling information that none of the States possesses a franchise similar to our own. I am aware of the fact. This clause, in any case, can only come into operation by an arrangement between a State and the Commonwealth, but I am contending that if we pass this clause there should be a proviso under which it would be operative only in the case of States which have a franchise similar to our own. The difference between the franchise in operation in many of the States and our own is quite nominal. </para>

                            <para>- I think it is only natural that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> should have had that in mind. The difference between the franchise of several of the States and that of the Commonwealth is so merely nominal that if they really desire to economize - and the economy will be for their benefit, and not for ours - it will be quite open to them to take advantage of the provisions of this Bill by making such slight alterations in their electoral laws as are necessary to bring them into uniformity with the Commonwealth law. Unless that is done, this clause will only lead to confusion. I am, therefore, not at all in love with this proposal, unless its application is limited to States whose franchise is similar to our own. </para>

                            <para>- I thank <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> for his interjection. One of the reasons why, in their second-reading speeches, honorable senators indicate what they regard as objectionable features in a Bill is in order that they may give the Senate some general knowledge of the form of amendment which they are inclined to submit for consideration. I am not in this case disposed to make any apology to the Senate, because I am dealing with an entirely new proposal. Arising out of the proposed joint rolls, further serious complications may take place. We have, under the existing law, in theory, at any rate, the practice of electoral divisions, with polling places within those divisions. In theory, the idea was to group electors around their natural polling places. In order to fall in with State requirements, an alternative subdivision is here proposed to be called a" subdivision." So that, instead of having an electorate with a division into polling places, we will have an electorate with a possible division into polling places, and with or without a possible division into subdivisions. Honorable senators will recognise that no two electorates will necessarily be divided in the same way. One may have subdivisions with or without polling places ; another may have polling places without subdivisions ; and a third may have both. Arising out of this further proposed subdivision, there comes the question of the rolls, dealt with in substituted clause 31, which provides that - </para>

                    <para class="block">Sub-clause 3 provides that he may have his name placed on any one polling place or subdivision roll for the division, whilst sub-clause 4 provides that he may have it placed wherever the regulations permit him to have it placed. This appears to me to be likely to lead to a very great deal of confusion. No one elector will be able to tell another what he requires to do, because the conditions of each may be different. In one case, where an electorate is divided into subdivisions, an elector may require to have his name on a subdivisional roll. In another electorate divided only into polling places, he may require to have his name on a polling place roll, and in another case the regulations may prescribe the polling place roll on which his name must appear. A further complication might arise, because we might have subdivisions coterminous with polling places, subdivisions embracing two or three polling places, or one polling place embracing two or three subdivisions. The whole thing is going to be so complex that, without a map, the probability is that the average elector will never know where he stands. The principle of grouping men around their natural polling places was admirable; but now, in order that we may work in with an economical system of registering State and Commonwealth electors, we are proposing to do something which the Government have not really had the courage to do, and that is to divide the various electoral divisions into units which may be taken from, or added to, an electorate. </para>

                            <para>- There' is no objection to that, but I point out that as the Bill stands we are being asked to depart from one excellent principle, and the framers of the measure have not had the courage to go the whole way towards the adoption of another principle. The principle of our existing law is the grouping of electors around their polling places. The suggestion on which this portion of the Bill is founded has been put forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Garran</inline> in his very admirable paper.- He has proposed that the States should be divided as far as possible into areas, not equal in geographical extent, but fairly equal in the number of electors they contain. A sufficient number of these "units," as he calls them, might be bracketed together to make an electorate, and if the population increased somewhat in one electorate, one or two of these units could be taken from it and added to another electorate. It reminds one somewhat of the bricks with which children are enabled to form all sorts of pictures. The adoption of this principle would have enabled States electorates to be arranged by the bracketing of these units, and the same process could have been gone through where a redistribution was necessary for Federal purposes. But evidently when the proposal came to be considered, the expense of dividing the whole of Australia, into sufficiently small parcels proved to be too appalling for contemplation, and it was therefore avoided. I can see no other reason for refusing to give effect to the principle proposed. Because honorable senators will recognise that, if that system had been followed, it would have been necessary to indicate by clear boundaries exactly where one unit commenced and another unit ended. All the boundaries of particular units would have had to be described, and that would have been a very heavy undertaking indeed. It is in order to avoid that expense that they seek to take the power to be utilized only in certain circumstances. In certain electorates, where it is convenient, they will utilize the power, but in other electorates, where it is not convenient, they will not do so. That is almost like saying, " If there is an advantage in a certain direction, which we can only see under certain circumstances, why should we not use the power?"' The great difficulty will be that no elector will know where he stands. Surely our electoral machinery is sufficiently complicated as it is. I have found great trouble in advising persons exactly what to do. How much more difficult will it be if we have the electoral divisions cut up in different ways? We may have a subdivision coterminous with a subdivision containing two or more polling places, or we may have a polling place without a subdivision, or containing one or more subdivisions. The whole thing will be so complicated that no elector, until he has made ordinary inquiry and special reference, will know exactly what he ought to do in his particular case. This brings me to the departures which have been made from the principle of the original Bill, which was the grouping of electors round their polling places. First, we said that an elector could get enrolled at a polling place other than that to which, by reason of his location, he really belonged; secondly, we allowed an elector to vote at any polling place by using form Q; thirdly, we allowed postal voting; and, fourthly, by a regulation, we allowed an elector practically to vote anywhere. These departures from the main principle are all extremely desirable in their way, because they allow odd scores of electors, who for some reason or other are not able to vote at their polling place, to exercise their suffrage. </para>

                            <para>- That may be so. Whilst it is desirable to provide machinery to allow what I call odd scores of electors to vote, we must be very careful - and the inquiry of the Select Committee proves the necessity for exercising great care - that we do not make these openings so wide as to threaten the very existence of the principle of grouping electors round their polling place. In the absence of an electoral roll, the only effective check we have is by locating the electors. In this Bill the power of enabling an elector, by a mere regulation, to vote anywhere outside his division, appears to have been dropped. </para>

                            <para>- If that is the case I have made an error. There are many provisions which I am pleased to see in the Bill. The fact that I am indicating provisions to which I object must not be taken as implying that there is not a good deal which excites my approval. It appears to me more advantageous to the Minister and to the Senate to point out what I regard as the defects of the Bill, rather than the portions which are improvements on the present law. The abolition of Revision Courts is, I think, a very wise departure. The Courts are costly and useless; they simply affirm, without any protest, what the officers have done. The proposal in the Bill is that the Courts shall only be set in operation when a dispute arises. That is the ordinary function of a Court anywhere. Honorable senators will notice that in clause 40 there is a discrimination against the Senate elector which I do not think is just or right. It provides that while an elector may vote outside his polling place at an election for the House of Representatives, the power which he previously enjoyed of voting outside his polling place at a Senate election appears to be taken away. </para>

                    <para>No provision appears to be made in the Act for the Court of Disputed Returns to decide whether a successful candidate is qualified when elected, or has become disqualified if the point be raised. It' is desirable in an amending Bill to provide as far as possible for all contingencies which are likely to arise. A question which may be raised at any time is whether a candidate is qualified or has become disqualified. These two contingencies might reasonably be provided for in the Bill. Senator Pearce has given notice of an amendment dealing with voting machines. I have not had time to study its terms, but the Committee to whose report I have referred expressed the opinion that there was a great deal of utility in the machines, but that they were not able to specifically recommend any one. The report ought to suggest to the authorities the propriety of making an inquiry and, possibly, an experiment, with a view of testing their efficacy. A voting machine is certainly a more economical method of taking the votes of electors than the present manual method ; but we shall never know whether the claims advanced on its behalf are substantial or not unless we, by inquiry and experiment of some kind, test their efficiency. Some steps should be taken to determine practically whether or not we can by this mechanical means expedite both the work of the electors and the work of the electoral officers. In conclusion, I would express the hope that, in dealing with a measure which is necessarily free from party significance, and which. I believe, every one earnestly desires to make as workable as possible, the Minister will receive suggestions for its improvement with an open mind. He will, perhaps, forgive me for saying that apparently, in the case of another Bill, he rather resented suggestions, as being to some extent an attack upon it. </para>

                        <para>- I think that speeches such as the one which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has delivered are very helpful to the Senate, and must be of service to the Minister in charge of the Bill. This is necessarily a Bill to be discussed in Committee rather than in the Senate. The main principles of our electoral law were discussed and defined in 1902. </para>

                            <para>- What better proof can we have that our Electoral Act was framed on right principles than the presence of the honorable senator ? The points raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> are all well worthy of the attention of Ministers, and, if raised in Committee, would not have received that attention that they will receive now that they have been raised at this stage. The first point was in regard to (he provision for the quota. I certainly should advise the Government to recast those clauses altogether. They are bad in principle, and the machinery for carrying them out is vague. They will, I think, work out with bad results. The words " whenever necessary " undoubtedly give a wonderful scope to the Minister. They are altogether too elastic. Furthermore, surely in this Bill, which, in regard to the ascertainment of the quota, will have to be read in connexion with the Representation Bill, we should have some reference made to the means of arriving at the quota. There should be on the face of the Bill an instruction to those who are to ascertain the quota that they shall automatically adjust it whenever the machinery provided proves that an adjustment is necessary. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> that it ought not to be left to Parliament, and certainly ought not to be left to parties, to determine when a redistribution of seats is necessary. I contend that if we leave the Bill as it has been introduced, the matter will always be dealt with on party lines. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> fell into error, however, when he said that it is unwise to leave Parliament to settle the matter. Unfortunately, it is not Parliament which settles it. It is one House of the Parliament. It is the House that makes and unmakes Ministries. As he pointed out, the <inline font-style="italic">status quo</inline> is always satisfactory to the member who is in occupation, and any readjustment will be a disturbance. So long as we leave in the Bill a provision that there is to be no automatic readjustment, so long will it be a party readjustment. It is just as well to face that fact, when we can discuss it quite apart from party considerations. The Senate is also, to some extent, a party House. </para>

                            <para>- But it is; and if we leave the Bill as it stands this question will be settled on party lines. I suggest the advisableness of redrafting that clause, and taking out the provisions allowing the electoral officer " whenever necessary ' ' to readjust the quota, making it automatic and dependent upon the operation of the Representation Bill. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. Then there is the question of the establishment of polling places. Hitherto the matter has been in the hands of the Governor-General in Council. In future, under this Bill, the establishment of polling places will be the act of the Minister. At the first blush, I was inclined to oppose that idea. But the experience of the last general election showed me that, in a growing State especially, it is absolutely necessary that the Minister should be able to proclaim polling places. Prior to the last election, there were numerous requests from my own State for polling places to be established at newly-discovered alluvial diggings ; but, because of the fact that this had to be done by the Governor-General in Council, it was practically impossible to get them established. The Minister is responsible for the working of this measure, which is one to enable the voters of the Commonwealth to exercise the franchise. It should be within his power to establish polling places -wherever required. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, and I agree with that, because he ought to be responsible. When the power was left in the hands of the Governor-General in Council the Minister, although responsible for the administration of the measure, had not the power to make it work. I think the alteration is a very valuable one. The next point to which I have to allude is one with which I cannot agree. I refer to clauses 23 and 24, which amend sections 62 and 63 of the principal Act. Under these clauses we are extending the number of officers who may be able to alter the electoral rolls. I think it is quite justifiable that the divisional returning officer or the chief returning officer should be able to place names upon the roll or to remove them, because these officers are persons over whom we have control. They are not partisans, but are public servants carrying out their duty. But these clauses go further), and direct that the electoral registrar may alter and strike out names. Electoral registrars are very often by force of circumstances' partisans. They are party politicians. It is surely inadvisable that persons holding party views, as many of these men do, should have the right to strike names off the roll or to put them on.

I have compared this Bill with the principal Act, and I have not been able to find any limitation. I should like the Minister to make a note of that, and to explain if he can when this power ceases to be given to the electoral registrar,- and also whether he thinks it is safe to give such a power to men who are not paid officers, who are beyond the control of the Minister, and who in many cases are political partisans. </para>

                            <para>- It is certainly in keeping with the clauses regarding redistribution. In regard to the amending clauses by which voters may vote at separate polling places, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> is under the impression that some alteration has been made, and that some privileges which voters had in voting for the Senate have been taken away. I think that on reconsideration he will see that, although clause 40 amends section 139 of the principal Act. it does not do so in a way that takes away any of those privileges from voters for the Senate. Because, while it leaves out the words "except as provided in sub-section 3," I think that the effect of amending the Act in this way will be that the altered statute will not take away the right conferred by the proviso in the principal Act. I take it that the Bill will be read with the principal Act. </para>

I am glad that the point has been raised, so that the Minister may satisfy the Committee that the effect will not be as pointed out by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould,</inline> and that, if there is any doubt, the matter may be made perfectly plain. As to voting machines, it would be a pity, in an amending Bill, not to provide that any satisfactory appliance, which, while effecting saving in time and money, would safeguard the purity of the ballot, could be taken advantage of without the necessity to introduce an amending Bill. In! the amendment which I have circulated, provision is made for all details of any machine to be laid before Parliament, and, unless Parliament disagrees, to allow that machine to be used ; and I hope that some provision of the kind will be made. </para>

                    <para>This Bill has been circulated for some days, and, in moving the second reading, I propose to confine myself to its main principles. Honorable senators are aware that in section 24 of the Constitution, provision is made for the composition of the House of Representatives, and for the method by which the number of members for each State shall be decided. The section sets forth that the number of members for each State in the House of Representatives shall be in proportion to the number of people in the State; and sections 25 and 127 provide that, in estimating the number of people in a State for this purpose, certain persons shall be disqualified and not counted. Some discussion has taken place as to the proper construction to be placed on section 24. The second paragraph of that section is as follows : - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>The number of members chosen in the several States shall be in proportion to the respective numbers of their people, and shall, until the Parliament otherwise provides, be determined, whenever necessary, in the following manner : - </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">Then provision is made in two paragraphs for the ascertainment of the quota, and, by the division of the quota into the number of people in the State, the ascertainment of the number of members to which the State is entitled. The question naturally arises as to how the words " be determined " shall be understood - that is to say, by whom the determination shall be made; and there is the further question, how the words " whenever necessary " are to be construed. </para>

Then, as I have already said, there is the further question as to the construction of the words "whenever neces sary." That is - When shall the determination be made, or take place? In <inline font-style="italic">The Annotated Constitution of the Australian Commonwealth,</inline> prepared by Quick and Garan, some comments are made on page 454, on this section. It is there stated by the learned authors - </para>

                        <para>The Constitution does not expressly say by whom this determination is to be made. Whenever it is " necessary " to re-apportion the members, the only data needed are the " latest statistics of the Commonwealth," showing the population of the Commonwealth, and of each State. Given those figures, the rest is mere arithmetic ; and according to the maxim - <inline font-style="italic">Id cerium est quod, cerium reidipotest</inline> - the numbers are then already determined. </para>
                        <para>Parliamentary authority would, however, appear to be required for two purposes : - (1) To provide for the preparation of the latest statistics, and to identify those statistics by law ; and (2) to declare when re-apportionment is " necessary." As the statistics are at the root of the representative system, it is important that they should be clearly recognized and identified by Act of Parliament; and even when that has been done, it would be most undesirable that the Executive should be left to decide for itself whether re-apportionment were necessary. </para>
                        <para>The Constitution does not prescribe any regular interval for re-apportionment, nor does it require that re-apportionment should take place at every general election, if later statistics are available ; it merely provides that apportionment shall be made " whenever necessary," and that when so made it shall be according to the latest statistics. The Parliament is apparently left to judge for itself when the necessity arises. The only reliable basis of population statistics is a census; and it may be presumed that the Parliament will provide for a periodical - probably a decennial - census, and will require that after each census the number of members for each State shall be determined afresh. Such determination, when made, will of course not take effect till the next general election. </para>

                    <para class="block">This Bill has for its object to determine, according to general principles, the latest statistics of the Commonwealth for the purpose of giving effect to section 24 of the Constitution. There is the further object of taking away from the Executive the determination as to the necessity or otherwise to reapportion the representation in accordance with the principles referred to by Quick and Garran, in the note I have just quoted. In the Draft Constitution Bill of 1 89 1 provision was made for a decennial census to be taken by the Commonwealth, and for the apportionment of the representation amongst the States in accordance with figures which would then indicate the respective populations of the States. But the Federal Convention of 1897, for reasons best known to itself, departed from the principle laid down in 1891, which was - </para>

                        <para>A fresh apportionment of representatives to the States shall be made after each census of the people of the Commonwealth, which shall be taken at intervals not longer than ten years. But a fresh apportionment shall not take effect until the then next general election. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">At present there is no provision in the Constitution that the census shall be taken at any fixed period. In accordance with the practice of the States in the past - a practice which we believe will be continued in the future - a census is taken every ten years, in the year ending with the figure 1 - 19 1 1, 192 1, and so forth. The question again arises as to what a&gt;re the latest statistics of the Commonwealth, as the term is used in section 24 of the Constitution. Obviously, if we are to depend on the census as being the latest statistics, then we must take the figures disclosed by the censuses of 1901. It is true that the censuses' were then taken in the several States simultaneously, but there was no agreement as to general principles. Since 1901 the Statisticians of the various States have assembled in conference in Melbourne, and have agreed on uniform principles, which will be adhered to hereafter in taking the censuses of the several States. The Bill proposes, in order to -meet the circumstances arising out of the duty that . devolves on Parliament under section 24 of the Constitution, not to confine the apportionment of the representation to every ten-year period immediately after the taking of the census. We recognise that the circumstances of Australia are such as, in many instances, to cause great fluctuations of population during a very much lesser period than ten years. We have only to take the case of Western Australia, more particularly recently, to realize that it is quite possible, after the lapse of two or three years, to have disturbances of population so great as to entitle a State to an extra representative; or, on the other hand, to necessitate a reduction in the representation. The Bill deals with general principles, and not with any particular set of circumstances at a particular period. It is provided that there shall be what are called enumeration days, in order to ascertain the population of the Commonwealth for the purposes of the Bill, and in order to comply with section 24 of the Constitution. It is provided that until there shall be a Commonwealth census taken in accordance with the general principle, the States censuses shall be adopted as a basis. It is further provided that every census day - that is, a Commonwealth census day, or, until such shall have been instituted, a State census day - shall be an enumeration day;' and that on the expiration of five years after each census day, whether Commonwealth or State, as the case may be, there shall be another enumeration day. The Chief Electoral Officer is charged with the responsibility of making an inquiry into the population of the Commonwealth and of the several States on each enumeration day. Whenever an enumeration day and a census day happen to be the same the returns from the census will be the basis* on which he will work. When an enumeration day does not happen to be a census day, but a day intervening between two censuses, and five years from the date of the latest census, the returns from that census shall be the basis on which he will work. He is charged under this Bill to work in this way. He will take the latest census returns of population as indicated on that day, if it be a census day, or on the latest preceding census day, if it be an intervening enumeration day, and he will take from the numbers indicated in the census returns the number of persons who are not to be counted in the population, in accordance with section 25 of the Constitution, that is to say, persons belonging to races which, by a law of a State, are disqualified from the franchise. He will further deduct the number of persons who, by section 127 of the Constitution, are not to be included amongst the population of a State, that is, the[ aboriginal natives. Before making these deductions, he will if the day be not a census day but one of the intervening enumeration days, have to make certain allowances in accordance with a schedule to this Bill. </para>

                    <para class="block">These percentages will be found set out in paragraph 5 of schedule A. The provisions of this schedule were agreed upon by the several States Statisticians at the conference held in Melbourne in 1903, to which I have already referred, and they embody the principles on which they will hereafter uniformly act in carrying out the census for their respective States. This is the first time legislative effect has been sought to be given to these principles. They are not the invention of any one in particular, but the principles determined on at that particular statistical conference, as those which shall hereafter guide the statisticians of the various States in the preparation of their statistics. The Electoral Officer will make his enumeration whether it be on a census day or an intervening enumeration day every five years, by taking the population statistics from the returns of the census, making allowance wherever necessary for arrivals and departures, and excluding the number of the persons which must be excluded under sections 25 and 127 of the Constitution. Having thus ascertained what is the population of the Commonwealth, and what is the population of each of the States he is to return a certificate in the form prescribed in schedule B of the Bill to the Minister. This certificate must be forthwith gazetted, and it must also be tabled in both Houses of Parliament. The Bill provides, in clause 8, that the certificate shall be evidence, practically of the matters it contains, that is. of the population of the Commonwealth and of .the several States, for the purpose of carrying out the objects of this Bill and of section 24 of the Constitution. So soon, then, as these figures are ascertained, the effect of this Bill will be to adopt them as the latest statistics of the Commonwealth for the purposes of section 24 of the Constitution. Proceedings can thereupon be, taken in accordance with that section and clause 9 of this Bill for the re-apportionment of representation. </para>

                            <para>- When I say "can," taken in this connexion, I mean can be taken with justice to all concerned, so that there can be no doubt that the reapportionment <inline font-style="italic">pf</inline> representation will, be carried out in accordance with the principles of the Constitution. I shall say that steps will then be taken by the Ministry of the day to give effect to section 24 of the Constitution. The only other provision of the Bill to which I need direct attention is that in clause 10, which is in conformity with the provisions of the Electoral Bill now before the Chamber, to the effect that in the event of any re-apportionment, of representation taking # place, or any fresh distribution of seats being on the <inline font-style="italic">tapis,</inline> it shall not take effect in the case of any bye election, but from the next general election thereafter. From the statement. I have made, honorable senators will see that the object of the Bill is to give effect to section 24 "whenever necessary." The words " whenever necessary " are somewhat vague as used in the Constitution, but we are endeavouring to establish a fixed principle that practically to all intents and purposes the latest statistics of the Commonwealth shall be taken every five years, and that until a Commonwealth Statistical Department is in existence we shall avail ourselves of the work of the States Statistical Department. When the Commonwealth Statistical Department is established we shall take advantage of it, and though we may only have a decennial census, we shall still have every five years an enumeration day. We shall make each census day an enumeration day for the purposes of this Act, and so we shall be able to give effect to the provisions of the Constitution at least every five years. </para>

                            <para>- We can deal- with that in discussing the Bill in Committee, as we can deal with' other matters to which the honorable senator has referred this afternoon. At present I 'am indicating the general principles of the Bill for the guidance of honorable senators. The main principle of having an enumeration every five years is in conformity to a large extent with what is, or with what was, if it is not now, the principle adopted in New Zealand. In some countries the opinion is held that a ten years' period is a sufficiently short one for a redistribution of representation. As I have said before, we recognise the peculiar circumstances of Australia, and are prepared by this Bill to adopt the principle that at least every five years any anomalies of representation which may have crept in shall be corrected. </para>

                            <para>- I overlooked that point. It is provided that, as soon as possible after the passing of this Bill, an enumeration day shall be appointed.' The enumeration that will then take place will be upon the basis of the last States census returns of population, so that effect may be given to the Bill as early as possible. </para>
