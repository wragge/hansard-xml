                    <para>- What is the use of the Printing Committee if this course is to be taken ? I always understood that in each House of the Parliament a Printing Committee was appointed to go through every document laid upon the table, and say whether it was of sufficient public- importance to be printed. We are not in a position to express an opinion as to whether this paper ought to be printed until we know what it is, and can judge its importance. </para>

                    <para>- It will be convenient for me to state what I propose to do in connexion with this Bill. It will be within the recollection of honorable senators that when I presented the Bill to the Senate I stated that it had been considered by the parliamentary draftsman, to whom I hadreferred it, with a view to have the phraseology of the measure brought into linewith the phraseology of the general Acts of the Commonwealth. Sincethen the Bill has been referred to the Standing Orders Committee. The Committee, judging from their report, submitted the whole question to the parliamentary draftsman, who has prepared a much more elaborate Bill, covering many details of an administrative or machinery character, which were not provided for in the measure as originally submitted by me. We have passed the first clause of the Bill as I introduced it. I now propose to move the omission of the remaining clauses, in order that we may have an opportunity to adopt the recommendations of the Standing Orders Committee. </para>

I draw the attention of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> to the recommendations of the Standing Orders Committee which I propose to adopt. Clause 2, enabling evidence to be taken, on oath, has been eliminated, and I now ask the Committee to strike out clause 3, which empowers the President of the Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Chairman' or member presiding at any sitting of a Committee of either House, to administer oaths and affirmations to witnesses. In the place of clause 3 I propose to adopt the recommended clause 2, which makes the same provision, with a little more elaboration. Thisclause gives exactly the same authority to other officials, namely, the Clerk of the House and the Chairman of any Committee. </para>

Theparliamentary draftsman, or the Standing Orders Committee, has made one serious omission, and that is in reference to the interpretation of the word " Committee." The interpretation in the suggested clause is. " ' Committee ' means a Committee of either House," andto that I propose to add the words, "or a Joint Committee of the two Houses." When I introduced this Bill, I recognised that, while we could regulate the taking of evidence before our own Chamber, or a Select Committee, by standing orders, we could not regulate the taking of evidence before a Joint Committee by standing orders ; . and, therefore, it is necessary to make the provision I have indicated.

                        <para>- I understood <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> to say so. However, the Standing Orders Committee held a great many meetings, and the parliamentary draftsman was called in to advise. Whether the parliamentary draftsman consulted the Attorney-General I do not know, but it was considered by the Committee that the Bill, as presented by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild,</inline> was defective on some points. Perhaps I am a little out of order in anticipating, but one of the points was that although t)he Bill, as originally presented, gave power to the Senate, House of Representatives, or any Committee, to administer an oath, it did not compel witnesses to take an oath. Honorable senators may have seen in the press lately a telegram from London, expressing the opinion of the Attorney-General of England in reference to some body in England - I do not exactly know what "Body, but I think it was the Board of Trade - not having power to compel witnesses to take an oath, although there was power to administer an oath. The Standing Orders Committee took- a great deal of trouble about the matter, and were unanimous in the recommendation that the clauses now suggested should be substituted for the Bill as originally introduced. It may, after all, be only a Question of draftsmanship, but there are details missing in the original Bill and now- recommended for approval.

                    should state what particular clauses in the proposed report of the Standing Orders Committee he proposed to insert in substitution for those struck out. This is not . an ordinary amendment that we are asked to accept. The Bill, as originally presented, contained four clauses, two of which might be regarded as purely formal. Now we are asked to accept as amendments on this Bill several clauses which constitute a new Bill from preamble to imprint. It is usual for a Committee, when a Bill has been referred to it, to suggest alterations or modifications of some of its clauses, but in this case we have a completely new Bill submitted, and the report of the Committee also suggests a widening of the scope of the original measure.

                        <para>- No; I complain that the honorable senator in charge of the original Bill did too little. I am not seeking to obstruct the passing of the Bill, but I am pointing out my difficulty in dealing with it. I have risen for the second time to remind honorable senators, that we are asked to accept certain proposals which, so far as I can see, are entirely different in character and scope from those contained in the original Bill submitted to us. </para>

                    <para>. - With reference to the remarks which have fallen from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> I may say that when this matter was previously brought before the Senate bv <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild,</inline> I slated ihi» attitude of the Government with regard to it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild,</inline> some time last session, introduced a Bill to give effect to what is intended to be given effect to bv this measure. The Bill was then referred 10 the Standing Orders Committee. That Committee, /having considered the measure, brought up a report in connexion with it, which was circulated last session. Honorable senators then had before them the original Bill, a report of the Standing Orders Committee, and the form of the proposed new Bill. I explained that so far as the Government were concerned, they wished to see some legislation of tho kind on the statute-book, and, inasmuch as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> took up the matter in the first instance, and our Standing Orders Committee had reported upon it, the Government were prepared to leave the matter now in the hands of the Senate for its proper consideration. With respect to what shall be inserted in the gap caused by the elimination of clause 2, I confess that I am in somewhat the same position as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen. Senator Neild</inline> has intimated that he intends to adopt the clauses recommended in the Standing Orders Committee's report. That is new to me, and I think we should ha.ve had some little notice of the honorable senator's intention to change the form of his Bill in that way before we are asked to vote on the motion now before the Committee. </para>

                    <para>- If the Standing Orders Committee had intrusted to any honorable senator the conduct of a Bill for an Act to give effect to its recommendations I could understand our present position. We should then be able to consider each of the proposed new clauses irc its proper order. We are now, however, being asked to adopt a clause recommended by the Standing Orders Committee in a Bill for an Act which is marked No. 2 on our files, and which was originally introduced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild.</inline> We are, at the same time, being asked to discuss an amending Bill of seventeen clauses, as compared with the original Bill of four clauses, and which we see almost for the first time. I suggest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> that if he is in charge of the proposed new Bill, on behalf of the Standing Orders Committee, he would do well to postpone it. We are being asked to deal now with an entirely new Bill, which we have not even read a first time. I think the proper proceeding would be to start <inline font-style="italic">de novo</inline> with the new Bill recommended by the Standing Orders Committee. </para>

                    <para>- I hope honorable senators will not allow a trifling matter to determine their action in connexion with this Bill. The second reading of the Bill was passed, and it was referred to the Standing Orders Committee, because there was a general impression that its provisions were inadequate. The Standing Orders Committee considered the Bill, with the advice of the parliamentary draughtsman. That officer drew up a Bill giving effect to the recommendations of the Committee, and it was then considered by the Committee and adopted as a part of their report. That report was laid upon the table some weeks ago. </para>

                        <para>- We have the Standing Orders Committee's report on the Bill. Surely it does not matter which honorable senator moves these amendments on the original Bill, and it does not matter whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> adopts that course or withdraws the original Bill, and brings forward the clauses recommended by the Standing Orders Committee in a new Bill ? I direct attention to the fact that it is advisable early in the session to determine the powers of Select Committees of the Senate. We have appointed a Select Committee which will probably be sitting shortly. Doubts have been raised as to the power of that Committee to take evidence. I do not personally believe that there is any ground for those doubts, but the passing of this measure will clear up all doubts on the subject, and will place the scope and powers of our Select Committees beyond all question. No honorable senator has yet said that he is opposed to the Bill, and I see no reason why we should not go on with its consideration in the way we have commenced. I appeal to honorable senators not to allow a mere matter of procedure to determine the postponement of the whole question, for that is what appears to be asked for. </para>

                    should not have the distinction and privilege of conducting the Bill to a successful conclusion. I do not believe that any one entertains the slightest notion of interfering with the honorable senator in that respect. Personally I say, as I did last year, that I think that
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild,</inline>
                    having taken the subject up, should carry it to a conclusion. I hold very much the same view as

                        <para>- I did nothing of the kind. I wrote to the honorable senator inquiring whether he proposed to avail himself of the standing order to resume the proceedings on the Bill he had introduced at the stage it had reached. But he never gave any intimation that he was going to adopt another Bill, as recommended by the Standing Orders Committee, with this title, "An Act relating to Parliamentary Witnesses," in place of his own Bill, with the title, " An Act relating to the taking of evidence by Parliament, or any Committee thereof," and with provisions enabling persons to be arrested, and to be imprisoned for two years, in some cases for five years. Are we to pass provisions of that sort at a moment's notice? It was for that reason I asked the representatives of the Government whether they had given consideration to the subject, and were prepared to guide the Committee as to the desirability of having these very severe provisions inserted. Because, if this Bill is to be enforced, it must be enforced by the Crown. </para>

                <para class="block">In point of fact, I have no doubt whatever that the whole of these powers are enjoyed under the Constitution. But if it is desirable to remove the doubt, unquestionably this Bill is a perfectly proper one to be introduced. The question is, are we to enact, in place of a Bill of three or four clauses, a Bill of seventeen clauses, containing penal provisions of a very drastic and severe order? The Committee certainly ought to have an opportunity to consider these proposals, now that it is intimated that they are to be inserted practically <inline font-style="italic">en bloc,</inline> before we seek to place them on the statute-book. </para>

                    <para>- I listened to a second-reading speech on a short Bill without apprehension of any wrong arising out of its provisions ; but now we are asked to accept a Bill with eighteen stronglyworded clauses affecting the liberty of the subject, without any information having been afforded. Surely a second-reading speech should be made when we are asked to pass an entirely new Bill, lock, stock, and barrel. I have not the least objection to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> getting the credit of introducing a Bill of this vast importance, but I should much prefer that it was introduced by the Government. At any rate, the Government should be sponsor to the Bill, if not its actual father. We are asked to take a departure from parliamentary procedure. </para>

The question as to who is to have any satisfaction from the passing of the measure is a small matter. Because if any one seeks for kudos as to its origin, the whole Senate has not the power to take from me the satisfaction of knowing that I initiated the measure. If honorable senators simply choose, by some very unusual process which I do not, for, an instant, suppose any decent majority here would propose to do, to take the measure out of my hands, they are welcome to take that course. They will only be dancing to my original fiddling. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> wishes to dance to my fiddling, let him do so ; I shall be perfectly satisfied. I do not choose to take up this attitude of personal interest, but I do submit that it is utterly unfair that, when I have followed out a strict course of agreement with the wishes of the majority and am simply, asking the Committee to consider an individual clause containing no penalty, but only interpretations prepared by the Standing Orders Committee, I should be met with accusations of a character which are rather unusual to be used in Parliament with reference to one occupying such an absolutely clear position as I do. </para>

I find that what he proposed to do was to get the Bill into Committee, in order that we might consider it as it stood in conjunction with the amendments recommended by the Standing Orders Committee. I, on behalf of the Government, expressed their concurrence in that course, and indicated that it was not intended to go any further with the Bill on that occasion, in order that honorable senators might have an opportunity to consider the recommendations. The attitude of the Government is an indorsement of the recommendations of the Standing Orders Committee. We were prepared to accept a Bill of the character recommended. The subject had been considered by the Government. The adjournment that was suggested after the disposal of the first clause was to enable honorable senators to acquaint themselves with what was proposed. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> proposes to confine himself to the consideration of the Bill as originally submitted, and to the amendments recommended by the Standing Orders Committee, I do not think that I should be adhering to the attitude previously taken up if I opposed him. </para>

                    (New South Wales). - I think that it is a matter of considerable regret that when any matter, even of so apparently innocent a character as this, comes before the Senate, one is not able to voice an objection, either to the measure itself, or to the procedure proposed to be adopted, without being met by suggestions as to motives, such as
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline>
                    ventured to make, or by open discourtesy, such as that of which I complain, on the part of
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild.</inline>
                    Speaking with his back to me,
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline>
                    made some reference to a document which he was about to quote. Not being able to hear, I asked him what it was that he was quoting." The Committee is aware of the answer that he gave. If we have reached a stage in debate when an honorable senator cannot ask another to name the document from which he is quoting, without' receiving a discourteous reply, it indicates a deplorable condition of feeling which is not likely to conduce to the smooth and satisfactory transaction of public business. I will leave
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline>
                    to deal with his insinuation as to motives, merely asking him whether it is not a sudden liking for Select Committees which has led to this community of interest between himself and the honorable senator in charge of the Bill. One of the objections which' I see to the procedure proposed is this:
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline>
                    proposes to strike out two clauses in addition to the one which has been negatived. In doing so we shall negative certain propositions. He proposes to ask us to adopt certain clauses in substitution. Thereby he asks us to reaffirm the same propositions as we shall have previously negatived. Now, without claiming to have an intimate knowledge of the Standing Orders of the Senate, I do not think that that can be done.

                        <para>- I suppose it is always splitting straws when an objection is made to a course which the honorable senator wishes to have taken. We have struck out a proposition to the effect that evidence may be taken on oath. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> now wishes us to affirm a clause containing the principle that evidence may be taken on oath. I submit thatit is not possible to affirm a principle one moment which we negatived a few moments before. </para>

We do not seem to be proceeding now in the right way to legislate on an important matter of this kind. I make the suggestion with a view, as I said last year, of removing a doubt which exists as to whether Committees of Parliament have, under the Constitution, power to administer an oath. I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild.</inline> in the most good- humouredway. to adopt the course I have indicated, and I shall be glad to afford him any assistance, which, it would appear, the Government are not inclined to extend. </para>

                    BAKER (South Australia). - It is a long time since the Standing Orders Committee considered this matter, and I do not pretend to recollect everything that took place. I do remember that I raised the question as to what Court should be competent to try these offences, and I pointed out that the Commonwealth Judges had no criminal jurisdiction. The parliamentary draftsman attended, ami convinced the Standing Orders Committee that I was wrong, and that State Courts, or the Supreme Court of the Commonwealth, could try these cases. Whether that contention is right or wrong, I am not now prepared to say, but we were convinced at the time, and if is too much lo ask me what arguments were used by the parliamentary draftsman ten months ago to convince the Standing Orders Committee. If there is any doubt on the subject, it would, perhaps, be as well to get the opinion of the Attorney-General. ' I should not take the responsibility of saying that a Court need not be indicated, because I had doubts on the subject before, and raised the question. As I have said, we were convinced at the time by the parliamentary draftsman that my doubts were not well founded.

If we provide that a certain thing shall be an indictable offence, any one who has committed, or is alleged to have committed, that indictable offence in any State of the Commonwealth can be prosecuted as he would ordinarily be prosecuted in a State matter in relation to common law, or in respect of a State statute matter, which was the subject of indictment. We provide simply that in certain circumstances a person shall be guilty of an indictable offence, and he can then be prosecuted in any Court of the State in which he is that has power to take cognizance of indictable offences, and can be dealt with in accordance with the procedure of that Court in respect of all indictable offences. We have that full power, and if we could not throw upon the Courts of the States the obligation to give effect to Commonwealth provisions in respect to indictable offences, we should find ourselves hampered and crippled in the exercise of almost all the powers given to us under the Constitution. </para>

But I make a definite promise that I shall institute full inquiries into this matter- - other honorable senators may do the same if they please - and if, at a later stage, it should seem in any way desirable to re-discuss clauses 7 and 8, I shall be quite willing to consent to a recommittal of the Bill for that purpose.

                    (New South Wales).I have a word or two to say on the penalties proposed. It appears to me that in the preparation of Bills for the Commonwealth we have in every case adopted the maximum penalty for an offence which prevails anywhere. Honorable senators will notice from the marginal notes of the clauses in the report of the Standing Orders Committee that this legislation is not based on the legislation in any particular place. The Committee would appear to have jumped from Canada to Queensland, and have in every case adopted the highest penalty. If Canadian legislation suggests the highest penalty, they have copied the Canadian legislation, and if Queensland or New South Wales legislation proposes a higher penalty for some particular offence, they have adopted the Queensland or New South Wales provision.

It is not desirable to cover the statute-book with offences, and make things criminal which contain no criminal element. The committing of offences is bad, and necessarily the arm of the law should extend to them and punish them. On the other hand, there is nothing more to be avoided in legislation than "creating new offences and attaching heavy terms of imprisonment to them. </para>

                        <para>- The resisting of the police, or the resisting of a warrant of apprehension, ought not to be made an indictable offence, but an offence punishable on summary conviction before a police magistrate. In the preceding clause, the expression used is " escaping from custody," not "escaping from custody without reasonable cause." The escaping from custody may have been unintentional. Wc cannot ' expect laymen like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> to be familiar with all these matters. I merely call attention to them because we know that " resisting the police " is an offence usually punishable on summary conviction. No doubt a Judge who was trying a case under this provision would tell the jury in certain circumstances that the offence was contemptible, and the charge ought not to have been brought, but still the jury would be entitled to return a verdict of guilty, and so brand the man as a convicted felon, when, perhaps, what he did was, after all, verv venial. I invite <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> not to take the Bill out of Committee this evening, but to consider whether these offences mav not be treated like the ordinary offence of resisting the police, punishable on summary conviction. </para>

                        <para>.- Well, I have seen an assault committed on a SerjeantatArms. A man can commit an assault on a person by merely pointing a loaded rifle at him, although he is 1,000 yards away. Perhaps the Standing Orders Committee erred on the side of severity in this matter. As a layman, I am not sufficiently acquainted with the intricacies of legal procedure to instantly suggest the phraseology of an amendment which would bring this particular offence into the category of an offence punishable on summary conviction. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> cannot supply me with the words of an amendment, I would ask the Committee to postpone the clause. </para>

                    BAKER (South Australia). - Before the clause is postponed I would ask honorable senators to consider the position of the Senate. It is suggested that if a warrant is issued by the Senate, it may be' set at naught, that a person may obstruct the officer intrusted with the execution of a. warrant, and that only a small offence will thereby be committed. I take the view that the position of the Senate is such that it ought fo enforce its power and authority by severe punishment. I am not wedded,, to a term of three or two years,_but I submit that we ought not to bring the Senate down to the position of a police magistrate.

                    has entirely misunderstood what I said. I did not say or suggest for a moment that the Senate should be brought down to the position of a police court. What I do say is that the dignity of the Senate does not require to be supported by creating indictable offences, and making a man a criminal, liable to be placed in the dock, simply because he may have technically obstructed the execution of a warrant for his apprehension.

                        <para>- Surely a penalty can be -imposed which does not require a man to be charged with a criminal offence, and branded as a felon. " Obstructing the execution of a warrant " is, I repeat, simply " resisting the police." The warrant will not be executed by the Senate, but by an executive officer, probably a policeman. If there is a resistance of a constable, that surely is punishable in a Court of summary jurisdiction. What I object to is that the Senate should make (that act an indictable offence, however venial it may be. In this country we ought not to be so ready to create indictable offences punishable by imprisonment. Of course it may be said that the dignity of the Senate requires thai no ordinary penalty should be inflicted, but that we ought either to give a year's imprisonment or go back to the time of the Inquisition and satisfy our dignity by handing the man over to the rack' and the thumb-screw. </para>

                        <para>- No; but the Act of 1 901. makes express provision to include " information " in " indictment." It might be argued from that fact that the word " indictment," or any adaptation of the idea of indictment, is always to carry a similar idea in connexion with " information " ; there is a rule of construction which provides for that. But where an Act constitutes an offence, and the liberty of the subject is involved, it always receives the most strict interpretation - as strict as possible against the Crown, and as favorable as possible to the accused. It might be argued that although we had constituted a thing an indictable offence in a certain State in which informations took the place of indictments, it would not be an offence that could be dealt with in its Courts. This matter came under my notice a little while ago, after we had provided in the Wireless Telegraphy Bill for a very heavy maximum penalty. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> raised a criticism, as to its imposition. Having inserted a very heavy maximum penalty, which carried with it the alternative of imprisonment, I brought down a new clause, which I would recommend to Senn tor Neild as She form of a clause which would meet all these cases and perhaps satisfy the criticism of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon.</inline> It reads in this way - </para>

                <para>If that provision, with necessary alterations, were adopted, it would be competent .for the prosecuting officer to prosecute, in the first instance, in a Court of summary jurisdiction, and if that Court considered that the circumstances surrounding the alleged offence were so trivial as not to warrant the infliction of punishment above its maximum powers, in accordance with the Acts Interpretation Act, it would proceed to deal summarily with the man. But if the circumstances of the case disclosed an offence of such great gravity that it deserved very severe punishment, then the Court could exercise its option of dealing with the man there and then, or sending him on for trial. Honorable senators will notice that in clause 8a of the Wireless Telegraphy Bill I did not adopt the words of the Acts Interpretation Act, " may be prosecuted on indictment," but used these words " may be dealt with summarily, or may be committed for trial." If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild,</inline> after providing for his penalties, would provide that Ohe proceedings in respect of any offence may be instituted in a Court of summary jurisdiction, I think it would meet the case. </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline>
                    practically suggests the omission of the word "indictable," and at a later stage in the Bill proposes the insertion of a provision similar to that in the Wireless Telegraphy Bill, which should meet with the approval of
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon.</inline>
                    If the offence is trivial it can be dealt with summarily. If it is a grave offence, the person can be committed for trial at the discretion of the magistrate. That is a wise proposal, and I should be very glad to see it inserted. I am prepared to. move that the proposed new clause be amended by leaving out the word " indictable," and by leaving out the word " three," with a view to insert in lieu thereof the word "one."

                    (New South Wales).It appears to me that not only should the term of imprisonment be reduced, but that there ought to be an alternative money penalty. Some of the offences might be of such a trivial character that they would be met by the imposition of a small fine. What the amount should be I am not in a position to state. Perhaps ^20 would be sufficient. If
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline>
                    will agree to amend the clause in that direction I shall be satisfied.

Who is the man who would be likely to refuse to give evidence before a Select Committee? He who had something to hide, and would probably have been making money by improper practices. A fine of
                    <inline font-style="italic">£50</inline>
                    or ,£100 would be nothing to such a man. I trust that we shall adhere to the Bill as drafted by the Standing Orders Committee, who have thoroughly considered the subject. This amendment has been asked for by some who represent the wealthy portion of the community, and who wish to shape the Bill to suit them.

                    <para>- As a member of the Standing Orders Committee I have listened with great attention to the discussion, and it appears to me that the more the Committee depart from the recommendations made the worse legislation we shall get. I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> who has had a vast experience in Courts, whereas I have had very little, whether what are here called indictable offences are not to be found described as such in almost every Act? I take it that if a man escapes from custody and defies the Senate he is guilty of a grave offence in setting at defiance the law, and rendering it impossible for us to carry on our business. If a man wilfully and deliberately obstructs an officer who endeavours to serve a warrant of the Senate, he may have to go to gaol, and possibly he ought to go, and not simply be let off with a fine. It appears to me that we should act very wrongly if we reduced the penalties proposed for such a case. In every instance I should like to see the greatest discretion vested in the magistrate or judge, with fine or imprisonment provided for offences. Magistrates, even of the most humble experience, always have regard to the nature of the offence. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. Some honorable senators seem to forget 'that, with a maximum imprisonment of twelve months, _ it is quite likely that an offender will be let off with a week's imprisonment for a small offence. But considering what we see around us in our daily life, we may make those penalties a great deal too low, and there is not much danger of making them too high when we name a maximum. </para>

                        <para>- Even so, there is such an enormous difference of degree in offences that legislation does not " make the punishment fit the crime," unless there be some penalty between imprisonment for a week and imprisonment for two or three years. What was attempted in connexion with the Butter Commission, and what is now happening in New South Wales, show us that there ought to be a very stiff punishment for men who refuse to give evidence - who, by omission or neglect, may absolutely take part in conspiracy to defraud. At the present day crime is finding a different rut or trend, and I believe that in the future, more than in the past, we shall have to punish men of education and culture who have found out modern ways of putting other people's money into their pockets in a gentlemanly kind of way. For these reasons I think that the Committee will do wrong if they make the penalties too small. </para>

                    NEILD (New South Wales). - The clause under discussion deals with minor offences, but the next clause, to which reference has been freely made, deals with the more serious matter of refusing or neglecting to appear. For the latter offence the Standing Orders Committee recommend a fine of ,£50, but no punishment by imprisonment.

                        <para>.- I think What we should do is to follow the example of the Standing Orders Committee in regard to the clause under discussion, and also provide the punishment of imprisonment, iri addition to a fine, under the following clause. I propose that under the next clause there Shall be precisely the same penalty of ^50, or imprisonment for a year, or, if honorable senators like, ^100 or two years. I do not wish to reduce the penalties, but we might reasonably make an effort to apportion them with some greater degree of justice than is apparent in the proposal before us. I ask the Committee to omit the word ""indictable," and to make the penalty <inline font-style="italic">£,$o</inline> or one year's imprisonment. I move - </para>

                    <para>- I think honorable senators are taking a wrong view of the proposal. The offences which are contemplated are extremely serious ; they cannot, under any possibility, be considered trivial. First of all, a warrant will not issue unless there has been a refusal to attend; and whatever happens under this clause cannot happen unexpectedly, or come as a surprise. Therefore, whatever action is taken in resisting or preventing the execution of an order of the Senate will have to be taken deliberately ; and that is a very serious consideration. </para>

                        <para>- -Then everybody ought to be made to know by sad and bitter experience. It is a very serious matter to resist the decree of a Court. There was, for instance, the unfortunate murder case recently in Victoria. Suppose some person had come up and prevented ' the police from arresting the accused man, could it have been said that that person ought not to go to gaol, when he must have known that the man was being taken into custody for the most serious offence possible against the law? Must such conduct be excused because the person concerned has some strong feeling of friendship towards the accused ? If resistance is excusable on that ground, then resistance under the clause would be excusable, because, at any rate, the people against whom an order of the Senate, in the form of a warrant, is issued, must be persons who have notice. It is reasonable to assume that those who feel so strongly about such persons that they resist the law, will be their intimate friends, and consequently it must be assumed that they also know of the warrant. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> has suggested that a wife and children maybe punished under this clause. </para>

                        <para>- At any rate, it is very likely to be some member of the family. The brother of a person who refused to comply with an order of a Select Committee of the Senate, and against whom a warrant for his forcible production has been issued, might intervene and successfully prevent him being arrested. Conditions are easily conceivable under which a very serious loss might be entailed on a number of persons. The Committee might have to go to the furthest part of the Commonwealth in order to take evidence. They might in consequence have incurred considerable expense, and might have entailed considerable expense on a number of persons required to give evidence before them. Yet some person whose arrest under a warrant was successfully prevented, might, because of his absence, render useless the whole of the sittings of the Committee. Offences of that sort would be so serious that a fine of ,£50, or ^500, or any number of pounds, would not meet the case in certain circumstances. </para>

                        <para>- I think it would be as serious, and as it is usual to speak of Parliament as being the highest court in the land, it might not be unreasonable to say that it would be more serious. Certainly, issues more far-reaching might be involved than are involved in actions in a Supreme Court. We have recently had under \10tice 'two or three instances of Select Committees or Royal Commissions dealing with enormous interests, in connexion with which frauds, which were not accidental and not entered into in a momentary lapse, but deliberately, carefully, and scientifically carried out, have been conducted for years, not by one, two, or a few, but by an enormous number of persons in our community. Some of those persons have done everything in their power, first of all, to resist giving evidence, and subsequently to resist the production of necessary documents and material proofs. </para>

I have no desire to be satirical, to say anything offensive to those who are opposed to me, or to insinuate that they are wealthy or represent, wealthy people. I am dealing with this question as it presents itself "to us now, and, in my opinion, this offence might be so serious that its committal should be followed by a serious penalty, and I do not think a fine would be a sufficiently serious penalty for the purpose. If there should be some talk about making men criminals, I would ]say that where persons are imprisoned " until the rising of the Court " no one ever considers the imposition of such punishment as involving a serious disgrace. I fail to see how an offence against this clause could be trivial, but if it should happen that it was, the Bench would be able, at its discretion, to order such a form of imprisonment as would carry with it no stigma whatever. </para>

                        <para>- The Bill contains an item of£420 for the maintenance of Sydney Government House. Two or three days ago I asked an extremely reasonable question on this subject, and elicited that the agreement in connexion with Government House, Sydney, will expire at the end of the current year. I asked the Government whether they would give Parliament an opportunity of discussing the general question of housing the Governor-General outside the existing Seat of Government prior to committing us to any expenditure in that direction, and more especially prior to entering into an agreement with the Government of New South Wales for the use of their Government House. The Government answered that the Government of New South Wales were willing to continue the existing agreement, and that the subjectcouldbe discussed on the Estimates. That, I submit, is absolutely playing with the Senate. It has no power to amend the Estimates,, but merely power to suggest an amendment, so that any debate on the policy of maintaining Government Houses outside Melbourne would be absolutely futile. This question was thoroughly threshed out on a previous occasion, but we discovered that it was impossible to correct what many of us believed was a very grave injustice to the Commonwealth at large, because it had been committed by the then existing Government to the maintenance of Government House, Sydney. Now the position is entirely different. The existing contract has five months to run, and there is ample time, if only the opportunity is afforded by the Government, for Parliament to express a definite opinion on this very important subject. </para>

The last message is a cable from Lord Beauchamp, at the instigation of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne, then Premier of New South Wales, in which he directly recognised the responsibility of that State if New South Wales desired to have the Governor-General residing at Government House, Sydney. Recognising that responsibility he promised free railway travelling for the GovernorGeneral and his establishment. But what do we find ? After having offered to place Government House, Sydney, at the disposal of the Governor-General, the Commonwealth has to pay ,£3,000 a year for its maintenance. I contend that the establishment in Sydney should be maintained by the State. I entirely dissent from the proposal to extend the agreement between the Government of New South Wales and the Federal Government, and think that it should be allowed to lapse at the end of the present year. </para><interjection>

                        <para>- I have not missed my opportunity. The best proof of that is that the President cannot call me to order. I am " on the spot." I have now put the position clearly before the Senate. I hope that the Minister will give some consideration to it, and endeavour to meet the views of many of us. I have not trespassed upon the time of the Senate unduly in relating the history of the matter, having merely read the correspondence. If necessary, however, I shall later on move the reduction of a vote, and shall endeavour to induce the Minister to give us a more suitable time to discuss the question. In connexion with the defence vote, I draw attention to the item, "Department of Defence, division 42, Central administration." I propose to say a few Words about the valuation of defence properties. </para>

I think that, considering the way the duties of. the Department have been neglected, that vote ought to be reduced, and I shall probably move to reduce it. In 1901, a committee of officers was appointed to discuss the defence arrangements of the Commonwealth. That committee reported, urging that a valuation should be made of the defence properties transferred by the various States to the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>-I quite agree with the honorable senator ' that the staff and the committee are not the same body ; but the committee made recommendations, and it was the duty of those responsible to see that those recommendations were carried out. I urge that it is a gross dereliction of duty that those valuations have not been made. The result is that from 1901 to 1905 we have simply drifted along. The bulk of the defence stores handed over to the Commonwealth were obsolete. No valuation was made on behalf of the Commonwealth, but, nevertheless, quantities of stores were sold without reserve. Practically the Commonwealth received no return. </para>

                        <para>- It is very difficult for me to say that remarks in reference to any item in the schedule to this Bill are not relative to the subject under discussion. But I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> to try to observe the spirit of the Standing Orders, and not find excuses for not conforming to them. We are now discussing the Supply Bill; and the whole policy of the Government, in reference to the Defence Forces, ought not, it seems to me, to be brought under consideration. The honorable senator is quite in order in referring to an item for the payment of the Defence staff, but I think he ought to confine himself, as far as he can, to the consideration whether the item ought to be reduced or diminished. </para>

                        <para>- Undoubtedly, because, under the Defence Act, the Council of Defence, which is composed of members of the staff, is responsible for these executive matters. You shake your head, sir, but if you refer to the Act which was passed lastyear you will see that the head officers of the staff - those whose payment is provided for under the vote - form the Council of Defence. The General Officer Commanding has been dispensed with, and each head officer has specific duties to perform. Therefore, they, and not the General Officer Commanding, are responsible for the fact that this valuation has not been made unless, of course, the Minister intends to take the responsibility on himself, which I hardly consider likely from the way in which the honorable gentleman now smiles. </para>

                        <para>- That is the very thing I do not know. At the commencement of the sitting to-day, I asked the Minister, without notice, in the most civil way, whether he could give any idea when the valuation would be placed before the Senate, and he, in an equally civil way, said in effect, " Heaven only knows when the valuation will be forthcoming." That is what brings me to my feet, because I think the Senate is entitled to know who is responsible for this extraordinary delay. </para>

                        <para>- This is not a question of two valuators meeting and arriving at a joint conclusion; it is for the Commonwealth to make a valuation and submit it to the States. I do not ask that the agreed valuation shall be placed before the Senate; what I want to see is the valuation which is placed on the stores by the officials of the Commonwealth. There are thousands of pounds worth of useless guns and stores at the present moment in the arsenals of the Commonwealth, and we are to be asked at some not far distant date, to pay for those stores as if they were effective. We have had experience of several Commonwealth Governments, and we know that matters are brought before Parliament in regard to which the Government are already committed, and ithas been on several occasions futile to debate questions already prejudged by the Ministry. I am anxious to use every possible means in my power to prevent this happening in connexion with the stores. I know that in Western Australia there are stored cannon which are absolutely useless. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; because I say the valuation ought to be made. However, sir, in view of your ruling, I shall not labour the question further, and, probably I have said enough. There is another matter to which I wish to call attention in connexion with the Post and Telegraph Department, under the Western Australian item " Subdivision No. 2, Conveyance of Mails,£4,100." That item contains a proportion of a vote which I say is absolutely unjustifiable. It is in connexion with the Vancouver mail subsidy, which up to this year, 1905-6, has been defrayed by Queensland and New South Wales solely. Last year, under this head, New South Wales paid£12,587, and Queensland£10,227. This year, without the least justification - without coming to Parliament for a direct vote - the Government have, under the head of transferred services, of which this item forms a part, split up this subsidy <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> amongst the various States. I asked the Minister to-day what justification the Government had for treating this as a transferred service, and I was told that authority was derived from section 89 of the Constitution. On referring to that section, I find- (II.) The Commonwealth shall debit to each State - </para>

                        <para>- If it was treated as " other expenditure," it might be quite right,, and there might be less to say about it. But I have gonevery carefully into the matter, and if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> refers to the Estimates, he will find the item there treated as transferred expenditure, without the least shadow of a justification. Western Australia has never paid a penny to this subsidy ; and how, then, can it be contended that any portion of this vote shall be debited to that State as expenditure incurred "for the maintenance or continuance, as at the time of the transfer, of any Department transferred from the State to the Commonwealth"? It is a gross infringement of the rights of Western Australia to attempt to make that State liable under this head for any such subsidy. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, I may, in consequence, move a reduction of the vote. What lends a particular colour to the injustice of the proceeding is that when it was necessary to increase the subsidy given by New South Wales for a service to the New Hebrides, the matter was honestly brought before the Senate in the shape of a resolution, and we were asked to express an opinion as to whether the increase should be regarded as a new expenditure on behalf of the Commonwealth. That was a perfectly straightforward and honest way of dealing with the situation. The Government dare not treat this subsidy in the same way, because they know that if a direct motion on the subject were submitted to the Senate none of the representatives of Tasmania, South Australia, or Western Australia would acquiesce in the allocation of any of this expenditure to those States.^ Without any consultation with Parliament the Government simply slip this proposal in under the heading of " transferred expenditure," where it would be most likely to escape notice. That is a most atrocious way of dealing with the business of the Commonwealth. </para>

                    The honorable senator has given me a vast amount of information about the Government Houses in Svdney and Melbourne. I have not before heard the contention that the upkeep of the Sydney Government House should be charged to that State, and not to the Commonwealth.

                        <para>- The matter to which the honorable senator has referred will be looked into, but I do not think we should be mean in our relations with the Governor-General. As far as I know, all the States provide their Governors with more than one residence. At all events, in the little State of South Australia, we provide the Governor with a residence on the Plains and another in the Hills. I understand that in Victoria there is a Governor's residence near Melbourne, and another some distance away in a more elevated situation. It would appear to have been recognised in the States that more than one place of residence should be provided for a State Governor. In the circumstances of the Commonwealth, when we have two such States as New South Wales, which is designated by the name " Mother State," and the important State of Victoria, in which at the present time is the Seat of Government, surely it is not too much to ask, when we have not to pay rent for them, that we should keep the Government Houses in Melbourne and in Svdney in repair. If the Governor-General desires that two residences should be provided for him, I do not think we should begrudge the small expenditure necessary to keep them up. </para>

I know- that the officers of the Defence Department have proper stocks sheets prepared, and are getting out their valuations as fast as they can. I hope the matter will be settled in a short time. Of course, there is great difficulty in estimating the value of military stores which have been transferred. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> is aware that the obsolete arms to which he has referred were not obsolete when the States purchased them. </para>

                        <para>- Western Australia is paying <inline font-style="italic">pro rata</inline> with the other States for that service, which is of more importance to her than it is to Queensland. If Queensland has to pay <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> a share of the cost of a service which is of special advantage to Western Australia, is it not right and just that Western Australia should pay on a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> basis for a service which New South Wales and Queensland make special use of? CanSenator Matheson say that that is not right and just? The old contract in connexion with the Vancouver service had run out. Under the old arrangement New South Wales paid an annual subsidy of £13,636, and Queensland an annual' subsidy of £10,227, a total of £23,863. The (wo States of New South Wales and Queensland paid the whole of that subsidy, and at the same time they were paying a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> share of the cost of the mail service in which South Australia and Western Australia were more particularly interested. </para>

                        <para>- The Government have decided that this service, the Orient service, and all over-sea services, shall be paid for by the Commonwealth on the basis of population. The only question we have to consider is whether that is a fair arrangement with the States as a whole. I say that it is. It would be manifestly unfair that Queensland and New South Wales should have to pay over ,£23,000 a year for a service which they use possibly more than other States, but which the other States can and do use to some extent, and should at the same time have to pay on a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> basis for another service which the other States use more frequently than they do, but which they occasionally use also. The proper way is to pay for these services by a Commonwealth payment on a population basis. </para>

I am unable to say that this matter will not be submitted in the same way as the contract with the Orient Company for the ratification of Parliament. Under the new contract for the Vancouver service, Canada will pay ^37)091, as against £34,091 under the old contract; Fiji will pay ,£2,282, as against £2,046 under the old contract; and the Commonwealth will pay ,£26,627, as against £23,863, paid by New South' Wales and Queensland under the old contract.

                    <para>- The item of £3,143 under the head of Parliament gives me an opportunity of directing the attention of the Minister of Defence to what recurs every time we deal with a Supply Bill, and that is the tremendous disproportion which the "contingencies " bear to the sums upon which they are contingent. I particularly direct his' attention to the item for the Library, where he will see that £10 is required for salaries, and £435 for contingencies. Can the Minister give the Committee any indication as to what items are comprised under the head of contingencies? I submit that to base £435 upon £1.0 is to verge upon the ridiculous. If we are always to be asked to pass votes for contingencies without getting detailed information the thing will become an absolute farce. </para>

                        <para>- No. The late Government considered the matter carefully, and I think I am in a position to say that its Treasurer had formulated a scheme for bringing the Estimates in some shape before the Senate after the Budget had been delivered - either in connexion with a Supply 'Bill, or in some other way - so that it could consider the items before the Appropriation Bill was sent up. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner thought it was perfectly feasible,, and it was that fact which led me to put the question to my honorable friend. I did not regard his answer as having a condition or understanding attached to it j he may have had it in his own mind, but he gave me an unqualified answer, which was the one I expected to receive, and I took it as meaning that probably the present Government had considered the question from the same point of view, and discovered some method by which the idea could be carried out. I know of no constitutional difficulty in the way. </para>

                        <para>- The other House likes to retain the Appropriation Bill as long as it can, but I do not see why there should be any difficulty in getting the Estimates in detail brought under the consideration of the Senate before the Appropriation Bill is sent up. If there is any difficulty of procedure it ought to be got over. We ought to develop a new departure if necessary, because it is folly to talk about the Senate being on an equal footing with the other House with regard to expenditure if we have thrust before us - it has been inevitable in the past - the detailed Estimates during the last days of the session. Last year I felt everything which was said on the subject. I recognised that we were labouring under a disability in that respect'. I hope that my honorable friend will consult his colleagues, and see if the idea cannot be carried out. It would be satisfactory to the Senate. It would facilitate business, and maintain that greater control over the finances which the Senate is supposed to have as compared with the upper Houses of the States. </para>

                    SYMON (South Australia). - In the vote for the Attorney-General's Department, under the head of " Secretary's office," we find an item of £180 for salaries, and an item of £45 for contingencies, and in order to hold the balance true when we come to the vote for the High Court we find an item of £130 for salaries and £670 for contingencies. Can the Minister of Defence tell us what the item for contingencies means?

                        <para>- I am very much astonished that the information is not given, because this matter has been very freely ventilated, both during the recess, and since the Parliament met. The expenses of the High Court were considered bv the late Government to be excessive, and if some statements I read in the press be correct, undoubtedly the expenditure was on a most extravagant scale. In many quarters the late Attorney-General has been adversely criticised for suggesting to the Justices and their officers that they ought to adopt a simple style in connexion with their travelling. He has been found fault with for doing that when I think he ought to be praised. I cannot see how it is possible for even a Justice of the High Court to spend £4 a day in travelling expenses. If he were travelling at his own cost, it would be nothing. But travelling at the expense of the public, as I should imagine, in a simple style, the cost seems to be altogether out of proportion. </para>

                        <para>- That is most extravagant. I cannot find out how the Justices travel. I may be accused of disrespect to the Bench for mentioning the matter here. But I look upon their Honours as merely officials of the Commonwealth. I do not see why , they should segregate themselves when they travel. I do not see why they should live at a much more extravagant rate than other persons do. They mix in society ; they go to races; they go to balls, and I understand that some of them go to prize fights. But apparently when travelling on public business they travel more like princes of the blood royal than ordinary individuals. </para>

                        <para>- They travel, I believe, in the most expensive way, but at other people's cost. They do not pay for it themselves, and of course the cost does not trouble them. I wish to enter my strong protest I do not know whether it will be of any service to say so, but I appreciate very highly some remarks made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> on this subject. We want more simplicity, both inside and outside the Court. I really think that it is most extravagant on the part of the Judges to spend money for travelling in the way they do. They ought to be called upon to give detailed statements of their expenditure. It may seem to be <inline font-style="italic">infra dig.,</inline> and trenching somewhat on the high dignity of the Bench, to ask for this sort of 'thing, but really to my mind it has become something approaching a scandal. The Senate would be failing in its duty if it did not insist on more economy on the part of the Judges when travelling. The Minister in charge of the Estimates ought to have more information to lay before honorable senators. </para>

                        <para>- Because it has never been done in the past, is that a reason why it should not be done in the future ? Our responsibility for the finances of the Commonwealth is very great, but hitherto we have had very little opportunity to exercise any control- The Estimates have never reached us until a very late period of the session, when every senator was anxious to get away from Melbourne. The consequence has been that the work has been scamped. The other House had passed the Estimates and wound up its work before the subject was handed over to the Senate, and if we had attempted to discuss it in detail and at length we should have incurred opprobrium from members of another place. Our control over expenditure ought to be something more than a mere sham and a farce as it is now. We ought to have an opportunity whenever a Supply Bill comes up to discuss every matter in connexion with public expenditure. It is of no use to put it off until the end of the session, when the Estimates come up. </para>

                    <para>. - I really think that the particular vote to which I have called attention does require further explanation. On turning to the Estimates, I find that the vote for the current month, £670, for contingencies, represents a quarter of the total vote for the year. The total vote is £2,665. 1° the second month of the year we are asked for about one-fourth of that amount. This is beyond all bearing. </para>

                        <para>- In connexion with division 23 exactly the same point arises. I find that the amount set down' for supervision of works for the whole year amounts to. £3,000, but in this month of the year we are asked to vote one-half the amount, £1,500. I really think that the Treasury is running away from parliamentary control when, in the second Supply Bill qf the year, it asks us to appropriate one-half of the whole amount for contingencies for the supervision of buildings. </para>

It would be a pure waste of time if we were to pick out each of these items in view of the frank admission of the Minister, that he is not able to give' us any information on the subject. I have listened to his statement that it is not usual to give full information on a monthly Supply Bill. But while perhaps it might be unreasonable to ask the Minister to be prepared with information to that full extent on every item, yet there is such a succession of items where the amount we are asked to vote is greatly in excess of one-twelfth of the total for the year, that we are entitled to ask for :a reason. Without an explanation the whole position would seem to be reduced to an absolute farce. </para>

But looking over the Bill I find that his is about the worst of all the Departments in this respect. Fully half the amount voted is for contingencies. For instance, in connexion with militia pay we have, on page 10, £20 for salaries, and £420 for contingencies; on page 11 we find - pay ,£320, contingencies £130 ; on page 13, in connexion with rifle clubs, we find - pay £17, contingencies £5,000. </para>

                    (South Australia - Minister of Defence). - When the annual Estimates come before us for consideration, I shall give honorable senators all the necessary information. It has not been the custom to give full particulars on Supply, Bills of the character of that before us. As to rifle clubs and volunteers, there is, as I have said, no pay to be provided for, except that of instructors, and we lump the ammunition 'and other stores under the head of contingencies.

If we were inclined to criticise the Estimates now, we should immediately be told that they were not before the Committee, and if we moved to reduce an item in the Supply Bill, excepting by some such arrangement as I previously suggested, it would not help us to determine the amount that ought to be allowed for the month's supply. The Minister is taking the right position in one respect, in saying that exact particulars cannot be supplied, but we ought to have some approximate idea of what is intended to be covered by the amount set down. </para>

                        <para>- I forget which particular Government was in power, but I take it that a promise made by one Government is treated as an heirloom by the succeeding Government On previous occasions, the advance made to the British Government for the Royal Naval Reserve has been described as an advance to the "Imperial" Government. Exception was taken to the word as not being the correct official title of the British Government. The promise was then made that in succeeding Supply Bills the expression would be brought into line with that used by the British Government itself. I call attention to the matter, because I consider it vital. </para>

The promise of which the honorable senator speaks was not made by the late Government, but by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dawson,</inline> on behalf of the Government in which he was Minister of Defence. Iti my opinion, "Imperial " is the proper word, because it is the word used in the Naval Agreement, and also, I believe, in the Act.

In the part of the Agreement framed by the British Government We will find that the words are " The Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland." If the honorable and learned senator refers to any Act of the British Parliament or indeed any document in which this reference has to be made, the word " Imperial " is not by any possible chance used, except in connexion with India; and we are not in the position or India. I believe in adhering strictly to the correct phraseology in all these matters.

                        <para>- I desire to draw attention to the number of hours that Post Office employes in Brisbane - and also, I believe, in Sydney and Melbourne, although I am not quite sure - have to be on duty. Some of these men have to be at call from 5 o'clock in the morning until 10 o'clock at night, in order that they may make up a work-day of eight hours. During the whole of the seventeen hours they have to be on hand if the head of the Department desires them to do any work. Does the Minister representing the Postmaster-General look upon this arrangement with approbation ? A man may be called upon at 5, and be dispensed with at 7 ; called again at 9 and dispensed with at 11 ; called at 3 in the afternoon and dispensed with at 5 ; and called back at 9 o'clock, and made to work until 10 o'clock. Such conditions would be known as sweating if they prevailed on the premises of a private employer ; indeed, I do not think that a private employer would ask his people to spread their day's work over such a large number of hours. I should like to know whether the Postmaster-General will do something to remove this great source of complaint on the part of Post Office employes. The Commissioner has fixed those hours, and has been appealed to without result, so that it is high time Parliament interfered. The difficulty could, no doubt, be got over very easily if the heads of the Department and the Commissioner were anxious to deal squarely by the men. But it has been so long the custom to call the men at any and every hour that the authorities resent any attempt to place the conditions on anything like a fair basis. I am assured by the men that they are quite willing to sacrifice their own convenience to a great extent to assist in carrying on the work, but they consider the present regulations too bad. They point out that in a large number of instances it is not possible for them to go home, and they are compelled to spend the intervals either on the street, or somewhere else, to their great inconvenience and sometimes expense. In other cases where men had to go home there was extra expense incurred for car fares, railway fares, and so on. On the whole, the arrangement is a very unsatisfactory one for the men, and I should be pleased if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> asrepresenting the Postmaster-General, would bring this matter under the notice of the head of the Department, and try whether some better arrangement might not be arrived at. </para>

But I shall bring the honorable senator's representations under the notice of the Postmaster-General, whether he refers to them again in dealing with the classification scheme or not, in order that, if on inquiry the Postmaster-General' should think it necessary, they can be dealt with by him in conjunction with the Public Service Commissioner.

                    <para class="block">Although it is late, I move the second reading of the Bill to-night. I shall prob- ably not occupy much more than about half-an-hour, and then honorable members will have the advantage of being able to consider what I have had to say on the measure before they discuss it. Honorable senators have had copies of the Bill for something over a week, and have no doubt given due consideration to its provisions. Seeing that this is about the first time that we have attempted in any of the Australian States to legislate somewhat comprehensively on this subject, it will per- haps not be out of place if for a few minutes I refer to the origin of the law of copyright, and its gradual development, and briefly sketch the position in Australia at the present time. Honorable senators will know that copyright, as it exists, rests on the principle that an author is just as much entitled to the work and product of his own brain as is any private individual to any personal property, and that he is entitled to turn that property in the product of his own brain, to such profitable account as he can. Copyright did not, of course, engage any serious attention on the part of people until after the invention of printing. Prior to the invention of printing, of course, students who had given their attention to translating or writing a work, after completing it and submitting it to the public, found that what they had done had engaged so much of their time, that it was hardly likely any one would take advantage of their work to the extent of copying it in more than, perhaps, one or two instances. After the introduction of printing the possibility of, so to speak, indefinitely multiplying the product of an author's brain gave rise to a new set of circumstances. I think it is Hallam who tells us that the first recorded instance of copyright is a grant by the Senate of Venice in 1469 to a man named John Spires, and that was the right to reproduce <inline font-style="italic">Cicero's Letters.</inline> It had always been admitted that an author had1 undoubtedly the exclusive right to the manuscript of his work, but with the possibility of converting that work into a profitable book, and so multiplying it indefinitely, a new set of circumstances, as I have said, arose. </para>
                    <para class="block">Trade custom and the decisions of the Equity Courts always recognised that the author had an exclusive right to his unpublished manuscript, but as soon as printing came into existence, as honorable senators are aware, various Sovereigns endeavoured, so far as they could, to regulate, direct, and control, almost directly and personally, the licences to print and to publish by means of printing. It was looked upon almost as one of the prerogatives of the Sovereign, and Sovereigns used this prerogative, if .1 might so call it, to licence the publication of books from time to time for the purpose of granting monopolies to individuals, and at the same time, obtaining some compensating advantage for themselves. We find in the history of the early development of the law of copyright, that once an author published his previously unpublished manuscript, the question arose whether at common law he had any exclusive right to the multiplication of copies of his work. The Stationers' Company, as honorable senators will no doubt remember from their reading of the history of England, had its charter, and the Royal authorities conferred on the Stationers' Company the right and to some extent the duty of regulating and controlling publication. They exercised this right, or discharged this duty, from time to time by their orders and decrees. We find working with' them at the time, or some time a little later, the Star Chamber, which, by its decree in 1687, prohibited printing without a licence. In 1662, under a Licensing Act, the Lord Chamberlain was empowered to licence the printing and publication of certain books. This Act of 1662 was continued by successive Parliaments from time to time, and was finally repealed in 1691. Once it was repealed, again was revived the discussion on the common law right of an author, and the common law right of a printer to the exclusive right to multiply the publication of an author's work or works fust printed by the printer. I may mention, in this connexion, that in the history of this branch of law, up to that time, 'the people who considered themselves most concerned with what might be called copyright, were not the authors, but the printers. </para>
                    <para class="block">Nearly every discussion that took place as to the right of exclusive publication, as to the right of the printer in a book, and his right to reprint it once it had been produced, dealt with the question from the point of view of the interests, not of the authors, but of the printers and publishers, it was not until 1709 that there was a real Copyright Act placed on the statute-book. That statute was passed in the eighth year, of the reign o,f Queen Anne. It is still open to a considerable amount of doubt whether that Act really recognises that there was a right in common law to copy- right, or whether it contemplates bringing into existence for -the first time by statute a copyright such as we are familiar with today. At any rate, it was not until sixty - five years later, in 1774, that in the course of the case <inline font-style="italic">Donaldson</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Beckett,</inline> in which twelve Judges were called in to give their opinions on a certain number of questions categorically submitted to them, that a long cherished illusion was shattered. That was the illusion entertained on the part of publishers that they had something like a perpetual copyright, apart altogether from statute. It was just subsequent to this that authors began to recognise that authorship offered many df the advantages of a profession. Previously a good many of- the authors, to whom we are indebted for some of the best literature we have, wrote with a view to fame and immortality, and wrote at the same time under the patronage of some wealthy public or private man. The first statute of modern importance that we have in connexion with copyright, apart from a .Sculpture Copyright Act of 1798, and some Engraving Copyrights Acts, was passed in 1814, and it gave copyright to the original writer of a book for a term of twenty-eight years, or for life. The measure of copyright protection afforded by ( the Act gave rise to considerable discussion, and in 1842 the Imperial Parliament passed a Bill which is for all practical intents and purposes our starting point. By that Act copyright was given for a period of forty-two years, or for the life of the author, and seven years afterwards, whichever of the two periods should be the longer. Conditions were made that there should be a registration of the book at Stationer's Hall, and that it should precede any action for damages for infringement. Registration was not a necessary precedent to the acquiring of copyright; the publication of a book by a British subject in the United Kingdom, and a compliance with other conditions of the Act, entitled him to copyright. It subsisted in him, but if it were infringed by anybody it was not competent for him to take an action for damages for infringement until he had registered his copyright as prescribed by the Act, and once he had registered he could sue, not sirmply in respect of subsequent infringement, but also in respect of prior infringement. The copyright given bv the Act of 1842 extended the area of conyright to the whole of the British Dominions. So that if a British subject in England brought out a book which he copyrighted, he had copyright not merely in the United Kingdom, but throughout the (whole of the British Possessions. There was no corresponding or reciprocal provision made for those who brought out their books in any of the Colonies. It was a mere oversight, apparently not intentional, and the position was that any one who brought out a book in a .British Colony obtained only the benefits of the copyright law, if any, of that Colony. In 1886, the Imperial. Parliament passed a Copyright Act which, amongst other things, granted to colonial authors - that is, to authors in British Possessions - all the advantages throughout the British Empire that were obtained previously under the Act of 1842 by British authors who obtained their copyright in the United Kingdom. I wish honorable senators to bear in mind that all these Imperial enactments have force and effect throughout the British Empire, and that the copyright law of a British Possession is only supplemental to or concurrent with the Imperial legislation which is in force. For some time there has been a tendency on the part of different nations to enter into mutual arrangements with regard to the recognition of copyright from country to country. So far as Great Britain, is concerned, this was done in 1884 by Orders in Council, and by copyright treaties with foreign countries. But in 1887 there was held at Berne a Conference, at which a number of countries were represented. The net result was the drawing up of an agreement known as the Berne Convention by which the countries there represented agreed amongst themselves each to recognise under conditions specified any copyright obtained in any of the others. The English Act of 1886 was passed in anticipation of the Berne Convention. It provided that the Berne Convention might be adopted and applied by Order in Council. An Order in Council was consequently passed on the authority of the Act after the Berne Convention had been settled. So that the Berne Convention,, the Imperial Act of t.886, and other Imperial Acts, now apply throughout the whole of the British Dominions. The result is that, if in. say. Spain, &amp; writer brings out a book which is copyrighted there, he has also copyright in every other country which is a Dart v to the 'Berne Convention, including Great Britain and all her Possessions. When, therefore, an author? copyrights in his own country, the protection is extended by this international arrangement throughout the British Empire. That is the position in which we find ourselves to-day. By the Act of 1886 an Australian who copyrights :his book in Australia gets reciprocal advantages throughout the British Empire, and those countries which are parties to the Berne Convention. </para>

Apart from our States Copyright Acts we have therefore operating in Australia the Imperial Acts from 1842 to 1896, and also by the Order in Council under the Act of 1886, the provisions of the Berne Convention. In 1891 the United States, by what was known as the Chase Act, empowered non-citizens and non-residents to acquire a copyright in books published in the United States, but amongst other conditions all the work in connexion with the composition and printing of the books had to be clone locally. It was a provision of a more or less protectionist character. The book had also to be printed in the United States prior to -its being printed elsewhere. Analogously to this, I might mention that if an American dramatist wishes to acquire performing right, or, as it is sometimes erroneously called, dramatic copyright, in Great Britain, his first performance has to be given in Great Britain, or simultaneously in point of time in Great Britain and the United States. On the question of colonial copyright, the Imperial Act of 1842 gives copyright in books published in the United Kingdom, and under the Act of 1886 a colonial author who publishes locally is entitled to copyright throughout the British dominions, and also the countries which are parties to the Berne Convention. The English statutes are very numerous. Those which apply to Australia, as well as to other British possessions, number about eighteen, running from 8 George II., chapter., 13, to 2 </para>

I have just mentioned the conditions which the United States impose upon the acquisition of copyright. In 1875 Canada passed a Bill which would enable persons non-resident to secure , copyright, provided that it was first published in Canada, or published there simultaneously with publication elsewhere; but that provision seemed to be in conflict with the Imperial Act of 1842. Grave doubts were expressed as to whether it was competent for Canada to impose conditions on the acquisition of copyright there when that imperial Act already provided that British authors could obtain copyright throughout the British dominions. A Commission was appointed to inquire into the matter, and the result of the inquiry was that the Imperial Parliament had to pass a statute to empower the Queen to give her assent to the Canadian Bill. </para>

                            <para>- To some extent, but it was not so strict as in the United States. The Canadian Act gave rise to the consideration of many questions, and led in 1875 to a Commission being appointed to investigate the whole subject of copyright. They found all these divergencies, differences, want of harmony, and want of certainty pervading the whole statute law. They brought up a report recommending the enactment of certain provisions which would bring the copyright law into conformity with the requirements of the times. Every text book writer on the subject of copyright is constantly giving his readers cases where the utmost doubt exists as to what is the proper interpretation of the law. Scrutton, the celebrated writer on the law of copyright, speaks of the circumstances I have just referred to in these terms at page 48 of the second edition of his textbook - </para>

                        <para>It only remains to add that, the national question being settled for a time by the Act of 1842, increased facilities for intercourse, and the spread of education led to knotty questions of International and Colonial copyright. A Canadian Act of 1875, thought to clash with the Imperial Act of 1842, was the cause of the appointment of the Copyright Commission in 1875, under the chairmanship of the late Lord Stanhope, who, as Lord Mahon, had introduced the Bill of 1842. After taking much valuable evidence, it reported in May, 1878, and the changes in the Law of Copyright which it recommended still wait legislative enactment till the House of Commons shall set itself in order and make better arrangements for accomplishing the legislative work of the nation. </para>

                            <para>- Quite so. In France the term is the life of the author and fifty years after his death ; and in Belgium copyright is granted for the life of the author and twenty years after his death. This Bill will, if passed into law, have effect in the Commonwealth side by side, so to speak, with the Imperial enactments already in existence in connexion with' this subject. But we can make special provisions in our copyright law, and we can impose special conditions by which these special provisions can be secured. I will explain what this Bill purports to do. In the first place, in Part II. it sets out the method of administration, which is analogous, generally speaking, to the method prescribed under the Patents Act and the Trade Marks Bill with which we have dealt. Clause 12 provides for the transfer of the administration of States Copyright Acts to the Commonwealth. In Part III. copyright is defined. It includes the exclusive right in connexion with books and musical and dramatic compositions to do certain things specified. Amongst those things is included the right to abridge or translate a book. Those are rights which, under some conceptions, do not exclusively, belong to the owner of a copyright. But we are making special provisions in these particulars. Also in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> of clause 13 we make provision in the case of a dramatic work for the owner of the copyright to have the exclusive privilege of converting it into a novel, and for the converse. That is to say, we reserve to the author the right to novelize a drama or to dramatise a novel. The Bill also provides that copyright shall subsist in every book, whether the author is a British subject or not, which book has first been published in Australia before, or simultaneously with, its first publication elsewhere. We do not make that a condition of copyright in any case ; but we say that if the book has been first published in Australia simultaneously with its publication elsewhere, copyright shall subsist in that book. The word " simultaneously " means according to a definition in the Bill itself within fourteen days. Of course we cannot take away the copyright here which an author may have acquired in Great Britain, or in any of the countries having relation to Great Britain under the terms of the Berne Convention. But this provision simply makes it clear that when a book is published in Australia copyright under this Act shall subsist in it, and that all the advantages of this measure shall be given to it. We provide throughout this Bill a uniform period for copyright of a book, or of an artistic work including photographs for the performing rights in a dramatic or musical production, and for the lecturing right of a "lecture. That period is the life of the author of the book, of the work, or of the' lecture, or of the owner of the dramatic or musical work, with thirty years added in each case. </para>

Otherwise political addresses are excluded from the benefit of this Bill. The term of thirty years from the death of the author isadopted in consequence of the recommendation of the Imperial Royal Commission, towhich I have referred. I may add that this Bill has been drawn largely upon the lines recommended by that Commission, whose report has been published, and is available in the Library. </para>

It is further provided in the measure that the author of a book or artistic work shall be the first owner of the copyright in that book or work ; that the author of a dramatic or musical work shall be the first owner of the performing right; and that the author of a lecture shall be the first, owner of the lecturing right. I may mention with regard to lectures that a lecturing right may be preserved by the author in a very simple manner - by announcing orally before he delivers his lecture that he reserves to himself the lecturing right, or by means of a written announcement placed conspicuously in the hall where the lecture is delivered; the idea being, of course, that it may not be suggested that once a man has prepared his lecture and delivered it tothe public he has necessarily dedicated it to the public. </para>

                            <para>- There are special provisions in the law with regard to certain University lectures. It is obvious that, should the author so desire,, a man should be restrained, after having heard a lecture, from re-delivering that lecture orally, just as he should be restrained from taking a full note pf it and publishing it as a book. A provision is therefore made in the Bill to reserve the lecturing right in a lecture to the author of it, provided that he complies with some very simple conditions. Of course, if he prints his lecture and publishes it, he makes it a book, and may at once secure the protection which belongs to copyright in a book. Provision is also made for the case of joint authors and separate authors, and also for the case of encyclopedias and periodicals, and articles contained in such publications. These, however, are all of them rather matters for consideration in Committee. Provision is made in the clauses regarding copyright in articles published in periodicals, which secure in all circumstances due consideration, both for the owner of the magazine or periodical, and for the writer of the 'article. Provision is also made in the Bill for insuring that copyright shall be personal' property, and be capable of being dealt with as such. In -clause 29 it is provided that, although the right of translation is reserved to the owner nf a copyright, unless a translation of his book into a particular language is made within ten years from the date of publication, a person desirous of translating the book may make an application to the Minister, who may call upon the author or owner of the copyright to show cause why the applicant should not be allowed to make a translation. If the owner or author is not in a position to show cause, the Minister may grant the application pf the person desirous of making the translation. </para>

                            <para>- lt is provided by the Customs Act that copyright books cannot be introduced into Australia from piracies of any country. There are- other provisions in this Bill of a drastic character nearing upon the same point, to which I shall later on refer. In clause 33 the proprietor, of any news agency or newspaper is granted copyright in news obtained exclusively by him abroad for a period pf twenty-four hours. Part V. of the Bill deals with infringements of copyright. In this part of the measure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> will find ample provisions such, as he desires. There is, first, the ordinary common law action for damages in case of breach of any of these rights. That applies both to copyright in a book or artistic work, to performing rights, and to lecturing rights. ' In the case of an action for damages, if the defendant objects to the plaintiff's title, he has to give notice of his grounds, so that the plaintiff shall not be taken at a disadvantage. In clause 50 <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> will find that - </para>

                        <para>If any person (a) sells Or lets for hire, or exposes, offers, or keeps for sale or hire any pirated book or any pirated artistic work ; or (t) distributes or exhibits in public any pirated book or any pirated artistic work ; or (c) imports into Australia any pirated book or. pirated -artistic work, he is guilty of an offence and liable to a penalty. But there is a proviso that- no person shall be convicted of an offence if he proves to the satisfaction of the Court that he could not, " with reasonable care," have ascertained that the book or artistic work was pirated. We also provide that where there is an infringement of a dramatic or musical right, the person who has let the theatre or place of. entertainment where that infringement has taken place, may be prosecuted for" an offence, except that if the person prosecuted proves that he " could not with reasonable care," have ascertained that, the work was performed in infringement of the rights of the owner, he is not liable. I may explain that in most instances, the managers or authors who own copyrights in dramatic and musical works, invariably circularize the owners of theatres and other places of entertainment, and lists are in consequence generally kept in respect of pieces in which copyright subsists. Clauses 52, 53, 54, and 55, are provisions 'to which I invite the attention of the Senate, before the Bill gets into Committee. The united effect of them is this : Many piracies take place on the part of persons against whom it is useless to proceed for damages, or to take out an injunction, because, to put it in the vernacular, they are not worth powder and shot. Therefore, some summary remedies have to be provided to give authors protection against such piracies. In this instance, we make provision that a justice of the peace, may, on the application of any owner of a copyright, issue a search warrant, and order a search to be made,. the pirated goods may be seized, and the magistrate, may deal summarily with the matter of their disposal. We also make provision that the owner of the copyright, if he has reason to suspect that a person has pirated copies in his possession, may, by notice, require that person to deliver up the copies, and if the person does not do so he is guilty of an offence, punishable summarily, and liable to a penalty of j£io. But having armed the owner with a summary remedy, it is only fair to the other person and the community generally that the owner1 should be put in such a position that he will not exercise the power without due caution. Therefore, it is further provided, under penalties, that the owner shall npt give any such notice without just cause, and if he is prosecuted for giving notice without just cause the onus of proof is put on him that he is the owner, and that at the time he took action he knew or had reason to believe that such copies were in the other party's possession. These are some of the special provisions of the Bill, by which we propose to give protection to international copyrighted works, so long as they are registered under the Biff. The other provisions simply deal with pirated works generally. Part VI. deals with international and State copyrights, and provides for the protection of all such copyrights in existence in Australia prior to this measure. It is also provided in Part VI. that anybody who has either an international copyright or an Imperial copyright - and the latter includes the international - may register, and thus, in addition to all the privileges, powers, and rights he at present enjoys by virtue of the Imperial Act and the Berne Convention, he may then obtain all the facilities, privileges, and powers which are granted by the Bill, but which neither the Berne Convention nor Imperial legislation secures to him. It is simply provided that if a book be first published in Australia, or published simultaneously here with 'its first publication elsewhere, it has all rights under this Act apart from registration; and that the owner of an international or Imperial copyright, i'f he wishes the additional privileges! of this Act, mav:obtain them by the simple method of registration. Part VII. deals with the method of the registration of the copyright, and of the assignment and transmission of interests ; and the other provisions relate to the rectification of registration, and the necessity pf an owner registering before he sues for damages. The final part of the Bill simply makes provision against the suppression of books, and for regulations. If honorable senators have regard to the condition of the present law_ with the Imperial Act, the various State Acts, and the provisions of the Berne Convention in relation to international rights, all operating - they will see how necessary it is to have some clearly! defined1 system of legislation for the whole of the Commonwealth. This Bill is intended to meet the situation, and in great part it follows very largely the lines laid down by the Imperial Commission, which bestowed a great deal of care, attention, research, and thought to the whole subject. I think I can say with confidence that if the Bil] be passed in its present- - or anything like its present format will be regarded, not only in Australia, but in other parts of the Empire, as marking a distinct advance in legislation - perhaps the greatest advance that has been made on this subject, and one well in conformity with, and not behind, the necessities of the times. </para>
