                        <para>- I am not in a position to give the honorable senator a definite assurance of the kind which he desires, partly because, as I stated previously, the Postmaster-General is giving the greatest consideration to this matter, and partly because the pressure of parliamentary work lately has prevented him from giving much attention to departmental matters. No one knows when the session will end. I shall to-day again press upon my colleague the request of the honorable senator, and, if anything can be done to facilitate the granting of it, it shall not be left undone. With regard to the second question, I do not wish to express a preference. It is for the honorable senator to take whatever course he may think desirable under the circumstances. I do not wish to be understood to say that I approve of any particular course he may take at this period of the session. </para>

We do not know that there will be time for a Bill on this subject to be brought in before that date, if the recess should last for six months, as, probably, it will. </para>

                        <para>- All the necessary provision has been made for the upkeep of Government House in Sydney until the end of the financial year. Any further provision will have to be made by an arrangement, which will have to be submitted to Parliament for its approval when it meets. At the earliest possible opportunity it will be asked either to approve or disapprove of any arrangement which the Ministry may have thought it advisable to make. The upkeep of the building will, in the meantime, go on, and Ministers will look to Parliament to approve of any little expenditure, which may be incurred. </para>

                        <para>He was pleased that the Premier had accepted the suggestion to visit the forts. Personally, he always felt that, as Commandant, he was a State officer first, and a Commonwealth officer next. It was very well to talk of the Commonwealth military forces, but the State paid foi its own defences. </para>

                        <para>- This morning I have not had an opportunity of going through the newspapers as closely as usual, and therefore my attention had not been drawn to this report. If such a statement was made bv Colonel Ricardo, all I have to say is that it was a very injudicious one. </para>

The yearly report will be made up to the end of this year, and will take the place of that which used to be furnished by Major-General Hutton, but the time for its presentation has not yet expired. It is in course of preparation. </para>

                        <para>- I will make inquiries of the Prime Minister. Yesterday I informed the honorable senator, in reply to a question, that the Prime Minister thought it advisable not to lay a draft of an agreement upon the table, as the time is so near when we shall be able to lay on the table the complete contract; but I will communicate with him again on the subject, and see what I can do. </para>

                            <para>- I am not referring to military escorts, but to the fact that State Commandants act as members of the staffs of States Governors. It is not a thing that I object to, but I want to know by whose authority it is done ; whether these officers apply for authority to act in such capacities or not? My reason for asking the question is the statement made by Colonel Ricardo that he considered himself more the servant of the State than of the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- I think these officers are following an old precedent, dating back to a time before the Military Forces were taken over from the States. I cannot see any harm in the practice. I think it may continue to be followed. If the members of the staff of the Commandant of Victoria like to act as members of the staff of the State Governor, as they have done in the past, on the occasion of the opening or closing of the State Parliament, they are simply, as I have said, following an old precedent, and, I presume, they do so as a matter of course. They do not apply to me for permission. There is no necessity to do so. </para>

It is whether the Senate may congratulate him beforehand on having set aside a sufficiently large sum of money to provide for the establishment of naval cadets in his new scheme relating to the Defence Forces ? I draw a distinction between naval cadets and military cadets. I understand that the answer of the Minister referred exclusively to military cadets. Will he inform me whether a sum of money will be made available for naval cadets as separate from military cadets ? </para>

                            <para>- I do not think the Minister would object to give the answer I desire; because I am sure it is quite unintentionally that his explanation is not clear. The last answer which the Minister gave leads me to the belief that Tasmania would receive &#163;4.000 odd less, if the revenue and expenditure were both distributed on a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> basis than she does at present. Is that the meaning of the Ministers last reply ? </para>

                            <para>- In my opinion, my answer to the question is perfectly clear. The post-office in Tasmania, for instance, receives a certain amount of revenue with which the State is credited, and. under those conditions. Tasmania, for the year 1905-6, would receive &#163;4,000 odd less than under the present system. </para>

                        <para>- I intend to support the second reading of the&#34; Bill, because, to my mind, it represents an amelioration, though a very slight one, of legislation now on the statute-book, which, from my point of view, is extremely mischievous and unnecessary, and which has been probably the chief cause of a great deal of what I may call misunderstanding, and injurious reflection on Australia, in England and other countries. </para>

                            <para>- I think not. When we pass legislation such as that we are now seeking to amend, we must expect consequences to flow from the natural inferences drawn by men who are not in the inner secrets of the minds of those who promote the legislation - natural inferences drawn bv men who merely read the printed language of our statute-book as persons of common sense. I do not wish to deal unnecessarily with that aspect of the case, because I welcome, as everybody else welcomes, any modification, the effect of which will be to remove the stigma cast on Australia. I should have welcomed a greater modification, because, to my mind, that which we are now asked to consider is almost infinitesimal, and is surrounded by conditions and fettered with difficulties to such an extent that, when the amending Bill appears as an Act of Parliament, I am afraid it will do very little to dissipate the adverse criticism in relation to the encouragement of immigration to Australia. It is as well to remind honorable senators what we are amending; and I do so, particularly because of the interjection, just made from the other side of the Chamber. I recall the fact that the contract labour provision of the Immigration Restriction Act provides absolutely and unqualifiedly that persons under contract or agreement to perform manual labour within the Commonwealth shall be prohibited immigrants. </para>

                            <para>- I am speaking of the first enactment. I desire to deal with this Bill without heat or party feeling of any kind, but simply from the stand-point of one who, in common with other honorable senators, and neither more nor less, desires that, in the matter of immigration, Australia shall stand on a high plane, so far, at all events, as the mother country is concerned, and that the supply of the crying need of Australia which is admitted on all hands to be population, shall not be discouraged. The contract provision means that a manual labourer, under agreement, is not permitted to enter Australia, but, on the other hand, is discouraged and stamped as a prohibited immigrant. Such an enactment on becoming known in England, and read according to its, literal language, is justification for everything that has been said as to the absence of a desire on the part of Australia to welcome people from the mother country. We must look at this matter as men of ordinary common sense, and ask ourselves whether, if we were in England, and an enactment of that sort were presented to us, we should not say that the positive policy of Australia is to discourage the immigration of manual labourers. The proviso to this provision, in my opinion, makes the position infinitely worse. It is set forth that only those contract workers are to be admitted who have what is called special skill - that is, some abnormal qualification. The ordinary working man, or manual labourer, is not to be admitted, but only those amongst them of whom it can be said that they possess some special, or. as I have said, abnormal or exceptional skill. Any one, on reading that provision would come to the conclusion that the ordinary working man or labourer from England was to be excluded from Australia. The second blemish, which justifies me in saying that the proviso really makes the existing legislation infinitely worse, is that the tribunal chosen for the purpose of determining whether a person has special or abnormal skill is the Minister of the day. I shall never lose an opportunity to denounce the tendency in a great deal of our legislation to introduce the political element, and to constitute the Minister, who is here to-day and gone to-morrow, and is subject to all kinds of political influences and considerations, a tribunal to exercise so-called judicial functions. That, in my opinion, is improper legislation ; and we know what has happened in the past. I do not wish to raise the old questions about the six hatters, or the six potters. </para>

                            <para>-Or the incident referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Croft.</inline> , It is not that men have been excluded; but that the administration depends on the party to whom the Minister gives his support, or on his peculiar feelings and sentiments on the subject. One Minister may admit a particular set of men under contract, while another Minister may determine to exclude exactly similar workers. It is a proposition absolutely unreasonable and impossible in its application, that a Minister is competent to determine whether a manual labourer - an artisan or any other worker - possesses special skill which is not otherwise available in Australia and which makes him an exception to the positive rule of the enactment. </para>

But, allowing for all that, I say fearlessly that in substance the criticism to which this legislation was subjected to in England is amply justified, and it is greatly to be regretted, in the interests of Australia, that occasion should have been given for it. If that were merely my personal view, it might have little weight or influence, but it is the view entertained bv the leader of the party to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> belongs, who, in reference to some remark made, I think, by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLean</inline> in another place, said that he would be prepared to agree to a modification to bring this law more into conformity with the intention of Parliament. We know that the present Prime Minister, in speeches of great vehemence and eloquence, time after time, though months ago, and before he came into office, declared that the one pressing demand of Australia was increased immigration. </para>

                            <para>- Honorable members opposite, so far as I can judge from the expressions of their leader, yielded to the universal feeling of Australia that this contract provision demanded modification. I think that it ought to be repealed altogether. That is the view I always entertained. I opposed it originally, and shall continue to oppose it. But, whether it be repealed or not, it should at all events, be greatly modified, and the sting taken out of it. Changes come over men according to the situation in which they are placed. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> gets into office, and all his zeal for immigration evaporates. </para>

It is one thing to bring people here, and another to shut them out. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> would shut out people who desired to come here. I say let those who are willing to come here, come. But what has that got to do with land? There are two different policies of immigration. One is a policy under which people might be introduced in thousands, and the question of the distribution of land is a very important element in considering that policy. The question we are considering now is whether this barrier erected against immigrants coming to Australia from England- </para>

                            <para>- I do not care whether the barrier is a contract, an objection because of colour, or anything else. I say that we have erected a barrier against people coming from England to this country, and people whose admission to Australia is desirable from every point of view who are willing to come here themselves, and whose admission need not be associated with any land policy. We have said by our legislation, so far, that these people are not welcome. I say that the leader of the present Government took the view to which I have referred, and we expected that the policy of the Government would be in furtherance of that view, and would throw these barriers down. The solid opinion of Australia was being aroused upon the subiect. with the result that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> proclaimed from many platforms that something should be done. What is it that is proposed to be done under this Bill ? The essential principle of the barrier that Englishmen shall not be permitted to come here under contract, is retained in this Bill. In mv opinion, it is a proper and a prudent thing for persons desiring to come to Australia from England to enter into some kind of bargain, or contract, which will insure them employment when they arrive here. On the other hand, it is an equally proper thing that an employer who desires to have them here shall have some assurance that when he pays their passages, and gives&#39; them assistance to come here, there shall be for some time a fixed engagement, in order that his outlay shall not &#39;be unnecessarily risked. What possible objection can there be to persons entering into an arrangement of that kind? It is surely the best way to insure that immigrants, when they arrive here, shall not become a charge upon the Commonwealth.. It is a perfectly proper thing to enable good colonists to bring others here, who, in their turn, will become good colonists, and may in. future rise, as perhaps their employers have done, from smallness to greatness. We know that many of the men who came here in the past, and have risen in Australia, came in this way. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, thousands of them came to South Australia in that way. The very best of our colonists came out with just sufficient money to defray the expense of getting here. What detriment can it possibly be to a man to have it said that &#39;his passage money has been paid, and that he has been given assistance to bring his wife and family with him? These are the sort of people we want here, so long as they are in sound physical health. There is, in my opinion, no justification in fair play to ourselves, and much less to our fellow-subjects in the mother country, for the bar erected against men desiring to come here under contract. However, that principle is still maintained in this Bill, and it is surrounded by most extraordinary entanglements. Such difficulties are thrown in the way, that whilst the existing law is bad because of its directness, this Bill is nearly as bad because of the intricate way in which it proposes to harass and annoy people who are desirous to come out here. For instance, no immigrants can come into this Commonwealth under an oral agreement. If there is to be an agreement at all. it must be a contract in writing. If a colonist returning to England forgetfully, or without a knowledge of this particular law. engages a person to come out here and work on his farm, in his factory, or as his coachman, or anything of that kind, and makes the arrangement verbally with him, the man on coming here will find that he is a prohibited immigrant under this legislation. </para>

There is no necessity to provide for a case where the approval is sought after the contract is made, because the Minister can only give his approval when a copy of the agreement is filed with him. Then the contract is only to be operative if, in. his opinion, it is not made - in contemplation of or with a view of affecting an industrial dispute. </para>

                            <para>- I have no objection to the essence of this legislation. I supported! the principle in the South Australian Act, which I have quoted before. Our Masters and Servants Act contains this most excellent provision, that if persons are brought to the State under contract, and it can be proved that in respect of wages or anything else there has been misrepresentation, the contract is void and they are absolutely free. I am quite willing that a provision of that sort should be enacted by this Parliament. But that is not what the Government are trying to do. There are only two considerations,: Are we bent upon excluding workmen from coming here, or are we desirous simply of saying that they can come here under fair terms ? </para>

                            <para>- There are other considerations which affect the question of wages. There is the cost of the man&#39;s introduction. If he gets twice the wages which he received in the mother country, surely that is sufficient ! Of course it may be much less than he would receive after he had gained three or four years&#39; experience here. Does my honorable friend mean to tell me that a man without experience in .Australia would be entitled to the same wages as a man who had had experience in Australia? I know plenty of pursuits in the open air - in primary productions, and so on - in which, for the first year or two, a man is gaining Australian experience. Surely an employer is not going to pay that man the same high wages as he would pay to a man who had passed all his life under Australian conditions ! I do not wish, however, to go into that aspect of the question. The only thing we have to provide against - and in that respect I am with my honorable friends - is the making of a misrepresentation to a man, such as telling him that the wage he is to get is higher than, or equal to, that which is paid to experienced Australians in the same occupation. </para>

                            <para>- No. I remember the details perfectly well, because I happened1 to be in the case. Either my honorable friend &#39;wishes to shut out these people,&#39; because they are afraid of their competition, or the provisions of the Act are needlessly preventing persons from coming here whom we ought to encourage to come. The contract has to be not merely in writing, but to contain a copy of sections 2 and 3 before it can be approved by the Minister. First of all, you have to establish an .army of labour agents in England familiar with all the details of the Act before &#34;engagements of any sort can he made, and you shut out the possibility of anybody coming here who has entered into a contract without the assistance of that profession against which my honorable friend has so much prejudice - the lawyers,; because nobody would be able to tell a man that it ought to contain those provisions. A market gardener, or a farmer, or a pastoralist, who happened to be in England, or some person in England, who did not know the details of the provisions, might enter into a contract of which, when it came out here, the Minister could not approve because it did not contain sections 2 and 3. All I can say is that whatever may be the case under the existing law, if these provisions be enacted, the Minister will not be troubled with many contracts of which it will be possible for him to approve. Then, again, he can only approve of a contract before this unfortunate contract labourer lands in the Commonwealth. Of course, he mav land at some port of call temporarily - that is afterwards provided for - but if he happens to land on the shores of the Commonwealth, it may be by accident, what is to happen? The contract is absolutely void. There is no opportunity afterwards for approval. The Minister cannot approve of it. Without any chance of being saved from this accident, the immigrant is liable to a penalty not exceeding ^5, and the employer who had nothing to do with&#39; it, and perhaps did not come down to the ship in time to prevent- this awful offence, is subject to a penalty not exceeding <inline font-style="italic">&#163;20.</inline> Without benefit of clergy, the employer has to pay any sum the Minister chooses to name, up to &#163;50,to maintain this contract labourer, who has by accident stepped upon these sacred shores, and to send him back to the country whence he came. </para>

The Bill is a little better in one respect than the existing law. It is a small step towards bringing down the whole edifice which I hope to see, before many years, crumbling to pieces, and this legislation swept off the statute-book. In Committee, I hope to remedy the defects which I have pointed out. </para>

When his feelings only are consulted, he is apt to go wrong, but when he applies the logic &#39;that resides in. the back of his brain he goes right. Clause 6 of this Bill is certainly the most singular production that could have emanated from the brain of the most ingenious of draftsmen. There are other provisions, in regard to which I do not wish to occupy the attention of honorable senators, because we can&#39; deal with them in Committee. Those to which I have referred constitute the substance of the Bill. But the&#39;re is one feature of clause II to which attention may be directed before I come to the point which induces me to support the Bill. The clause says - </para>

                            <para>- A man can go home and bring back with him a whole flock of domestic servants. What a nice temptation that is to put before batchelors, who maintain establishments of their own. I do not object to the reference to personal attendants, &#39; because they are supposed to accompany their employers. With respect to paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> of sub-clause 2 of clause 5,  I see that the Minister has given notice of an amendment which makes an improvement in the draftsmanship. When that amendment is moved I shall support it. I observe that the condition with respect to the difficulty of an employer obtaining within the Commonwealth a worker &#34;of at least skill and ability &#34; is not to apply to British people or persons of British descent. That is not very much, but it is a distinct amelioration of the present law ; and because of the presence of that provision in this Bill, with very great reluctance on account of other provisions which, I think, largely detract from the benefits conferred, I shall support the second reading. </para>

                            <para>- I do not complain of that expression. It is a sop to sentiment. That is something of value. Yesterday we were dealing with sops to sentiment in relation to Japan. I think it is of far greater importance that we should, even putting it in that way, administer these sops to sentiment in relation to people in the mother country, who are our own flesh&#39; and blood&#39;. Even putting it upon that ground, I think the amendment is an advantage. But it will be an advantage in other ways - that it will relieve the Minister of a duty which it seems to me it would be impossible for any Minister to discharge conscientiously. How can he possibly say when a man comes here under contract that a person of equal ability and skill could not be found in the Commonwealth to perform the duties for which he is brought ? Such a thing is a travesty of legislation. But with this provision regarding people of British descent in our law, that difficulty will be removed. That is a very great advantage, because it will enable unofficial Australians going to England to combat statements which have been made, and to say with truth that whatever obstacles have been thrown in the way of people from England coming to Australia to better themselves - and to better us, for the matter of that - we do not desire them to be subject to all the difficulties which we are determined to throw in the way of other and less desirable races. That, at any rate, is something better than the bald position of the existing law. Instead of providing that persons under contract to perform manual labour shall not be admitted, with a proviso that the Minister may admit them if satisfied that they possess special skill, we now state that the Minister shall not inquire whether there are in the Commonwealth workmen of equal ability to persons coming from Great Britain or persons of British descent. These are the views which I entertain in regard to this measure. I should hare liked to see the total repeal of the contract provisions,, with a clear law dealing with the two things that we are all agreed should be provided against - namely, the importation of men to influence a strike or an industrial dispute, and of persons under false pretences. It is not a question of low wages to which two persons agree honestly and fairly, but of misrepresentation. Those are the two things we require to guard against. Subject to these, I think the present law ought to be swept from the statute-book altogether. Apparently we can only deal with the matter by instalments. We can, however, make advances towards a better position of things. This is a very slight advance; and if it assists us to rehabilitate ourselves in England, even to a slight degree, I think we ought to .welcome it. I am sorry, from that point of view, to hear some of my honorable friends opposite say that they are not prepared to make even that measure of concession, and mean to vote against the second reading of the Bill. </para>

                            <para>- We ought; but the repetition of an idea that must appear to be absolutely monstrous to every intelligent man, is what I cannot understand. We, as labour members!,, have again practically been accused of desiring, by this class of legislation, to prevent what we recognise as being a needful element in Australia - namely, the element of immigration. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> has practically told us that that is our attitude at this moment. Personally, I absolutely repudiate any such intention. I am as anxious as any man in Australia to-day that there should be an inflow of immigration. I believe that we have vast sources of wealth, and a country capable of carrying teeming millions of people. Under those conditions, I should regard myself as an imbecile were I to attempt to prevent legitimate immigration to the Commonwealth. I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> desires immigration to Australia, and so do I ; but his views and my views in this respect are, I am afraid, as far apart as the two poles. The honorable senator desires that we should open our doors unrestrictedly to anybody and everybody, so long as they can be employed to the profit of the capitalists. That is unquestionably the &#39;desire of the honorable senator from the bottom of his heart. </para>

                            <para>- I do not knowwhy <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> is. supporting the Bill. In one breath the honorable senator tells us that he believes in restrictions which prevent the importation of labour in order to affect industrial disputes ; and, in the next breath&#39;, he tells us that he is prepared to wipe out every vestige of legislation that has been enacted in this connexion. There must be some inconsistency somewhere. My experience in regard to contract labour impels me to do my level best to prevent any such dangerous system being followed in Australia in the future. In 1889 some of the employers of New South Wales began to introduce contract labour. One instance was that of the South Kembla mine, in the Illawarra district, the proprietors of which managed to engage under contract about 160 miners in Yorkshire and Scotland. The conditions of the contract were simply a reversion to the old binding slavery that was known so well in the early days of English mining. One condition of the agreement was that when these men entered Australia they were to be practically bound to the mining company for a period of twelve months, although their wages might prove to be only half those paid to men following the same occupation within the Colony. The result was that these poor fellows were absolutely stranded in Illawarra, and had to appeal to public charity to enable them to repay the passage money advanced -by the employers. This had to be done before these miners could stand up as free men and demand the ruling wages. I feel satisfied that there are honorable senators who would like to enable employers to import labour, irrespective of whether there may be thousands of men in Australia out of employment. In order to find places for the 160 miners engaged iti Yorkshire and Scotland, the Illawarra Company had to discharge 160 of the men already at work, and the latter were thus thrown upon the labour market of New South Wales. These are the sort of conditions which certain honorable senators would like to see revived. Can it occur to any one that we, who represent the Labour Party, would do anything to prevent honest contracts with those possessed of special skill, provided such special skill cannot be obtained within the Commonwealth ? We should be worse than maniacs to raise any objection, and we have never attempted to do so. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> may laugh ; but &#39;I tell the honorable senator that what we have tried to prevent, and what, I hope, we shall continue to try to prevent, and successfully, is the deceiving of men whom it is sought to engage abroad. </para>

This application was accompanied by statutory declarations by the applicant and his foreman. Representations were now made by the Premier of New South Wales for the release of the hat- . ters, as the prevention of their landing was arousing dissatisfaction. The Prime Minister replied that the men were prohibited immigrants within the meaning of the Act, and he had no option but to exclude them until exempted for special skill. Application for exemption had only been received on the nth December, and the matter had to be dealt with according to law, and impartially.

                            <para>- No. it is &#39;the Senate that is Dining under the influence of the honorable and learned senator&#39;s oratory. There are too many solicitors in the Commonwealth without work to do. With the exception of those who are most skilled, architects can get very little to do, and the ranks of musical teachers are overcrowded. I am asked what this has to do with the question, and I remind honorable senators that in the Commonwealth education is practically free. &#39; If the conditions of the working classes employed in manual labour as wharf labourers, coal lumpers, navvies, and artisans of every kind, are not such as men care to labour under, we can be sure that fathers of families in Australia will do their best to have their children educated so that they may get out of the ranks of those labourers. If the conditions under which manual labourers have to work are irksome and unsatisfactory, we know that parents will half-starve themselves in the effort to enable their children to get into the professions. What is the object of this Bill? It is a Bill to introduce contract labour into the Commonwealth. We know that in every large city in the Commonwealth - Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane - there is an unemployed question. Only the other day the Queensland Legislative Assembly passed a vote of&#163;7,000 to endeavour in some way to relieve the condition of the unemployed in that State. Honorable senators will find, if they peruse any labour newspaper published in the Commonwealth, that there are plenty of men available for labour in all the industries, including the sugar industry. I believe that this Bill has been introduced to provide for the introduction of contract labour for the sugar industry in Northern Queensland. </para>

                            <para>- That appears to me to be the reason for the introduction of the Bill. There are 7,000 kanakas in Queensland - the majority of whom are to be sent away from the Commonwealth within the next few years, although those who are married and have families will no doubt be permitted to end their days here. I looked upon the legislation proposed to exclude coloured labour from Queensland as something which would prove a boon to the workers, and find employment for many men who are scattered about Queensland, and can find nothing to do. </para>

                            <para>- I do. I believe that one of the first matters dealt with under it will be a contract entered into for the introduction of European labour into Queensland for the sugar industry. It cannot be doubted that the introduction of coloured labour into Queensland lowered the standard of living of all workers throughout that State. When an employer could get a kanaka for &#163;20 per year, he thought he was doing a fair thing in giving a white man double that sum. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> and those who sympathize with his views can succeed in lowering wages in one industry, it is an economic fact that the result must be a lowering of the scale of wages in every other industry. </para>

                            <para>- They do all kinds of things, from weeding the cane, which some planters consider unnecessary, to blacksmithing; because the law is evaded, and it is impossible to have a policeman always on the spot. The low wages paid in the sugar industry had the result of lowering the wages of the workers throughout Queensland, and it possibly also had a similar effect, though not to the same extent, throughout the Commonwealth. I should consider 25s. per week and keep, a low and unfair remuneration for work on the plantations in Queensland, and if contract labour is brought into the Commonwealth to work on the Queensland plantations at such a rate of wages it will undoubtedly affect the rate of wages in every industry in the Commonwealth. When we passed legislation giving the sugar planters a protection of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;6</inline> per ton on sugar, and the farmers a bonus, we acted very generously towards the sugar industry. Whenever the rate of wages was questioned in this House when we were dealing with that legislation, honorable senators agreed that in that particular industry it would not be too much to pay 35s. a week and tucker, because the labourers would require to be away from their homes and families, and the accommodation and food provided for them would not be of the best. </para>

                            <para>- The work is no doubt trying. It does not appear in the Bill, but, from conversations round about we can gather that the proposal now made is to introduce contract European labour. The Bill is like its companion measure, with which we dealt yesterday, hasty legislation. Before being brought forward such a measure should be freely advertised throughout the Commonwealth so that the workers in the various States may have an opportunity to pronounce an opinion upon it. . No State Legislature would dare to pass a measure of this kind, providing for the introduction of contract labour. And why ? It is because its members are nearer to the people. They are shoulder to shoulder with them every day. And herein lies one of the dangers of the Federation. We are away from our States - representatives of Queensland are thousands of miles away from the sugar plantations of that State, and because honorable senators are so far removed from their constituents, they are disposed to do what they would not think of doing in their own State. </para>

I say that all the labour required can be obtained in the Commonwealth. Let it be understood that we who may claim to specially represent the working classes of Australia; we, who have worked at the bench and in the mine, are prepared to allow Italians* Frenchmen, Germans, and any other Europeans to come here, provided they come as free men. That is the stipulation we made - that the labourer should land in Australia a free man. That is the stipulation we made as affecting the Britisher, and I think we should continue to make it. There is a provision in this Bill to permit Britishers to come in here without any restriction whatever. </para>

                            <para>- That is very true. -This Bill may form a part of the Prime Minister&#39;s .immigration policy. I would point out how erroneous that view is, if he thinks that he is going to bring about prosperity by introducing contract labour into any industry. If we wish to attract population, we should endeavour to follow the programme which that eminent statesman, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Richard</inline> Seddon, has been able to put in for.;e. New Zealand is attracting immigrants on- account of the prosperity which prevails therein. We, however,&#39; cannot keep the people we already possess. Every now and again those who can afford to go away depart, in many cases with a certain amount of capital. If the prosperity of the Commonwealth is to be advanced, the States Parliaments will have to modify their laws, in order to enable people to get upon the land and make a living, out of it. it the land laws of the States be amended in that direction, we shall attract immigrants ; but if we allow contract labour to be introduced into any industry, we shall undoubtedly enhance the difficulties of the working classes who are already here, and cannot get employment. We shall drive away more people than we are now driving away. What we want, in order to attract immigrants, if I may be permitted to refer to the matter, by way of illustration, is a high protective Tariff. If the working classes had fair conditions, reasonable hours, and good wages, we should have no difficulty in connexion with any industry. I hope that if the Bill gets into Committee, as I am afraid it will, an honorable senator will propose the insertion of a clause to the effect that the Government shall furnish to the Parliament an annual, return, showing the names of the firms, corporations, or individuals who have introduced contract labour, the number of contract labourers who have been brought in, the places to which they have been taken, and the work for which they have been engaged. </para>

I do not believe that it has been asked for <inline font-style="italic">by</inline> any one except sugar planters in a large way, who want a number of men to be employed in groups. It is not asked for by the average employer, and certainly it is not asked for by the working classes. The men by whom it is asked for - the planters on a large scale - are not those whom we ought to encourage. The men whose presence we require, in order to create a great Commonwealth, are not those who employ themselves), &#34;their sons&#39;, .and one or two hands, but those who cultivate a small block of land. </para>

                        <para>- I am quite sure that every honorable senator desires to make the people of this community as prosperous as he possibly can. I believe that, if it were thought by honorable senators on this side, or by the Government, that the Bill would do to our people the serious injury which is feared by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs,</inline> it would have very little chance of being passed. I desire that all our people shall be fully and satisfactorily employed, because no community can be truly great unless , its people are employed remuneratively, so far as that is possible. I do not think that the Bill is open to the very serious objection which has been taken to it by some honorable senators. Under our restrictive law as it stands, there is a possibility of introducing, contract labour under certain conditions, and although this Bill may apparently increase the possibility, still it is hedged round with such precautions as would prevent its provisions from being used for, an improper and unwise purpose. It leaves the door open &#39;to the people of our own kith and kin - to British subjects born in the United Kingdom, or to the descendants of such persons. It is only fair and reasonable that if a discrimination is to be made it should be in favour of people of our own kith and kin. We are all proud of belonging to an Empire which we hope will always hold a leading place among the nations, and in which humanitarian considerations will al ways. lie uppermost in the framing of legislation. Tt is only fair for us to recognise all British subjects born in the United Kingdom, or the descendants of such persons as our brothers, and to admit them to our community. But even then every precaution is taken in this Bill to protect the workers in the Commonwealth, because the contract has to be submitted to and approved by the Minister. He has to be satisfied as to the terms and conditions of the contract, and before- he can give his approval he has to be satisfied that it is not made &#34; in contemplation of, or with the view of, affecting an industrial dispute.&#34; It will be remembered that the primary object of our legislation, in regard to contract labour, was to prevent the introduction of a large number of men at a time when an industrial dispute was in existence, and so give employers an&#39; opportunity of defeating what might be the legitimate aspirations of their late workmen. Those provisions are still retained in our law. and apply to an Englishman as well as to a foreigner. But this Bill will give a further advantage. By paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c</inline> of sub-clause 2 of clause 5 it will prevent the introduction of men with a view to the cutting down of wages. If in Melbourne an employer wishes to bring out men under contract, he will have to satisfy the Minister that the contract immigrant will enjoy the same remuneration and other terms and conditions of employment as local workmen. </para>

                            <para>- The Bill provides that an employer shall not import contract labour &#34; in contemplation of or with a view of affecting, an industrial dispute,&#34; or subject to conditions less advantageous than those which are enjoyed by local workers. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> entertains the fear that &#34;employers will flood the market and cut down wages, but he is willing to allow fifty or 100 men who are receiving 30s. a week in England to come out to Australia to be employed at <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2</inline> a week. But where a man is brought out under contract at a wage of, say, <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2</inline> a week, with an engagement lasting for a number of years, who should object? No contract labour can be brought out without a great deal of expense, inconvenience, and risk to the employer. It is not reasonable to assume that any employer, or body of employers, would bring out a number of men to flood the market and bring down wages. They would, by doing so, not only run the risk of losing their money, but I am not sure that they would not run a great risk of prosecution for conspiracy. This Bill is surrounded! by restrictions &#39;to protect the interests of those who are already in the Commonwealth. But it is impossible for Australia to achieve the destiny which we all hope and believe is in store for her, unless she gets rid of some portion of the restrictive legislation she has in force at present. </para>

                            <para>.- We want people to come out with a prospect of being able to maintain themselves for a reasonable time. I should be better pleased if we had an opportunity to deal with this question of immigration on a far larger scale. I should like to see opportunities given to persons to settle on the soil of this country, and become producers ; because, without that, we cannot have a material increase of employment in the cities and towns, or an addition to the industries of the Commonwealth. Unfortunately, however, we have not control of the lands. All we can do is to say to the States Parliaments. &#34; Make provision to put people on the land, and we will see that they are brought out.&#34; </para>

But while we are in our present position, are we to say to a man who has capital : &#34; You can come to Australia if you like, but you will have to take your chance of finding employment on the spot, and subject to such restrictive legislation as you find in force &#34; ? The more people we have in the country, the more employment there must be for our population. No man can come to Australia without requiring some work to be done for him. Take the case of a man who comes out under contract, and earns <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2</inline> or ^3 a week. He spends the money which he earns amongst the members of the community. He creates work for other people. . <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> has said that we have too many doctors, too many briefless barristers, and too many solicitors who are pining for want of employment. Why is that? Simply because there are so many people in the community who wish to put their sons into what they look upon as genteel professions. They do not give them a chance of earning a living in occupations where their services are likely to be required by the community. Many people appear to think that there is some charm in making a man a lawyer or a doctor. It is considered that it gives him a sort of position in the community. People are not so anxious to make their sons mechanics, following occupations where they could do good for themselves and for the country. It is not sufficiently recognised that there is a dignity in labour. I do not care what occupation a man follows, so long as he is working honestly for his living. </para>

                            <para>.- That is the best solution of the difficulty we can have ; but we must go step by step, and this Bill is a step in the right direction. I would rather see the Bill very much wider than it is, now in its scope; but even as it stands it will be of great value. I should have no objection to a return being tabled every twelve months, giving the names of people who have taken advantage of this measure, the number of employes they have brought into the com. munity,and the position of these people at the end of twelve months. I believe the result would be a revelation to honorable senators who opposed the&#39; Bill. I acknowledge that they oppose it honestly, but they are mistaken. Such a return would show the beneficial effects of this measure upon the community in. general. The Bill affords no opportunity to flood the market with labour. It gives no opportunity to introduce immigrants under unreasonable conditions. There are Factories Acts and Wages Boards in several of the States. </para>

                            <para>- They have in many of the States. Under the Commonwealth, the working classes have the fullest opportunities of exercising their rights. There could not be a freer Constitution than ours. It is true that some of the States have nominee Legislative Councils, but the working classes are not without influence in them. Now, I should like to direct attention to one or two points connected with the language of this Bill. I think it would be wise to make it clear that immigrants who come out tinder the measure are not subjected to the dictation test. Under clause 6, i&#39;t is provided that if a contract immigrant lands in Australia before the Minister has approved of the terms of the contract it becomes void, and the immigrant is liable to a penalty of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;5.</inline> I do not think it is a reasonable thing that a man who is induced to come to Australia should be rendered liable to such a penalty simply because his contract is void owing to an oversight on the part of his employer. The hardship of imposing a penalty on  the immigrant was pointed out by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> and also by the Minister, but the latter remarked that there was some recompense, because it was within the power of the Executive to direct the payment of a certain sum of money, not exceeding&#163;50, to the immigrant. That sum is not intended to recoup the immigrant for any penalty that may be inflicted upon him, but is really meant to maintain him until he can find suitable employment, or to enable him, if he so chooses, to return to the country whence he came. Even if the intention were to recoup the immigrant, the proper course would be to render the employer, and the employer only, liable to a penalty, and not by a round-about means to make him liable for a fine supposed to be inflicted on the immigrant. We are all agreed that we do not desire to give people in other parts of the world opportunity to misrepresent the intentions or desires of the Commonwealth Parliament. But there will be a very serious hindrance to the removal of these impressions which, rightly or wrongly, prevail, if our laws indicate that a man, by a simple omission on the part of his employer, may become liable to a penalty. Such a provision is utterly contrary to all the principles of British fair play and justice; and I hope that, if the Bill goes into Committee, this objectionable feature will be removed. I raise no word of objection to a penalty being imposed on an employer who fails to comply with the law, because, if he takes advantage of the legislation, it is his duty to make himself acquainted with its provisions. As to the importation of men under contract in case of an industrial dispute, I have already pointed out that the Bill requires the Minister to be satisfied that an agreement is not made in contemplation of any such event. If, however, a Minister be misled, and he assents to a contract which violates this provision, the Bill later on enables him to protect those who are interested or concerned in an industrial dispute. In clause 9 power is given to the Governor-General to publish an order in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> to the effect that, after a date specified, the immigration of contract immigrants in connexion with, or in contemplation of, an industrial dispute, shall be prohibited, subject to exceptions and limitations expressed in the order. That clause further provides that from the date so specified, contract immigrants shall be subject to the exceptions and limitations within the meaning of the Immigration Restriction Act of 1901. By this clause any section of the working community, who are engaged in what they regard as a legitimate industrial dispute, are absolutely protected against any mistake on the part of the Minister. That provision must be regarded as most reasonable; and I cannot conceive of any objection to it on the part of honorable senators, who, I assume, are desirous to promote the prosperity of the community-. The only weak point in the Bill, from a labour stand-point, is the fact that the Bill makes an exception in regard to our own kith and kin. In the case of men who are not our own countrymen, the Minister has to be satisfied that there is difficulty on the part of an employer in obtaining within the Commonwealth workers of at least equal skill and ability. This provision, and this provision only, does not operate in the case of men from England who are British subjects bom in the United Kingdom, or their descendants born in any part of the British Empire. I have already urged upon honorable senators the fairness and justice of working amicably with our own fellow countrymen, who, after all, are only separated from us by an imaginary border, seeing that we are all citizens of the British Empire. It would be as unreasonable to say that a working man in New South Wales shall not be employed in Victoria, as to say that the British subject born in Great Britain shall not be employed in Australia. The principle is exactly the same; and I wish honorable senators to realize that the people of the Empire are one. If we desire to keep the British Empire in its present position, and to protect all British coasts and territories, we must be imbued with the knowledge that we are one people with one destiny. When this Federation was formed that was the cry that was raised ; and the phrase, &#34; One&#39; people, one destiny,&#34; should take a far broader scope than that which was then contemplated. Australia is not an independent country, with ideals, principles, and objects hostile or foreign to those of Great Britain. Throughout the Empire there are advocates of every possible means of ameliorating the condition of the working classes ; and the legislation of </para>

While I know that in Great Britain there is great poverty and distress, I also know that in the United States there is equal, or even greater, poverty. I urge on honorable senators not to make any distinction against our own kith and kin, no matter what we may do in reference to the people of other nations. Australia has a territory of something like 3,000,000 square miles. </para>

In the United States there are millions of acres which, so far as nature is concerned, appeared absolutely useless ; and yet they are being used in the service of man at the present time. The United States cover an area no greater than that of the Commonwealth; and yet the former has a population of something like 80,000,000, with immigrants pouring in at the rate of over 1,000.000 a year. </para>

                            <para>.- It is true that small restrictions have been removed. The question has been raised whether this Bill is not introduced in the interests of the sugar-planters of Northern Queensland. I do not believe that to be the fact. The probability is that if the sugar-planters desired to take advantage of the provisions of the Bill they will do so; but unless the intending immigrants are British subjects, or descendants of people born in the United Kingdom, they cannot be admitted unless it is shown that there are not available in the Commonwealth persons of equal skill and ability. We have heard it suggested that numbers of people may be introduced from Southern Europe for that purpose, but before that can be done the Minister must be satisfied that there are no persons already in Australia available and capable of discharging the duties which those people would be called upon to. discharge after their arrival &#39; in the Commonwealth. If I ask honorable senators whether they desire to see the sugar industry carried on successfully, they will tell me that they do, and I say that they must afford opportunities to make it successful. When, under this Bill, labourers who are not British subjects cannot be introduced under contract to work on the cane-fields of Northern Queensland unless the Minister is satisfied that there are no labourers in Australia available and capable of doing the work, it must be admitted that they are amply protected. If we have not men in the Commonwealth available and capable of doing this work, will it not be the height of folly to refuse to permit the introduction of others who will be able to make the industry the success it ought to be ? Nature has done all that she could for us, and we should do all that we possibly can to make the most of our natural advantages. We should be prepared to give our own kith and kin the same opportunities that we claim for ourselves. I would ask honorable senators opposite what they would say if they desired to enter Great Britain to carry on their occupation, and were told that they would not be allowed to do so? Would they not talk loudly of the narrow-mindedness of the people of Great Britain who would shut out their own kith and kin ? Yet some honorable senators object to allow people from Great Britain to enter Australia under contract to earn an honest livelihood. They say that those who desire to come here must do so on their own responsibility, and take their chance; or, in other words, that thriftless and&#39; workless persons from the old country may enter Australia and join the thriftless and workless in the Commonwealth. Those are the men we are asked in some quarters to encourage, and I can only say that I should be very sorry to see in this country the thriftless class of people whom America receives with open arms. The report of the Agents-General has already been referred to, and I ask honorable senators to bear in mind that it was asked for by the Government of the Commonwealth, who recognised the fact that difficulties existed in connexion with the introduction of immigrants to this country. The Agents-General say in their report - and it cannot be too often repeated, or too strongly impressed upon the people of this country- </para>

                            <para>- That may be so; but it is our duty to prevent misrepresentation, and to let people abroad know exactly what our laws are. If people choose to go about maligning a country, they can do immense injury, but that can be avoided if we are able in an authoritative way to show that we are being maligned. We should thus kill the lie which, given a start, does an incalculable amount of injury. Impressed as I am with this view, I believe that, even if under this Bill and under the Bill with which we dealt yesterday a single additional immigrant were not introduced into the Commonwealth, their provisions would still do good in removing the erroneous idea existing in the minds of the British public at the present time. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> read what I presume was the official report in connexion with the six hatter case. An attempt is made in that report to .show that if the law had been observed earlier, those men would not have been prevented from entering the Commonwealth. </para>

We have a right to combat misrepresentation as to the character of our laws, and to show that we are not as restrictive in our immigration laws as some persons on the other side of the world allege. A man who has only recently arrived in this- country, or who took no interest in politics here, might say, &#34; What is the nature of your legislation? You have only 4,000,000 in Australia, and those who are here want to do all the work, and desire to keep others out.&#34; </para>

                            <para>.- I hope that honorable senators will view the Bill from a reasonable stand-point, and will be prepared to accept it as a measure which will not interfere unduly or unfairly with any class in the community. It is, in my opinion, an honest attempt to impose restrictive legislation in such a way as to avoid any misrepresentation of our desire. I hope that honorable senators will realize that some special consideration is due to people of our own race and colour. If they do so, they will accept the principle of the Bill, and, though it may not be carried in the Senate by such an enormous majority as that by which it was carried in another place, there will still be a substantial majority in its favour in this Chamber. </para>

                            has had a great deal to say about the desirability of passing this Bill, in order to remove certain restrictions now imposed on immigration. &#39; At the outset I should like to say that the honorable senator is a member of a political party whose policy has done more &#39;than anything else in Australia to make it impossible for immigrants, especially of the artisan class, to obtain work when they come here. If the honorable senator would support a policy which would enable artisans already in Australia to secure work, and would give increased opportunities for desirable immigrants to obtain employment when they came here, we should not hear so much about the dearth of population in Australia.

                            <para>- I point out that, in my opinion, this Bill does not raise the general question of an immigration policy. The question is one merely of the removal of a restriction which might apply to a few hundreds of people. I therefore deprecate the discussion of the whole question of immigration and emigration on this Bill. Land monopoly and such questions are not dealt with in this Bill. </para>

There would have been no necessity to pass immigration restriction laws if a policy different to that to which I was referring had been pursued in the Commonwealth.

                            <para>- I do not know that it is advisable to discuss all those questions, but so far it has not been done. A fair amount of latitude has been allowed to the various speakers, and of course those who wish to reply from a different stand-point desire to go over the same ground to some extent. However, I shall pass on with the remark that if we had a protective, instead of a free-trade policy, there would not be so much need for enacting this legislation. I am in favour of the Bill being read a second time, and while I do not think that there is as great a necessity for its introduction as some speakers have stated, still I recognise that, perhaps, the Government have taken a wise step. The only clause which will provoke much difference of opinion is that which makes an exemption in favour of British subjects born in the United Kingdom, or the descendants of such persons. I think that a very large majority of honorable senators will not have any objection to offer to the rest of the Bill. The exemption in favour of certain British subjects is made in clause 5, and it has a relation to clause 4, which says : - </para>

                            <para>- I was not referring to the honorable senator&#39;s arguments, because they are generally very full - of fury, froth, and! sound, if nothing else. The chief fear in the mind of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> was that the sugar plantations in Northern Queensland might be flooded with cheap contract labour from some other part of the world, if the Bill were enacted, and of course he intends to vote against the second reading. But there is very little probability of contract labour being brought from the United Kingdom to Queensland or any tropical portions of Australia, whether they be British subjects born therein or the descendants of such persons. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> will be able to tell us whether any number of contract labourers have been brought from Great Britain to work in the sugar plantations of Queensland, or in the tropical regions of Australia. On the contrary, if the Bill be passed, would not contract labour be likely to come from countries other than the United Kingdom ? If that is the fear which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> entertains, </para>

                            <para>- With the safeguards placed round their introduction by clause 3, I cannot see that there is any reason to fear danger to any workmen in Australia. Now, what are the class of workmen whom we are likely to get from the United Kingdom if the Bill be passed in this form? In the first place. we might get miners. The spirit of unionism, which is pretty strong, and sometimes militant, on the mining fields of Australia, probably had its birth with the British miners, because, as a rule, the British miner whom I have met, whether he has come from Cornwall or any other county in England, has generally been a unionist, and has never been anxious to work at less than the current wages or under unfair conditions. </para>

                            <para>- If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie says that there is no trade union in Cornwall, I can only say that I have come in contact with hundreds of Cornish miners, and that, with very few exceptions, they have been trade unionists, and have believed in keeping up fair wages and conditions. If we are not to get a class of British workman brought in under contract to work in the mining fields, or in employments where it! has been contended bv some persons cheaper wages are essential in order to secure the continuance of tropical industries, then we are reduced either to tradesmen or to general labourers. I have been informed on, I think, very good authority that in Great Britain skilled workers, if good tradesmen, can get, even at the present time, wages and conditions about as good as those which prevail in Australia - that is, after allowing for the difference in the cost of living. I am also informed that the best class of tradesmen are not likely to leave the old country in order to come out under contract at less wages or with worse conditions. That limits us to the inferior class of tradesmen. I have sufficient confidence in the skill, brain, ability, and application of my fellow Australian tradesmen and artisans to believe that they could compete with British workmen who might come to Australia, whether the Bill be passed or not. Believing that an influx of cheap labour could only come from countries outside the British Isles, and seeing that the only exemption in the Bill is in favour of British subjects born in the United Kingdom, or the descendants of such persons, I fail to see where any danger can possibly arise. What was the original purpose in framing the contract section of the present Act? I have always understood, and it! has never been contradicted, that the main purpose in the minds of those who proposed and secured the insertion of that section - and I would remind honorable senators opposite, when they say so much about the six hatters, that members of their own party voted for it- </para>

                            <para>- I refer to members of the honorable senator&#39;s party in another place. In fact, members of all parties voted for the contract labour section of the Immigration Restriction Act; yet they made a party cry about the six hatters. What was the original intention of those who secured the insertion of that section? It was this: That labour should not&#39; be imported at the &#39;time of an industrial difficulty to break down a strike, or should not be imported when a strike appeared to be in contemplation, cr should not be imported under contract to lower wages and labour &#39;conditions in Australia. Those intentions are just as strongly maintained in the amending Bill as in the original Act. It says that even if workmen come from Great Britain - even if they are our own brothers, born of the same fathers and mothers -they are not allowed to come into Australia under contract unless the Minister approves of the contract, and unless it is clearly set out in writing that they are to receive the wages current in that part of Australia where their work is to be performed. </para>

                            <para>- In spite of the cheap laughter of honorable senators opposite, I am not to be .deterred from doing what I believe to be the right thing. Had it not been for the absolute falsity of the statements made by the supporters of the Right Honorable G. H. Reid at the last election regarding our immigration legislation - had it not been for the damnable misrepresentations at that time - there would have been no necessity for the present Government to bring forward this Bill. I admit that even before we received a communication from the Agents-General, and quite irrespective of the value to be placed upon it, owing to the misrepresentations made bv the Reidites- at the last election, and since then, purely for party political purposes, Australia has suffered to some extent in the eyes of people in other parts of the world. But on their heads be the blame. </para>

                            <para>- It. is all very well, for honorable senators who took a very prominent part in such popular clamour, and in the tirade of abuse against the land in which they get their living, to make such statements. . It sounds very patriotic for them, when they find that they have done some damage to their country, to sneer at those who are not guilty in that respect, but who, recognising that some damage has been done, want to try to remove it. There have been several reasons for the misrepresentations jo which I have alluded. The chief reason was that they were made for party purposes. Another one which influenced the minds of a considerable section was that they wished to bring as much cheap labour as they could into Australia. To use an old phrase employed a hundred years ago in connexion with the introduction of slave labour to America, they have called upon &#34; the perverse ingenuity of their unprincipled avarice &#34; to such an extent that they have been able to make innocent people believe that our legislation has been the means of keeping desirable immigrants out} of Australia. But, in spite of what honorable senators opposite say, I deny that our laws have had that effect. </para>

                            <para>- I know that the honorable senator desires to, have no restrictions on contract or any other kind of imported labour. I was about to say that if, by adopting this exemption with proper safeguards, we can obviate misrepresentation in the future, we shall be wise to take that course. I shall support the second reading of the Bill, though I think it ought to be amended in the direction in which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> desired1 to amend the Immigration Restriction Act Amendment Bill. A number of honorable senators are quite willing to accept the spirit of the clause which exempts British subjects, but are not willing to admit to Australia certain classes of coloured British subjects or their descendants. I understand, however, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> intends to submit an amendment to meet such cases. </para>

                        <para>- I can hardly understand any honorable senator arguing that people in England or elsewhere are not perfectly justified in the criticism which they have passed on the restrictive immigration laws of the Commonwealth. People abroad judge our laws by the provisions they contain, and we find that, under the Immigration Restriction Act of 1901, no human being is exempted - not even a&#39; British subject. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe</inline> contended that the sole cause of the unseemly talk abroad about Australia, was the misrepresentations made by Australians when visiting the old country. I contend that much of what is said at Home- </para>

                            <para>- England is my home. I contend that the people at Home or elsewhere, could not possibly come to any other conclusions than those which have been described by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> and others. I know, of course, that, as a rule,_ British subjects are not called upon to undergo the test. According to section 3 of the Immigration Restriction Act, any person under contract to perform manual labour is a prohibited immigrant, though power is given to the Minister to make exceptions in cases where the immigrant is possessed of special skill. But for the clamour, and the righteous and proper indignation expressed in Australia at the idea of British subjects being excluded, the six hatters would not have been admitted. What is the use of honorable senators trying to throw, dust in the eyes of the public? Only yesterday we passed a -Bill which contains a clause providing that any person who has resided in Australia for a period, or periods, amounting in the aggregate to not less than five years, and who is about to depart from the Commonwealth &#34;may, in the manner prescribed,&#34; apply to an officer for a certificate. Good heavens ! &#34;Under such a clause a colonist, like myself, who may have been fifty-three years in Australia, will have to go, cap in hand, to an officer, in order to get a certificate. </para>

                            <para>- Our great need is population. I was delighted&#39; to read the Prime Minister&#39;s speech on this subject; but what has been the result ? The Prime Minister&#39;s intentions were good, and&#39; are good now, but the Labour Party would not allow him to proceed. </para>

                            <para>- I think I shall be able to show that it is not. At all events, it is unnecessary for me to enter into a laboured explanation of the reasons for reversing my former attitude on this question, because I do not intend to reverse it. What is the reason for the introduction of this Bill? Is it not exactly the same as that offered for the introduction of the Bill with which we dealt yesterday ? It has been introduced in response to an outcry for which there was never any justification whatever in fact. We know that honorable senators opposite are consistent in denouncing the Immigration Restriction Act passed in 1 901 . They have contended all the time that it is bad legislation. </para>

                            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> is assisting honorable senators opposite to justify that outcry, though only a very narrow section- of the public indulged in it. Honorable senators on this side, who are in this matter prepared to vote with honorable senators opposite, must admit that they made a mistake in the principle or the form of the Act which was passed in 1901, or they would not be prepared to support this amendment of it now. I do not think that they made any such mistake. I believe that the principal Act was necessary and desirable in the interests of the great majority of the people of Australia, and that it has worked well. We have heard a great outcry to the effect that the Act is making Australia stink in the nostrils of the people of the old count rv, and, indeed, of the civilized world. But we know that an extravagant statement of that kind has absolutely no justification in fact, because there has not been a single individual kept out of Australia bv the operation of that Act. I am of opinion that it would be an exceedingly ba.d thing for Australia to permit the -free admission under contract of any persons, whether British subjects or not. </para>

                            <para>- Honorable senators opposite have emphasized the alleged fact that a large population is exceedingly desirable in Australia, and that _ the chief reason why we cannot obtain it is because of certain alleged action taken by the Labour Party. I agree with all that has been said with regard to the desirableness of having a large population in Australia, provided they are a prosperous, and not a starving people. It will be no advantage to have a large population here, if we have not something to put in their mouths, and if their little children are crying out for bread. Every one will agree that it is exceedingly desirable from every point of view, and especially in order that we may be able to maintain our national independence that we should have a large population of prosperous people settled in Australia. But I deny that it has ever been the policy, or any portion of the policy of the party to which I belong, to prevent, or in the slightest degree to retard, the accomplishment of that great aspiration. </para>

                            <para>- I took notice of what they said, and I think <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> will bear me out that they made a strong point of the desirability of having a large population in Australia, and urged that the legislation we are now being asked to amend had the effect of keeping people &#39;out, and that it was the policy of the Labour Party to keep them out. I maintain that no section of the community is more ardent in its desire to see a large population here than are the members of the -Labour Party. But I think that this is not the way in which to secure population. In my opinion, the way to attract a large population to Australia is to make the conditions in this country so desirable that people will flock here. Within my memory, New Zealand was losing population simply because the conditions of life in that Colony were bad, but when those conditions were improved in the nineties, without any provision for the introduction of contract labour, people flocked into New Zealand .wholesale, until, as a matter of fact, the statistics showed that New Zealand was gaining a larger proportion of population from the excess of arrivals over departures than the whole Commonwealth of Australia was gaining. </para>

                            <para>- It is said that the contract provisions of the principal Act have prevented people from coming to Australia. I do not think so. We have had four years&#39; experience of the operation of the Act, and, so far as we know, it has not kept a single individual out of the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- Where so much misrepresentation has been indulged in, it should not be difficult for those who have indulged in it to bring forward one genuine case of a person refused admission in support of the misrepresentations made. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> when Attorney-General, found it necessary to write a scathing letter of contradiction when the Agent-General for Queensland, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Horace</inline> Tozer, tried to bring the Act into contempt by absolutely false misrepresentations with regard to the introduction into Queensland of a girl attendant on ,his family. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> did that, and did it well, in defending Australian legislation from the false&#39; misrepresentations of a . prominent public official. We are not opposed to British subjects - to men of our own race and colour coming here. They can come as freely as they please. What we wish is that they shall come with absolute freedom, and enter into engagements only after .they have become fully seized of all the conditions of employment in the country. That, I think, is a very fair statement of the case. I desire that as much for the protection of my fellow subjects in the old country as for the benefit of the people in Australia. It does not matter a straw to the great bulk of the people of Australia whether the persons who take the bread out of their mouths, and throw them upon the street in a starving condition, with their wives and children suffering from want of the necessaries of life, are their own countrymen, or Germans, or Frenchmen, or Italians. My experience is that if a wrong is inflicted on a nation it is greater if it is inflicted by people of their own race than if it is inflicted by any other people. It is provided in clause 5 that the Minister shall approve of the terms of the contract only if, in his opinion - except in the case of British subjects born in the United Kingdom, or their descendants born in any part of the British Empire, there is difficulty in the employer&#39;s obtaining within the Commonwealth a worker of at least equal skill and ability. </para>

                    <para class="block">That is the only condition which is made with regard to the bringing in of British subjects born in the United Kingdom. Frequently in Australia we have Had a great many persons born in Great Britain who could not find work, or whose children were suffering from the want of the necessaries of life, because they could not find work. Have not the British-born people who are residing within the Commonwealth, the same claim upon our good feeling, and to our protection;, as the British-born subjects residing in the United Kingdom? Undoubtedly they Have. It is neither a kindness to the people in the old country nor a kindness to the people in the Commonwealth to allow persons to be brought in under contract, when there is no sufficiency of work to keep them going. Either the immigrant or the Australian worker has to suffer. I do not desire to see either of them suffer. What I desire is that there shall be plenty of work for all hands, and that when work comes the people of our own race and colour shall be allowed to come in freely, but not under contract, because that is not necessary. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> has pointed out the danger which exists in Queensland, particularly in North Queensland, of .large planters, who desire to continue their operations by means of gang labour importing a considerable number of European labourers, even British labourers, if you like, under contract, at the expiration of 190S, when a large proportion of the black labour which they now possess will be withdrawn. That danger is very real and very great. Now that they are convinced that they will not be able to keep their beloved kanakas, the planters are looking round to find some other form of cheap labour. There is a danger that they will flood that portion of the Commonwealth with cheap labour imported under contract from abroad for, perhaps, two or three years, and that by that means, they will be able to keep down the wages, to reduce the employment offering at remunerative rates, to the white people already there. Feeling so strongly on this question, and knowing that if this Bill, like the Bill which we passed last night, has any ill effects, the State I represent will be the first to suffer, I shall do what I can to defeat it at this and every other stage. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. The Bill contains some farcical provisions, which are intended, I suppose, to be a salve to the conscience of the Ministry, or some of their supporters, but which do not amount to anything in the way of protection. One provision is that &#39;the Minister shall approve the terms of the contract only if it is made - in contemplation of or with a view of affecting an industrial dispute. </para>

                    <para class="block">It is utterly absurd to think that any Minister could give effect to that farcical provision. All that the Federated Employers&#39;&#34; Association, or any association of employers, would need to do would be to determine in their own minds that six months hence they would attempt to reduce wages, and then cast about for a means by which to accomplish that object. They would say : &#34; The best thing we can do is to introduce a couple of hundred men under contract.&#34; In that way they would overcome the labour market, and no Minister could say what was in their mind, because&#39; he would have no means of finding out their object. </para>

                            <para>- It can not be done under the Act with the ease or impunity with which it could be done under this Bill. After employers have flooded the market what will be the result? They will either lower the wages or impose worse conditions. Men will be forced to accept the conditions imposed, or else endure the misery of having to look at their suffering wives and children enduring the torments of starvation and misery. That is a position which should be seriously regarded by every one who has at heart the interests of the working people of Australia. I desire to maintain a high standard of living, and to secure fair wages and good conditions of labour, because I believe that the true greatness of a country depends1 upon the extent to which the masses of the people enjoy a happy and prosperous existence. I do not wish a few persons to make large profits while the masses endure hardship and misery. I wish the masses of the people to be, in the highest sense, wealthy. This outcry against the contract sections of the Act! has been raised entirely with a view to discredit labour legislation, and to obtain freedom for any employer at his own sweet will to do what seems to him best, in order to reduce wage3 and so increase profits. In the Bill, as in the Act, there is nothing to prevent an employer from introducing under contract as much labour as he likes, no matter how many unemployed there may be in the town or place in which he is operating. </para>

If he says that he did not approve of that legislation, and that this Bill is better, by all means he is justified in giving the measure his support. But he does not say that this is better. He merely says that it is quite as good. What is&#34; the use of tinkering with our Acts of Parliament if we are going to get something which is not as good as the legislation at present standing on the statute-book ? What is the use of wasting time if we are not going to effect improvements ? </para>

                            <para>- Of course, from SenatorClemons&#39; point of view this Bill is an improvement ; but it is not from mine. In the Bill which we passed yesterday, and in this measure, we are merely meddling and tinkering with the legislation of the Commonwealth. From the point of view of the Labour Party, both inside and outside the Senate, these measures, instead of doing the work which they are designed to do for the benefit of Australian workers, will weaken the Acts that Parliament has already passed. I have no desire to do anything which will have that result. If there is an honest difference of opinion, well and good. Honorable senators are entitled to their views, and they are justified in fighting for them. But if they tell me that no improvement is made, I ask why should we tinker with our Acts of Parliament for the mere sake of truckling to the feelings of those who have always been opposed to our legislation, and who, no matter what we do, will still be opposed to it ? If I could defeat this Bill on the motion for the second reading I would do so. But, at all events, I shall relieve myself of responsibility by voting against it. </para>

                        <para>- I intend to support the Bill. I agreed with the legislation that was previously passed on the same subject. I think that the Bill before us improves that legislation. A good deal of unnecessary anxiety and heat have been imported into the discussion. The question is important in a degree ; but, so far as I have been able to see, there is no great danger of Australia being flooded with cheap imported labour, even if we had not the contract sections of the Immigration Restriction Act at all. I have had a great deal of experience with labour and labour difficulties, and I think I am well within the mark when I say that during the last twenty or thirty years there has not been an average of 100 persons per annum imported into the whole Commonwealth under contract. The most serious thing has been that &#39; highly objectionable form of contract which grew to be a great evil in Queensland, and which I am happy to believe we have scotched. </para>

                            <para>- If I thought so I should agree with&#39; my honorable friend. But I am of the contrary opinion. There have been some contracts which, in themselves, were baneful, and were intensely unfair to one of the contracting parties. Persons have been engaged in poorly-paid parts of the world at remuneration that seemed to them to be princely, and have been brought to Australia, where conditions very much superior existed among the people with whom they had to work. I take it that the original Act aimed largely at the removal of that abuse. Then there was another danger. It has sometimes occurred during the currency of an industrial dispute - and disputes will continually happen while men remain human - that persons instigated by pique, and by a desire to win at whatever cost, have imported, and have even injured themselves financially by importing a few labourers in order to win their case. That evil also we have sought to kill. I think that generally there is a consensus of opinion that it is desirable that we should kill it. But in the original Act we accomplished our purpose in a way that angered some people ; and it was, I think, wisely sought to provide a way of doing the same thing so as not to anger them, or not to anger them so much. I am always in favour of doing the thing which I want to do in a way that will not annoy the fellow who does not want me to do it. That, it seems to me, is what this Bill aims at. I point out to my honorable friends who- oppose the measure that the Bill makes a very great advance. While we provided in the original Act that persons could not come into Australia under contract, unless it was shown that there was not the necessary amount of skill of the character required in the Commonwealth, we are providing in this Bill that whoever comes under contract, and wherever he comes from, he can only come her* and remain on condition that he receives the same consideration with reference to wages, hours, and conditions of employment as others are receiving who are engaged in the same class of labour. I think that is a very great advance. Therefore, I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> that while the original Act was a good measure, and while a great deal has been said about it that ought never to have been said, this Bill really improves it from the point of view of the interest of persons who have to work to live. With reference to British subjects being exempt, I am inclined to think that the Bill, as framed, exempts more people, or makes greater exemptions than is intended ; and unless some amendments can be made in Committee, I shall vote against the third reading. I am inclined to think that in clause 5 the intention of the Government is merely to exempt British subjects from the provisions generally. It provides that in regard to other than British&#39; subjects employers importing contract labour must show that there is not sufficient skill of the class in Australia. I think that is all the Government intends to exempt them from. But the clause, as drafted, it seems to me, exempts them from the provision requiring that contract labour shall receive the same conditions and wages as are paid to Australian workmen for the same kind of work. </para>

                            <para>- There seems to be a disposition to amend the Bill to make the point clear, and in that case the difficulty can easily be removed. Notwithstanding that some lawyers differ from me, I feel that the clause is capable of improvement. With reference to the question of contractsper <inline font-style="italic">se,</inline> I am not aware of any objection to contracts to serve if the conditions are fair and reasonable. The general objection to contracts made abroad, to be completed here, is that conditions made in ignorance by one of the contracting parties, or perhaps by both, may be such as will be prejudicial to the wellbeing of the Commonwealth. This Bill, it seems to me, provides that when contracts to serve are made under conditions arising out of the ignorance of one of the parties and placing him at a disadvantage compared with the workers in the part of Australia in which he is to fulfil the contract it will be void. Therefore all the safety that we require appears to be provided. If people come here to work under contract, they must come under exactly the same conditions in respect of wages, hours of labour, and other circumstances relating to fair treatment as we already have provided for our workmen within the Commonwealth. If so much is insured, I think that every safeguard that we can ask for is provided. I agree with all that has been said concerning unreasoning complaints about the existing law, and with the observations that have been made as to the unfair misrepresentations on its administration. But while many unjustifiable statements have been made with reference to it, if anything can be done to remove the excuse for making those statements I think it is well to do that thing, if we do not weaken the legislation which we have passed. That this Bill does not weaken it I have pointed out. It rather strengthens it. Therefore I shall support the second reading, and if the amendment I have suggested be made, I shall support the measure heartily right through. </para>

                        <para>- In my view, as in that of many members of the Senate, this Bill can be divided into two parts, unequal, so far as size, but in importance in converse ratio. I am not concerned in the least with any clause of the Bill, with the exception of clause 5. The rest may go ; but I do welcome the opportunity to say that the Opposition in the Senate seems at last - I hope with the &#39;assistance of many honorable senators who are not usually with us - to be securing some advance on the legislation of previous years. In case some of the too-harsh critics in the Senate should be inclined to blame the Government altogether for the existence of clause 5, I desire to point out that in the present instance the Government will follow the Opposition. We on this side of the Senate will have our numbers reinforced by two, and I welcome the conversion under compulsion of the Ministers to a more reasonable state of mind. Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> of clause 5, which I suppose is the provision around which contention chiefly centres, was inserted in the Bill on the motion of a leading member of the Opposition in another place. </para>

Those honorable senators seem to have forgotten that this clause was not inserted on the initiative of the Government. We have debated at some length the question of how far this amending Bill is in advance of the original Bill. To my amazement, I have heard some honorable senators attempt to argue that the difference between the Bill and the Act is very little. From my point of view I regard this as not, perhaps, the only victory the Opposition have achieved this session, but as a most important victory. The difference between the amending Bill and the original Act is really of the greatest moment. </para>

                            <para>- Let us all rejoice, and indulge in the hope that this is only an instalment of better things to come. I am glad to see a tendency, even on the other side of the Chamber, to recognise that it is time we rectified some of the mistakes made by previous Parliaments. In the first place, paragraph b of clause 5 provides that, subject to the condition, to which every member of the Senate will readily give his adherence, that the rate of wages and conditions of employment are satisfactory, British subjects born in the United Kingdom, or their descendants born in any part of the British Empire, may enter here freely under contract. I use the words &#34; freely under contract &#34; advisedly, because such immigrants are subject only to one condition, that the rate of wages and conditions of employment are satisfactory. Under the original Act, no British subject from the United Kingdom could enter Australia under contract to perform manual labour, unless he obtained an exemption because of special skill required in Australia. With that exception, manual labourers from Great Britain were absolutely barred. The difference between that provision and clause 5 of the Bill is enormous. I draw attention to the phrase in the Act, &#34; special skill required in Australia.&#34; Parliament seems to have assumed that there could be too much special skill in Australia, and when I read the phrase again, although I remember the provision being placed in the original Act, it seems to me most extraordinary. I do not suppose that any one will contend that we could have too much special skill in Australia. Indeed, the terms seem almost contradictory. </para>

However, I do not wish to emphasize that point. We have at last an admission that, even if immigrants are not British subjects, they may enter Australia. Apart from the provision in regard to British subjects, we have at last an admission that even immigrants who are not British subjects may come into Australia, provided the remuneration and other terms and conditions of employment are satisfactory. </para>

                            <para>- It was not. But the Bill at last recognises, in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c</inline> of clause 5. that the remuneration and other conditions are material to the issue. In the Act that point is ignored altogether, and it is provided, by implication that no matter what the conditions of employment or the rates of wages are, they do not touch the question. That is one of the cardinal vices of the original Act. An attempt was made in the Senate to make an exemption provided the conditions and wages were satisfactory but that attempt was defeated by the Labour Party. Now, however, the Labour Party seem to recognise that these are the material points which ought to be considered ; and I regard this provision as an enormous advance on the previous legislation. If clause 5 is not all that we would&#39; desire - and it is not, by a long way - it is a distinct stride in the direction of permitting the free immigration of the white races to this country. 1 ; </para>

                            <para>- I shall oppose the slightest verbal alteration in the clause. The section of the original Act refers to &#34;special skill required in Australia,&#34; and it will be seen that the wording of paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> of clause 5 is quite different. I regard the Bill, so far as clause 5 is concerned, as holding out bright hopes of something better in the future. The time will come in Australia, perhaps a century hence, when the question of properly developing our tropical territory will have to be faced, once and for all. Honorable senators know- that I voted for the direct test in order to secure a White Australia. </para>

                            <para>- We shall have to decide at some time or other as to the cultivation of the tropical, and probably o other parts of Australia: and the question of contract labour in this connexion is sure to arise. I have said that it is a distinct advance on previous legislation, that British subjects may be brought here under contract; but unless we bring in other Europeans who are not under the ban, from the point of view of a White Australia, to assist in the cultivation of those parts of Australia which at present are lying waste, the time will come, in the history of the nations, when we shall be told that we have no right to that territory. There is a national obligation imposed on the people of every country ; and if we neglect our opportunities, and the question is pressed home, we shall lose that enormous territory in the absence of an adequate and satisfactory answer. </para>

                            <para>- lt has been urged to-day, by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe</inline> especially, that inhabitants of the United Kingdom, although under contract, are not the sort of persons to come in to cultivate the Northern Territory. I am hoping the time will come when we shall extend the operation of paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b,</inline> not merely to British subjects of the United Kingdom, but to all Europeans. Just one word in regard to contract labour. It is strange that a great many h honorable senators opposite can only read &#34;contract&#34; as meaning slavery; they frequently put &#34; contract &#34; in opposition to &#34;freedom.&#34; It is high time that those honorable senators disabused their minds of an idea so ludicrously erroneous. I venture to say that there is scarcely a member of the Senate, or a man whom we meet in- the street, who has not at some time or other been under contract. Are we to say that all such men have, therefore, been slaves? To finish the argument - Why should it be slavery t to make a contract in Great Britain, while it is perfect freedom to make a contract in Australia? I cannot dissever the two, and I repeat that it is high time this &#34;slavery&#34; was dropped as a foolish bogy. </para>

                        <para>- I was not a member of the Senate when the original Act was passed, or I should certainly have opposed the section which this Bill is amending. I always felt that the Commonwealth might make a few initial mistakes, for which it might be excused ; and this clause of the Immigration Restriction Act is the most grievous mistake of all. I read the Act with a great deal of astonishment and considerable regret, and I determined, when I was returned to this Chamber, that whenever an opportunity occurred to amend it in the direction now proposed, I should lend my assistance. The amendment proposed in clause 5 is most important. The original Act was designed to prevent people coming in under contract, and a contract labourer was defined as a prohibited immigrant, and, as such, classed with prostitutes, diseased people, and other undesirables, and he was absolutely forbidden to come in. One exception alone was made, and that permitted the admission of men assumed to possess some special skill not obtainable in the Commonwealth. But the Bill with which we are now dealing is not one forbidding the introduction of contract immigrants, but permitting their introduction under conditions I think fair to themselves and to the workers already in Australia. If this had been the character of the legislation first adopted, the six hatters episode would probably not have occurred. Certainly under this legislation such episodes are not likely to occur very frequently again. What happened in connexion with that case was, to my mind, an evasion of the law of the land by the Prime Minister of Australia, who, in the position he occupied, should have asserted and carried out the law.. I was going to say that he had to pretend to believe, but I will say that he had to express himself as being satisfied that these six hatters were specially skilled men. </para>

                    <para class="block">I prefer to give expression to my views in my own way rather than have what I say distorted by the honorable senator. It seems to me that if there is one class of immigrant more desirable than another it is the man at Home who possesses sufficient foresight&#93; to be certain that he will be able to secure employment for the support of himself and his family when he reaches Australia before he comes here. Yet it is this particular class of immigrant to whom up to the present time we have given the cold shoulder. There is a provision in this measure which I welcome, though it may seem somewhat sentimental. However we may be disposed to treat the people of other races, we should be prepared to make some exceptions in favour of our own kith and kin. Britishers will be able, under this clause, to come into Australia under certain conditions which are laid down, and which seem to me to protect the local workman. I am afraid that what is proposed is a very cumbersome method, for under this Bill the Minister is given the right to examine every contract under which persons are brought to Australia, and he is to be satisfied, first of all, that they are not brought here for the purpose of influencing in any unfair way any industrial dispute. </para>

                            <para>- I do not care how many there may be. I confess I should like .to see British people being brought to Australia under contract under the best conditions. I should certainly not like to see men brought here at lower rates of wages than are ruling in Australia, because I am as strongly in favour of the payment of fair wages to workmen as is any member of the Senate. In this Bill we are asked to recognise a fact which I think we ought to recognise, and that is that we are a part of a large Empire. We frequently hear America spoken of, and we know that that country has an anti-con.tract immigrant law. </para>

                            <para>- Honorable senators must bear in mind the great difference in the distance between Canada and any part of the United States and Great Britain, and the distance between Great Britain and Australia. It is a very serious thing for a man to contemplate a voyage to Australia from Great Britain. If he is to come out here, and bring his family with him, he will prefer to know that he will be certain to obtain employment when he arrives here. It is a comparatively small thing for a man to go from Great Britain to Canada or the United States, as, if he is not satisfied, it is possible for him within a few weeks to return to his native country, and possibly to the employment which he left. It is not so in the case of men coming to Australia, and instead of putting difficulties in their way it seems to me that we should, offer them every possible inducement. I have no wish to digress, but I agree with honorable senators who have expressed the opinion that we should offer inducements to immigrants to come here, by providing them with land. We surely have enough of it. </para>

                            <para>- It seems to me that in the existing Act, while offering inducements to immigrants in one sentence, we reject them in another. I hope that this Bill will not be materially altered in. Committee. If I thought that in Committee it would be amended in such a way as to remove provisions which I consider improvements upon the existing law, I should vote against the second reading. Whilst I recognise the consistency of honorable senators who are prepared to oppose the Bill, I am glad to see that the members of the Labour Party, as a body, are going to support the Government in passing this legislation. </para>

                        <para>- I think there is no doubt that the second reading of the Bill is going to be carried. When we see such a combination of forces gathering behind the Government there is some justification for a belief that the Senate is coming round to the opinions which have always been held by honorable senators opposite, and possibly the second reading of the Bill will be carried by a decent majority. I do not believe that the Government had any particular intention to &#163;0 in the direction indicated by the provision to which so much reference has been made, and which was not in the Bill when it was introduced, but which apparently is the only excuse brought forward for it here. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> has said that the only reason he is voting for the Bill is because it contains paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> of clause 5. The honorable senator has said that he wishes it went further, and that all the restrictions of the original Act were wiped out altogether. At all events, he recognises that this Bill is a step in the right direction, that is, from his point of view. I believe that the Employers&#39; Federation, and such bodies, have been passing resolutions pointing out that the persistency of the Opposition has induced the Government to take one considerable step in the right direction. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know that it would be right to say that the Opposition have frightened the Government. I do not think that even the Employers&#39; Federation submit that contention.. They base their expression of gratification upon the fact that the Bill takes a considerable step in the direction in which they have always suggested this legislation should go. I do not know that we should be guided by the opinion of the members of the Employers&#39; Federation, or that the stir made about the legislation passed in 1901 should influence honorable senators who sat behind th, Government that passed that legislation. I have always held that it is a good thing to stop any person from coming into Australia under contract. I would have no contract immigration at all if I had mv way. I was not very strongly impressed by this measure until I heard the speech of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> but when he pointed out the absurdity of various clauses, and the number. of provisions under which people might suffer inconvenience, I thought it would be better to prevent that kind of thing, and that is why I suggested that the honorable senator should vote against the second reading. The legislation on the statute-book at the present time is known, and we must be aware that when legislation is first introduced people who believe that :it will interfere with them in any way usually raise a considerable commotion. When this legislation was first passed, the people who have always endeavoured to do what they could to flood Australia with cheap labour, whether under contract or otherwise, made a great noise about it, through their press organs. The press references to the matter were taken up by newspapers published in the old country, as they afforded the only means of gleaning the opinions of the people of the Commonwealth on this subject. They have taken up the cry, with the result that it has probably induced a number of persons in the old country to believe that men would not be admitted, even if they came out under contract. But it has not yet been proved that one person who has come out under contract has been kept out. A contract immigrant may have been called upon to go through certain formalities, but as soon as he has done so, he has been allowed to go ashore, and follow his occupation. In Queensland we have had some experience of persons coming out in a fairly large number. That State is now paying, I think, ,&#163;130,000 a year upon the sum which it spent in bringing out immigrants. But even those persons were not brought out under contract. They came Out because certain persons had misrepresented the state of affairs in Australia With what result? Soon after their arrival they went wherever it was. possible for them to get employment: Clause 3 provides that British subjects, born in the United Kingdom, or the descendants of such persons, shall be allowed to enter under contract. In Queensland we have had some opportunities of studying the tactics of large employers of labour in the North? Seven years ago the standard wage for a labouring man on one large railway job was 10s. per day. The contractors kept standing advertisements in all the newspapers throughout Australia, to the effect that in that district there was plenty of work for any persons who might choose to go there. The advertisements induced hundreds of persons to go. On their arrival they were offered employment at the usual rate of wages. When a very large number of persons had been attracted to the district, what happened? No longer was 10s. per day paid. The men had to accept any wage, because they were unable to leave the district unless they walked away with their swags on their backs. </para>

                            <para>- Most decidedly it could have happened, because the job lasted over three years. Suppose that the men who had gone to the district under a six months&#39; contract. At the end of that time the contractor could have lowered the wages, because the market would then have been flooded with men. It cost the men, I suppose, <inline font-style="italic">&#163;6 on</inline> &#163;7 to go from Sydney to the district, but for ^13 per head a contractor could bring in men by steamer from the old country. If a contractor had a large job in progress, and he considered that the wages were too high, he could import men under contract just as easily as he could indent goods. He could swamp a district for very little more than it would cost him to bring up men from the southern part of Australia. Some honorable senators point out that the contract labourer would come with a surety that he would have some employment when he landed. It should be remembered that a contract could be made just sufficiently long to . enable the employer to recover the money which he had advanced in importing the labour. When a number of contract immigrants had been brought into a district, it would be utterly impossible for the Government to prevent the wages from being brought below the minimum rate. This proceeding is . by no means novel in Australia. In the western part of Queensland, employers have objected fO&#39; employ men who for years had been earning their livelihood at shear.ing sheds in one place or other. The men made themselves objectionable to the employer through belonging to an organization, and when they returned to the district they were told that there was no employment for local men because Victorian money had been invested in the industry, and an order had been issued by the company to bring in men from Victoria. Any one who knows the cost of proceeding from Melbourne to the middle of Queensland will realize that such employers would be prepared to shut out local men when the roll was called. The only reason which some honorable senators have given for supporting &#34;the Bill is that it would allow persons of our own nationality to come in under contract without any restriction. But, in my opinion, there are persons in the British Empire whom it would not touch. </para>

There are quite a number of persons in the British Empire to whom it would not apply. For instance, the people of Lower Canada are, for the&#39; most part, descended, not from people born in the United Kingdom, but from French persons who settled in Canada. They have not, to any considerable extent, intermarried with either British subjects born iri the United Kingdom, or the descendants of such persons. </para>

                            <para>- When, from a source like the Employers&#39; Federation, commendation such as that is received, it ought to be enough to convince the members of the party to which I belong, who support this Bill, that they are on the wrong track. We know, from the opinions expressed by honorable senators opposite, who represent the employers&#39; party more than do any other members of the Senate, and who share in the ideas and aspirations of that party, that they accept this Bill as a small modicum of what they hope ultimately to effect. Honorable senators opposite have said, &#34; We want this immigration legislation wiped out altogether ; we want Australia to be a country to which&#39; men can come, contract or no contract ; and we believe that when any person wants to get labour into Australia he should be able to get it from Europe or America so long as the people he brings out are of the white race.&#34; This Bill affords opportunities for any amount of misrepresentation on the part of those who have induced people in other countries to come to Australia under contract. I know it may be said that immigrants who are brought out under the measure will be protected so far as concerns their wages and their hours of labour. But when they are told that the place where they are to work is so and so, and that the wages which they are to receive are the wages of the district in which they will work, the whole truth is not told to them. There is plenty of scope for misrepresentation. Let me give an illustration. I travel through a good part of this country every year. I travelled hundreds of miles last year. I saw large numbers of unemployed everywhere I went. Travelling through the northern parts of Queensland I saw numbers of men just scratching a bare living in the mineral districts; I also saw large numbers on the roads looking for employment. They were travelling in parts of the country where they would not have been at that time of the year if they had been able to find employment in any other places. The wages paid in the parts of the State to which I allude are very low. . </para>

                            <para>- I think it has. When we find that there are large numbers of men who are working for a very low wage - though the amount might not be considered low by the people who are employing them, and who might desire to bring out contract immigrants, under misrepresentations as to wages - I say that decidedly it has a good deal to do with the Bill. It is because such things can be done that I intend to vote against the second reading. Take a place where 2,000 or 3,000 men are employed, and where we will say the wages are 8s. per day. Suppose the employers think it necessary to reduce wages. Suppose the place was Mount Morgan ; though I do not believe it would be, because the employers there pay very fair rates, and that they wanted to reduce wages all round. Suppose this Bill were passed containing a section enabling them to ship hundreds of men from Great Britain to Rockhampton ; that they did so, and that the employers were under contract to pay these men 8s. a day for six months, that sum being the ruling rate in the district. The employers could bring them in,, knowing very well that the passage money would be refunded to them. It would be part of the agreement that the labourers should pay their own passage money, and, as the wages were earned, instalments would be deducted for that purpose. Suppose the men were brought out a few hundreds at a time. The employers could say to the men already employed, &#34; We are bringing out a considerable number of men who we think are better able to do the work than you.,&#34; and they could dismiss hundreds of the workmen already in their employment. But how long would it be before there would be such an over-supply of labour in that district that the employers would be able to say - &#34;We do not think we can keep this going any longer; as dividends have fallen off lately, it is necessary for us to reduce wages.&#34; They would have the power to do that, and they would not scruple to exercise it. It is because 1 realize that we are putting this power into the hands of men who have shown in. the past that they are prepared to take advantage of every possible opportunity to reduce wages, and to make the conditions of workmen worse financially, that I object to putting any additional weapon in their hands, and shall vote against the second reading of the Bill. </para>

But he had not the candour to tell us what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> told us yesterday - and what I take to be the true policy of the Labour Party - that they do not want a single man to enter this Commonwealth either under contract or in any other way so long as they can point to a few unemployed in some corner of Australia. That, I believe, is an honest and candid expression of what the policy of the Labour Party is. And if that be so -and I assert that it is; I insist that it is, because I know that it is - all that I have to say is that the Labour Party never will be in favour of any immigration to Australia. And if we Can logically and truthfully derive that policy from the utterances of members of the Labour Party, we cannot wonder that the leading journals of Great Britain derive exactly the same policy. And therefore it is known throughout the length and breadth of Great Britain that the people of Australia, influenced by the Labour Party, do not desire any immigration whatever. Unfortunately, when we go into these heated subjects we can never agree about the facts, and will not. admit the most palpable things that are brought under our notice. What is the use of the members of the Labour Party saying, one after another, that it is not our laws which have got us into disrepute, but the slanders of the capitalist party and press, when we have before us the opinions of the six Agents-General, who are old and experienced politicians ? </para>

                            <para>- I find that the report is signed by, amongst others, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jenkins,</inline> for South Australia. The Minister is so anxious to curry favour with his party and supporters, and to drive his Bill through, that he has not even read the report of the Agents-General. The Agents-General deem it their duty to point out that the legislation, which we are now considering, has been a veritable stumbling block in their way, and that it has. created a bad influence against Australia in every part of the United Kingdom. Could evidence be better, or language stronger? If we appointed a Commission to inquire as to the cause of the so-called slanders - but truthful statements, in my opinion - could we call better witnesses than those Agents-General who, I suppose, read the press on both sides, tabulate notes of all matters affecting the Commonwealth, and discuss questions of the kind with bankers, commercial men, and people from different portions of the Empire? </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator is talking nonsense, and the President has told us, over and over again, that such interjections are irrelevant. My point is, that if the Labour Party, honestly, as I believe, hold the views I have indicated, we cannot expect them to ever favour any kind of immigration? A great many moderate members of the Labour Party would, in their hearts, I believe, like to follow the example of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley,</inline> whose speech to-day rather astonished me, as showing the extreme to which he would go, and thus risk marring the prosperity of this or any other country. </para>

                            <para>- -Not only did Senator Turley go beyond <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> in saying that he had met, or knew, hundreds of men who were out of employment, and that, therefore, he could not possibly vote for a Bill sanctioning immigration while that condition of things continues, but he added that he knew hundreds of men who were employed in country places at low wages, and that immigration would be to the prejudice of those men, whose wages would be taken as the standard. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley&#39;s</inline> argument, driven to a logical conclusion, means that, while throughout the Commonwealth there is one section of workers whose wages and conditions, in the opinion of a labour member, happen to be unsatisfactory, the door should be barred to our fellow-British subjects. It is hopeless to expect a Labour Party holding such views to receive with sympathy any Bill to assist immigration. The views of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> on this question are so narrow, so circumscribed, and so undoubtedly favorable to class legislation, that if they were carried into effect they would destroy the progress and prosperity of every man in the Commonwealth, including the class he represents. </para>

                            <para>- We are making a great fuss about nothing, so far as the practical effect of the Bill is concerned, but we are doing a most important work in placing ourselves right in the opinion of our fellow subjects in Great Britain. We have the authority of the Prime Minister that very few men under contract have come in in the past, and that he expects very few in the future. We are informed by the Prime Minister that last year there were not one dozen applicants for contract labour certificates made to&#39; the Government. After all, we are passing a. Bill which permits the immigration of British subjects under restrictions which are very great and far-reaching, and I do not know that the measure will do the good that is expected. The provisions are most restrictive in so far as they enable the Minister to insist that every contract shall be placed before him before the immigrant lands. It is all very fine for the Prime Minister and other Ministers to. say that the contract must be submitted in advance ; but men in the hurryskurry of business, in this twentieth century, can scarcely be expected, three or four months in advance, to submit to a Minister, at the Seat of Government, a contract for the engagement of a man then 12,000 miles away. If we want our British fellow, subjects to come to Australia, why not be content with the other conditions, without imposing this further restriction, and thereby nullifying the very provision we all favour? At first I had intended to move that the High Commissioner and the Agents-General should be substituted for the Minister, but I do not propose to take that course now. I- do desire, however, to make the clause water-tight and workable, and therefore I intend to propose that, the Minister may depute his authority to the High Commissioner, or to the Agent-General of any State. The emigrants will be engaged in Great Britain, and therefore will have no trouble in applying at the offices of the Agents-General. </para>

                            <para>- I am very glad to hear that statement, and under the circumstances, I shall not move an amendment.: However, I notice that a contract under the Bill can be entered into only by a person &#34; resident in Australia.&#34; In order to meet cases of large manufacturers, or squatters who live in England, and only visit Australia once every two or three years, I think we ought to make the clause read, &#34; resident or carrying on business in Australia.&#34; The clause dealing with the &#34;equal skill and ability&#34; phase seems to be unduly strict and unworkable. In my opinion, the words of the original Act are preferable, namely, that the Minister or officer shall be of opinion that the skill of the worker who is seeking to enter is &#34;required in the Commonwealth.&#34; &#34;I do not see how any Minister, officer, or Agent-General is to satisfy himself on the point. It is hopeless to expect a Minister or official to honestly and properly adjust such a calculation. </para>

The Bill is open to the further criticism that a distinction ought to be made between the ordinary labourer or navvy and a skilled mechanic.

There is some distinction to be drawn between half-a-dozen hatters, trained from their youth in the most important branches of hat manufacture, and workers who have not been so trained. But if we required 1,000 men to build a railway to the West, and1 could not get them here, we could not import men and refer to them as having greater skill and ability than men who are here, using the word &#34;skill&#34; in its ordinary acceptation. </para>

                            <para>- I have extracts from it here, and can tell the honorable senator what it provides. Under the contract section of the Canadian Act it is provided that no foreigner shall enter Canada under contract at all. But the section goes on to provide that it shall not apply to the people of foreign nations who admit Canadians into their country. That is a reciprocal treaty between Canada and foreign nations. </para>

                            <para>- I said that the nations to which I have referred open their doors to immigrants, and the honorable senator stated that it was because they have land to offer. Another matter with which I . propose to deal is the question of the introduction of contract labour in relation to the. sugar plantations. The number of contract immigrants arriving here under the existing Act is very small, and it is not likely to be greatly increased under the restrictive provisions of this Bill. I remind honorable senators that it is very likely that an effort will be made to introduce contract labour under this Bill for work on the sugar plantations, because it is possible that we shall find that white labour is scarce in North Queensland. </para>

                            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson&#39;s</inline> remark is unworthy of him. We know that he is so ingrained with every doctrine of the Labour Party that labour politics bubble out of him like water out of a spout. My honorable friends opposite seem to me to be quite incapable of believing that any man who happens to have a shilling in his pocket, and is therefore a capitalist, can be anything but the most conservative, selfish, and unprogressive of individuals. I took special notice of the speech delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs,</inline> and I regard the carrying on of the sugar industry by white labour as one of the most important matters with which we have to deal. We shall have to consider it in a few hours&#39; time, when we have the Sugar Bounty Bill before us ; and I believe that when the 6,000 kanakas now in Queensland are deported, there may be some difficulty in getting the 4,000 white men who will be required to supply their place, and I think some provision might be made in this Bill to meet it. It is very important to consider in this connexion what are fair conditions for workers in the industry if we are to introduce white labourers under contract to carry it on. If we are to be asked to vote another ^1,000,000 in sugar bounties, immediate steps should he taken to obtain white labour for the plantations. The day is close at hand when the kanakas will have to be deported, and we should know whether white labourers will be available in sufficient numbers to take their places. If it is found that they are not available, we should set to work under this Bill to import foreigners, whether Italians, e or people of other European nations, to do the work required to be done, and to keep Australia white, even on the sugar plantations. We must do what is necessary to save this great industry from being annihilated, in spite of the bolstering up we have to give it, and must continue to give it. This question of contract labour for the sugar plantations is about the most important that can arise under the Bill, and every effort should be made under it to provide white labour for the sugar plantations of the tropical regions. If this Bill is to be mutilated in Committee, and the one or two steps in advance for which it provides are not to be taken, it will do more harm to the Commonwealth than anything that has happened so far, because the people at Home will get it into their heads that, in spite of all our protestations that we desire to welcome them with open arms, we really do nothing of the kind, and they will be able to point to the laws on our statute-book. </para>

                        <para>- I do not propose to speak at any great length on the second reading of this Bill, but when one intends to vote against a measure, he should be prepared to give a few reasons for doing so. I am opposed to this Bill, because I believe it will relax our existing legislation dealing with the introduction of contract immigrants. Instead of relaxing our contract labour Taw, we should endeavour to discover means to make it more effective, because there are many instances in which labourers have been brought into Australia under contract, to the detriment of Australian workers. </para>

                            <para>- I have never known any men brought out here to take the place of workers already in Australia who have done any good for themselves or for those whom they have displaced. I know of men who were brought out here under contract, and upon whom the stigma of &#34; black-legs &#34; has lain for over a generation. I know of men brought into the Newcastle district nearly forty years ago in this way, and they are even to-day looked down upon, because of the conditions under which they came out to Australia. We can find instances of a much more recent date of men brought out to Australia under contract to do work in this country that white men were doing until they struck work against what they considered unjust terms. I recognise the rights of the Australian worker, and I see no reason for introducing contract labour to Australia. </para>

                            <para>- I am prepared to give Australians the first choice for work offering in this country, and when the Australian workers are served, outsiders can come in. Until Australians&#39; are served, there is, in my opinion, no room for outsiders, and we should not relax our laws in order to permit labourers to be brought into Australia under contract to take the place of those already in work, or to swell the ranks of the unemployed. That, in my opinion, would be cruel to those who are brought into the country, as well as to those who are already here. </para>

                            <para>- Unfortunately, under our present industrial system, it is only too true that there is no country in which there are not unemployed, but that is certainly no reason why we should seek to increase the number of unemployed in Australia. Two blacks will never make a white. That is no reason why we should increase the number of our unemployed. I am sure that if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> had had any experience of what it means to be unemployed, he would be the last man here to take any step to increase the number of that army. </para>

                            <para>- While there are unemployed persons in Australia we should not open the door to the introduction of contract labour. Let me give an instance of the way in which it has been used to the detriment of local workers.. In several States contract labour has been introduced. In Western Australia, Italians have been brought in, and employed in the gold mines. The circumstances surrounding their arrival were of so suspicious a nature that every one felt satisfied that they had come out under contract, especially when they displaced men who were much better miners than themselves. On their arrival in the State they went straight to the gold-fields, and dropped into a position as soon as they presented themselves, at a mine. It was proved that as miners they were inferior to the Australians, who had to go elsewhere and look for a living. </para>

                            <para>- A Royal Commission was appointed to make an inquiry, but I am sorry to say that its conclusions were rather confusing. The Commission was unable to get evidence which would enable it to state beyond a shadow of doubt that the Italians had been imported under contract. Of course, it could not get evidence from the contract labourers ; but other Italians admitted that their countrymen had been brought out under contract. That system has been practised not only in </para>

                    <para class="block">Western Australia, but also in Victoria. Take, for instance, the Scotchmen who were recently brought out from Lanarkshire - practically from the district in which I was born - to the coal mines of Gippsland. The Miners&#39; Union of Gippsland were unable to prove in a Court of law that these men had been brought out under contract; but I had a statement from them to that effect. Realizing that it is, a greater disgrace for a Britisher to be displaced by a fellow-countryman than by a foreigner, I went down to the boat to see my fellow countrymen on their arrival. I pointed out to them that they were going to Gippsland to take the bread out of the mouths of other workers who were fighting a battle which, in my opinion, was quite justifiable. I asked them not to go near the mines. The brother of the manager, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKenzie,</inline> was at their elbow, and, of course, they told me that they were not under contract. In a few days they found themselves at the Gippsland mines. When the true state of affairs, was disclosed, some of them rejected the work which in Scotland they had contracted to do. On their return from Gippsland I interviewed some of them, and they candidly told me that they had come out under contract. </para>

They were good workmen, better than the majority of the men who were working in the collieries. It was a credit to them that they refused &#39;to work under the local conditions,, and returned to the old country at their own expense. The man from whom I received this version was working his passage home on a White Star boat. These are instances concerning which there can be no doubt. </para>

                            <para>- I think it can be easily understood by most persons how this man came to tell an untruth in the first instance. When he was met in Gippsland by the local miners, their wives, and their children, his manhood rose to the occasion, and rather than accept the work under the circumstances, he decided to work his passage ba:k to Lanarkshire. Whenever a question of this kind is under discussion the Labour Party are taunted with being anxious to keep the country to themselves, and to exclude their fellow countryman. But I contend that we are doing a greater kindness to the people in the old country by letting them know the true position of the labour market in Australia than by doing, anything calculated to induce them to come here, unless they had work to go to, and would not displace other men. </para>

                            <para>- I remember the old adage that &#34; Charity begins at home.&#34; The home which I have in my mind, when I use that word, is Australia. My duty is to consider the people of this country before I consider the people of the old country. There is no escaping from the fact that the sugar plantations are the most likely places into which contract labour would be introduced. We all know that by the &#60;;nd of 1906 the South Sea Islanders will have to be deported, and that cheap labour will be desired by (he large planters. During our trip to Queensland this year it was put to us plainly that the planters required, and must have, cheap contract labour. At the same time, we were made acquainted with the working conditions of the white men in the district. In the sugar mills and cane-fields, particularly in the sugar mills, the ordinary rate of pay was 25s. a week and rations, and for that remuneration the men ha,d to work twelve hours a day. Suppose that it were desired to initiate the 8-hour system in the cane-fields. Contract labour could be imported to work twelve hours a day. and we could do nothing to prevent Its introduction. In view of the climatic conditions and the nature of the work, an attempt should be made, I contend, to improve the lot of the white workers. The Bill leaves a loop-hole for the introduction of a very large number of contract labourers. It would not be desirable to see white working men displaced by contract labour. </para>

                            <para>- I am unwilling to enact any conditions in which I ,do not believe. The sugar industry is one in which better conditions ought to prevail. It is one of the most remunerative industries in Australia. In view of the dividends which it has yielded, it is just as able to adopt the 8-hour principle as is any other industry. Having regard to the amount of protection which it has received, better conditions ought to be introduced. It is simply nonsense to talk of white labour being, brought into the sugar districts while the working conditions comprise twelve hours a day. As the result of my visit, I feel satisfied that, even in Queensland, there is enough labour to supply the demand, but if there is not, certainly there is plenty of labour to be obtained in the other States, where, to my knowledge, men ate working at very low wages. From time to time it has been urged that the Labour Party do not wish to see&#39; Australia peopled by outsiders, that our unemployed are professional loafers, and do not want work. Even in this debate we have been told that the unemployed hang about the cities instead of going to the country and seeking work where it could be found. Let my honorable friends go to the utmost limit of civilization in Australia and they will find men working for miserable wages. In Western Australia I have seen men working on the alluvial for a miserably low wage. In the mining districts of Australia, such as Kalgoorlie, there are armies of men looking for work. In coastal mining districts like Newcastle, I am satisfied that there is not enough work to keep the men fully employed more than three days a week. </para>

That is a very old gag, and an absurd one. I shall not refer to it at any length, because, even those who have been making most use of that gag must be getting somewhat tired of it. But some of the six hatters themselves recognise the fallacy that underlies this Bill. I hold in my hand a letter signed by one of them, and I will read it to give honorable senators an opportunity to see what they think of contract labour.

                            <para>- He knows the conditions that prevail here, and he wishes to prevent contract labour being brought to our shores. I certainly agree with him. I am sufficiently well acquainted with unionism and with labour troubles to know that his opinion is that of nine-tenths of the trade unionists of Australia. Wherever there has been an opportunity to reduce wages, whether by bringing men from the old country or by taking them from one part of Australia to another, employers of labour have not hesitated to do it. I have seen that sort of thing done so frequently that I quite expect that if we legislate to enable it to be done advantage will be taken of the law. I am satisfied that if this Bill becomes law it will be one of the most dangerous Acts that have been passed in Australia. The Employers&#39; Federation does not disguise the aim of its members, and if we give them legislative authority to bring out contract labour, they will hail the opportunity with great delight. I shall not give them a chance if I can prevent it. </para>

                            <para>- I have given instances where it has been done since the commencement of this Parliament; once in Victoria, and on the second occasion in Western Australia. If the employers have a legal right to do it, they will not hesitate to make use of their power. Honorable senators do not need to be told that there are numbers of unemployed in this country who cannot find work to do. For my own part, I have just as strong an objection to Britishers coming here and displacing our own workmen as I have to kanakas or foreigners doing the same thing. I hope, at any rate, to see the particular clause of the Bill, which I look upon as one of the utmost dangerous proposals that has ever been brought before this Parliament, defeated by a large majority. Indeed, I do not think that any other Ministry that has yet been in office in Australia would have had the audacity to introduce a measure of the kind. I believe there is not another Parliament in Australia in which such an attempt would have been made to permit contract labour to be introduced. I cannot understand how it comes about that such a proposition has been made in a Parliament whose democratic principles are supposed to be so strong. I hope that the Federal Parliament will keep up its reputation for the kind of legislation we have hitherto passed, and will reject the proposal now made to us. </para>

                        <para>- I very much regret that in the course of this debate an honorable senator has thought fit to charge me with want of sincerity for having the presumption to take a course different from that which he proposes to take. He did not wait to enable me to say how I intended to vote in regard to this Bill. He assumed that I was going to take a certain course ; and in. that dogmatic manner which so often characterises him, accused me of having something up my sleeve, or that I had some underhand idea in supporting the second reading. Well, the honorable senator is welcome to his opinion. I only wish to say that I give him credit for being sincere in his opposition to the Bill. I could just as easily accuse him of having some motive in opposing it. </para>

                            <para>- I do not believe that I have made any mistake in this matter. It would be to my own advantage, if I were seeking my own advantage, to get up and trumpet about a White Australia, to make out that this Bill will break down the great fabric of policy which we have established, and that it is intended to facilitate, the introduction of millions of contract labourers into the Commonwealth to take work out of the hands of those who are here at the present time. It might be popular for me to describe the Bill as one to increase the number of (unemployed in Australia/, and to take away the wages of those who are now earning their living here. I could easily play that game, and no doubt it would be very popular for me to do so. But if I did&#39; I should have to express those sentiments with my tongue in my cheek, for I should not believe them. But I claim that, in taking what may be the more unpopular, course, I am acting consistently with the vote I gave in the first Parliament of the Commonwealth. Furthermore I wish to point out what every honorable senator ought to know., that in voting for the second reading I do not commit myself to all the details of the Bill, nor do I say that I regard it as a perfect measure. In fact, if the honorable senator had taken the trouble to inquire, he would have known that I have already circulated an amendment which I think is calculated to make the Bill more drastic and to tighten the restrictions against the introduction of contract labour. I do not give my assent to all the provisions of the Bill. &#34; There are some which I think require amendment. There are others for the rejection of which I shall vote. </para>

                            <para>- I will give the honorable senator, before I sit down, my reasons for my opinions. No doubt there has been a big outcry against the Immigration Restriction Act of 1901 <inline font-style="italic">;</inline> but only a bold man would contend that this, was wholly the result of inherent fault or weakness in the legislation. Much of the agitation was due to the desire of certain political parties, then in a minority, to make capital by decrying not only the Immigration Restriction Act, but all the legislation of the first Parliament, in an endeavour to justify their existence and gain the support of the electors. Therefore, I am not moved to support this Bill by any opposition that may have been shown to the original Act, most of that opposition being due to ignorance, prejudice, and party bias. There is, however, one objection which- has been raised to the Act, and which has sufficient weight to induce me to vote not only for the second reading of this Bill, but to support the Immigration Restriction Amendment Bill passed last night. I have for some time recognised the necessity to separate the legislation, the object of which is the attainment of a White Australia, for reasons which are purely racial, from legislation directed against the immigration of Europeans under contract on purely industrial&#39; grounds. I have always held that the strongest argument in favour of a White Australia is the racial argument, and I have never based my support of that policy on industrial grounds. Contract immigration is a matter of industrial consideration ; no one could say that if we were to abolish entirely all the laws which regulate contract European labour, we should be placed in any racial danger, though we all admit that the unrestricted importation of such labour, even European and British, would be a serious menace to us industrially. I, therefore, welcome the present Bill, because it enables us to separate the legislation dealing with two great principles. Whatever conflict of opinion may justly arise in regard to the industrial question, the Immigration &#39; Restriction Act is based entirely on considerations of a racial character. It will strengthen the position of the advocates of a White Australia to have one measure dealing with the prohibition of coloured aliens and another measure dealing with the importation of Europeans under contract. Sub-section <inline font-style="italic">g</inline> of section 3 of the original Act, which it is proposed to amend, is the only one that now calls for consideration ; and we have to deal with the essential differences between that provision and the proposals in the amending Bill. It is well known to honorable senators that sub-section <inline font-style="italic">g</inline> does not alone govern the importation of contract labour into Australia, but that in order to make that provision effective there are regulations which have been altered from time to time, and are still in force, and that these, to a great extent, are drafted on the lines of the amending Bill. With perhaps one exception, the amending Bill is simply an amplification of paragraph <inline font-style="italic">g</inline> of section 3 of the original Act. and I see no objection to tha principle of that subsection being carried out in a separate measure. The only objection that occurs to me is that in one section of the amending Bill there may be loopholes which afford greater facilities for the entrance of immigrants into the Commonwealth under obnoxious forms of contract&#39;. There are. however, certain advantages in the Bill which are not presented by paragraph <inline font-style="italic">g</inline> of section 3 of the principal Act, beyond, of course, those afforded by the regulations to which I have referred. Under paragraph <inline font-style="italic">g,</inline> of section 3, until the officer puts the test to the immigrant just prior to his landing, there is no official knowledge of any intention to import contract labour, unless the employer has applied to the Minister for permission to introduce workmen, because of the inability to obtain men of the skill required within the Commonwealth. When it is ascertained by the officer from the immigrant that a contract is in existence, and permission to land is refused, it is the duty of the employer to prove that workmen of the necessary skill are not available in the particular district for which the immigrant is destined. There is no necessity for the employer to. make his declarations on oath, and whatever he says has to be accepted, because it is, of course, impossible for the Minister to make inquiries in the district where the industry is carried on. Under the Bill, however, a copy of the contract has to be given to the Minister, and the terms of that contract have to be sworn to by the employer. As to the case of the six hatters, if the statements of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> are correct, the principal Act has not achieved its purpose in the way that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> has claimed. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> has stated that there was no scarcity of labour of this particular kind, and that had the principal Act been enforced, in letter and in spirit, the six hatters would not have been allowed to land. I do not think that is quite a correct statement of the case, but, if it is, what becomes of the contention of those who argue that all that is required is the existing Act? According to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy,</inline> in the very case around which the controversy raged, the Minister was able to put aside the provisions of the Act. </para>

                        has stated that any immigrant is admitted to the United States. M)y reading teaches me that thousands of persons are turned away from the American immigration depots i in Europe, as unfit, and inefficient.

                            <para>- That has been the case for years past, and this stream of the unfit and inefficient has been diverted, where? To England, to swell the number of unfit and inefficient foreign residents already there. The dangers of this emigration have stirred public opinion to such an extent that last year,- even a conservative Government introduced a Bill with the object of remedying the evil. Then, again, in last year alone, 1,800 contract immigrants who attempted to land in the United States were sent back to Europe at the expense of the shipping companies by whom they had been carried there. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> has told us that the Employers&#39; Federation are congratulating 1 themselves on the introduction of this Bill. It would have been more&#39; correct to have said, as some supposed supporters of the Bill on the other side have said, that they congratulated themselves upon one subclause being in the Bill. When the Bill was first introduced, Chambers of Commerce, and Chambers of Manufacturers, and the Employers&#39; Federation met it with bitter hostility, and their representative organs of the press, like the <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> before this paragraph was introduced into the measure, pointed out that its effect would be to make even more stringent the provisions already existing with respect to the importation of contract labour. The measure was declaimed against from one end of Australia to the other, until the concession contained in the paragraph to which I refer was agreed to in another place. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> said that employers would go to the other side of the world to obtain labour, and would succeed in obtaining it only by misrepresentation. The honorable senator used that as an argument against the Bill, but I remind him that if employers make misrepresentations when they come to draw up the contract, unless the intending immigrant is a very simple person,, he will see that misrepresentations have been made, because the contract must set out the conditions of labour, wages, and hours. If they are stated truly in the contract, there can be no misrepresentation; and if the employer puts words that are false into the contract, he will&#34; be brought within the penal provisions of this Bill. If the Bill gets into Committee, I propose to move an amendment that will make it even more certain that persons guilty of such misrepresentations will meet with the punishment they deserve. Honorable senators will agree that if a man brings another several thousand miles to Australia, as the result of a misrepresentation, it is right that he should be adequately punished. </para>

                            <para>- I do not say that they are, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> has said so, and has used that as an argument against this Bill. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie instanced the mining industry as one that would be affected by this Bill. I agree with the honorable senator that in the mining centres of Western Australia there are hundreds of willing workers without employment. But I do not for a moment believe that if this Bill is passed there will be one man brought out under its provisions to compete in the overstocked labour market pf our gold-fields. It must be borne in mind that if men are brought out under contract to work on the Western Australian gold-fields it can only be under the conditions existing there. The miners of Western Australia have proved by their record that they are the most efficient miners in the world, and it will be no advantage to an employer to introduce a less efficient miner from England or elsewhere to work in Western Australia under the same conditions as those now ruling there. </para>

                            <para>- We have some good Queenslanders there. The mining industry of Western Australia is regulated under Arbitration Act awards, and no employer importing a miner under contract could do so at a less rate of wages than men already on the gold-fields are obtaining. Therefore there could be no possible advantage in an employer doing what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie has suggested. I come now to the vexed question as to whether we should differentiate between British labour and other European labour. I confess that I dislike any differentiation between any of the European races. I believe that it is the destiny of this Continent to be peopled by the European races, and I dislike making any distinction between them, even thought it should be in favour of our own race. To me it seems that the provision dealing with this matter in the Bill is a concession to national prejudice. But I recognise that there is to be this said for it - that the economic conditions to which the Britisher is accustomed more nearly approach those under which we live in Australia than do those adopted by the other European races. </para>

                            <para>- I did not say that it was. What I said was that I consider that it is a concession to national prejudice. I recognise that, in favour of it it can be said that when the Britisher comes here he becomes an Australian more quickly than do the men of other European races. For instance, we have had some trouble with Italians, many of whom have been brought to Australia under contract. They have been a source of trouble on the Western Australian gold-fields, because they settled in one locality, formed a little Italian colony, and some time elapsed before the colony was broken up and the men distributed throughout the gold-fields. I confess that the clause gives me a considerable amount of trouble. There are many arguments which would impel me to vote for it. The difficulty to which I have referred in connexion with the immigration of Italians has arisen, as honorable senators are aware, in a more exaggerated form in the United States. In New York, for instance, there is an Italian colony, a Hungarian colony, and other colonies of foreign immigrants. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. Italians, for instance, really plant a little Italy in the midst of the country to which they emigrate. Wherever this kind of thing occurs, I admit that it is a danger; but if we deal effectively with the contract labour provisions which I have referred to, such a difficulty as that which arose in Western Australia in connexion with the introduction of Italians cannot occur. If the contract sections of the Act had been faithfully administered, many of those Italian immigrants would not have been permitted to land, because it might easily have been proved that there were a sufficient number of white Australians available to do the work for which they were introduced. Whilst I recognise the force of the argument to which I have referred, I also meet it by saying that it rests with the Government by a faithful administration of the Act to prevent such a state of affairs as I have condemned from arising. From my reading, I learn that in the United States of America, precisely the same kind of thing occurs. Numbers of Hungarians, Poles, and people of other European nations have formed little Hungarian, Polish, and Italian colonies in the cities and mining fields of America; and in nearly every case those people were brought in under contract. But if this law is faithfully administered, we shall be able to prevent the importation of these people to special localities in such numbers as would enable them to engraft their ideas, economics, and industries upon ours. Viewing the question from both sides, I feel that it will be my duty to vote against this particular sub-clause. I feel constrained to treat all European nations in the same way, and I think I should not be acting justly if I were to agree to differentiate between them by allowing British immigrants to be brought here under contract when there might be other men unemployed, and the immigrants introduced might be brought into an already overstocked labour market. </para>

                        <para>- It is four years this month since the principal Act was before the Senate. Honorable senators will remember something of the origin of the provision to which reference has been made. When the Bill was -originally introduced it contained no such provision, and that is some indication of the small attention which was given to a subject which now seems to be all-important to some people. When the Bill came to us, I tried to persuade the Senate to omit the provision altogether. Not succeeding in that, I suggested that we should make it come into effect only if the contract proposed the payment of wages below current rates. Unfortunately, I did not succeed in getting even that accepted. Had it been accepted, Australia would have been saved a great deal of disgrace. There is no doubt that in the four intervening years Australia has suffered a great deal in reputation by the action of that provision. I at once admit that a very great deal of the feeling in the old country is based on a mistaken impression, that the fault which undoubtedly exists in Australia has been immensely magnified, and that we have been painted very much blacker than we are. But need we wonder at this? The people of England cannot, all of them, study these Bills, or be made acquainted with the facts. It is quite evident that throughout the length and breadth of that country the fact that a certain number of Englishmen were checked - I use that limited word - when they wished to land here was widely known, and the fact attracted wide attention, and came as a great shock to the people from whom Australia derives all her right and title to this Continent. There is no doubt at all that this feeling has grown until it has become very acute. This afternoon <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> read a statement explaining officially the facts with regard to the six hatters&#39; case. I do not dispute a word when he read. I suppose that, from the official point of view, every word is accurate; but it does not undo the fact that British-born subjects were not allowed to land in Australia on the arrival of the ship. There is. no disputing that simple fact, nor can it be denied that a grave and painful feeling was aroused in the United Kingdom, and I think I might add, throughout more than the United Kingdom, in consequence of the existing state of affairs. Is it not true, then, that a great occasion had arisen? I think I have heard of a writer who spoke of a statesman as one who knew when &#34;to take occasion by the hand.&#34; It would have been well, I think, if the Government of Australia and all those who occupied leading positions in political circles had risen to the occasion and taken it &#34;by the hand.&#34; Instead of that, the Government and the Labour Party seem to be almost afraid to take the occasion by the little finger. It would have been very much to the advantage of Australia if the Government had taken a generous view of the situation, and recommended Parliament to eliminate paragraph <inline font-style="italic">g</inline> from section 3 of the Act. That would have been a great stroke. It would have done Australia great good. But, instead of that, we have the eleven lines in that paragraph expanded into a Bill of three pages, and it is so full of entanglements, to use the word of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> that I am afraid we shall get but limited praise even for the concessions which undoubtedly it does contain. I am free at once to admit that by the mere elimination of paragraph <inline font-style="italic">g</inline> certain risks would be run, and that occasionally contract labour might have got in under objectionable circumstances. But all life is full of risks. We cannot walk the streets, or eat, or drink, without taking certain risks, If&#39; we were to refuse to eat or drink because in some cases trouble arose in consequence of doing&#34; so, what would life come to? For the attainment of a great object we might have run this very trifling danger. The number of persons who are likely to come to Australia under contract is so minute that it is not worthy of the prolonged discussion which has been given to the subject here. It would have been very much to the advantage of Australia if we had been willing to take a broad view of the position, and contented ourselves with at once sweeping away the provision, knowing, as T say, that there would have been a little risk, and that at the same time there would have been a great gain. It has been stated by a gentleman who has only recently visited England, that he believes that the detention of the six hatters, if it were put into money, meant that Australia had suffered to the extent of at least &#163;6,000,000. It is quite easy for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> to laugh at a statement like that. I dare say that it is exaggerated, but there is no doubt that Australia has suffered very greatly in credit and repute, and that is an influence which does affect us in various ways. It affects us in the money market. It affects us when we wish to renew our loans, and in other ways which are more or less obscured to the vision of a gentleman like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart.</inline> The law as it stands does operate detrimentally to us. Therefore, I regret very much indeed that the Government has not risen to the occasion and simply swept it out of existence. It appears to me that under this very extended Bill the Minister of the day would always have a very great amount of power. He would have the power to interfere when he should not interfere. I am not quite clear as to the explanation given by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford.</inline> He took it for granted that an officer with authority would be appointed in England. I am not at all sure that, under the clause giving the Minister certain power, an officer would be appointed at Home. I ask honorable senators to think out how extended the period of time would be before an arrangement could be made by any person in Australia who desired to arrange a contract for one or two persons to&#39; come out from England. He would have to write to England; arrangements would have to be made in that country, correspondence would have to be sent to Australia, and before the men could come out the employer here might almost have ceased to want them. These are difficulties thrown in the way which might well have been avoided. The Bill is undoubtedly in the right direction. It does something to accomplish what we want, and I join with those who have expressed the wish that in time we may be able to remove the whole of this oppressive legislation, and to stand before the rest of the British race as free men in matters of this sort. </para>

                        <para>- I must confess that I approach the discussion of the measure with a feeling that is very closely related to sorrow. It is a distinct evidence of decadence. The robust spirit which pervaded this Parliament four years ago seems to have evaporated into thin air, and in its place we have a weak and vacillating temper which may lead us anywhere, and which certainly bodes no good to the Commonwealth. When a law affecting the interests of the people of Australia is desired to be amended, the first duty which lies upon those who seek to alter its provisions is to show that a demand for the change has come from the people. Have the people of Australia asked for a revision of this Act? I emphatically say that we have not the slightest evidence to that effect. During recent recesses, I have gone up and down Queensland detailing to the electors what had been done in the Federal Parliament. This, I pointed out, was a measure of which the people of Australia ought to be proud. I said that we had laid it down as an axiom indelibly expressed in the Australian statute-book that every immigrant should land as a free man, and I was applauded wherever I went. If I had even hinted to the people who sent me here that the Act required revision , the very idea would have been scouted. I admit frankly and freely that a small but noisy, mischievous minority has persistently clamoured for this Bill. I ask honorable senators whether, in a case of this kind, they are going to listen to the voice of the vast majority of the people, or whether they are going, to be led away by a small, disloyal, slanderous, untruthful, insignificant minority. I have always understood that the wishes of the majority ought to be the law of the country. But in this, particular case we are asked to follow, not the lead of the great body of the loyal, patriotic people of Australia, but the lead of a small, slanderous, untruthful, insignificant minority. If the Parliament of the Commonwealth chooses to take that course, it certainly shall not have my support. I repeat that there has been no demand from the people of this country .for the alteration proposed in the Bill, and I submit that, constitutionally speaking, the Government had no right to bring it in. The party who introduced the Immigration Restriction Bill, four years ago, is still in power. It is kept in power in the same fashion. It has the Labour Party behind it now as it had then ; it has its own supporters now, as it had then. What is the reason for it1? What is the impelling motive? Has the original law been found defective in administration? If so, in what way? The honorable senator who is in charge of the Bill has not told us. He has simply echoed the sentiments of those who have told us that Australia is in evil odour. Where? In Australia? Where is our legislation in evil odour? Some have said that our legislation is in evil odour in this country, but, and a number consider this to be of greater consequence, it is also said to be in bad odour in Britain. Now, what is Britain? When honorable senators refer to Britain, what do they mean? They mean that wretched corner of London known as the Stock Exchange, where the hawks of the money markets have their nests, and from which they fleece the entire world. That is what honorable senators opposite mean when they talk about Britain ! I admit frankly and freely that the Stock Exchange of London is against us, that Australia spinks in its nostrils. Why? Simply because they cannot make enough profit out of us ; because they cannot coerce us into employing cheap labour in our mines, in our factories, in our fields; because of our advanced legislation. I will not call it socialistic legislation, because I do not desire to offend the sensitive ears of some of my honorable friends on the right. But I say positively that&#39; that is why Australia stinks in the nostrils of the London Stock. Exchange and of the London capitalists. And my hope is that she will stink &#34;still more, that her example will be followed bv every community under the sun, and that within a measurable distance of time the reign of the capitalists will be shattered, and the reign of the people will Have be- gun. Are we, in our internal government, going to be guided- </para>

                            <para>- I do not know whether my reference to South Africa appealed to you, but I am sure tEa-6 it appealed to a number of honorable senators. In any case, however, I have said all I desire to say with regard to South Africa, and will now proceed to another aspect of the question. I have given the reason why Australia is in bad odour in England. The question that I now desire to ask is this : whose opinion are we to consider in the internal management of Australian affairs? Are we to consider the people of Australia, are we to consider the electors of this continent, or are we to consider the views or.; the London Stock Exchange, or of the rich newspaper proprietors, or of the capitalists of Great Britain? So far as I am concerned, my honorable friends on the right can bow the knee to Baal if they please, but I bow the knee to the people of Australia. In these matters the will of the Australian citizens is my law. If my honorable friends on my right have false gods, that is their look-out. But my look-out, so far as I am able, is to prevent the people of Australia being injured on that account. </para>

                            <para>- I hope that their views are large. I know that they are; but if we were to follow the lead of the honorable senator our views, instead of being large, would be insignificant, and the great mass of the working people of this country would not be considered at all. They would be looked upon as mere goods and chattels. Horses arid cows and sheep and pigs and asses and goats would be placed on a level with them. But we are trying, however ineffectively - and, of course, we always have the drag of my honorable friends upon the right - to raise our fellows up to a dignified station. We are trying to make men of them, to make them feel that they are human beings, that they are men made in the image of God - that they are not mere profit-grinding machines for men such as my honorable friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser.</inline> That is what we are trying to do, however ineffectively, and however inefficiently. That is our ideal, and the principal Act, which we are now discussing, was placed upon the statute-book with that object. But now&#39; our friends of the Opposition have made a breach in the wall. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> has said that he sees the position quite clearly. Next year a claim will be made for the entire sweeping away of the safeguards we have here. The first breach has been made in the wall ; and if my honorable friends think that, having been so far successful, our pertinacious opponents on the right are going to give up the struggle they are mistaken. They will return to the fight with redoubled energy next session, and the probability is that they will be able to bring more and more pressure to bear on the Government, until ultimately we have every vestige of our defences swept away. And, that accomplished, our opponents will then turn their attention to the White Australia policy. Having defeated the right wing of our army, they will attaCk the left wing. And I do not blame them. If they find a feeble, vacillating, foe before them I do not blame them for taking every advantage. I give them credit for it. If they find that the army of democracy, as represented by the supporter&#39;s of the present Government, are easy of defeat, that they fall asleep in their camp when they ought to be up and watchful with their swords girded at their sides, all credit to them ! </para>

                            <para>- It is quite enough for me to deal with those who are here. T do not know whether all this was done for party purposes, or whether mv honorable friends are animated bv the most purely patriotic spirit. But. in any case. I think it is extremely unpatriotic that they are not doing their utmost to rehabilitate Australia in the eyes of the world, if it be true that she has lost her character, as we are told. They have been allying themselves with the enemies of Australia, with the people who are opposed to every law that we have placed upon the statute-book - every single one - who sneer at our legislation, who scout the very idea of our, adult suffrage, who laugh at our free institutions and jibe&#39; at the care we take of our workers. I suppose our enemies of the Stock Exchange see danger ahead. &#34; If this sort of policy is allowed to continue,&#34; they say, &#34; if the people of Australia can successfully carry out their schemes of legislation, the spirit of reform will attack the countries of Europe, and our possibility of making huge profits will be lost.&#34; I do. not blame them from their point of view. But we are here - at least I am here - to look after the interests of the working people of Australia. </para>

                            <para>- The Parliament of the Commonwealth evidently thought that there was. We have laws for the punishment of theft, for the punishment of murder, for the punishment of forgery and a number of other crimes. Why? Because some people steal, while others commit murder, forgery, and so on. Why did we put this Act on the statute-book? Because we found that some people were only too ready to introduce labour from outside Australia. For what purpose? For an illegitimate purpose - for the purpose of lowering wages : for the purpose of making more profits ; for the purpose of reducing the working men of Australia to a condition of subjection. </para>

                            <para>- That was exactly the reason this Act was placed on the statute-book. It was a measure of self-preservation, just as we preserve ourselves against the attacks of criminals, so we passed this legislation to defend our industrial system against people who desire to destroy it. The Opposition say they, have gained nothing, and the Government say that they have lost nothing; and if that be the case, why make any- change ? But I claim that the honours of war are distinctly with the Opposition. The spirit of the first enactment is gone. That Act declares that no labour shall be introduced here under contract, . with one special exception, the exception that proves the rule. But, according to the Bill, labour may be introduced under contract, though, it is true, the provisions are surrounded with a great number of precautions. The whole power, however, is placed in the hands pf the Minister, who, if he is so minded, . can permit the introduction of contract labourers by the thousand. That is a most unsatisfactory state of affairs which, I presume, the people of the Commonwealth will not approve. </para>

                        <para>- The vigorous and energetic denunciation of this measure by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> we owe, I think, to a large extent, to his somewhat extravagant imagination. He would have us believe that the reason for the incorporation of certain contract labour provisions in the Immigration Restriction Act was due to the fact that we were threatened with an invasion of Australia by hordes of workmen.. As a matter of fact, those provisions were inserted in. the most casual way, not because of any imminent danger, but merely as a reasonable and wise precaution against possible events. The real and only object was to provide against the introduction,, during the course of an industrial dispute, of workmen or labourers under such circumstances and conditions as would unfairly interfere in the settlement of that dispute; and it is only by reason of subsequent experience that we have discovered that the legislation goes far beyond what was intended. Speaking subject to correction, I believe there was not a division on the clauses, honorable senators being impressed with their fairness. I think, moreover, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> is a little unfair when he contends that the Government, in introducing this Bill, are. weakening in their former robust ideas as to the introduction of contract labour. In my opinion, the Government are fairly interpreting what was originally intended ; and they would not be justified in ignoring the results of the introduction of these particular provisions. Largely, I agree with clause 5, so far as its object is concerned ; but the fact remains that it has resulted in a campaign of misrepresentation and calumny, which has caused Australia and Australia&#39;s credit to suffer very seriously. </para>

                            <para>- That has been my contention. That fact cannot be reasonably disputed, and it has resulted in serious discredit tq Australia. I am free at the same time to admit that the misrepresentations to which I refer have largely emanated from Australia herself, and are the result of the somewhat wicked and unfair reflections of unpatriotic Australians. Nothing is more nauseating to an Australian visiting the old country than to be constantly listening to the vile slanders repeated about these provisions. </para>

                            <para>- What I am urging is that this provision, because of the misrepresentation made concerning it, has been unfortunate. I contend that we cannot afford to hold a discredited position in the mother country. The progress of this community largely depends upon the preservation of the most cordial relations, between Australia and the mother country. Therefore, when the impression prevails within the limited circle of those who give attention to Australian matters, that we do not desire immigration in Australia, a condition of affairs has been reached which we cannot afford to ignore. It is, in my opinion, to some extent the result of the present form of the section, and it is in order to remove that unfortunate stigma from the reputation of Australia in the old country, that the Government have introduced this Bill. In my judgment, the force and effect of the section is not in any way relaxed, and the present Bill, while it modifies the form in which the provision is expressed, more fully interprets what we originally intended. We must try to bring about the most cordial relations between ourselves and the people of the mother country, and holding that view, the concession in this measure in favour of the Britisher is, to my mind, one of the most satisfactory features of it. Some exception has been taken to it by certain honorable senators, but I am not prepared to ignore the fact that there is some obligation on the part of Australia to give a preference to Britishers to some extent in regard to labour conditions in the way here proposed, and in regard to trade as well, so far as we can do so, in justice to ourselves. I, therefore, welcome the innovation in this respect which finds a place in the Bill, especially when I recognise that it is not intended for a mo-&#39; ment to introduce any British workmen into Australia under contract, except upon Australian conditions. If we are satisfied that under this Bill our own brethren in other parts of the British Empire can be brought- into Australia under contract but upon Australian conditions&#39; - and, in my opinion, the Bill effectively provides for that - what reasonable exception can we, as a part of the Empire, take to such a provision? In the circumstances, I feel that it would be very unwise for us to attempt to remove the proposed preference. I urge honorable senators to recognise that it is a very important factor in the consideration of this matter that we are ourselves part of the British Empire, that blood is thicker than water, and that we are called upon where we can do so, without detriment to our own interests, to relax the stringency of our legislation in favour of the people of other portions of the Empire. I have shown that what is proposed in this Bill will not be detrimental to our own interests, and that is, to me, a sufficient justification for the concession proposed. As regards other elements tending to discredit Australia in England, it is true that we cannot hope to recover from the&#39; discredit we suffer, so far as the Stock Exchange is concerned. But the members of the London Stock Exchange have been animated by a consideration of our provision respecting immigration only to a certain extent. So far as I had opportunity to ascertain the reasons for their attitude, I- believe they were prompted by a feeling of resentment at what I regard as the very proper interference of Australia in an endeavour to prevent the introduction of Chinese into the Transvaal. I think that we are not justified in. taking the remotest notice of that, but if we are satisfied that the contract sections of our immigration law have given any justification for the slanders from which we have suffered, we shall be wise to take notice of that fact. For the reasons I have stated, I support the second reading of the Bill. </para>

We can all agree that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> possesses a keenly analytical mind. The honorable senator understands every word in every clause in the Bill now under discussion, and he made the candid admission that, from his point of view, it is a decided improvement on (he existing Act. To these sentiments a number of other honorable senators who followed <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Svmon</inline> on the same side have heartily and readily subscribed. At the present time, the doors are absolutely closed against contract labour being introduced into any part of the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- The doors are closed against the introduction of all contract immigrants, with the exception of those possessing exceptional skill. Now, honorable senators who are so whole.heartedly supporting this Bill, and who cannot be called other than half-and-half White Australians, see some possibility, under this measure, of the doors being left ajar, and they are no doubt hopeful that in the course of time they will be swung wide open for the admission of immigrants from abroad to flood this country. When I hear the sentiment expressed that &#34;blood is thicker than water,&#34; I say that my first consideration is for Australian blood and Australian people. Honorable senators who seem to be so seriously concerned about what certain irresponsible people say abroad in regard to our legislation, should remember that it is not those people who returned them to their places in this Chamber. Why should I be concerned about what is said by people abroad, who, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> has said, have amassed fortunes in this country, and afterwards, not con,sidering it good enough for them, have settled down in the city of the big smoke, and taken advantage of every available opportunity to cast reflections on the legislation passed in the interests of &#39;the bulk of the -people of Australia. When I hear certain honorable senators gibing at honorable senators on this side because they belong to the Labour Party, and saying that they are class legislators, I am inclined to ask them what class they represent. Can any member of the Senate tell me honestly and conscientiously that he represents every section of the community ? If any honorable senator declares that he does, I say that he does not understand what he is talking about-, or intentionally desires to deceive people. </para>

One would think that in the matter of restrictive laws, those which appear on the statute-book of the Commonwealth are unlike any which have been passed in any other part of the world. But I have no doubt honorable senators are well aware that a more rigid and restrictive law than ours is in operation in Canada to-day. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator cannot draw me as he desires.. I hold international ideas, and I do not consider that, in the truest sense of the word, any man is an alien. Contract labour is fettered labour. As a member of the Labour Party, I object to the introduction of bound labour into any part of the Commonwealth, no matter under what conditions it may be sought to be introduced. When I heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> say to-day that if this Bill were in force when the six hatters arrived in Sydney they would have been allowed to land in peace, and that nothing would have been heard about their landing, I remembered that at that time there were, according to those best able to judge, equally skilled and competent workmen in the hatting industry walking the streets, of Melbourne and Sydney in idleness. </para>

                            <para>- There is nothing to prevent the introduction of men of the description I have given by any employer, provided that he pays, the ruling rates of wages and observes the current conditions and hours of labour. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Anderson</inline> observed those conditions in connexion with the six hatters. He did not desire at that time to reduce the hours of labour or the rates, of remuneration. If that be the case, and if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> grasps the situation rightly, as I think he does, is not that a very serious danger to workers as well as to organized labour throughout every part of the Commonwealth? I have no objection, to the introduction of free labour unbound and unfettered. I am seriously concerned about the betterment and advancement of the working classes. My duty is first to the people of Australia. For them I desire to get the best form of legislation, and in their interests I am opposed to men being introduced under contract whilst there are men - Australians by birth or by adoption - seeking employment and unable to get it. </para>

                            <para>- Certain senators can never see them doing anything right. However, I do not wish to labour the question. I feel as strongly and keenly as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> does, and because I see the most reactionary forces at work in different parts of Australia in trying to weaken the advanced legislation on our statute-book, because I believe that insidious attempts are being made by interested persons, both within and without the Commonwealth, to weaken the forces, of the rising democracy, I keep a sharp look-out, and watch carefully the utterances of gentlemen who have always been opposed to the advance of democracy in this country. And when I hear them speaking strongly in favour of this measure, and hip-hip-hurrahing at the close of the session that at last they have got something for their labours, I have no hesitation in voting solidly against the second reading of this Bill.&#34; </para>

I think that on account of the course of action I intend to- adopt it is necessary to justify myself in the eyes of not only my fellow-senators, &#34;but those whom I claim to represent. It has been said that the Government have been weakening in connexion with the question of immigration restriction. </para>

                            <para>- I ask my honorable friend to restrain himself for a minute. When the Immigration Restriction Bill was before the Parliament in 1901, it was the policy of the Labour Party - as it always has been, and, as I believe, it still is - to oppose the introduction of contract labour of any description. When we attempted to carry that idea into effect here, were we successful ? Only to a limited extent. That attempt was made in a Bill which referred more particularly to coloured aliens than to any one else.. I believe that it was a desire to secure better administration, and to separate the two. matters which led the Government to introduce this Bill. What did we do in the first Parliament? We provided that contract immigrants should not be introduced, except under certain conditions - a proviso which&#39; has been a bar to the carrying of that policy ever since. Has it stopped any immigrant who has attempted to come to Australia? </para>

                            <para>- How many ? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGREGOR.</inline> - The six potters, the six hatters, and, though it was against the provisions of the Act, the twelve boilermakers, were admitted, so that the action which the Labour Party took in conjunction with the first Government to prevent the introduction of contract labour was, to a very great extent, a failure. It was a failure to the extent of the six hatters, the six potters, the twelve boilermakers, Lady Tozer&#39;s maid, and very likely a few others whom I cannot recollect. So far as the action of the Government was concerned, where does the weakening come in, when paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> of clause 5 contains almost the same conditions as are in the Act ? There can be no weakening when the same conditions still remain, and other conditions have been added- If we add to the Act some provisions which are not of a qualifying description, but which really extend its meaning, we are not weakening, but strengthening the law. </para>

                            <para>- Certainly, and that was the reason why honorable senators on the other side opposed the Bill until they got the amendment in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> of clause 5. It was the difficulty of administering paragraph <inline font-style="italic">g</inline> of section 3 of the Act which&#39; made it necessary for the Ministry to introduce a Bill dealing with&#39; contract labour only. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> has stated that if the Bill had been in force the six hatters would have been admitted. They would not have been admitted under the same conditions as those under which they were admitted. </para>

                            <para>- If they are foreigners, the Minister has not only to take into consideration whether there are men of equal skill and ability available in the community, but also whether they are- to receive the same remuneration, and to work under the same conditions, as Australian workmen. He has also to make sure that they are not coming here to interfere in any labour dispute that may_ be pending or likely to occur. These are precautions additional to those in the original Act. Now, what does the amendment made in another place amount to? If the immigrants are British subjects, they have to comply with paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">c.</inline> They will not be admitted if they are likely to interfere in any strike which may be pending, or if their wages are not equal to those ruling here at the time of their introduction. As far as Britishers are concerned, as I interjected when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> was speaking, the Bill is a sop fo sentiment. And if we can, under circumstances such as prevail in Australia at the present time, throw a sop to sentiment, are we to be ridiculed for doing it ? Are we going to ruin the Commonwealth because we give some little preference to Britishers? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> when delivering his eloquent oration to-night, declared that, in all his. years of experience in Queensland, not one per cent, of the immigrants to that State came in under contract. Then what have we to be alarmed about, as far as Britishers are concerned, if not one per cent, came in under such conditions when employers had every facility for bringing them in? </para>

Only the other night he said that we would have refused to allow even John Bull to come here and look at our land. A worse misrepresentation could not be made by any one. It is untrue, and the honorable senator knows it is untrue. </para>

                            <para>- Oh. if you took that as a remark against the Chair, I withdraw it at once, because I never meant it in that sense. I was endeavouring to deal with the qualities of this Bill, in comparison with the Immigration Restriction Act as it stands. 1 consider that clause 5 of the Bill is more effective and stringent than the Act so far as foreigners are concerned. The little concession that was wrung from the Government in another place, I1 am perfectly willing to grant to Britishers anywhere; and I hope that honorable senators opposite who are supporting this concession will, on a future occasion, be prepared to deal with the preferential trade question in the same manner. Under the original Act it was impossible for the Minister to administer the law, effectively. But the power given to the Minister to carry this Bill into effect is much more effective. </para>

                            <para>- But look at the punishment. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> to-day declared that it was unfair to penalize an immigrant coming here under contract to the extent of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;5.</inline> But there are two parties to a contract. If a man in Great Britain makes a contract of this description, he ought to know something about what he is doing, and should take reasonable precautions. Any honorable senator in entering into an agreement with another person would make careful inquiries before signing it. A man on the other side of the seas ought to do. the same. If he comes here without making &#39; inquiries I do not think that he has a right to plead ignorance if he is fined <inline font-style="italic">&#163;5.</inline> But if those who bring him out under the contract are found to be guilty, they are penalized to the extent of &#163;20, in addition to which they have to provide under the Minister&#39;s direction a sum up to <inline font-style="italic">&#163;50,</inline> to recompense the immigrant or to keep him while he is looking for a job, or to send him back to his own. country. I think that the provisions of this Bill will be found to be much more effective, more easy to administer, and more beneficial to the workers of Australia than the haphazard sections of the Immigration Restriction Act. Besides all these penalties, the immigrant, if he is found guilty, becomes, also, a prohibited immigrant, and can be dealt with under the Immigration Restriction Act so far as the powers of deportation and the other penalties of the Act are concerned. Honorable senators must, I think, admit that those members of the Labour Party who are supporting the Government under these circumstances, are doing so conscientiously. We are acting to the very best of our judgment. I do not think that any one has a right to say that we have not the interests of the workers of Australia as much at heart as has any other member of the Senate. For the reasons I have given, I shall support the second reading of the Bill, and before it leaves us I hope it will be made a perfect measure for the prevention of the introduction of contract immigrants. </para>

                        reading the speeches which accompanied the appearance of the Bill elsewhere, and also the speeches made in this Chamber by the Minister and others, that the purpose of the Bill is to lessen in some measure the restrictions  previously  adopted against immigrants to this country. We are now told, however, that the purpose is to increase the restriction.

I have no doubt that my friends opposite will do as I have stated, and for that reason I draw attention to what I know will be the tactics adopted. Exactly the same course will be taken as that followed by the Government when, having &#34;fought to keep a certain provision out of the Postal Act, they subsequently took credit all over Australia for its inclusion. </para>

Not a single honorable senator who previously opposed, but is now supporting, this proposal, has had the honesty to make that admission, and to assert that, so far as he is individually concerned, he intends to remedy a defect. </para>

In order to- mark the dividing-line between those who support the original Act and those who wished for its amendment, I ask what happened when there arose the great scandal over the six hatters? Who urged that the Act should be interpreted so as to exclude these men? My honorable friends opposite. Who urged&#39; that it should not be so interpreted? Honorable senators who sit on the same side of the Chamber as myself. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator will accept anything as proof which supports his argument. I am dealing with facts beyond dispute when I say that it was the unions who put this law in force against the six hatters, and those bodies, with whom my friends opposite are associated, used every power at their disposal to bring the Government to &#34;sticking-point.&#34; But the people who objected to the administration of the Act in that way were my political friends ; and it was only because of the great outcry that the Government were forced to break the Act, which it had helped to pass, and admit these men. I welcome the Bill, although it does not go so far as I should like. It does, however, remove from our statute-book the greatest blot ever placed there, namely, the bar which was created against the reasonably free access of our own kith and kin from Great Britain. The Bill will go as an indication to the people 0 of the old country that whatever mistakes may have been made, we have recognised them and remedied defects, and that in the future, so far as our own countrymen are concerned, we are prepared to abandon the policy of exclusiveness, which, in what I regard as an ill-fated moment, we were induced to adopt. Nothing that could be said bv public men throughout Australia, in the public journals, or bv officials, could do more than will this brief Bill to put&#39; us right in the eyes of the people of Great Britain ; and for that reason I propose to give it my support. </para>

                        <para>- There is one matter to which I should like to draw attention. I have heard the arguments on both sides, but I have not been led to depart in the slightest degree from the opinion which I previously formed; and I intend to vote against the second reading of the Bill. Just two short years ago, when I went before the people of South Australia, part of mv platform was the absolute exclusion, of labour that is bound in any way, and on that ticket I was returned. In my opinion, the restrictions in this regard require strengthening, and not weakening; and it is certain that the Bill has the latter effect. I desire to call the attention of the Senate to the position of shipping on the Australian coast, as affected by the Bill. In the first place, clause 4 provides - </para>

                    <para class="block">The preceding sections 6 and 7 are absolutely the whole Bill, and yet they are not to apply in cases of immigrants under contract to serve on vessels on the Australian coast. I hope the Minister, when replying, will give us some information as to why clause 8 has been inserted. In the original Act, paragraph <inline font-style="italic">k</inline> of section  3  absolutely exempted ships in any port of the Commonwealth, and that provision is retained in force. Amongst the exemptions under it are members of the King&#39;s regular land or sea forces., the master and crew of any public vessel of any Government, and the master and crew of any other - vessel landing during the stay of any vessel in any port of the Commonwealth. This is not a new question, because it has been brought prominently under the attention of the Government. Cases were cited of ships having arrived in Australian waters, with crews shipped under agreement in some of the cheapest ports in the world, in order to compete with Australian seamen. The matter was brought before the Government, who took up the position that they could not administer the Act because of paragraph <inline font-style="italic">k</inline> of the section. A considerable amount of debate has taken place on the question of the extent to which the introduction of contract labour will interfere with shore labour, but it has been generally admitted that during the last few years very few of these contract labourers have presented themselves for admission to Australia. I point out that in the shipping trade they are brought to our doors every day, and if there be any reason for passing these provisions dealing with the admission of contract labour, it is because of the way in which they may affect those engaged in connexion with our shipping. I hope that when we get into Committee we shall be able to deal effectively with the points to which I have referred. I shall not further delay the Senate on the second reading, but I propose to return to these matters when the Bill is in Committee. </para>

But I must confess that I hoped to make more progress with Government business than I have been able to make to-day. Honorable senators will agree that the discussion on the Bill has been a long one, if an interesting one. Nearly every point has been raised in connexion with it that is dealt with in the amendments which, I understand, are to be proposed, and I therefore think that we might go on with the Bill. I should be very glad if honorable senators would be prepared to put it through Committee. </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline>
                    said this afternoon was that it was most important that we should not mislead people in Europe. In my opinion it is more important that they should not be misled as to the intention of this measure than that they should not be misled as to the intention of the Bill with which we have already dealt, because, as I pointed out before, an attempt will undoubtedly be made in England to lead the people there to suppose that we in Australia are as willing under this amendment of the existing Act to introduce Chinese into Australia, as they are that they should be introduced into the Transvaal. The Minister of Defence shakes his head.

                <para>According to the interpretation which was put on the expression &#34; other vessel &#34; by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> when he was Attorney-General, it means every vessel other than the ships of the King&#39;s Navy or any vessel belonging to a Government. Every other vessel comes under the drag-net paragraph <inline font-style="italic">g</inline> , which this clause seeks to repeal. I wish to insert a provision under which the crews of over-sea vessels will be allowed to land at any port of call, but must be mustered before they leave, in order to show that they are all being taken away. In the <inline font-style="italic">Parliamentary Papers</inline> for 1903, honorable senators may see the opinion of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> that paragraph <inline font-style="italic">k</inline> of section 3 overrides paragraph <inline font-style="italic">g,</inline> and that, therefore, the latter has no effect. </para>

                    <para>. - I would point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> that he cannot properly move his amendment in this, clause. It seeks to repeal two provisions which deal with contract labour, whereas he proposes to amend a provision which deals with another subject. It will be observed that the subject-matter of paragraph <inline font-style="italic">k</inline> of section 3 of the Act has nothing to do with contract labour. The honorable senator wishes to amend a general provision in the Act, and that, I submit, cannot be done in this Bill. </para>

If an employer really cannot find in Australia the skilled labour needed for carrying on his business, he is entitled, under this Bill, to bring in labour under contract. But before he does that, I submit he ought to give public notice of the shortage of labour. The best way would be for him to inform the Minister that he requires labour that does not appear to him to be available. In my opinion, the proposed new clause will improve the Bill. At all events, it will cause some official intimation to be made that there is a dearth of labour in any particular industry, and that an employer is desirous to introduce contract labour. </para>

                    will not press this amendment, the effect of which would be that before any employer could take advantage of the Bill he would have to send to the Minister a written notification of his inability to obtain a worker of the requisite skill and ability, and, in addition, to give a month&#39;s notice of his intention to make a contract. On what principle are we justified in making a provision which will have the effect of &#34;holding up &#34; an employer in this way for at least one month?

                <para class="block">J still insist that the Government should make it clear to the public when there is a dearth of labour in some portion of the Commonwealth. I can quite imagine a manufacturer in Melbourne being short of men, and yet ignorant of the fact that labour is available in Sydney. If the Sydney men were made aware of the want of hands in Melbourne, they would go there,, and so render it unnecessary for the employer to import men. I am not particular as to how the notification is given, but some system of the kind would provide a means to attract surplus workers to the place where they can be employed. It is my desire that an employer, before bringing out! more men, who may glut the market, should let it be publicly known that he requires hands. When passing a measure of this kind we ought to take care to safeguard the interests of both employer and employes. If the Minister will not accept the proposed new clause. I ask him to suggest some means by which the object I have in view may be carried out. </para>

                    <para>- I am afraid that this amendment may admit people under contract wholesale from any part of the British Empire, no matter how long ago it is. since their ancestors were citizens of the United Kingdom. There is no limitation to the word &#34; descended,&#34; and it is possible that an intended immigrant&#39;s forefathers may not have resided&#39; in England for 300 years. Our first duty is to the people of Australia. So long as the Minister is satisfied that there are men in Australia wanting work by which to provide food for themselves and their wives and children, no men should be allowed to come into the Commonwealth under contract, whether they come from Great Britain, or anywhere else. In my opinion, the effect of this provision is likely to be an influx of labour under contract, which will have the effect of cutting down the rates of wages and lowering the conditions of labour in Australia. I shall, therefore, press my opposition to it to a division. </para>

                <para class="block">I move the insertion of this clause, in order to provide that, if by any chance, an employer is able to get his contract past the officer administering the Act when the immigrant has arrived at his destination, and is called upon to perform the work for which he has been introduced, if he finds he has been the victim of any misrepresentation which may have been overlooked&#39; by the Minister, he shall not be left without a remedy. With respect to the latter part of the clause it is very possible that where there has been misrepresentation of the kind the immigrant may be put to considerable expense, and I think that it should be at the discretion of the Court to award a certain sum out of the penalty where any is: imposed to the contract immigrant, to enable him to recoup the expense to which; he has been put. </para>
                <para>SenatorCROFT (Western Australia). - I favour the proposed new clause, but I have some doubt about the latter portion of it. The contract immigrant may have an excellent case at law against his employer, and if under this clause the Court orders that he shall receive <inline font-style="italic">jQio</inline> out of the penalty imposed, will that prejudice him iii any action he may have at law for the recovery of damages? </para>

I wish to assist the honorable senator, because the clause is one ot which I approve; I believe in punishing, any man who is guilty of making false representations, but 1 think there is no such thing known to the law as punishing a man for doing something inadvertently, or by his agent unknowingly. &#34;Unknowingly&#34; will be proved by the circumstances ot the case, and if it is not proved the employer should be liable. </para>

I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> to agree to leave out the words &#34;or is likely to be.&#34; 1 suggest also that after the word &#34;Court,&#34; in sub-clause 2, the words &#34;imposing a penalty &#34; should be inserted.

                    SYMON (South Australia). - I am astonished at the statement by which the Minister of Defence seeks to influence the Committee to support the amendment. The honorable senator has said that the word &#34; knowingly &#34; should not be inserted in the clause, because no magistrate or Court would inflict a penalty if it were made to appear that the untrue representation had been innocently made. That is a statement which ought not to be made, because the magistrate would have no discretion whatever, and he would be false to his oath if, after it was proved that an untrue statement had been made, he did not inflict a penalty.

                        <para>- What right have we to fill our gaols with persons when they have been guilty of no offence? My honorable friend does not seem to realize that he is creating a criminal offence, and he is doing it with the same light heart as apparently he will eat his breakfast to-morrow. He seems to think it is a proper thing to create offences right and left in his haste to pass this Bill. We shall have to object to proceeding at this hour if the effect upon him is so demoralizing. The second sub-clause of the proposed new clause is a very dangerous one. It seeks to put the penalty into the pocket of the informer. It proposes to offer a premium to the contract immigrant for turning dbg upon the man who had brought him out. </para>

                            said that the contract immigrant would not be debarred by the penalty being inflicted upon the employer from recovering damages if he had been misled, or if a contract had been &#39;entered into which&#39; was improper. That is his remedy, but we are asked to give him a premium for informing.

                        <para>. - I cannot make a statement about&#39; the close of the session, because I do not know the time the Senate may want to discuss a number of measures of more or less importance, which must be got through before we prorogue. If we make as little progress as we have done to-day, we shall rise perhaps some time before Christmas. But if we make good progress, I think that, by sitting to-morrow and on Saturday and Monday, most likely we shall be able to prorogue on Tuesday or Wednesday. </para>
