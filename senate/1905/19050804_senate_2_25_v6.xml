                            <para>- Necessarily, Lieut. -Col. Clarke would not be entitled to brevet rank, because out of 180 officers who returned before that date, only twenty-nine got it. Evidently, in respect to a number who had returned before that date, the matter was held over until a further Cabinet decision was arrived at, and when it was arrived at they did not get brevet rank. Lieut.-Col. Clarke would not necessarily have got brevet rank if he had returned earlier. </para>

                        <para>- This is a necessary Bill. The growth of wireless telegraphy is already very considerable, and promises to be much greater. It is desirable, therefore, that the Post and Telegraph Department should be prepared to deal with it. I observe that, according to the English Act, in the old country it is considered a matter not only for the Post and Telegraph Department but also for the Defence Department, in which certain powers are vested. I think it is desirable to make some amendments in the Bill in that direction. Clause 3 reads - </para>

                    <para>That seems a very simple and necessary provision. In sub-clause 1 of clause 6 there is provided an immense penalty - <inline font-style="italic">&#163;500</inline> - which is repeated in the next subclause. The English Act fixes the penalty at&#163;100, and also provides an additional penalty of imprisonment, which may be inflicted with a fine. I shall propose, therefore, that we reduce the penalty from&#163;500 to&#163;200, and add these words - &#34; With or without hard labour, for a term not exceeding twelve months.&#34; Clause  8,  as it stands does not seem to be quite sufficient. The search warrant may be granted to any person. I shall propose that the clause be brought into line with the provision in the English Act by substituting these words - </para>

They conflict in no way with the principle of the measure, but assist in carrying it out and safeguarding the work of the Departments. They also give some power to the Minister of Defence as well as to the Postmaster-General. Under the English Act power is possessed by the Postmaster-General, the Admiralty, the Army Council, and the Board of Trade. In our measure I imagine that it will be sufficient to name the Postmaster-General and the Minister of Defence. </para>

                        <para>. - I think the honorable senator&#39;s suggestion is a worthy one, which should be accepted. The Bill, of course, only provides for a system of wireless telegraphy in Australia. The exclusive use of wireless telegraphy within the Commonwealth is to be under the control of the Postmaster-General. The same reason that would apply to the six States applies with equal force to the territory of Papua. Therefore, I shall accept the amendment. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator MILLEN</inline>(New South Wales).Senator Pearce indicated a suggestion which came from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> and which seems to be better than that contained in the amendment. It is true that, to-day, the Commonwealth is only vested with the control of one piece of outside territory ; but one can hardly say what the coming years may bring forth. There are infinite possibilities of greater responsibilities being placed upon the Commonwealth, and we should provide for them. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> has suggested the insertion of the words &#34; and any territory thereof.&#34; That would cover not only the immediate necessities with regard to Papua, but also any other territory that might pass under the control of the Commonwealth. It is, for instance, quite conceivable that one or two islands, which are at present directly under the administration of New South Wales, might at some time pass under the control of the Commonwealth. I might mention Lord Howe Island, as an example. Certainly, the insertion of the word Papua would not cover that case, whereas I should think the term &#34; territory of the Commonwealth &#34; would do so. I, therefore, suggest the advisableness of accepting <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor&#39;s</inline> suggestion. </para>

A copy of it was left with the secretary for Ministers in the Senate this morning, and from that copy another copy has been typed and just now put into my hands. But it is obvious that when honorable senators wish to more amendments in a measure of this character, sufficient notice ought to be given to enable whoever is in charge of the Bill to ascertain from those who are familiar with the working of the departments concerned, and from the experts, whether or not it is desirable that such amendments should be carried. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think it is desirable to delay the Bill. I have consulted the Postmaster-General with regard to the amendment since it has been put into my hands, and I should have liked to consult the permanent head of the Department. But apart from that, I wish to point out that there is not always an equally good reason in Australia for the insertion of provisions in measures that there may be in England. Most of the amendments which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> has indicated in his second-reading speech, are based, to a large extent, upon the desire to bring this Bill into line with the terms of the English Act. In England, there are several authorities such as the Board of Trade, and the Admiralty, in connexion with the peace, order, and good government of the country, that are equally affected by these instrumentalities. In Australia, all the matters in connexion with postal and telegraphic affairs are in the hands of one Department. I have not the slightest doubt that the naval and military authorities of the Commonwealth would be able to use any system of wireless telegraphy under this Bill whenever it was necessary ; because clause 5 makes it clear that - </para>

We certainly have military forces at present. If there is any advantage to be derived from the use of wireless telegraphy, why should we tie our hands by restricting its use?

                        <para>- The remarks of the Minister seem te* emphasize the desirableness of the amendment. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> recognises that it is extremely probable the Military Forces will deem it desirable to use some such system, and that they should be enabled to do so under the most liberal conditions. But the Minister pointed out that the Military Forces could do so by applying to the Post and Telegraph Department for its licence, for which the Bill provides. If the Minister recognises the necessity for the Military Forces being placed in the freest possible position in regard to this invention, the question arises whether it is not better for us to state in the Bill that they have the right, than to leave it to the Postmaster-General to frame conditions which may or may not be harassing. </para>

                            <para>- But if we take away from the Post and Telegraph Department the right to control an officer&#39;s actions, that officer is, of course, free to do as he likes. The Senate has always shown a little suspicion of leaving large powers in the hands of Ministers. I do not wish to refer to the many occasions on which that point has been discussed, but more than once a protest has been made here against placing undue power in the hands of a Minister, allowing him to do by regulation what should be the work of the legislative body. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> nas not pointed out any objection to allowing the Military Forces the right to use those instruments and appliances, but merely says that the Bill as it stands now enables them to do so. That, however, will be under certain conditions absolutely in the hands of the Postmaster-General. With the knowledge we have of parliamentary procedure - of regulations which are framed, and of the annoyance and irritation frequently caused by the unworkable character of regulations - we see that it would be better to; state clearly and simply in the Bill that the Military Forces - which are not likely to abuse the system - shall be free to use it whenever they please.. </para>

As I have said, under ordinary circumstances a Bill does not bind the Crown in the discharge of its ordinary functions in the Commonwealth. It might be desirable that the Crown, in some other Department, should be in a position to use a system&#39; of wireless telegraphy without reference to the Department of the Postmaster-General, but if we adopt the amendment, the question arises whether, having exempted one particular Department, we do not impliedly make, or attempt to make, this Bill bind other Departments of the Crown. Reference is made in the Bill to the King&#39;s Navy. The King&#39;s ships of war, when in the Commonwealth or anywhere else, are the ships of war of the Crown ; but, as honorable senators know, a distinction is drawn by constitutional lawyers between the Crown in its Imperial functions and the Crown as the Crown in the Commonwealth acting under the provisions of the Commonwealth Constitution, and the Constitutions of the different States. The words &#34; This Act shall not apply to ships belonging to the King&#39;s Navy,&#34; were put in to show expressly that there was no intention to in any way interfere with the ships of the Navv. </para>

                            <para>- But I think it as well to have a clause expressly stating that we do not in any way attempt to interfere with ships of the Navy which may, as they nearly all do, have a system of wireless telegraphy on board when they come into our ports. If we start to exempt, or purport to exempt, certain departments of the Crown, we at once raise the question whether we are not exempting those alone and leaving other departments bound. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator PULSFORD</inline>(New South Wales). - I cannot help recognising that I have done myself some little injustice by the late notice I was able to give the Minister of this amendment. The Minister, coming in contact with an amendment which he has not studied, must naturally be on the defensive, whereas had he had time to examine it in all its bearings, he would probably have raised no objection. It is singular that my amendment proposes to carryout the very object which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie desires, though the honorable senator thought that I was antagonistic to the idea. I should be quite willing to see the clause eliminated, but if we say that the Bill shall not apply to ships of war, I ask that we should make it equally clear that it does not apply to the Military Forces. Wireless telegraph is an entirely new departure, and it is now part and parcel of the equipment of our Military and Naval Forces. I propose, by the amendment, that the Minister of Defence shall have power more or less equal with that granted to his colleague, the Postmaster-General. </para>

In that Act there is no such provision, and honorable senators must know that in cases of emergency the Military and Naval Forces would have no hesitation in using the telegraphs of the Commonwealth. Why should we in a supplementary measure make a special provision which might throw some doubts <inline font-style="italic">on</inline> the position in regard to the main Act ? It may be said that in the Post and Telegraph Act there is no provision as to the King&#39;s Navy. But wireless telegraphy applies in a very different way in the case of ships, from that in which it applies to ordinary land telegraphy. I ask honorable senators to pass the clause as it stands. </para>

                        <para>- Personally I do not see any harm in the proposed proviso, but in my opinion it would be merely surplusage if inserted. There is nothing in the clause as it stands which would, in my opinion, in any way suggest that the Postmaster-General reserves to himself the right of erecting electrical apparatus for any purpose other than the transmission and reception of messages. The addition of the proviso suggested would make it doubtful whether the Postmaster- General would have the exclusive powers which paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c</inline> of the clause purports to confer upon him, since it might make it competent for any person to erect electrical apparatus for the reception of messages. There is nothing in the clause as it stands to suggest that any person who established and erected electrical apparatus for actuating machinery would contravene the provisions of the Bill. The proviso would only add to the length of the Bill, and would not make clause 4 any clearer than it already is. </para>

                    <para class="block">The power of . government by regulation given by that clause is simply immense. In common with other honorable senators, I have seen enough of what has happened when unlimited powers have been given to Departments, to make me feel that it is desirable that, as far as possible, Parliament should legislate for itself, and should not leave things to <inline font-style="italic">be</inline> arranged by regulation, or as prescribed by the Minister for the time being. In the circumstances, I urge that the amendment be accepted, in order that it may be made quite clear that any person putting up electrical apparatus which is not intended to infringe any of the privileges of the Postmaster-General under the Bill, will not be interfered with. The wording of the proviso is taken from the English Act. I have not invented it. I see no reason why the amendment should not be accepted, and there are many reasons why it is desirable that such a proviso should be added to the clause. </para>

                            <para>- The regulations must not be inconsistent with the Bill, and they have to be submitted to Parliament. In inserting the proposed proviso, there is a danger which I did not foresee when speaking before, and that is that, to a certain extent, the insertion of such a proviso might possibly invite persons to commit a breach of the main provision of the Bill. With an extended coastline such as we have in Australia it is possible that some person on the coast might erect electrical apparatus to be used in some way for the receipt and transmission of messages in connexion with his own works. </para>

                            <para>- The power is defined in the Bill itself. The only possible extension of that power would , be by regulations inconsistent with the Bill. I do not think it is for us to anticipate that regulations will be framed which will be inconsistent with the Bill. When they are framed, they must be submitted in the ordinary course &#39;to Parliament. Honorable senators are assuming that they will be inconsistent with the Bill; that, consequently, a wrong will be done bv the Department in the first instance ; and, further, that we shall be blind to it when the regulations are brought under our notice. The words of the proviso would be merely surplusage, and would possibly amount to an invitation of the kind I mentioned just now. </para>

                        <para>- Honorable senators will see that the penalty provided in this clause is; &#163;500. I think it is too high. The English Act fixes the minimum penalty at &#163;100, but it does something more, which this Bill&#39; does not do. It gives a power of imprisonment. Whilst a fine of&#163;500 might not be a deterrent to some men, imprisonment would. </para>

                        <para>- Under this provision, it would be competent for a Court to impose a penalty as high as ^500, or as low as is. In other measures we have prescribed penalties as high as ^500. For instance, .in the case of illicit distillation, a penalty of ^500 is prescribed. So far as the community is concerned, the illicit use of wireless telegraphy might be a far greater offence than illicit distillation could possibly be. </para>

A single wireless telegraphy station on the north coast of Australia might do incalculable harm to the whole community.

If he proposed to raise the penalty from .&#163;500 to ^1,000, I should be with him too.

                        <para>- If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> will alter his amendment so as to eliminate the fine, and substitute a substantial term of imprisonment as a penalty, he shall have my support. I wish the penalty to be at least five years&#39; imprisonment. In our Acts, there is too great a disposition to substitute fines for imprisonment as a form of punishment. A wealthy offender can always escape the indignity of going to gaol, but a poor man, because he cannot pay the fine, has no opportunity of escaping that obloquy. All a wealthy offender has to do is to shell out some of. his surplus cash, and we appear to be quite satisfied. It has been pointed out by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> that there is a national danger in allowing any one to work a wireless telegraphy station in any part of the Commonwealth, because it might be used to our detriment, and even to our national destruction. Any term of imprisonment which could be imposed for a crime of that character would not be too great. </para>

There is nothing in that argument, because if the monetary punishment can be reduced to an infinitesimal amount, the imprisonment can also be reduced to an infinitesimal time. If the amendment be defeated, I shall move to eliminate the monetary punishment with a view to substitute a term of imprisonment. </para>

That for certain grievous offences, such as wilful attempts to defeat the Act, there should be punishment by way of imprisonment I quite agree ; but to say that there should be no other form of punishment, appears to me to be going to the opposite extreme.. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> pointed out the weak spot in the contention when he mentioned that someone might have unconsciously committed a little offence against the Act or some regulation thereunder. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens,</inline> with that large humanity which marks his character, would hale the offender to gaol at once. In modern times, the whole tendency of legislation has been in the humane direction, and not in the direction of returning to the old barbarous laws which disgraced the earlier years of last century. </para>

                            <para>- In all good faith, a man might exceed the terms of his licence, and yet the magistrate would be bound to punish him. It would be wrong to have no alternative punishment to be used according to the discretion of the Court. In many cases, men are convicted of a technical offence, but their honesty of motive is recognised by the presiding Magistrate or Judge; and he inflicts a nominal penalty. Let me point out the inconsistent attitude of some honorable senators. In the previous clause they were quite prepared to leave the largest measure of power to the departmental officers and the Minister; but they hesitate to leave a measure of power to our Judges and juries. If I were asked to give a discretionary power to any one, I should give it to the latter. While I am quite prepared that as an alternative, to be used at the discretion of the Court, there shall also be a term of imprisonment, still I cannot countenance the proposal to make imprisonment the only punishment. </para>

                        <para>- It appears to me that the punishment to be awarded under the clause should be either very heavy or very light. I cannot see why the penalty or the term of imprisonment should be fixed. I think that it should be left to the discretion of the Judges or the magistrates. Can we not conceive circumstances in which a sentence of imprisonment for twelve months or two years would be absolutely unjust. If we provide for punishment by either fine or imprisonment, I think we shall have done enough. It is almost impossible to realize the nature of an offence unless we know the conditions under which it has been committed. </para>

There can be no trifling offence committed under the clause; it can only be a flagrant violation of the law, and therefore a minimum should be fixed. If we were to fix the maximum at ten years imprisonment that would be much more reasonable than not to provide, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> suggests, for either a minimum or a maximum in the case of either fine or imprisonment. The honorable senator would not like to wake up some morning and find that a friend who had been guilty of an offence against the Act had been landed in prison for the term of his natural life, or for twenty years. He would feel very sorry then that he had not fixed a. maximum, of, say, five or ten years, by which the Judge&#39;s would be bound. The clause should provide for a minimum term not exceeding one year, and for a maximum term not exceeding ten years. That would leave a wide margin to the Court. </para>

It would require comparison with punishments for other offences of a corresponding character to enable one to form an opinion. I should like to have an opportunity to refer to our Post and Telegraph Act, our Customs Act, and other Statutes, in order to see what penalties we have imposed for other offences. I would impress upon honorable senators that one of the most prominent facts in connexion with the legislative work of recent years - I am not referring specially to Commonwealth legislation - has been the enormous quantity of time occupied in amending defective Bills. In our States Parliaments three-fourths of the time is taken up by amending Acts previously passed. I suggest, therefore, that the amendment be postponed, in order to enable us to obtain information which is necessary before we can come to a proper conclusion. </para>

Wireless telegraphy, as I said some time ago, is an instrument of warfare, and some person of evil disposition might use it so as to inflict grave injury on the Commonwealth. It was in view of that possibility that I was willing to accept an increase of the maximum penalty, and I cannot be guided by the consideration of the penalties imposed under other Acts, where money matters only are at stake. </para>

Contraventions of this measure would possibly take place at great distances from the centres of population. The English circumstances are totally different from ours. A wireless telegraphy station might be discovered somewhere on the north coast of Western Australia. Suppose that a justice of the peace was satisfied that there was reasonable ground for believing that there was such a station in contravention of this measure. It would considerably impede the officers from doing their duty if they had to wait until they had communicated with the Postmaster- </para>

The very reasons assigned in discussing the last section, for imposing a heavy penalty as a maximum, apply equally in this case in dealing with any contravention of the measure. It is necessary that there should be the utmost expedition, unless people are to be allowed to contravene the measure at some remote point, and to do it flagrantly until the Postmaster-General shall be communicated with to authorize a certain person to authorize a justice of the peace to make a search. By permitting that, we should not be carrying out the purpose of the Bill, but should simply be putting ourselves in the hands of those persons who wished to contravene it. </para>

The establishment of the Commonwealth created a number of new positions and offices, and it is deemed desirable to exempt from the liability I have mentioned the persons who occupy those offices and positions, and who were not in contemplation when the Acts of the States were passed. Clause 1 contains merely the short title; and the second clause, which comprises the whole of the legislative effect of the Bill, exempts from liability to serve as jurors the following persons : - The Governor-General, members of the Federal Executive Council, Justices of the High Court and of other Courts created by the Parliament, senators and members of the House of Representatives, members of the Inter- State Commission, officers of the Public Service of the Commonwealth, and members of the permanent Naval and Military Forces. </para>

                    <para>Honorable senators have had an opportunity to peruse the measure, but I intend to add a further clause which the Minister in charge in another place practically promised should be proposed in the Senate. The provisions of the Bill are similar to those in the legislation of the various States and of Great Britain with regard to what matters a Court shall take judicial notice of, without being under the necessity to call on persons to come forward and give oral evidence of identification. Under ordinary circumstances, in order to prove before a Court the signature of a person, if the signature is not admitted, it is necessary for some person familiar with the hand-writing of the party whose signature is in question, to testify as to its authenticity. Obviously it would be very awkward and difficult for the administration of justice, if the signatures of persons occupying official positions had in every instance to be proved in the same way as it is necessary to prove the signatures of private individuals who may not be known to the Court or outside their own immediate circle. Clause 4 is as follows : - </para>

But the Court takes this judicial notice only when the signature or seal has relation to any judicial or official document. For instance, the Court would take notice of the official signature of the President of the Senate on any document which he signed as President, whether he were President to-day, or had been President twenty or thirty years back. But in the case of the President&#39;s signature in his private character, and affecting his own private business, the Court would require the same proof as is demanded in the case of every other private individual. If the Court were restricted to the proof necessary in the case of a private individual, when official documents are concerned, it might be necessary for officers from the </para>

                    <para class="block">Then there is provision for proof of judicial proceedings. Proof of evidence of any judicial proceeding of the High Court, or any Federal Court, including any affidavit, pleading, or legal document filed or deposited in any such Court, it is proposed may be given in all courts by the production of a document, purporting to be an examined copy thereof, and purporting to be sealed with the seal of the Court, or purporting to be certified by a registrar or chief officer of the Court. Honorable senators will see that the object of the Bill is simply to enable courts of justice, in dealing with matters where documents, books, entries, or records of an official character have to be proved, to accept proof of these in circumstances which would not ordinarily be evidence in connexion with private records or private transactions. It is necessary that this should be so in order that the administration of the various Government Departments may be carried on expeditiously, and may not be interfered with or hampered by the necessity for the production of original documents and records. Without such provision, some Departments would have to keep a staff of officers whose duties would be confined to attendance in various courts to prove certain documents, acts, and publications in respect of those Departments. In dispensing with the ordinary rule of evidence, in regard to the production of original documents, the Bill makes ample provision that the copies or other evidence produced in lieu of originals must be properly certified and authenticated, so that the: Court shall not be in any way misled. I have already indicated that it is proposed to add a new clause, which is to the following effect : - </para>

This might necessitate persons interested travelling great distances to attend before a commissioner for the purpose of making an affidavit to be used in the High Court. On account of the extent of our territory and the distances at which persons interested in matters before the High Court might be from the larger centres of population, provision is made by the proposed new clause to enable them to make affidavits, for use in that Court, before a justice of the peace. As honorable senators are aware, justices of the peace have now the power to take affidavits in connexion with State matters of very great importance, and it is considered that they may be charged with the duty of taking affidavits which may often have to be taken in remote parts of Australia for use in the High Court. </para>

                        <para>- It seems tome that it was not necessary to insert the words &#34; for a State.&#34; The objection raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> is not quite met by their insertion. The. Minister said that in his opinion a justice of the peace could only act in this capacity while he was within his own jurisdiction. But even by the way in which the new clause has been amended, he would not be confined within that limit. Supposing, for instance, that an honorable senator, who was a justice of the peace for Tasmania, were asked to act while he was in Victoria, it seems to me that, as the new clause is worded, he could act. Whether the words- &#34; when acting within his jurisdiction &#34; ought not to be added to the words already inserted, is a question which I suggest for the consideration of the Minister. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator KEATING.-</inline> The terms of the commission of a justice of the peace practically define his jurisdiction, and immediately he goes beyond the territory of his State or district, it ceases to operate. My purpose in inserting the words &#34; for any State,&#34; was to make it clear that it did not necessarily mean a Commonwealth justice of the peace, such as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> contemplated. But I find that according to section 9 of the Acts Interpretation Act of last year - &#34; Justice of the Peace &#34; includes a Justice of the Peace for a State or part of a State. </para>

I do not think that outside his jurisdiction a justice of the peace could exercise the power of attesting that is conferred by this clause. I think it could only be exercised by a justice of the peace while he was acting within the terms of his commission, that is, within the territory of his State or district. </para>

                <para class="block">In view of the small amount of business on the notice-paper, I do not think it would be fair to ask honorable members to sit next week, but I would request them to come prepared on Wednesday week to goon with the consideration of the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway Survey Bill, and to continue it until it is finished. Next week several honorable senators wish to be away, and if we were to meet they would have very great difficulty in getting pairs. Otherwise I should ask honorable senators to sit next week, and complete the consideration of that Bill if possible. </para>
