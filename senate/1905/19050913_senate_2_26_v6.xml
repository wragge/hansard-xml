                    <para>- I wish to take advantage of this opportunity to ask the leader of the Senate whether he will make an inquiry as to the work which the Printing Committee is or is not doing? I understand that for some weeks or months the Printing Committee has not done any active work, but that a similar body in another place does the work for which it was appointed. In that House, most of the papers which are laid upon the table are referred to the Printing Committee, which meets and resolves what papers should be printed, and reports accordingly. It is most desirable that our Printing Committee should follow that practice, and that we should have an opportunity of knowing that papers which are sought to be printed have been examined by a committee of five or seven men who think that they are worth printing. We are getting into a very loose habit of ordering a document to be printed on the motion of an honorable senator without any one else knowing whether it is of importance or not. </para>

                    (South Australia Minister of Defence). - -This is npt- a matter in which I should be asked&#39; to interfere. It is purely one for the Senate to deal with. A Minister has no control over the Senate or its officers. The course adopted in South Australia, might perhaps be adopted here with advantage. In each House of its Parliament, any documents which a Minister lays upon the table, and does not move to have printed, are referred to a Printing Committee. Through its chairman that body brings up a weekly report, which is read by the President or the Speaker, as the case may be, and which recommends that a paper bearing a certain number and title, should or should not be printed.

                        <para>- No, last session. We drew up certain rules of procedure, came to the Senate, and asked1 it to invest us with certain powers. We asked for exactly the same powers as the Printing Committee of the House of Representatives was invested with. We arranged that the two Committees should sit together, the chairman of the Senate Printing Committee, and the chairman of the House of Representatives Printing Committee presiding alternately. We asked that all papers laid upon the table should be referred to the Printing Committee, and that the two Printing Committees should jointly decide what should be printed, and what should not. When we brought our request before the Senate, Ministers opposed it, and if I remember rightly, you, sir, also did so. </para>

                <para class="block">Committee considered that it would have been simply foolish to meet under the circumstances. In my opinion there has been great waste and extravagance by the Senate in ordering many papers to be printed which never should have been printed; and which if referred to the Printing Committee would in all probability never have been printed. Some of them, I venture to say, were extremely expensive to print, have never been read by senators, and are practically of no use or interest. It is absolutely useless, however, to have a Printing Committee unless it has some powers. .We asked for the same powers as the Printing Committee of the House of Representatives has &#62; and as those powers were not given to us there was- nothing for the Committee to do. </para>

                        <para>- No doubt. The difficulty with regard to the waste of money in the printing of unnecessary papers is due to the fact that perhaps too great facilities are afforded for the printing of papers. The remedy for that, I say with all deference to my honorable friend the Minister of Defence, is for the Government to exercise some kind of control over (he papers that are ordered to be printed. Some papers are of importance. With regard to others, the members of the Government might move that they be referred to the Printing Committee for its consideration. </para>

                        <para>- My honorable friend adopts a <inline font-style="italic">tu quo qui,</inline> which, is not very appropriate while we are discussing this question. His remark is not true so far as concerns the late Government, but if it were true it would not enable him to get rid of the duty that rests upon him, and which he has been a little slack in discharging. He has a duty in respect to the Senate and to the Printing Committee. That duty is that when a paper is laid on the table by himself, or by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> if a motion is submitted, he shall state whether he thinks it is desirable that it should be printed, or be referred to the Printing Committee. If that course were followed, the occupation of the Printing Committee would not be gone. It would have something to do, and there would be some reason for calling it together. That would obviate unnecessary printing, and would prevent an order of the Senate being made for the printing of a paper without sufficient information as to its&#39; value. My honorable friend has the remedy in his ownhands. </para>

                    <para>- Since I have been a member of the Senate every senator has desired that every paper which was thought worthy of being placed upon the table of the Senate should be printed. If that is the case I do not see where the responsibility of the Government comes in, nor what need there is for a Printing Committee. My contention is that if any paper is of sufficient importance to be laid upon the table it ought to be printed. Honorable senators cannot be expected to wade through pages and pages of writing and typescript. </para>

                    <para>- I share <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart&#39;s</inline> opinion that every paper that is of sufficient importance to be laid upon the table of the Senate ought to be printed, and that we ought not to be at the mercy of a Committee which may be influenced one way or another as to the importance of a particular paper. I can instance a case which afforded me considerable annoyance. Last session, or perhaps the session before, a very interesting pile of letters was laid upon the table for our inspection. They had reference to Government House, Sydney. I made some notes from them. Those letters are not now available, because they were not printed. Apparently, they did not reach the hands of the Clerk in the ordinary formal way. They would be particularly valuable in connexion with a series of letters which have been printed. The letters to which I allude were handed to the Commonwealth Government by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Harry</inline> Rawson, Governor of New South Wales. The letters which have been printed were handed to the Government by the present Government of New South Wales. The two lots of letters throw a most interesting light one on the other. This is a case in point, which shows the desirableness of printing nearly every paper laid upon the table. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> has raised the question of petitions ; and here is an example of what may happen under the present system. Here we have what, to my mind, is an absolutely unimportant petition, which has been put into print at the instance of the Printing Committee of another place. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that a joint Committee is necessary. If an honorable senator succeeds in passing a motion that a return&#39; be laid upon the table, he ought to be entitled to have that paper printed, with the sanction of the Senate, and without reference to any Committee. It is obvious that an honorable senator would, not submit a motion of the kind unless he were acquainted with the contents of the return, and deemed them to be of value, or desired that they should be circulated for some useful purpose. </para>

                    <para>. - This clause contains definitions of terms which occur in very many places throughout the Bill; and, following the practice that has been adopted on previous occasions in connexion with lengthy measures, and which is in conformity with the procedure of the British&#39; House of Parliament, I suggest that the consideration of the clause be postponed until after the main provisions have been dealt with. In English Bills, the definitions are, or were, usually placed at the end, but in Australia, for convenience more than for any other reason, they are placed at the beginning. If we pass the definitions as they stand, we may find that we have, to a certain extent, circumscribed ourselves in regard to amendments later on in other clauses. I move - </para>

                    <para>- I commend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> for the wise course he has taken in moving, for the reasons given, the postponement of the consideration of this clause. This is not a Bill for party discussion; and, seeing that we are endeavouring to legislate with a view to practically codifying the law in relation to copyright, and to bringing that law up to* date, it is desirable that we should all assist, as far as possible, to that end. It is perfectly possible that all honorable senators may not be present when the other clauses have been dealt with, and clause 4 comes before us again, and I should like to make one or two suggestions with a view to improving definitions which have been introduced. I ask honorable senators to consider the suggestions I make, not merely! in relation to this clause, but also in relation to other clauses. I dare say <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> will forgive me for sounding a sort of preliminary note of warning as to the source of a large number of the new clauses. According to a very useful paper which has been circulated, those clauses have been taken, not from any legislation now in force, but from a Bill which has been before only one branch of the British Parliament. We must not, therefore, adopt those new. clauses on the assumption that they have any authority from previous legislation, because the Bill in England has never yet been considered by the British Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- That was in 1900, since which time the measure has remained in the limbo of neglected Bills. We cannot regard it as having passed through the fire of parliamentary criticism, or as having been followed by practical application, and experience. These particular clauses have not, therefore, the legislative stamp upon them, nor have we the advantage of any practical experience of their working as a part of the law of the land&#39;. They may be good or bad, but I am sure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> would not ask honorable senators to accept them merely because they happened to appear in the English Bill. They have really no more weight as having been taken from that Bill than have the recommendations of the&#39; Royal Commission! which sat now thirty years ago, in 1875, and&#39; reported twenty-seven years ago in relation to the law of copyright. Its report has for twenty-seven years lain in the archives of the Imperial Parliament, gathering dust. No step in the form of legislation appears to have been taken until the introduction of the Bill of 1900. I take great exception to some of .these clauses, and whether they be good or bad in the opinion of others we should apply to them our own original consideration, and adopt them if we are satisfied that their objects, and the methods adopted for carrying out those objects, are good, and not simply because they bear the stamp or imprimatur of the Imperial Legislature, which they, do not. I take the opportunity on this clause of making these remarks as applicable to a large number of the clauses which the very useful document circulated amongst us indicates to be clauses taken from the Copyright Bill of 1900 and the&#34; Copyright (Artistic) Bill of the same year. With regard to this clause itself, I invite <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> to consider between now and the time at which he will submit it to the acceptance of the Committee, whether the word &#34; author &#34; should not be defined. There is a definition as to what it shall include, and it is provided that it shall extend to the personal representatives of an author, but there is no definition of the word. It seems to me that that is especially necessary. </para>

                        <para>- I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dawson</inline> will find that the definition might be improved, and it should be inserted iri the interpretation clause, instead of in another part of the Bill. 1 suggest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> also that throughout the definition clause wherever possible he should adhere to the word &#34;includes&#34; instead of using the word &#34;means.&#34; For instance, in the Bill it is provided that an artistic work &#34; includes,&#34; or an author &#34;includes,&#34; whilst a book &#34;means.&#34; The word &#34;includes&#34; will give exactly the same effect, and will not shut out the ordinary interpretation. </para>

                        <para>- They are not exclusive, but in looking through the other clauses my honorable and learned friend will find that it will be well to keep to one definition of a particular subject of copyright. If we do not, it will, I think, be found that there is nothing more likely to create confusion, in the administration of such, a measure as this, which in some respects is more intricate and complex than is a Patents Act than a departure from that principle. We should &#34;define the word &#34;book&#34; as including &#34;newspaper,&#34; or the word &#34;periodical&#34; as including &#34;newspaper,&#34; and not have two different words defined to include the same thing. Then in the definition of &#34;lecture,&#34; I do not quite know what is meant by the expression &#34; a piece for recitation.&#34; A piece for recitation would ordinarily mean a poem written by some one else, an arrangement of poems, or an arrangement of some rhetorical and eloquent piece of prose. The phrase is not very intelligible to me. In offering some observations on the second reading of the Bill, I referred to the definition of &#34;publication.&#34; The matter is the subject of considerable discussion in the <inline font-style="italic">Publishers&#39; Circular</inline> of May last, in which some questions are asked indicating this difficulty, which I invite my honorable and learned friend to consider. We know that a number of books are published for private circulation. We know also that there are a number of literary societies - Shelley, Shakespeare, and Browning societies, and a number of others. There are also scientific societies, which issue their proceedings and reports to members and subscribers only. In addition, they sometimes publish works which may be out of print for the benefit of their members and subscribers, and issue them to those persons only. In the case of books printed for private: circulation, the result will be that if that private circulation does not amount to publication, and we do not make it publication, the copyright will not begin to run. </para>

                        <para>- I think that probably it was intended to cover it. What I suggest is that after the words to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has called attention, there should be added the words &#34;whether marked for private circulation or not, and whether to subscribers or to private friends or not.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- No; what we are dealing with is the law of copyright. On the one hand, we desire to protect the interests of authors, and on the other hand we wish to give the community the benefit of these books. The same mischief is created if the author of a book should make an edition of, say, twenty copies. No one else has the right to reprint that book. He has made his publication, and if he has sold his copyright, the result will be that the first edition of the book will increase enormously in value, and if it suits the publisher, <inline font-style="italic">ten</inline> years afterwards, when the value of the book has increased enormously, he may publish another very limited edition, and the general public will be unable to secure the book at all. So it is with books published for private circulation. Many persons adopt this course from a retiring disposition, and unwillingness to offer themselves to public criticisms - to seem to be publishing a book for sale - and for various other reasons. Some of them forget that the public have also an interest in their books, and that their benefit to the community must <inline font-style="italic">be</inline> considered as against  the rights of the authors. </para>

                        <para>- No ; if they are published for private circulation only, there are two things which will result : they will remain the private property of the author, and no copyright attach to them. No other person can print them. On the other hand, if such&#39; a distribution is declared to be publication, then, the author will be entitled to the copyright from the dale of that distribution. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, under the common law. We step in with our legislation and give him a legislative copyright from the moment of publication to the world; but if he keeps his hand on the book and marks it private there is no publication. That is a difficulty which has already arisen, and a perfectly impractical proposal has been suggested in America to make two kinds of copyrights, one a sort of private copyright, and the other a public copyright. That, of course, is only introducing complexity. My own view is that the expression, &#34; or the first distribution of copies of it &#34; may cover my suggestion. Probably it was so intended; but it should be made more clear. </para>

There is no copyright&#39; in the books, and they cannot be reprinted by any one but the authors.

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator KEATING</inline>
                    (Tasmania- Honorary Minister).^ - I am very glad to have had the advantage of the criticism of some of the definitions by
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon.</inline>
                    But while I do not agree in every instance that there is a necessity for any of the alterations he has indicated, still everything he has said will receive the fullest consideration, and I can assure him and others that the whole subject-matter off the clause will, receive the best possible attention before it is again considered, in order that it may be framed in such a way as to give proper effect to the desire of Parliament. With regard to the criticism which
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline>
                    directed to the sources of many of these clauses - the clauses in the Copyright Bill and the Copyright (Artistic) Bill - I agree with him that they have not yet received the stamp of legislative authority. While one of these Bills was passing through the House of Lords, it was dealt with by gentlemen than whom perhaps few men in the Empire are more qualified to speak on this important department of law. The honorable and learned senator has said that for that reason we should be to some extent chary in giving the same force and consideration to these clauses as we would if they were the substance of an enactment which had borne the test of experience. That is perfectly correct, but at the same time I would take this occasion to remind honorable senators that in the instances in which we have taken advantage of these clauses, we have not in many cases slavishly followed their verbiage. In some instances, as they will see by reference to the memorandum, we have taken the substance of the clauses and improved upon them, as we think. In other instances, the clauses have been adopted perhaps bodily, but most of these clauses were not new, and contained nothing novel or original or the part of their framers. They were merely a concise expression of the common law on the subject, as it has been determined during the last century or more, by the judicial interpretations given by the various courts. Honorable senators may think sometimes that, in adopting a clause practically as it stood in the Copyright Bill, we were subject to the criticism which has been levelled at us by
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline>
                    that we were adopting something for which there is no legislative warrant, and which has not had the actual test of experience. But during the course of their inquiries, the Royal Commission to which he referred, and which sat some twenty-seven or thirty years ago, not merely confined themselves to the existing statute law, but considered the operation of that law, how it affected the public generally, authors, and publishers, and also how it had been interpreted from time to time by the various judicial tribunals. Where it was possible, as it was in many instances, to get from the number of cases in which there was no conflict a clear and correct expression of a principle of law, they adopted it, and put it in a concise form, making it statutory instead of common law. In such instances, I think we have been perfectly justified, so long as the verbiage was all that could be desired, in adopting clauses which are merely a concrete expression of the common law. In circulating this memorandum, and drawing the attention of honorable senators to similar provisions elsewhere, we are not seeking by any means to wrongly impress on their minds that the clauses which in many instances have been the sources of these provisions, have anything like legislative authority. I think that the only reason why they have not the force of legislative authority is that assigned by
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scrutton,</inline>
                    whom I quoted in my second-reading speech, that the block of business in the House of Commons has for many years been so great, and there are subjects of such party and vital interest arising there every day, that matters of this character are, by the greater number of honorable members, practically looked upon as being of an academic character.

                    will recollect that a good many years ago it was decided, in the Bradlaugh case, that unless the work was of a very grave and prurient character the word indecent could not be applied. This was laid down in the case of the prosecution of the book entitled
                    <inline font-style="italic">The Fruits of Philosophy.</inline>
                    Of course, all such books would be covered by the expression &#34; immoral.&#34; I do not think that any one of us desires that an immoral publication, so decided by the Courts, ought to be the subject of copyright.

                    (Tasmania- Honorary Minister). - I do not see that it would be an advantage to substitute the word &#34; immoral &#34; for the word &#34;indecent&#39;,&#34; because, however wide and vague the term &#34;profane&#34; may be, the term &#34; immoral &#34; is still more wide and&#39; vague. The question of morality, or immorality, especially in connexion with literature, is one upon which it would be very difficult to get any two minds to agree. There are books which are written in the ordinary course, and read very widdy bv persons of both sexes and of all ages. To the minds of some persons, these works are perfectly pure and moral, but to the minds of others they are highly immoral. The term &#34; immoral &#34; is too wide and comprehensive, and likely to be subject to many different interpretations. If the word &#34;indecent&#34; does not meet with the approval of the Committee, the word &#34; obscene &#34; might meet the cases with which we wish to deal, but I think the word &#34; immoral &#34; is capable of too varied an interpretation.

                        <para>- The Copyright Bill as passed through the House of Lords, in clause 4, sub-clause 4, contained the words &#34; any profane, indecent, seditious, or libellous book.&#34; The word &#34; immoral &#34; would be too varying a term. One might, for instance, ask for the opinion of the public generally as to the twelve most immoral books that have, recently been published; and I venture to say that perhaps 80 or 100 books would be heavily voted for as coming under that description. Some books which have been published within the last five years are considered by some people to be immoral, whilst other members of the community take quite a contrary view. It will be convenient to adhere to the words of the Copyright Bill as passed by the House of Lords as far as possible, so that in the event of the Imperial Parliament hereafter passing this legislation, our measure will be uniform with theirs. </para>

                    <para>- I trust that the Government will not agree to the insertion of the word &#34; immoral.&#34; If that were done we should be brought face to face with&#39; difficulties arising through the indefiniteness of the word, and should never know where we were. The word &#34; immoral &#34; is often used with regard to political works. I have heard it applied to the teachings of Henry George, and to the single tax. </para>

                        <para>- It is an instance of the vagueness of the word. I am afraid that if it were inserted in this Bill, many such hair-splitting definitions would be given, and we do not know what injustices might be done. The word &#34; indecent,&#34; or &#34;blasphemous,&#34; would be far more definite than the word &#34; immoral.&#34; It would never do to put in an Act of Parliament a word that would lead to so much difference of opinion. I can quite believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> looking at the matter from a professional stand-point, might like to insert a word that would lead to much profit to the lawyers, but we do not want to make our Acts of Parliament a means of increasing the number of cases in the law courts </para>

                    Largie stopped when he was getting most interesting. I thought he was about to define the word &#34; indecent,&#34; but he abstained from that exceedingly interesting effort. I frankly confess that if I could think of any word that would carry out the sense and intention of the Legislature better than the word &#34; immoral,&#34; I should prefer it. My idea, of course, is to avoid those consequences to which my honorable friend alluded, as leading to undue litigation. We ought to see to it that the language of our Acts of Parliament is so expressed that the possibilities of dispute are as far as possible  avoided. What impresses me in relation to the word &#34;indecent&#34; is this: There is verv great difficulty in saying to what books it applies.

                        <para>- I think that would be better than &#34;indecent,&#34; but &#34;immoral&#34; is the best word of the three. The word &#34;indecent&#34; is extremely difficult to define in relation to the law of copyright, so as to exclude from its benefit the authors of productions which may be described as indecent. I do not think, for instance, that any one would wish to give the advantage of copyright to books like <inline font-style="italic">The Fruits of Philosophy.</inline> There may be a demand for books of that character greater than for other books which could be mentioned.! What we want to stop is the making of such books a profitable property in the hands of their authors. For myself, I say at once that such a book as <inline font-style="italic">The Fruits of Philosophy</inline> should not have the advantage of copyright. That is what we ought to stop. Nevertheless, when a prosecution took place as to that book, the point was raised as to its being an &#34; indecent publication,&#34; and the prosecution failed. It was not regarded by the Court as indecent; and, therefore, such a book would be protected by copyright, and the consequent  profits  from its sale would go into the pockets of the author. </para>

                        <para>- No, I think not. The word &#34; immoral &#34; is much wider, and would have enabled the Court to say that the book was a violation of the law, and came within the definition of &#34;immoral book.&#34; But as the word used was &#34; indecent,&#34; the&#39; Court said that the publication was not an indecent one; it was an immoral book, but not indecent in the legal sense of the term as being calculated to arouse passion. It is from that point of view that I think &#34; immoral &#34; is the better word for the purpose of preventing copyright being extended to books which are in a grosser sense immoral. We can all attach a definition to the word &#34;immoral,&#34; and it would be for the Court to say whether a book came within the legal definition or not. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> says that the word is too wide to use in a law of copyright, by which we are giving a property to authors in their books. I think it would be better to have a larger and wider word than &#34;indecent,&#34; which has been subject to decisions and has been found practically to be insufficient. My honorable friend said something in regard to plays which might be regarded as having immoral tendencies. But we cannot stop that.&#39; It is not the purpose of this Bill to stop anything of that kind. Its purpose is not to give a property to the author of a production which violates certain conditions. My honorable friend also said that we should retain the word &#34; indecent &#34; in order to secure uniformity with the Bill which was passed by the House of Lords. But we have not that uniformity yet, and the probability is - or, at least, there is a possibility - of that word, iti the&#39; light of the decision in the Bradlaugh case, being eliminated, and another more effective word for the purpose we have in view being substituted. If my honorable friend feels strongly about the amendment, I will not press it, but ask him to reconsider the point, so that we may have another opportunity of dealing with it 3 and I am quite sure that he will see that we require some other word than &#39; 1 indecent, &#39; &#39; which&#34; has been tried and found wanting, not for the purpose of preventing the publication of books, or dramatic pieces which a hypersensitive man might regard as having an immoral&#39; tendency, but of preventing works having that tendency acquiring copyright and thereby becoming a profitable property to their authors. </para>

                    <para>--We should be&#39; careful not to insert any provision which may take away an author&#39;s right to his own productions simply because of any feeling of prejudice which may exist in the mind of the general public. It must be remembered that some of the finest writers of the race to which we belong have at various times written books which a great many people have regarded as both immoral and indecent; and even now classics of the English language are held to be open to that condemnation. Take Byron, for instance. Some of his finest works are commonly set down as sensual, and a great many people look upon them as being highly indecent and immoral. </para>

                        <para>- I had intended to allude to those books. Some of the finest descriptive poetry in the English language was written by Byron, and occurs in his <inline font-style="italic">Don Juan,</inline> which is usually regarded as most sensual, and by some as the most indecent and immoral work of poetry we have in the language. Even Shakespeare, who is recognised as being perhaps the greatest poet and dramatist the world has yet .produced, has written passages which very many people would say are absolutely immoral and indecent. </para>

                    <para>Copyright shall subsist in every book, whether the author is a British subject or not, which has, after the commencement of this Act, been first published in Australia, before or simultaneously with its first publication elsewhere. </para>

                <para class="block">Under that provision, if a book of an immoral or indecent character is first published in Australia, or, in Australia simultaneously with its publication elsewhere, there is copyright without registration. The question of determining whether or not a book is immoral or indecent, and, as such, is disqualified from copyright, will most likely arise when some private individual pirates the book, and the author or owner of the copyright takes proceedings to restrain him, or brings an action for damages for infringement. In such a case, the defendant would set up the defence that the plaintiff was not the owner of a copyright, because the book was of an &#34; immoral &#34; or &#34; indecent &#34; character- whichever word may be used. Such a case would hardly ever arise, unless the book was of such a strong character, either immorally or indecently, that some private individual, from the knowledge he had of it, regarded it as not entitled to copyright; and then it would come under the consideration of the Court. Under the Bill, when an author or owner of a copyright desires to bring an action for damages or to restrain piracy by injunction, he has first to register; and the registrar might hold a book to be immoral. It would then be impossible for the author or alleged owner of the copyright, to sue at all, unless he obtained from a Judge a mandamus or a &#39;rectification1 order compelling the registrar to register, and that mandamus or order, of course, would be on the grounds that the book was not immoral. When we consider how this clause is likely to operate, with the word &#34; indecent &#34; in it, it does not seem likely that anybody will be able ,to get copyright in an immoral publication. Even if we inserted a stronger and wider term, such as &#34;immoral,&#34; it would still be necessary for some third party to take action in the nature of piracy, before the question could arise. An owner of a copyright in a book published in Australia would, as I say, not have to register until his rights were infringed, and he wished to take action. If, on the other hand, the book was not published under the provision of the sub-section I have just quoted, but was produced abroad, and the author wished to get the benefit of the international provisions of this Bill, he would come here with his certificate. I do not think that even if we made the amendment suggested&#39;, and an author came from abroad with an immoral or indecent book, &#34;lie could be denied the benefits of the international registration, because we are bound by the reciprocating terms of the Berne Convention. Under the circumstances, I think it is perfectly safe to use the term &#34; indecent,&#34; because, whether we use one term or the other, and split straws as to what is or what is not immoral, it will still remain for some individual in the community to take action, before the question of the immorality or indecency of a work can be decided. And no individual would take action unless he felt that he could pirate the book without any danger, on the ground that it was not entitled to copyright under clause 6. No one would pirate a book because he thought it immoral, or on the border line, but&#39; would wait until its character was bad enough to enable him to pirate it on the ground that it was what we call indecent. After all, the censor in the community would be the individual who wished to take advantage of this clause, in order to make some profit himself, and to be able to defend himself from an action for piracy on the ground that the book was of such a bad &#34;character that it came within the prohibition of clause 6. </para>

                    is quite right in saying that the question of the moral character of a book would arise when some body attempted piracy, and the author endeavoured to prevent him. But
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline>
                    has missed the point, which is that a copyright gives a valuable property to the person who writes the book, and that, if copyright be withheld on the ground of indecency, there will be no inducement to people to write indecent and immoral books. What we are legislating for is to do justice to authors by converting an intangible thing, in which there is no property under certain circumstances, into a tangible and profitable possession. There are certain productions which we ought not to make valuable, and, therefore, we withhold the temptation to write books on the assumption that they will be a profitable property. Books are written in order that they may be sold ; and if there is no temptation to write them, the possibility of piracy does not come into play. No doubt if such books were copyrighted, the question would arise as between the pirate and the original author, but; we wish to stop the writing and publication of them, or, at any rate, to withhold from them a profitable copyright. The probability is that when this matter is further considered, it will be found to be desirable to eliminate the word &#34;indecent&#34; I have suggested a word which has a definition and a scope that would prevent a copyright being acquired for a book of the particular description under discussion.

                        <para>- There are several curious features of the law dealing with unpublished manuscripts, but they are all dealt with by the text-book writers on the subject of copyright. For instance if an author becomes bankrupt his unpublished literary manuscript does not pass to the trustee or assignee in bankruptcy, whereas his copyright does. Again, so far as manuscript is concerned, an assignment of it does not of itself carry with it to the assignee the right to publish it. There are other peculiar features about it, but the main point in connexion with us and with this clause is that according to the law at present, if an author does &#39; not publish his manuscript and it gets into the hands of any one else, he has the power at common law to restrain the publication of that manuscript. In order to do that he has to invoke the intervention of a Court. If we pass this Bill without this clause, and an author were to take out an injunction in a Victorian Court to restrain some person from publishing his unpublished literary manuscript that injunction would have force and effect throughout the State of Victoria only. If the person prohibited&#39; from publishing that manuscript went to South Australia, there would be nothing to prevent him disregarding the injunction of the Victorian Court, and publishing it there. </para>

                    SYMON (South Australia). - I must say1 that I have been staggered to hear my honorable and learned friend attempt a defence of this clause. I say, after the very greatest consideration, that he has confused1 two things - procedure and the operation of the principles of common law. It is quite an elementary thing, and a point with which I am sure my honorable and learned friend is familiar, that the common law of England applies throughout the whole of the Commonwealth.

                        <para>- As a Commonwealth. It applies throughout the Commonwealth and in every State. Every student, as my honorable and learned friend must know perfectly well, recognises that as an elementary principle. Then the honorable and learned senator says that if steps are taken to protect unpublished manuscript in one State, and an order is made restraining its publication, that order is not operative in another State. I do not know whether that is so or not, having regard to the various steps we have already taken to facilitate procedure by making the orders and judgments of one State operative and enforcible in another. But that is a question of procedure; it has nothing whatever to do with the operation of the common law, and this clause does not touch it at all. It is a declaration which seems to me to suggest a blemish on what we hope will be an exceedingly good Bill. We are, in this clause, making a declaration which will stamp us as forgetful of the ordinary principles of the law, and as practically noodles - a declaration, not regulating any procedure, as that might be done in another way, but that the common law of England applies, unless altered by the laws of the Commonwealth1. Of course, that is so. We brought here the common law of England when Australia and every State of it was founded. That common law applies throughout every inch of our territory, whether within a State or within the ambit of the Commonwealth. It remains until we alter it. We can alter the common law as applicable to Australia, but until we do so it remains in force. It is of no use to deal with this Bill from the point of view of trying to be critical, and I do not propose to deal with it in that way. I have not examined the Acts, relating to execution and process, and the enforcement of judgments. There is Commonwealth and State legislation on that subject ; but the introduction of a provision of this kind is, I think, without precedent. I doubt whether my honorable and learned friend can mention any Act which this Parliament has passed, in which it is stated that the common law of England shall apply unless altered by our legislation. It does apply. </para>

                        <para>- This is a Bill to give effect to our powers, as the Parliament of the Commonwealth, to legislate on the subject of copyright, and the moment it becomes law away goes all State legislation on the subject, except as regards existing rights, which, of course, are protected, as they should be. It would be a distinct blemish on this Bill to provide that the common law of England shall apply when we know that it does, except where we alter it. As to procedure, I say nothing, because that is another matter. But that the common law is the same here as in South Australia, and will be the same after the passing of this Bill, is absolutely undoubted, and we should not by the insertion of such a provision throw any doubt on the subject. </para>

                        <para>- We do not alter it, but in the absence, of this provision with regard to unpublished literary manuscript, we should leave the law with regard to the publication of manuscript still within the domain and the province of the several States. They may still legislate on the subject, and different laws dealing with it may be passed by different States. In such a case a person who would get a copyright under this Bill in one State would perhaps start under disadvantages as compared with another person starting from a different point in another State. So we propose to make it plain and explicit that, subject to this, and any other Acts of this Parliament, the common law of England, with regard to unpublished literary manuscript shall remain in force and effect throughout the Commonwealth. With regard to procedure, I again repeat that when we make this matter the subject of Commonwealth legislation, with which the States cannot hereafter interfere, we provide for uniform procedure throughout the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- I will ask my honorable and learned friend if he can refer me to any extended treatise on the law relating to unpublished literary manuscript which is not found in a text-book dealing with the law of copyright. This has always been considered as an adjunct of the law of copyright, just as have the questions of a performing right, and other rights which have grown up from time to time. I think it is desirable to provide that the law in regard to unpublished literary manuscripts so far as they may found copyrights shall subject to our legislation be uniform throughout the Commonwealth, and not to leave it to the States to legislate in the future on this subject divergently, and so to a very great extent nullify at its very source the advantages of uniformity that we are trying to insure for those who will get copyright under this Bill. </para>

When I pointed out that the common law of England applies throughout the whole of the Commonwealth - that every State, . with every person therein, is covered and clothed with the common law of England, unless it has been altered by Statute - my honorable friend questioned that statement; but I think he now admits its truth.

                        <para>- That is procedure. I think every honorable senator, whether lawyer or layman, must understand the elementary principle that the common law applies throughout Australia, and that until it is altered we must abide by it. But now my honorable and learned friend says that an unpublished manuscript may be dealt with by any State under its ordinary law of property. Undoubtedly that is so. But an unpublished manuscript has nothing to do with the question of copyright. An unpublished manuscript of mine is just as much my property as my purse or penknife, or table, or chair. It only comes under the influence of copyright when it is published. This Bill defines what publication is, and provides that copyright shall only subsist from the time of publication. If that is the case, an unpublished manuscript is not subject to the law of copyright. My letter or manuscript is just at? much my property as any other article which belongs to me, and of course as a subject of legislation it is within the ambit of the States. The clause is objectionable as a blemish on the Bill, because it declares that to be the law by virtue of a Statute, which is the law by virtue of our being part of the British Dominions. If the Bill is to deal with unpublished manuscripts, and we are to pass a provision which is to apply throughout all the States, and to supersede the State law in relation to unpublished documents, we are doing something which we have not power to do. Our only power of legislation on this subject is as to copyrights. We have no power to enact that a document which belongs to me in South Australia shall or shall not be my property. The Commonwealth is not empowered to say that my unpublished literary work shall not be my property, or shall be dealt with by some other law than that of the State of which I am a citizen. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> could show that the unpublished letters of a man are not his <inline font-style="italic">own</inline> property as much as are his goods and chattels, then there would be some force in that part of his argument. When we look at what our powers are, inasmuch as copyright only begins to operate on publication, everything antecedent to publication is private property. That point has been settled over and over again. In South Australia the other day an action was brought to restrain a soda-water manufacturer from using a recipe surreptitiously taken from a manuscript book by an employe of another soda-water manufacturer. An injunction was granted, and damages were awarded. <inline font-style="italic">An</inline> account had to be kept, and the former had to pay up the profits he had made, if they could be ascertained, on the ground that the manuscript book was the private property of its owner, just as much as his chairs and bottles, and that the copying of the recipe by his employe, and handing the copy over to another person, was literally theft. On the other hand, I can give an illustration of a case of copyright which is a totally different thing. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gladstone</inline> published1 a book which was called <inline font-style="italic">The Bulgarian Horrors, or the Question of the East.</inline> Instructed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gladstone,</inline> I appeared in the Supreme Court of the <inline font-style="italic">State,</inline> and got an injunction against certain publishers in Adelaide, because the property of copyright attached to the book. We are. legislating as to one class, the authors of such books. We are not legislating, and have no power to legislate, as to the other class represented by the owner of the unpublished book containing the recipe for making soda-water. If we leave this clause in the Bill we shall go beyond our. power, if it is -for the purpose mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating.</inline> If, on the other hand, it is not for that purpose, we are asserting a position which is undoubted. </para>

                    (Tasmania- Honorary Minister). - So far from the clause being possibly a blot on our legislation, I would say to honorable senators that if it be omitted we shall have a very serious gap in the Bill. I am well aware that, with regard to the question of the ownership and disposal of property, whether it be a table or a chair, or an unpublished literary manuscript, the States will still have the full measure of legislative jurisdiction which they have hitherto enjoyed. But once an. unpublished literary manuscript gets out of the hands of the author, he has a power to restrain the publication of it without his authority. But how must he exercise that power? If an author invoked the jurisdiction of a Victorian Court, and obtained an injunction to restrain the publication of his manuscript - and bear in mind that, under this Bill, the moment it is published a copyright will subsist in it for some one - the publisher might -go to another State, snap his fingers at the injunction, and publish the manuscript again. It would be necessary for the author to follow him from State to State, and invoke the jurisdiction of a competent tribunal

                        <para>- So far as unpublished literary manuscripts may be affected by the law of copyright - and they may be affected by publication unauthorized!}&#39; - we provide in this clause that, subject to this or any other measure we may pass, the common law of England shall apply throughout the Commonwealth as one area. The common law in this detail is made the statute law ot the Commonwealth, and the Federal Courts will then have a Federal jurisdiction in relation to the rights which are perpetuated by the Bill, from which we prevent the different States hereafter from making divergence by their own legislation. If we leave the matter to the States it is quite possible that hereafter some of them might legislate so that persons starting off to acquire copyright by publishing previously unpublished manuscripts, would be on different levels. </para>

                        <para>- I am not dealing with ownership, but with the question of publication. It is when a literary manuscript is first published that the law of copyright applies to it. It may be authorizedly, or unauthorizedly published. If it is unauthorizedly published, and we have no legislation of this kind, the person whose rights are infringed may have to seek the intervention of half-a-dozen different States Courts. We want to obviate the necessity of his having to hunt round from State to State after some one who has published his manuscript. We want to give our Federal Courts jurisdiction. But the Federal Court as a Federal Court cannot exercise any common law jurisdiction. The jurisdiction must be conferred upon it by the statutes of the Commonwealth. Much as my honorable friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> may smile at the assertion,.! feel confident that if we do not insert this provision in the Bill, we shall be guilty of a very serious omission which might interfere with the rights of authors. We are providing, therefore, that whatever on this point exists in Great Britain&#39; as&#39; common law - and which exists so far as I know in each of the States separately - shall be statute law throughout the Commonwealth, and that our Federal Courts shall have jurisdiction in such matter as being a matter of Federal statute law. </para>

                    SYMON (South&#39; Australia). - I will tell, the Committee in a sentence or two what the point is from which my honorable and learned friend
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline>
                    as I think, diverged very greatly. He says that it is necessary to pass this clause in order to give the Federal Courts jurisdiction. All that I can say is that he will not give the Federal Courts jurisdiction in any shape or form by this clause. If they had no jurisdiction before, they will have none after we have passed the clause. We are dealing with proprietary rights in Unpublished literary compositions. The term &#34; proprietary rights &#34; is simply a large expression for ownership. We mean the ownership of unpublished literary compositions just as we might refer to the ownership of goods and chattels or of tables and chairs. This clause says that the common law of England relating to proprietary rights in unpublished literary com- positions, shall apply throughout the Commonwealth. The common law which exists in Australia is the common law of England. That being the case, what is the power in Australia that deals with the ownership of private property? The States. That power has not been taken from them. They have power to tax unpublished literary manuscripts just as they have power to tax anything else. My honorable friend says that the object of this clause is to take that right right away from them. Suppose a State has passed an Act which says that the ownership of an unpublished manuscript shall be in some one else than the author. It has a perfect right to legislate m that manner. We have no power to take that right away. Our only power is to deal with copyright which affects publication authorized by the owner of the manuscript. If a manuscript is published without the authority of the owner, he does not lose his control over it. He has an absolute right to stop the publication; just as the person from whose private book a recipe was copied by some one who had no right to it, was enabled to obtain protection and damages. If this clause would assist authors in any way whatever, I should not say a word against it. But we have no power whatever to take away the right of a State to legislate with regard to an unpublished manuscript. The matter is beyond our jurisdiction. Any lawyer would agree that the common jaw of England affecting private property applies here unless altered by Statute.

                    <para>. - I am not in a position to say that I can accept the amendment, even on the assurance that it will achieve exactly the same object as that which the subclause as it stands seeks to effect. When moving the second reading of the Bill, I particularly referred to clauses 8 and 12, and pointed out that some representations had been made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Anderson,</inline> of the Public Library, Sydney, to the Premier of New South Wales, to the effect that this Bill would in some way derogate from the rights of that State and that institution. In order that there should be no possible idea in the mind of any person that it is intended to override  any rights which the States are entitled to enjoy, I announced that I intended to submit amendments in both the clauses that I have mentioned. Those amendments have been in circulation for some days; and I do not think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> ought now to ask me to accept a new subclause, which none of us but himself and the .Clerk have seen. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> must surely realize that I cannot accept such an amendment at the table, but that I must have some time for consideration, and, possibly, consultation with those who have assisted me in drafting the Bill. What it is desired to effect will be properly effected by the sub-clause as it stands, together with the amendment of which I have given notice. </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline>
                    has said as to my calling on him to choose between the two. If the honorable senator does not see his way to accept the amendment, I shall not press it to a division. I took a division before on a very important clause, and the result guides me to the course I should adopt in regard to any other amendments. Much as I am anxious to assist the Minister, I should not be disposed to press amendments in a Bill of this kind, the responsibility for which&#39; rests entirely with the Government. My desire is to assist the Government; but if honorable senators think that because an amendment emanates from this side it ought to be immediately rejected, I shall not put them to the trouble to divide.

                        <para>- Honorable senators opposite were, many of them, not present during the debate. I am willing to accept the situation, because the responsibility rests with the Government ; and those who sit behind the Government are perfectly entitled to vote in accordance with what .the Government desire, and to share that responsibility. However, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> will have an opportunity to consider the amendment that I have moved, the object of which is practically to give effect to the provision of the Constitution that this Bill, if it becomes law, shall supersede existing States legislation. The Constitution operates quite irrespective of any provision of this kind in the Bill, but it is a simple way of declaring that no copyright shall be acquired under any State Act after this Bill comes into operation. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. but it is just as well to have a declaration&#39; on the face of the measure. In substance this Bill was in existence under the auspices of the late Government, though it had not then been revised. It is quite obvious that the words of the sub-clause as it stands imply that as to books, dramatic works, lectures, or artistic work, if there are any, in which copyright does not subsist under the Bill, the States Acts are still to remain in force. The sub-clause implies that there are some kinds of copyright or productions to which copyright may attach under a State Act after we have legislated. </para>

                        <para>- That might be so, and the sub-clause will tend to litigation if it be left obscure, as it is at present. What it is intended to declare is that no copyright shall be acquired under any State law after this Bill comes into operation. The amendment appears to me to be a great and distinct improvement, which will remove all obscurity and prevent possible litigation and doubt - certainly doubt, if not litigation. What we all desire to do is to revise and polish our Bills so as to make them perfectly clear. </para>

                        <para>- I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> that the clause as it stands seems to create a degree of embarrassment&#34; It indicates that some rights exist in regard to books, either registered under or governed by the Bill; and the fact that the Constitution itself provides that Commonwealth legislation shall prevail, increases the embarrassment. It is desirable that there should be some declaration in the form suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon.</inline> I do not mean to say that a declaration is absolutely necessary, but if we are to have one, it ought to be of a definite character, and not the hybrid provision now presented. </para>

                    (Tasmania- Honorary Minister). - In reply to
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best,</inline>
                    I point out that the sub-clause deals only with books, dramatic and musical works, lectures, and artistic work in which copyright &#34; subsists&#34; under the Bill. The principle of the Bill is that copyright, lecturing right, performing right,. and other rights of that character subsist in every individual instance in which the publication, first performance, or first delivery&#39; has taken place in Australia, or when such first performance, or delivery and so forth, has taken place simultaneously in Australia with the first performance or delivery elsewhere. The rights enure in those instances by virtue of the fact that the first performance or publication takes place here, and then the right &#34; subsists under this Act.&#34; In such cases no registration is necessary. The only case in which it is necessary to register is where a man has so acquired a copyright or performing right, and wishes to sue; then he must register before he takes action.

                        <para>- Well, let us see. In some of the States Acts there is a similar provision that copyright shall subsist, for instance, in a book first published in the State. That law is in force in those States at the present time, and we provide here in this Bill that copyright shall subsist throughout the Commonwealth in a book first published in Australia. The point might be raised whether, in the case of a copyright subsisting under a State law, prior to Federal legislation, by virtue of first publication in the State, the State law would continue to operate in regard to a book published in that State subsequently to the passing of the. Bill, as well as the Commonwealth law. </para>

                    <para>- Surely <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> does not mean to construe the Acts Interpretation Act so, as to suggest that a power given to appoint one officer involves a power given to appoint more. Would the honorable and learned senator say that a power to appoint a High Commissioner would be a power to appoint a dozen High Commissioners? I suggest that the commonsense reading of the provision is that where we confer the power to appoint one specified officer, that power cannot be exceeded. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating&#39;s</inline> answer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> shows that the honorable and learned senator has considered the matter, because he contends that the clause provides for the appointment of more than one deputy registrar.

With regard to the suggestion made by Senators Millen and Dobson that this interpretation would lead to very undesirable results, I point out that the Acts Interpretation Act provides that -

Honorable senators will remember that previously I made reference to some criticisms levelled at the Bill by the Librarian of the Sydney Public Library. The Copyright. Act of New South Wales provides, amongst: other things, that a copy of every publication issued in the State shall be supplied to that institution, and also, I believe, to the Sydney University. In conformity with that provision, the former is supplied&#39; with about 340 newspapers, and is thereby enabled to keep records which hereafter may be of very great value and interest. I do not know that the Bill as it stands would in any way interfere with the right; of the institution to get these publications, because our legislation would not be inconsistent with, or repugnant to, the State law upon the point. But if it were, it would still be competent for the State Parliament, apart from the question of copyright, to require the publishers of a work in New South Wales to supply a copy thereof to certain institutions. But in order that it might be made abundantly clear on the face of this Bill that it was not intended to interfere with such existing rights, I gave notice of my intention to move certain amendments in this clause. I may mention again that, this matter was first brought under my notice by the Librarian of the Melbourne Public Library. He has seen these amendments, and thinks that, so far as that institution is concerned, they are eminently satisfactory, and meet the case. </para>

                        <para>- This tribute, if the expression may be used, is levied, not as a condition precedent to the acquisition of copyright, but pursuant to the legislation of the State. The provision happens to be contained in its Copyright Act. I do not think that all the publications of which these libraries get copies are copyrighted. If this measure be passed, we could not prevent a State from imposing upon a printer or publisher within its jurisdiction the necessity of providing certain institutions with a copy of his publications. It is provided in clause 74 of this Bill that any applicant for the registration of the copyright in a book shall deliver to the Registrar two copies of it - one to be- forwarded by him to the Librarian of the Commonwealth Parliament, and the other to be retained by him until otherwise prescribed. At the present time, in order to get copyright in Victoria, New South Wales) and Western Australia, an applicant has to deposit one book or more in each State. I cannot say from memory exactly how many books <inline font-style="italic">have</inline> to be deposited in order to get copyright in the United Kingdom ; but not very long ago as many as eleven or twelve libraries, including the British Museum and certain Universities, had to be supplied with from five to nine copies each. </para>

                        <para>- I entirely differ from the honorable and learned senator. It seems to me to approach . the height of meanness to attempt to levy this tribute upon the authors of books or publishers of newspapers. In a circular, which he has addressed to honorable senators, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Anderson,</inline> of the Sydney Public Library, has pointed out that these newspapers and other documents become valuable. If they become valuable, let the public who use the institution pay for them. I can quite understand any one arguing that, inasmuch as a Copyright Act would confer a considerable advantage upon an author, therefore he might reasonably be asked to pay for it. Let us openly charge an author a fee for the benefit we propose to confer upon him. But after &#39;We have granted copyright to a man, do not let us turn round and insist upon him contributing to an institution a copy of his book, or of his newspaper. This appears to me vo be a species of loafing. I cannot conceive that in private business we would attempt to justify such a proceeding. It is a little worse than a secret commission, because we are taking something by arbitrary authority, which I do not think we can justify. Let me point out. how unfairly this tribute is imposed. Let us compare the case of a man who has published a remarkably valuable book with the case of a man who has published a book which can be purchased for sixpence. Here the tribute is not equitably levied. If a contribution is to be exacted from an author, as a return for the protection he gets, let it be exacted in proportion to the value of his work. This tribute must be a heavy tax upon an author who has published a limited number of copies of an expensive book. Where a man has published a sixpenny edition of a work he is really not taxed when he is asked to supply a copy to certain institutions. For that reason, I am extremely disappointed that the Minister has not made it clear to me, if he has to others, that there is some justice underlying the law which is said to exist in New South Wales, and which I affirm he is seeking to perpetuate. </para>

                    <para>- I am compelled to disagree somewhat with the remarks made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen.</inline> I must have a little sympathy with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> for having brought in amendments specially to oblige the Librarian of the Sydney Public Library. The Premier of New South Wales has sent to all the members of the Senate, I believe, certainly to all the senators from that. State, a statement on the subject. Therefore, it seemed to me that it did not require very much explanation when the Minister did not elaborate his reasons for agreeing to the amendments suggested. It is said bv <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Anderson</inline> that 340 newspapers are published in New South Wales, and that a copy of each newspaper, free of cost, is deposited week by. week with the Sydney Public Library. The cost to the newspaper publishers is as near nothing as possible, because the postage rate amounts to about id. per dozen. Every newspaper has a number of advertising clients in the metropolis, and has to send down a bundle of newspapers, so that the postage is really trifling. It would be a tax, however, if the Sydney Public Library were called upon to subscribe for a copy of each one of these newspapers. If it was called upon to make a special contribution the trustees would have to consider whether, after all, it was worth while to spend&#163;500 or <inline font-style="italic">&#163;600</inline> a year for the sake of completing these files. I very much doubt that it would be. But as the newspapers can be obtained at the very minimum of expense to the printers, and will be available for reference in coming years, we should maintain the existing right)? of the Public Library. I think that the Minister has only done what is right in recognising the representations of its librarian. Therefore, I trust that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> will see his way to withdraw his objection. </para>

Unfortunately, there is a great feeling abroad in Sydney that the Federal Parliament, somehow or other, is unnecessarily treading upon the toes of the State. In this case, we would do well, I think, to refrain from accentuating that feeling.. </para>

                        <para>- What we are asked to do i&#39;s to give legislative recognition by the Commonwealth to a practice which it is perhaps quite true the States may be able to enforce in some other way; but the odium ought to be placed upon the States of enforcing a tax of this character on literature. We already insure that an author on securing copyright shall present two copies of his work, one of which goes to the Library of the Federal Parliament. That is a proper thing, because it is a record of the copyright. But it is very different to impose a tax of this kind upon authors, independently of copyright. I do not believe that any State Parliament would consent to pass a law imposing such a tax upon authors. There is no more reason why New South Wales should have two or more copies of a book published in that State than that any other library in the Commonwealth should be similarly treated; except that these people have been getting their books for nothing in the past, and want to get them for nothing in the future. It will be observed that the requirement is that not only shall the author be compelled to present his book in the ordinary binding, just as it may be sold in any shop ; he has to present copies &#34; printed upon the best paper upon which the same shall be printed.&#34; In these days there are <inline font-style="italic">editions de luxe</inline> of many books. Copies are printed on hand -made paper. These people wish to exact the finest library copies of an unfortunate author&#39;s book. If he happens to print for circulation among his friends a. few copies at a higher price than the ordinary copies, he has to present one of the special copies to the New South Wales library. It may be worth 8 or 10 guineas. </para>

                        <para>- He will have to give copies such as he is directed to give under this Bill, just as in England to secure copyright copies of a book have to be handed to certain libraries. To compel authors to give copies to State libraries,&#39; as proposed, is simply a pure, unadulterated piece of literary blackmail. I suggest the withdrawal of the amendment, because if the clause is sufficient without it there is no need for it. If the Parliament of New South Wales favours this nefarious proceeding, and chooses to exact a direct tax, let it have the odium of doing so. But we should set our faces against such a system. These great libraries should pay for their books if they want them, and are not entitled to get any help at our hands. </para>

                    (New South Wales). - I should like to point out that for one book published in an expensive form such as we have heard about, there are other books by the hundred, and there are newspapers by the thousand. That is the main point. I recently published a little pamphlet, and within the last, few days, have had a few copies bound with strong &#34;backs especially to present them to three or four libraries. I gave one to the Public Library in Sydney, and another to the Parliamentary Library here. I am glad at any time for these public libraries to have copies of anything that I bring out. I do not think that

                    himself, if he published anything, would be other than delighted to present copies to the leading &#34;.libraries.

                        <para>- We are not proposing to abridge State rights in any way. The people, of the Commonwealth gave us power to legislate with regard to copyright, and I take it that they did not expect us to have special regard to the desires of the libraries of any State. In my opinion, an author should not be subjected to a tax simply because he has to take advantage of the law of the land to define and protect his rights. Why should we with the one hand give an author the protection of copyright so as to protect the products of his own brain, whilst at the same time we compel him to contribute a portion of his property to some person or State? It does not matter whether the publication is worth a penny or a thousands pounds. It is a question of principle. I would also point out that this Bill affects works of art. Must an artist who reproduces a work of art be compelled to give copies to several State institutions? I am strongly in favour of the establishment qf public libraries in every town where there is a reasonable population. But these public libraries should be supported at the public expense, and not at the expense of authors. It is a mere matter of loafing on authors to compel them to contribute copies of their works to Government institutions. One of the most popular Australian authors to-day is at present in financial difficulties. Yet not one of these great public institutions would do a thing to help him, although they have lived upon his brains. By their means his best works have been read by thousands of people, many of whom, if they could not have read them in a free library, would have purchased them. Of course, if the management of a public institution purchase their copies of books, they are entitled to use them as they please, and an author cannot complain that his works are read for&#39; nothing by the public. But a public institution is entitled to pay for the books which&#39; it acquires, and we should not compel authors to give away works which are&#39; the product of their brains, energy, industry, and enterprise. </para>

                    <para>- There is a provision, almost word for word with this, in the South Australian Copyright Act of 1878, except that it provides that a copy shall be lodged at the South Australia Institute, and, in Western Australia, copies of books and newspapers published in that State have to be sent to the Victoria Public Library in Perth. Then, again, in Victoria, copies of every newspaper or book first printed in that State must <inline font-style="italic">be</inline> sent to the Public Library, and, perhaps, to other institutions. Honorable senators may be under the impression that if the amendment be carried a man who publishes a book in Australia, will, in order to obtain copyright, have to deposit two copies with the Registrar of Copyrights, and also two copies in each State, as required by the law of each State; but that is not so. The fact is that if a book, for example, be first published in South Australia, two copies will have to be furnished to the Commonwealth Registrar, and a copy to the South Australia Institute, according to the present law of that State. </para>

                        <para>- I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> that there has been much exaggeration as to the imposition1 of a &#34; tax,&#34; or the levying of &#34; blackmail,&#34; and so forth. Under ordinary circumstances, authors are quite prepared to give some such publicity to each of their works. The amendment will mean, in the case of New South Wales, for example, the deposit of an extra two copies, namely, those required for the Registrar under the Bill. In the case of Western Australia, or South Australia, it will only mean an additional copy that will have to be supplied. There are 340 newspapers printed in New South Wales, which are sent to the Sydney Public Library, and such newspapers have been deposited ever since the State law was put in force. These newspapers form a regular and uninterrupted record of great value; indeed, they are the only record available now for the community of New South Wales in regard to certain matters. The same may be said, I believe, of Victoria. It is desirable that there shall be in each of the States a permanent and continuous collection of records of this <inline font-style="italic">character;</inline> and it must be remembered that this Bill does not provide that newspapers published in any State shall be deposited with .the Registrar. In Western Australia, every newspaper published in that State has been filed at the Victoria Library, in Perth, since the Copyright Act was passed ; and, as I have pointed out, the same policy has been carried out in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, and, doubtless, in Queensland. In Tasmania there is no provision of the kind, but a copy of every newspaper published in the State must be sent to the Chief Secretary, who keeps the records. </para>

I was told just now by the honorable and learned senator that it was the author who was penalized, though now I am given to understand that it is the recipient. The main object is to preserve the records unbroken. </para>

                        <para>- I venture to suggest, with all respect, that if those authors and publishers, who are described as being penalized, could hear this debate, they would desire to be saved from their friends. After all, once a work is in print, an extra copy one way or the other matters very little; and these contributions of publications are desirable in the interests of the community. The cost is infinitesimal to the individual, while the results are most; valuable to the people at large ; and we should do well to let matters stand as at present. No heavy burden is imposed, and each State is provided with records which will prove of great value hereafter. </para>

                    <para>- I cannot appreciate the standard of morality which assumes that an injustice, because it is &#34; only a little one,&#34; is in principle less wrong than a big injustice. I have waited for some defence of this amendment, but neither from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford, Senator Walker,</inline> nor the Minister have I heard one word to justify the morality of the proposal. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> merely said, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> does now, that the charge on those who are compelled to contribute, is infinitesimal. Does that affect the principle ? The question is whether this amendment can be justified on the grounds of commercial or any other morality ? The second point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> is that this is the existing law in the several States. But the Minister, if he did not forget - and I can hardly assume he forgot. - at any rate omitted to point out that when authors and publishers are required to present &#39; copies to public institutions in New South Wales and elsewhere they do so in connexion with the copyrights granted by the several States. The deposit of those copies is incidental to the application for copyright; but in the future a Commonwealth law will secure them that privilege, and while the Bill very properly requires that a couple of copies shall be deposited with the Registrar, I see absolutely no reason why we should continue to enable the States Governments, who will cease to have any power over copyright, to continue to levy this toll on authors and publishers. </para>

                        <para>- Then let the States do so directly. I have no desire to pass any law interfering with States rights; indeed, I always fancy myself as being rather stalwart in the defence of States rights. The effect of the amendment is to perpetuate a practice which, in my belief, cannot be justified. Let me put a parallel case to honorable senators. Would honorable senators entertain for a moment a proposition that, in connexion with applications for patents, a duplicate or model of every invention should be lodged at the Patent Office and the technical school in the State in which the application was made ? Would any honorable senator attempt to justify a proposal of that kind? If we were now initiating copyright legislation, would any honorable senator} defend a proposal to give, the States the right to demand that every work published should be deposited at&#39; local institutions? The only reason for the amendment is, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> has said, that it represents the State law as at present carried out. Although it is my own State that has moved in this matter, I cannot allow my regard for the interests of that State to compel&#39; me to do violence to my sense of what is equitable and just. </para>

The honorable senator speaks of the immorality and the in- justice of the proposal. I believe that it is in the interests of the State&#62; that it is just, and that it is thoroughly moral, if the question of morals can enter into the subject at all. In every civilized State strong views are held with regard to the regulation of literary matters. Almost every State does its test to get together as complete a collection of its own literature as it can. This is done in New South Wales and in other States of Australia, and we know that in America and in Great Britain every effort is made to make as complete a collection as possible of the literature of the country. We should hesitate before we do anything to withdraw this right. </para>

                        <para>- My object in rising is to show that there is no iniquity other than that which exists in the minds of Senators Symon and Millen. With regard to the matter of cost, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Anderson</inline> ^estimates that if the newspapers filed in the New South Wales library had to be paid for, the expenditure would run into between ^500 and <inline font-style="italic">&#163;600</inline> a year. I have no doubt that these newspapers do not cost the people who send them to the library as much as <inline font-style="italic">&#163;50</inline> per year. I know something of the cost of producing newspapers, and the cost of a single copy of a newspaper is not worth talking about. But if the States Governments were to be called upon to subscribe to every newspaper published in the Commonwealth, it would mean throughOUt Australia an addition to States taxation of something like .&#163;2,000 a year. , We are not called upon to take any step which will add that amount <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> the taxation of the people of the States. </para>

                    <para>- I remember that at one time when I was working on a new gold-field, . a mare of mine cast a foal. That foal grew up to be a very fine colt, for which I got a handsome price. The colt did not cost me a farthing, and, therefore, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford,</inline> I should have given him to the public. That is the honorable senator&#39;s argument. He says that as newspapers do not cost their proprietors very much, they should make a present of them to all and sundry. </para>

                        <para>- If it is right and equitable that they should be compelled to do that, they should also be compelled to present copies of their newspapers to every library in each State. I have been a publisher of a newspaper myself, and I know that this provision has often caused me inconvenience and trouble, which I would not willingly have undertaken for a couple of pounds. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford&#39;</inline> has said1 on the authority&#39; of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Anderson,</inline> of the Public Library of New South Wales, that the newspapers which that institution is enabled to exact from proprietors amount in value to from &#163;500 to &#163;600 a year. What right have the public of New South Wales to demand that the proprietors of newspapers shall contribute property of that value to on a particular institution? New South Wales is a very extensive State, and the people of many important towns throughout the State derive no benefit from the Public Library in Sydney, and many of them very rarely ever see it. Why should the newspaper proprietors throughout that State be penalized for the benefit of a Public Library in one corner of it? I point out that the publication of many country newspapers does not pay as a purely commercial enterprise, and the proprietors of country newspapers have often a hard struggle to make a living. Why should they be subjected to this tax for the benefit of a particular public institution. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> that it is exceedingly desirable that in all the States every provision should&#39; be made for a complete eel lection of the&#34; newspapers and books published1 in those States, but it should be done at the public expense, and not at the expense of the unfortunate authors and proprietors. If this is done for the benefit of the public, they should bear the burden and should not loaf on newspaper proprietors and authors. </para>

                <para>SenatorSTEWART (Queensland). - I find great difficulty in making up my mind on this question. Listening to the inflammatory language of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> who talked of holding a pistol to people&#39;s heads, I was filled with zeal to support the honorable and learned senator&#39;s contention, but listening later on to the cool, calm, and reasonable language of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford,</inline> I came to the conclusion that probably there might be something in the idea of keeping a permanent record in some safe place of all the newspapers and books published in each State. After more mature consideration I really think that there is something in that idea. Of course we cannot have a complete record of this kind in every town in each State, and the capital city of each State is the most convenient place in which to keep such a record. Copies of the newspapers and books published every year in the States might not be of any great value from our point of view, but when a hundred years hence the history of Australia comes to be written, probably by some descendant of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> or of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> - if the taste for history is at all hereditary - these records will be found to be most valuable. After hearing the argument, I am inclined to support the amendment. </para>

The administration of the States Acts will cease, so far as they give anybody copyright the moment this Bill comes into operation ; but all existing rights will remain, and for the purpose of effectuating those rights, the administration of the States Acts must be in the hands of the Commonwealth. I cannot understand how the omission of these words is dependent upon the words which were inserted just before the suspension for dinner. All we did in inserting the first amendment was to say that the Governor-General in Council may, by proclamation, declare that on a certain date, the administration of the Copyrights Acts of any State, so far as they relate to registration, shall be transferred to the Commonwealth, but there is nothing in that amendment referring to existing rights, which are to be preserved. I think
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline>
                    will see that the only words to preserve existing rights are those which he now proposes to strike out. I suppose there are hundreds of copyrights in operation under States Acts, but these will not be preserved if the present amendment be agreed to.

                <para>That is to say, when a work is first performed in&#39; Australia, in comparison with any. other part of the British dominions, that gives a right to copyright in Australia. Of course, there can be no copyright in Australia in conflict with copyright in Great Britain. If a work is first published in England, copyright in Australia has gone, except by virtue of the Imperial law, which confers the privilege of copyright in the British dominions because of publication in England. </para>

                        <para>- Undoubtedly. If there were no State copyright law, and we did not pass this Bill, copyright in Australia would apply to works first published in England. There are two kinds of copyright conferred by this Bill. When a book is published here before it has been published anywhere else, that gives copyright. But publication in Australia, which is not first in point of time, but which is simultaneous - that is to say, when the book is published here within fourteen days of publication elsewhere - also gives copyright. Consequently, what we have to do is to provide for two things - first, copyright for a book first published in Australia; and, secondly, copyright for a book published here simultaneously with publication elsewhere. The amendment which I have moved is to provide that a work which has been first published in Australia, . or of which the first publication in Australia is simultaneous with publication elsewhere, shall have copyright. By way of illustration, take clauses 14 and 15. Take a lecturing right. It subsists in every lecture which has &#34; been first delivered in public in Australia;&#34; and that means clearly the first delivery of that lecture in public here, or simultaneously with its first delivery in. public elsewhere. Unless this amendment is carried, we shall first of all introduce a limitation on &#34; first publication &#34; by saying that it means &#34; before publication elsewhere.&#34; If that means anything, it emphasizes what I have said about first publication being in reference to the. whole of the British dominions. Or, if we say that it means &#34; simultaneously with publicationelsewhere,&#34; we are departing from the language used in clause 15. I think the clauses of this Bill should be as connected&#34; and as harmonious as possible. </para>

I wish to know whether or not the clause is intended to mean that a work can be published elsewhere, but that the moment it is published here it can secure copyright. I do not wish to delay the Bill, but it is one thing to expedite legislation, and quite another thing to make ourselves ridiculous, not only in the eyes of the public, but in our own eyes. It seems to me that we have had two meanings from the Minister in charge of the Bill. One is that &#34;first publication in Australia&#34; means that the first publication of a particular work is made here, although it may previously have been published elsewhere. If that be so, the words &#34; before or simultaneously with its first publication elsewhere &#39; &#39; become a rank absurdity. On the other hand, if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating&#39;s</inline> other interpretation be correct, the words &#34;before or simultaneously with &#34; kill the first portion of the clause. One or the other interpretation is ridiculous. </para>

                    (Tasmania- Honorary Minister). - I will endeavour to give a concrete instance. The next two clauses refer to performing rights and lecturing rights. They are all framed on the same principle - that first publication, first performance, and first delivery in Australia, either prior to or simultaneously with first publication, first performance, or first delivery elsewhere, will enable copyright to subsist. It is as well to remember that copyright under this measure may be obtained in two ways. First, the person who is entitled to copyright), by virtue of first publication here, has all the advantages and privileges of this measure conferred upon him. These are over and above any advantages or privileges or facilities that may be conferred upon another by virtue of international or Imperial copyright, which privileges do not subsist under this Bill itself, but perhaps under some Imperial enactment. These latter may be registered here for their original value. I will take as an illustration the case of the performing right of some play. We will say that a drama is written in England or in America, and is called

                    <inline font-style="italic">Upper Life.</inline>
                    Suppose that that drama is first produced in London on the 1st March of this year, and is first produced in Australia on the 1 st September of this year. Obviously its first production in Australia is after its first production elsewhere, and there is no copyright here. But suppose that it is first produced in London on the 1st August, and is first produced in Australia on the 1st August, or within fourteen days after. That is first production in Australia, not before, but simultaneously, because the Bill provides that a period of fourteen days is to be regarded as simultaneous with first production elsewhere. The words of the clause are perfectly correct. They say that copyright shall subsist in a book which has been first published in Australia - not which is absolutely first published as a book, but which has been first published in Australia, either before or simultaneously with its first publication elsewhere. What is wrong with that?

                        <para>- No; I am speaking of what is ordinarily understood by the public. A book may be first published in Australia last week, but it may have been published in England six months ago. We provide that if a book is published here, before or simultaneously with its publication elsewhere, with a margin of fourteen days, that shall be first publication here.. I submit that the clause, as it stands, carries out its object, and if we adopt the amendment that has been suggested we shall cause doubt and obscurity. </para>

                    <para>- Apart from the ordinary statute law of copyright, a lecturer has a property in his lecture. It was held in the celebrated case of that very distinguished Scotch professor, Professor Caird, that whilst his students were perfectly entitled to take even shorthand notes for their own private use, they were not entitled to use them for the purpose of lecturing themselves, or for publication in book form. A student or some one else had taken notes of Professor Caird&#39;s lectures and proposed to publish them in pamphlet form, but was restrained by an order of the Court from doing so. In passing, I should like to point out that it is a little difficult to understand how a lecture could be delivered simultaneously in, say, England and here. </para>

                        <para>- I merely point out that the clause reads, rather funnily, and it provides for a condition of things not usual or very likely to arise. It is very seldom that a lecture is delivered at the same time in two places, even by two different lecturers. However, Ido not suggest that the clause should be struck out, because there is nothing impossible under the sun. </para>

                    <para>- I object to the term proposed for the duration of a copyright. I pointed out on the motion for the second reading, how it is quite possible for a valuable work to be written and published by an author in a very early period in his life, and for that author to live, as some of our distinguished writers have lived, to an advanced age. It is true that on the contrary, some authors have died at a comparatively early age; and if the clause be allowed to remain as at present, it will not operate fairly as between the two classes. Certainly the heirs of an author who dies young will not reap the same advantage, as will the heirs of an author who dies at an advanced age. In any case, the period is too long. For instance, as has often happened, a young author, before reaching the age of twenty-five years, may publish a valuable book, and if he lives to the age of seventy-five, that work may be copyrighted for something over one hundred years. The English Act provides that copyright shall subsist for seven years after the author&#39;s death, or for a period of forty-two years, whichever is the longer. In my opinion, forty-two years is too long for copyright to last. It is certainly desirable that there should be a fixed period, failing the author&#39;s life extending to that period. It must be remembered that no author is absolutely the creator of any work. We are the heirs of all the ages and of the accumulated knowledge of all the ages, and authors certainly owe some debt to the public who have supplied them with knowledge. They ought not to wrap themselves up in selfishness, and say that knowledge obtained from those who have gone before should remain their exclusive property for a very extended period. I think that the period proposed is too long. It would have the effect of limiting the publication of valuable works at a time when they ought to be free to the public. I have no desire to do any injustice to an author, but if he has the exclusive right to the publication of his own productions during his lifetime, and if it continues to vest in his&#39; children after his death until they reach the age of manhood or womanhood, that is all that any author should demand. </para>

                    <para>- This is undoubtedly, if not the most important, one of the most important provisions of the Bill. The whole advantage or disadvantage of the Bill rests on the duration of the copyright granted under it. The property which we propose to confer upon an author of a work depends on the duration of the copyright which we give him. I agree very largely with the sentiments expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens,</inline> and I shall ask the honorable senator to allow me to move a prior amendment, which will differ only in one respect from that which he has proposed. I desire to propose that there shall be a fixed period of forty-two years. </para>

                        <para>- That is true. I took the liberty on the second reading of the Bill of dealing at some length with this question, and I should like to sa.y one or two words now in elucidation of what this principle of copyright is. A man publishes his book, and unless there is some tangible property, measurable, as lawyers say, by metes and bounds, he cannot deal with it. The difficulty, which was met by copyright legislation, was the difficulty of making measureable, and capable of being valued, the property which a man had in the productions of his own intellect, as expressed in words. It was like giving him a lease, and saying that he should have a certain right for so many years. If a fixed period were decided on, with an absolute power to stop any one else from reproducing his work, he could go to his publisher, and say, &#34; I have this to sell you. Here is my book, and attached to it there is a monopoly of publication for a fixed period.&#34; The publisher would then know exactly what he was going to buy. He would be able to estimate his probable profit during that fixed period, and as the author would be also in a position to make an estimate, he could not be taken advantage of. </para>

                        <para>- It could not be less than thirty years. Under this clause it is proposed that copyright shall be given for the authors life and thirty years after the end of the year in which he dies. The effect of such a provision would be that we should have two measurements of the value of the property the author is to get. One is an absolutely uncertain measurement, and the other is certain. I propose to make an absolutely certain measurement. </para>

                        <para>- And equal all round. If a man goes to a publisher, and says that his interest in his book is a life interest, the publisher mav say, &#34; You may die to-morrow; I can give you only so much for it. If your interest is for life and thirty years. I can only pay you for a thirty years&#39; interest, and a margin of, perhaps, a year or two longer. The uncertainty of life is great, and I cannot possibly assess what your work is worth to me for the period covered by your life interest.&#34; We may make the period long or short, but if we fix a definite period, the author is given something with which he can go to a publisher, and say, &#34; I give you this book, with so many years&#39; purchase of the monopoly of its publication.&#34; If forty-two years is not long enough, the Committee can make it longer, but I think it is long enough. In Canada, the term is twenty-eight years. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, it is like the patents law. Here with regard to a patent, the period of protection is fourteen years, with a qualified right of extension for a further seven years, or, in exceptional circumstances, for &#39;fourteen years. I prefer a definite fixed period, and I say that the duration of the copyright should be forty or forty-two years, or the life of the author, whichever is the longer term. That, in my opinion, would be ample. The publisher can make his estimate of purchase on a certain period of forty or forty-two years, and if the author lives longer so much the better for himself and his children. </para>

                        <para>- I suggest forty-two years, because that is the period adopted by the Imperial Legislature, and adopted in State legislation throughout Australia, relying on the English precedent. I feel that that is long enough. I remind honorable senators that when, in 1841, it was sought to make the duration of copyright extend during the life of the author and sixty years beyond, the proposal was defeated at the instance of Lord Macaulay, one of the greatest literary men of the last century.. In the following year Lord Mahon, afterwards Lord Stanhope, brought in his Bill shortening the period to twenty-five years beyond the life of the author. That was again opposed by Lord Macaulay, whose views had the greater force, because copyright so gravely affected himself and his own literary productions. The period was then reduced to what is at present the law - forty-two years, or the fife of the author plus seven&#39; years, whichever term is the longer. I say. that we should leave it at that. It has been at that&#39; for more than sixty years. In 1875 a Royal Commission made certain suggestions which have never been carried into law, and, so far as I .am aware, the term fixed has worked satisfactorily, and has given to authors a property in their works in a form which is beneficial to them, and which has enabled them to secure a fair price for their work. Every one is aware that a monopoly for a fixed period is a much more saleable product than is a monopoly for an uncertain period. It is like so many years purchase. We give an author a monopoly for a period of so many years, and if he lives longer, and retains his copyright, he has it until his days are ended. If he lives for fifty or sixty years there will have been ample time for him to derive .from his copyright the emoluments necessary to enable him to bequeath the benefit of .it to his children. If, on the other hand, copyright is extended beyond the life of the author, it may have passed into the hands of a publisher, who, after the author&#39;s death, may make use &#39;of it to secure a fortune for himself. </para>

                        <para>- I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe</inline> that we should not allow any period after the death of the author. We can have a fixed period of forty-two years, or if that is not considered long enough it may be extended. I personally think that it is too long, and that from thirty-five to forty years would be long enough, but in any case we should also extend the period during the author&#39;s life, if that is longer than the fixed period, in order .that if he retains the copyright he may secure the benefit of it during the time he lives. . </para>

Of course the most valuable books are usually published when a man has reached the maturity of his powers - that is when he is in middle age, and, therefore, the public get the benefit of a fixed period. The great thing we ought to seek to do is to establish a fixed period so as to put an author on a fair footing when bargaining with his publisher. We want to give him a property, that is copyright - and we ought to enable him to bargain on practically equal terms with his publisher. If, on the other hand, the period is left uncertain, he is entirely in the publisher&#39;s hands.- As Macaulay said, &#34;If you make any amendment in the law, make it in the direction of increasing a fixed period, but do not increase an uncertain period which must always work to the disadvantage of the man who has wares to sell.&#34; I propose to move - </para>

                    <para>- I should like to have an opportunity of voting for the amendment foreshadowed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon.</inline> The chief objection to the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> is that it would introduce the element of gambling or speculation. From actuarial tables, we can form a fair idea as to the average duration of life; but still his amendment would introduce the element of speculation In the matter of a copyright. Who would suffer in that case? It would not be the publisher, but the author; and an old author would suffer more than a young one. We ought to give a certain value to a book, just as we give a certain value to a patent. The amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> would accomplish that object in a very effective manner. In my opinion, it would give a sufficient term of copyright to provide for an author during his life, and also in the greater number of cases for his children after his death. I trust that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> will withdraw his amendment, and let us have a vote on the proposition of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon.</inline> I shall vote against any amendment designed to enable the chances of an author&#39;s life to determine the value of his copyright. </para>

                    <para>- I hope that the same provision will be passed as is contained in the Imperial Act ; that is to give copyright for the life of the author, <inline font-style="italic">plus</inline> seven years, or for forty-two years, whichever is the longer. With, regard to the point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> he need not; have any apprehension. Supposing that I were a publisher, and were offered a book. I should know that the author would have copyright for his life, and seven years longer, and it would be very easy for mie to ascertain the actuarial expectation of his life, and if necessary to insure against his death. I think that in justice to the children of an author there ought to be copyright for a few years after his death. Many an author dies in comparatively old age, leaving young children who are not over-well provided for. A copyright for seven years would be a perfect god-send to the family of many an author. As a rule, authors are impecunious, and therefore are not able to leave their children provided for. I hope that if no one else moves in that direction I shall be at liberty by-and-by to submit an amendment for the adoption of the system which prevails in the United Kingdom, New South Wales, Victoria, </para>

                    <para>- I intend to support the amendment foreshadowed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon;</inline> because I think it would be better to have a more fixed period than is proposed in the Bill. Otherwise, we should accord a more valuable privilege to a young author than to an old one. According to the Bill there is a specified term after the author&#39;s death, in which copyright shall endure, so that a young man of twenty-five years of age would have a clear advantage over a man twice that age. I do not see why we should! accord to one man on account of his age a privilege which we do not accord to another. There is no absolute reason why we should not have a fixed term instead of one varied by the life of the author. If a man is fortunate enough to live a considerable time after his work is published, why/ should he&#34;, or, iri the event of his death, his children, get a greater advantage than the children of a deceased author? Take the case of Gibbon, who, although he was very wealthy, died a year or two after he had completed his <inline font-style="italic">magnum opus - The Decline and Fall of Rome.</inline> Under this provision the Children of such an author would not be left penniless, but would have the advantage of the copyright in the works which had been published. Lately, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. E.</inline> V. Lucas has published in twelve volumes, <inline font-style="italic">Lamb&#39;s Letters,</inline> perhaps the most delightful literature in the English language. Unfortunately, the work is not complete,, because recently some of Lamb&#39;s letters have been discovered and published. If the twelve volumes have been issued, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lucas</inline> is in this position : That he cannot publish them for another forty-two years, although Lamb has been dead for 100 years. It seems, therefore, that under the Imperial Act there is copyright for a term of forty-two years from the date of publication. If that is not provided against in this Bill it should be. </para>

                    <para>. - I have listened to the remarks of the honorable senators who have addressed themselves to the amendment with great care. It seems to me that there is a disposition on their part to regard this limitation of the term of copy right as; being one that will be practically effective in the case of every production that is copyrighted. Quite the contrary is likely to be the case. Experience has shown that the full benefit of the term of copyright is enjoyed in a very small number of cases. Very few books are copyrighted as to which it is necessary to preserve to the authors their rights beyond a very limited period. In a very excellent article contributed to the <inline font-style="italic">North American Review</inline> in January of this year, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. S.</inline> L. Clemens, who is better known throughout the world as Mark Twain, says that during the last twenty-five years in the United States more than 100,000 books, and in the last 104 years over 250,000, have been copyrighted. When asked how many of the works survived the forty-two years, he says that the average was five per year. He says that in most instances the term of forty-two years for the operation of copyright, in his opinion, is altogether too short. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Clemens</inline> gave evidence before the Copyright Commission in Great Britain, and Lord Thring, in the <inline font-style="italic">Nineteenth Century,</inline> some little time after the examination made reference to it. I will quote from Lord Thring&#39;s article a little later on. The article in the <inline font-style="italic">North American Review</inline> is in the form of question and answer, and I would draw the attention of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> to it. It will be seen that, in Mark Twain&#39;s opinion, it is desirable that the copyright term should have gome relation to the author&#39;s life. He says that the present system is - </para>

                        <para>- It appears, from this article, that the term of copyright had run out while the authoress was still alive. The publishers who had issued the book in the meantime were not philanthropists. As soon as the forty-two years&#39; limit expired, they did not care whether the authoress or her relatives were well provided for or not. They concerned themselves with their own interests. </para>

The Royal Commission to which reference has been made during the debate, and which sat in England for two or three years to investigate the whole subject of copyright in Great Britain and other civilized countries, dealt exhaustively with this point. They say with regard to the period that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> seems to favour - life, plus seven years, or forty-two years, whichever may be longer - and with regard to the fixed term of forty-two years from publication, or life, whichever may be longer, favoured by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> - </para>

                <para>The term of copyright in books is for the life of the author and seven years after his death, or for forty-two years from the date of publication, whichever period may happen to expire last. . . First, the period is said not to be long enough. The chief reasons for this .assertion are that many works, and particularly those of permanent value, are frequently but little known or appreciated for many years after they are published, and that they do not command a sale sufficient to remunerate the authors until a considerable part of the term of copyright has expired. Some works, as, for instance, novels by popular authors, command an extensive sale, and bring to the authors a large remuneration at once, but the case is altogether different with others, such as works of history, books of a philosophical or classical character, and volumes of poems. In some instances, works of these kinds have been known to produce scarcely any remuneration, until the authors have died, and the copyrights have nearly expired. It is also urged that in the case of many authors who make their living by their pens, their families are left without provision shortly after their deaths, unless their works become profitable very soon after they are written. </para>
                <para class="block">In the case of ephemeral literature, such as novels, the author looks to get practically the whole of the return from the sale of his books within a year or a couple of years from publication. The remaining&#39; thirty-five or thirty-six years of the term of copyright are worth very little to him. Consequently we find to-day that works which were published only a few years ago, and which have a term of copyright, extending over the life of the author and seven years,, or for forty-two years, whichever may be longer, are selling; in sixpenny editions ; the reason being that the remaining term of copyright is of very little value. The books have had their day. But historical works and books of research,, as pointed out in the English report, very often do not acquire their full value im the. eyes of the public until many years of the copyright term have elapsed. In some cases their value is not fully appreciated until after the death of the author.. If we abridge the term of copyright, authors who have derived no benefit from works of that character, would be the less; likely to derive any. The Royal Commission in Great Britain, after considering the term of copyright existing in various countries, unanimously .recommend the adoption of a term extending over the life of the author and thirty years after. They say, in paragraph 39 of their report - </para>
                <para>We find considerable variety in the terms fixed in other countries, but putting aside the United1 States, which seems to have adopted our existing term with modifications, we find that the more important nations have adopted terms longer than our own. Thus, the term in France is the life of the author and fifty years ; in Belgium, life and twenty years; in Germany, life and thirty years; in Italy, life and forty years, with a second term of forty years, during which other persons than the proprietor may publish a work on payment of a royalty to him ; in Russia, life and fifty years; in Spain, life and fifty years; in Portugal, life and fifty years; and in Holland, life and twenty years. These terms are subject to sundry modifications and conditions; which it is unnecessary for us to enter into, but while we consider it expedient that the existing term of copyright should be altered, we think that the terms fixed by the nations we have referred to are, in some cases, excessive and unnecessary. </para>

                <para>He reckoned that-the number of British authors in a century, whose works survived forty-two years (the limit fixed by the existing law), was sixty-five. He allotted to each of them ten volumes, and concluded that 6v&#62; volumes was the total limit of surviving volumes in the century. Why, he asks, should the richest nation on the earth, by limiting copyright, annually take out of the pockets of the children of the little handful of illustrious men the trifling sums which they would derive from the sale of these volumes. </para>

                    <para> Great Britain issues 5,000 new books per year. None of these, except six and a half volumes, need the Committee&#39;s help. The&#39; others will never reach within a thousand miles of the forty -two year limit. They are amply, and even superfluously and extravagantly, protected. The mighty bulk of them will be dead and gone inside of five years. A few of them will live fifteen, others will live ten; but if you average the life of the 5,000 books straight through, a copyright limit of six months would answer all their necessities. The Committee is in no way concerned about their salvation; no legislation could achieve it. The whole batch can be set aside as being perfectly safe under the existing law, or any other for that matter. The only real question, the only important question, the only high and worthy question, as it seems to me, is how to save the six and a half volumes. </para>

                <para class="block">Practical experience shows that this term of copyright would, in actual fact, apply to such a small proportion as six and a half books out of 5,000; and honorable senators, will recognise that, by providing this term, we are not inflicting any injury or hardship on the public. As pointed out in the report from which I have quoted, the works which do survive forty-two years are mostly of a character which have to wait for a considerable time, and receive the attention of students and others, before their real value is recognised, and they begin to grow in demand. Under all the circumstances, the report recommends that the term should be for life and thirty years; and there is reason to believe that, if in Great Britain the copyright law were recodified that term would be adopted. If that were so, there would then be harmony between the British Act and the Act of the Commonwealth. A term for life and thirty years afterwards has an advantage over the proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon.</inline> The honorable and learned senator proposes forty-two years, or the life of the author, whichever , period is the longer, thus providing an alternative. The life of the author, of course, is not a fixed term, and when he goes to negotiate with a publisher, the latter is not in a position to know how long he will have the copyright for. </para>

                        <para>- It has been pointed out during the debate that if a young man of twenty-odd years of age published a book, he would get protection for forty-two years, or for his life, whichever period was the longer. It has been suggested that the same man might twenty years later bring out another book, and that, in respect to the latter, the terms would be the same ; but, if the forty-two years&#39; proposal operated in both cases, the copyrights would fall in at different dates, and publishers would not be aware of the fact. A man between the ages of thirty and forty-five years might publish one or, two books every year; and if he died at the age of sixty, the determination of the various copyrights would be different. </para>

That it is well founded is manifest, for if an author writes several works, or one work in several volumes which are published at different times, as is frequently the case, the copyrights will expire forty-two years from the respective dates of publication, unless the author happens to live so long that the period of seven years after his death is beyond forty-two years from the publication of his latest work or volume. </para>

                <para>Copyrights subsist under the Bill from the date of first publication, independently of registration ; and all kinds of questions would arise as to whether a book brought out in a certain year has had its full term of forty-two years. If, on the other hand, we make the term for life, plus thirty years, it could always be ascertained with exactness when a person died, and it would be easy to determine to a day when the copyrights ran out. This matter had caused extreme difficulty in England, and evidence was given at the inquiry by publishers and others. </para>

                        <para>- An author when alive would have the interest that after his death the rights in his works, if they were of any value, would be preserved to his family or his representatives for the definite period of thirty years. If,- on the other hand, he was an author who worked intermittently, he would simply have the half satisfaction of knowing that, in respect of some of his works, there would be a fair measure of copyright, and in respect to others, the value of which had not been properly appreciated, that the copyright was very nearly running out. &#34;Under all the circumstances, seeing that the matter has been reported on so fully in the light of the best evidence procurable, we should be well advised in adopting the term recommended by the Royal Commission, in the interests of the author himself, of those who represent him after his death, and of the public. </para>

                    SYMON.Be.cause I was speaking legislatively. The recommendations of the Royal Commission have never been given legislative force.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline>
                    has made excellent use of the report, but what is the use of quoting recommendations which were made twenty-seven years ago, and which the Imperial Parliament has not brought into force by, legislation? Both
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline>
                    and myself want a fixed period, that favoured by the honorable and learned gentleman being thirty years, whereas I propose forty-two years. The fixed period proposed by the honorable and learned senator is attached to the uncertain period of a man&#39;s life, and that, of course, is nothing on which to negotiate with a publisher. It is valuable to have a fixed period of thirty years or forty-two years, but an author would be entirely in the hands of a publisher as to_ what was uncertain. The whole tendency of legislation in the past in England has been, if possible, to lengthen the fixed period and diminish the uncertain period, and if there be an alternative, subject to the point referred to by
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens,</inline>
                    it ought to be in the direction of strengthening the fixed period.

                    <para>- I have no intention to stand in the way of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> submitting his amendment, and I shall ask leave to withdraw my proposal, in order to give him an opportunity. So far, I have heard no argument to induce me to believe that any of the suggestions made are more commendable than my own proposal. I fail to see the force of some of the arguments which have been used by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> and others, as to the desirability of accepting his amendment in preference to mine. It has been said that my amendment introduces a gambling element, but the same gambling element is in the proposal suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon.</inline> My proposal is that the term shall be the author&#39;s life and seven years, or a fixed period of forty-two years, whichever is the longer, whereas <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon&#39;s</inline> proposal is that there shall be fixed period of forty-two years or the author&#39;s life, whichever is the longer. I should like to ask those who say that my amendment introduces the gambling element whether there is more of the gambling element in a provision for a period covering the life of a man and seven years than in one covering his life without seven years. This is a ridiculous argument to put forward in support of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon&#39;s</inline> amendment. It might&#39; frequently happen that a man would die at just about the time when the forty-two years fixed period would expire. Immediately he was dead, copyright in his works would expire, &#39; and then the hardship would arise which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> quoted for us as indicated by Mark Twain, and commented on by Lord Thring. </para>

                        <para>- Then there would be a fixed period of copyright for forty-two years. Suppose the fixed period of forty-two years, and an author&#39;s life expire about the same time, say, for instance, that a man publishes a work at thirty, and dies at seventy-two years of age, his copyright in that work would cease exactly at the time he died, notwithstanding the fixed period suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon.</inline> It would be a very great hardship indeed if he left a widow or young children that they should be absolutely deprived by his death of all profit from his work. Such cases are possible, and it is our duty to avoid giving rise to such hardships if we can. A publisher cannot be expected to give any of the proceeds from the publication of the works of an author to his relatives after his death, if the period of copyright in those works has expired. In these days, when competition is so keen, it is probable that there is not one publisher who could afford to do so, because every publisher has then the same right to publish those books, prices are cut down to bedrock, and only sufficient is left for ordinary trade profit. In justice, therefore, to relatives who may Be dependent on an author, it is desirable that we should give a copyright for seven years in addition to his life as an alternative to the fixed period of forty-two years. I point out that in doing so we shall only be acting in accordance with what has already been done in Great Britain, and in every </para>

                <para class="block">State of the Commonwealth. I have never heard that a single word has been raised against that provision in Australia or in Great Britain. I am inclined to think that a fixed period of forty-two years is rather too long, but as it seems to be the general wish of the Committee to enact a fixed period of that duration I waive my objection to it. But I am not willing to agree to a fixed period of forty-two years and an alternative of the life of the author. I favour the provision of the law of Great Britain, and of every State of the Commonwealth, that a period of seven years after the author&#39;s death should be the alternative to a fixed period of forty-two years. By leave of the Committee, I will temporarily withdraw my amendment, in order to allow <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> to move the amendment he has indicated. </para>

We know by experience that it frequently happens that when a prominent author dies a very great demand arises for his books. At the present time we have before us an illustration of the sudden demand which may arise for the works of an author on his death. Several years ago a celebrated book was published, and when the author died the other day a great demand for it arose at home. I refer to Shorthouse&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">John Inglesant.</inline> It is what is called a philosophical romance, and there is a very great demand for that work at present. </para>

                        <para>- I am aware of that, as the book was published in 1881. But a new demand for the book has arisen since the death of the author. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> made a. remark to the effect that Charles Lamb had died 100 years ago, and&#39; that new &#34; Letters of Elia &#34;&#39;had been discovered recently, for which there would be forty-two years&#39; copyright. I refreshed my memory on the subject, and I find that Charles Lamb died in 1834, only seventy-one years ago. I should not like it to go abroad that we all think a man died 100 years ago who died less than seventy-two years ago. We know that towards the end of an author&#39;s life he often publishes his autobiography, and it would be rather unfortunate if his family at his death should&#34; not be able to secure any benefit from such&#62; a work. I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens&#39;</inline> suggested amendment will be carried, and that the period fixed will be forty-two years, or the life of the author and seven years. </para>

If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> acquired a landed estate, he would call it confiscation if any one attempted to take it from him during his life, and if the honorable senator were not permitted to hand it down to his children after his death, no one would be louder in protest than he would.

                <para>SenatorSTEWART.- I am not very sure that I would not. I do not see how we can deprive a man of one particular kind of property, whilst another form of property is looked upon as sacred. The only gleam of satisfaction I have in connexion with the whole matter, is that we have an admission from honorable senators on this side of the Chamber, that even property is not to be looked upon as sacred. </para>

On this occasion I am &#34; a voice crying in the wilderness.&#34; There is not much use in my protesting against what is being done, as I find that the great majority of honorable senators are anxious to limit an author&#39;s right to the production of his own brain. Some honorable senators would do that during his life, and all of them would appear to be prepared to limit the interests of his children in an author&#39;s work. As the Committee seems determined to take this course I can only acquiesce. </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. F. W. Holder)</inline>
                    undertook, as soon as Federation was established, to introduce a Bill formally giving the assent of this State to the construction of the line by Federal authority, and to pass it stage by stage simultaneously with the passage of; a similar Bill through the Western Australian Parliament. This had ( nth June, loot) the support of the Jenkins Government, conditionally upon the line joining the Western Australian one forty to sixty miles north of Eucla. In 1903 the Premier
                    <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jenkins),</inline>
                    while on a visit to Western Australia, personally promised to introduce an Enabling Bill, but with the further stipulation that the powers conferred upon the Federal Parliament should be exercised within a period of three years. Again (29th June, 1903),
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jenkins</inline>
                    promised to bring in a Bill for the construction of the line, subject to Western Australia passing an Act indemnifying South Australia against any financial loss for ten years from the completion, with a stipulation as to3&#189;ft. gauge, and for the line to go through Tarcoola to Port Augusta. This indemnity was offered by the Premier of Western Australia on 26th June, 1903.&#34;

                        <para>- I should like to remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> of this fact that, in spite of all the evidence he brings that certain persons holding public positions did make promises, one of them, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jenkins,</inline> laid it down in a public document that no promise could be binding unless it was contained in an Act of Parliament. That seems to me to sum up the whole position - that one of these gentlemen, whose individual promise is relied upon, has candidly told us and Australia, &#34;You must not take my promise as binding ; no promise except that contained in a resolution pf Parliament can be held to be binding.&#34; </para>
