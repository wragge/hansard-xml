                        <para>- My remarks, I find, were made under a misapprehension. I think that if they had had a general application, they would, in many instances, be correct, but in this instance I unwittingly  did to the officers of the Departments an injustice, which I regret. The Prime Minister informs me that the answers to the questions were not formulated by the clerks, but emanated directly from himself ; therefore, they were not in any way to blame. There was a misunderstanding as to the nature of the replies, and that arose probably through some ambiguity in my questions. When I asked what steps would be taken to carry out the terms of the Anglo-French agreement, I desired to elicit information with regard to what negotiations had actually taken place between the British and French Governments, in reference to the purchases that were to be granted in that agreement. I desired to know what was the cause of the delay of one year and four months which had taken place without any action being taken, and as to whether that delay was the fault of the British or French Government. The Prime Minister informs me that he understood, when I asked what steps had been taken, that I was anxious to know if any results had accrued with regard to the formation of the Commission that is to inquire as to land matters in the New Hebrides, and also with regard to some control over the natives. As nothing had been done, looking at it from that point of view, he was quite correct in answering in the negative, but he assures me that he misunderstood my intentions in the questions, and that therefore he gave a reply which he thought conveyed the information I desired. </para>

I should like in the first place to say that considerable correspondence seems to have taken place with regard to the duty on harvesters, and especially with regard to the valuation on which duty is being paid by the importers. It may be said that the consideration given to the subject by the Customs Department and by the Minister is pretty well summed up in a note writtenby <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smart</inline> on the 6th October to the Comptroller-General : - </para>

                            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> was the chief one. I think there was another. I believe that the evidence, although very voluminous, was confined to those two gentlemen without any rebuttal of it being given by any other firm. I may say that the Sydney manager of the Massey-Harris Harvester Company told me in conversation three or four months ago. " We are ready with an immense amount of evidence in rebuttal of what has been said when we have an opportunity of giving that evidence." The matter remained pretty well in abeyance until the month of June, when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay,,</inline> who seems to have very considerable access to the Customs authorities, appeared with a statement that some correspondence had passed between him and a gentleman in Italy, from whom he had received a statement respecting the Massey-Harris Company, stating that they quoted their harvesters in Italy at about ^65. This letter from Italy, which was produced by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay,</inline> shows that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. De</inline> Haan was a gentleman in Milan. In his letter he acknowledged receipt of a cable message asking him to send over "Canadian letter quoting machines " ; and he says - </para>

Instead of treating that as a private communication <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> took it to the Customs House. When this information was given to the Customs authorities they at once proceeded - and they were quite justified in doing so - to make some inquiry into the matter; and I should like to read this draft of a letter to the manager of the Massey-Harris Company which may be seen amongst the papers in the Library. It is dated June 19th, and is as1 follows : - </para>

That is the statement which I have to make to' the Senate. We are face to face with this most extraordinary position : The Government has issued an instruction for an immense advance in the valuation. If this advance is justified, then the Massey-Harris Company has been fraudulently presenting false invoices ; and if it has been fraudulently presenting false invoices it ought to be prosecuted. That is the position. There is no getting away from that. </para>

The honorable senator said that if the Government, who, through the Collector of Customs, had, under section 160 of the Customs Act, taken on themselves to raise the price at which these machines could be invoiced from Â£38 to ^65, it was an unmistakable sign that the company in question had previously been defrauding the revenue, and that, therefore, it was the duty of the Government to proceed against the firm for fraud. But the position is that evidence cannot be procured to prove fraud in a Court of law. </para>

                            <para>- These machines are made in Canada and the United States, where there is no local demand for them, and, as it is thus impossible to arrive at the selling price in the country of origin, the manufacturers are able to charge what they like on sending them to this country. At first the machines were invoiced at ,Â£28, but that price was raised by a previous Minister of Customs to ^38. When that step was taken, the same argument applied that has been used to-day by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford.</inline></para>

                            <para>- I forget which Government it was, but, at all events, it was nob the Deakin Government. My point is that, at that time, the same argument applied, namely, that by raising the. invoice price the Government insinuated that the manufacturers had been making false entries. Yet no action was taken ; and why ? Because it could not be proved that there had been fraud, although there might be moral certainty that the goods had been undervalued. That is the reason, I suppose, why the head of the Customs Department at that time did not attempt to take any action, as I am sure he would have done if fraud could have been proved in a Court of law. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know, and I do not care very much, what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLean</inline> says in regard to the matter. I am not sure whether it was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLean</inline> who raised the invoice price to .-Â£38, but whoever did so, doubtless had a suspicion of undervaluation. I did not know that this motion was to be submitted until five or ten minutes before the Senate met, and I have not had time to do more than to take an exceedingly hurried look through the papers. This is a matter which does not come within my Department, and I have no knowledge, except what I have gained from evidence given before the Tariff Commission. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> implied that the Minister of Customs should have waited until the other side had been heard : but the evidence given before the Tariff Commission has nothing to do with fixing invoice rates or duty. The local manufacturers in the Commonwealth, however, have something at stake ; and they pointed out, as they were justified in doing, that these machines were coming into the country, and unfairly competing with the Australian pro- duct. It was not for the Collector of Cus-toms to wait to hear what the other side said ; he has his own officers, and is supplied with information on which he can act. In regard to these harvesters, there has been a suspicion for many years that they were being introduced at too low a rate. As I have said, the machines were at first invoiced at ,Â£28 or ^29, and the company at that time represented that as a fair value. </para>

T-hat gentleman has had the matter under his consideration for years, and has reported on it to his Minister. All that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne has done is, as J say, to act on the recommendation of his chief officer, under section 160 of the Customs Act, which gives power, whenever it is difficult to determine the value of goods for duty, because the goods are not sold for use or consumption in the country of production - and that is exactly the case here - the Minister may assess the value at what he thinks a fair amount. I contend that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne is amply justified in the action he took, and I ask the Senate not to adopt the motion, although I know it is not proposed to be adopted, but merely to afford an opportunity for debate. The matter has received the attention of more Ministers of Customs than one, and they have all been, satisfied from the first that there was undervaluation. If honorable senators desire 1 to know the whole facts of the case they are disclosed in the papers which have been laid on the library table. </para>

                            <para>- It appears strange, I admit, that a harvester should be introduced here invoiced at ,Â£38 or ^40, and sold at something like ,Â£85 or .Â£90. I have no doubt that that fact prejudices honorable senators in regard to the attitude they ought to assume on such an occasion. But I remind honorable senators that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay,</inline> who manufactures a similar implement, sells them on the same terms as the imported harvesters are sold. We have, therefore, a trade jealousy, which gives rise to an endeavour to induce the Minister to increase the duty. The question arises whether it is an honest increase, or an increase for ulterior purposes. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLean,</inline> the predecessor of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne, was satisfied that he could not go beyond ^38, but directly the latter gentleman comes into office, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay,</inline> who happens to be an important resident in the constituency of the Prime Minister, and to have something like 400 men in his employment, takes action. </para>

                            <para>.- We have these facts before us. There is the further fact that one cannot buy the locally-made article at a cheaper rate than the imported article. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay.</inline> or any one else, has a perfect right to charge the highest price he can get for the article which he has for sale, but in the same way the Canadian people have the right to charge the highest price which they can get for the implements they produce. I admit that there is an enormous difference between the invoice price of .Â£38 or ,Â£45 and the selling price of ,Â£85 or ,Â£90, but I do not know what circumstances require to be taken into consideration in that connexion. The Massey-Harris people may give from two to five years' credit. The giving of credit in that way no doubt often results in the loss of money to the person giving it, and it is usual to make that up by charging a higher price to people who are good marks and pay well. I repeat that, in this instance, the power assumed by the Minister of Trade and Customs is a most dangerous one. That was pointed out when the Commonwealth Customs Bill was under consideration. We contended that the powers proposed to be given under that measure to the Minister of Trade and Customs for the time being were most dangerous, and that they should be safeguarded in some way or other. The reply we always got was that we could depend that the Minister, whoever he was, would exercise those powers with the utmost discretion. I am sorry to say that the history of the Commonwealth Customs administration has not justified that contention. The section of the Act under which the Minister of Trade and Customs is supposed to have taken action has been used to greatly increase the invoice valuation of a certain article, and why? Because. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smart</inline> says that the valuation previously agreed to, ,Â£38, is an undervaluation, and that the Customs officers, who previously investigated the matter, were misled. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smart</inline> does not give a single reason for making that statement. We are told that these machines are invoiced in the Argentine at ,Â£41, and that, according to a certain letter, they were invoiced at .Â£65 in Italy. </para>

                            <para>- It is only a copy, and it comes from a gentleman who is personally interested in raising as high as he can the invoice valuation of imported harvesters, to reduce the margin of profit of a trade rival. In the circumstances, the Minister should have taken the greatest care before he .acted in the way in which he has done. Why could he not have made further inquiries from the Canadian authorities? He should have again communicated with the Canadian authorities, who could have no reason for deceiving him. He could have explained that these machines were invoiced at higher rates in other portions of the world, and suggested that the Canadian authorities must have been misled as to their proper valuation, and might, therefore, inquire further. If that had been done, and it had been shown, as alleged, that these implements really cost something like <inline font-style="italic">Â£65</inline> to make, there is no member of the Senate who would not have been perfectly willing to. agree to the action which has been taken by the Minister of Trade and Customs. But the valuation of these harvesters has been jumped up so suddenly, and under such peculiar circumstances, that one is forced at once to the consideration of possible motives behind the action taken. Those motives may have been absolutely pure. I do not say that they were or were not, but in view of all the circumstances, the action taken looks very suspicious. Honorable senators should not forget that we have placed in the hands of the Minister of Trade and Customs the power to improperly increase the duties imposed upon every article imported into this country. The Minister may, if he pleases, under this section of the Customs Act, say that any article invoiced at <inline font-style="italic">Â£25</inline> shall be invoiced at ^50, and it will be seen that the door is open to all sorts of corruption. </para>

                            <para>.- If a manufacturer can get <inline font-style="italic">Â£go</inline> for an article which it costs him only <inline font-style="italic">Â£20</inline> to produce, he is entitled to all the benefit he can derive from the transaction. I am glad that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> has brought this matter forward. I hope honorable senators will take care to protest every time action is taken which they consider improper in the administration, not only of the Customs Department, but of every Department of the Government, and will insist that full investigation shall be made, and that everything done shall be honest and aboveboard. Before I resume my seat, I should like to allude to the fact that certain papers relating to this case have been placed on a table in the Library, and access to them granted to honorable senators generally ; but in a case of this kind, the papers should be made official documents, and should be placed on record. It should not be left for a Minister to say, " The papers in this case are so voluminous that I shall place them on the table in the Library, and any one can look at them." When the particular matter dealt with is -settled, the papers are taken away, and later on members of Parliament, and the public generally may have no idea of the reasons for certain action. In this case, I believe that most extraordinary action has been taken bv the Minister of Trade and Customs. </para>

                            <para>- He would certainly have power, under the Customs Act, to do what I have suggested. While one can sympathize with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> in bringing this matter forward, one is not necessarily committed to a condemnation of what the Minister of Trade and Customs has done in this particular instance. I agree with what the Minister has done. I believe he has done rightly, and he has only exercised the power which the Federal Parliament gave him in passing the Commonwealth Customs Act. I point out that the Minister might have achieved the same end by another method. There is another section in the Customs Act, which' was acted on by a previous Minister, under which he could have seized these goods and sold them. </para>

                            <para>- If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dawson</inline> were the importer of goods at a valuation ofÂ£35, which he sold here at Â£90, he would have a very strong objection to their being seized at the invoice valuation. If the course I point out had been followed, the action of the Minister would have been free from any suggestion that it was taken because of his protectionist proclivities. I do not think any honorable senator believes for a moment that there is a member in either House of the Federal Parliament who would take this action because a local factory for harvesters happened to be in a particular electorate. I do not think that should have been mentioned. I do not believe that such a consideration actuated the Minister of Trade and Customs in the slightest degree. I know from actual experience that these imported harvesters are being sold in the Commonwealth at fromÂ£80toÂ£90. </para>

                            <para>- I have seen similar machines manufactured. I know the conditions under which they are manufactured. 1 know something of this kind of business, and I am certain that they could not be manufactured for anything approachingÂ£35. From personal observation, therefore, I am satisfied that these goods are imported at very much below their true value. I think, therefore, that the Minister of Trade and' Customs was justified in taking some action, but it would have been better if he had acted under section 161 of the Customs Act, under which the Customs may take goods on paying the declared value - that is, the invoice value plus 10 per cent. I am certain that if the company referred to has been doing as it seems they have been doing, the Minister might have straightened them up in the manner I have suggested. Where a Minister of Trade and Customs takes action which has the result of doubling the invoice value of an article, this Senate should be very jealous of its powers of criticism, and should not hesitate to exercise them. If we allow such action to pass without comment we shall not be true to the interests of the' people who have sent us here. We are here to represent, not only the interests of the manufacturers of this particular article, but the interests also of those who use it. If such action as has been complained of in this case be allowed to pass without notice, honorable senators will see that a protectionist Minister of. Trade and Customs might revise the whole of the Tariff, and double the duties imposed in every case by taking like action in connexion with every other imported article. On the other hand, a free-trade Minister,, or one having revenue-tariff leanings, might by allowing importers to depreciate their invoice valuations, lower the Tariff rates by 50 or 100 per cent. We are therefore justified in criticising the action of the Minister in this case. I think that in view of all the circumstances the Minister was justified in the action he took, becauseÂ£65 is much more nearly the true value of these harvesters than the valuation stated by the importers. </para>

                            <para>- No doubt the honorable senator knows a good deal about swindles, but it would be very much better if he did not interrupt at present. The Customs Act necessarily contains very drastic powers to be exercised by the Minister for the protection of the public revenue. But for that reason it is absolutely essential that a careful and strict watch to be kept on the Minister, so .that "these; powers of administration shall not be exercised unfairly or in furtherance of some particular political view which he may have, and to prevent the possibility even of a suspicion that he is favouring a local manufacturer or local competitor against some foreign manufacturer whose goods are imported1 here. For that reason <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> is perfectly right in putting the matter in the most effective way in which it could be put - that if the present Administration were permitted to increase invoice valuations we might one day have a protectionist Minister who would not be too scrupulous ; or on the other hand, a free-trade Minister who would be similarly wanting in scruple, and either of them might exercise the powers conferred by the Act for the purpose not of administering it fairly and justly, but of favoring the particular fiscal views which he entertained. The principle applies both ways. Therefore, this motion is a just exercise by us of our right of supervision and criticism over the operation of an Act which demands effective administration, and which because of that demands also keen scrutiny at every point when it comes under challenge. I part company, however, with my honorable friend when he says he thinks that, in this instance, the Minister has acted properly. I am not going to suggest for a moment - and the proposition does not involve a suggestion - that there has been any moral impropriety, obliquity, or anything of that kind, but there are higher principles that we seek to observe than the claims of free-trade on one hand, or protection on the other, of local industry on the one hand, or exotic industry on the other, and these are the principles of fair- play and justice. I am not dealing now with the allegation that these principles have not been brought into force in relation to the action which the Minister has taken in this case. It is a leading and elementary principle that when you are asked to pronounce judgment on what anybody does, you hear the other side. In this particular case, we have the fact that it was difficult to estimate the value of these goods, because, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> has pointed out, there is no local market in the place of manufacture by which the Minister, as required by one section of the Act, can be guided. That being the case, it comes to be merely a question of first, an investigation as to what the cost of manufacture is, and, secondly, what would be a fair profit to charge in that country, adding any incidental expense of taking the goods to the sea-board or place of market, and on arrival here of the 10 per cent., which the Customs always" add. Some investigations have taken place, and, as a result, the late Minister of Trade and Customs, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLean,</inline> for whom apparently <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> expresses the greatest contempt- </para>

                            <para>- The evidence comes from what in legal circles is called a tainted source. Heaven knows where the original of the letter_ is, or whether it ever existed ; and yet it is upon that evidence that the value of these goods has been raised to ^65 in this market, and the duty increased by more than a third, with the 10 per cent, added. Is it fair or just that the present Minister should reverse the decision of his predecessor without further inquiry from official sources, and without giving manufacturers and importers an opportunity of being heard, and do so not upon an original letter emanating from a rival in trade, who, of course, is interested in prohibiting the importation of these machines. but upon a copy of a letter of which the Minister has never seen' the original? </para>

In fact, it is a charge of fraud, but it is not made against them in a way which they can rebut. </para>

                        <para>- So far the criticism of the action of the Minister of Customs has come from freetraders. I propose to / speak as a protectionist. When an extraordinary and arbitrary power is conferred upon the Minister of Trade and Customs, such as is conferred by section 160 of the Customs Act, he_ ought to take the greatest possible care not to allow his fiscal prejudice to overcome him. To me, as a business man, it would seem that there was justification for an- increase in the invoice price of these articles; but, in my opinion, the Minister, in making that increase, went to the other extreme. As regards an article which I understand is sold on terms of long credit at <inline font-style="italic">jÂ£&amp;5,</inline> one would think that between ^40 and <inline font-style="italic">Â£50</inline> would be a fair invoice price in the country of manufacture. If the Minister will inquire as to the selling prices of articles which are sold under similar conditions, pianos, for instance, he will find just as great disparity between the selling and invoice prices. It seems to me that in raising the value by one jump from ^38 10s. to <inline font-style="italic">Â£65,</inline> he took a step which requires a great deal of justification on his part. Although my instincts are in a protectionist direction, still I can hardly consider that the Minister was well or fairly advised by his officer. I consider that, in acting as he did, he rather l courted criticism of this kind, and laid himself open to the accusation of trying, without consulting Parliament, to introduce a more extreme protectionist policy. I like everything to be done in a straightforward way, and if we are going to have a protectionist policy for Australia, let it be introduced by Act of Parliament, and not bv the whim, caprice, or prejudice of the Minister. </para>

                            <para>- I understood the honorable senator to use the argument as a proof that the goods were under valued, because the previous Minister had seen fit to raise the valuation. To my mind', the whole matter tests on this - whether the action of the Minister was justified on the evidence then before him. No one disputes the power conferred by the Customs Act. No one disputes that it is the duty of the Minister to carry out that Act, and to take any action which may be necessary for the protection- of the revenue. I start from- that. But what I do say, is that the obligation rests upon the Minister to get full and sufficient facts before he takes any action, drastic or otherwise. The whole question seems to be as to whether the facts were sufficient to justify the action which the Minister took. We have an assurance from a gentleman, for whose smartness the Minister of Defence vouches, that up to the 6th of October last the valuation of these machines was considered to be sufficient and satisfactory. Only one thing happened after that date which could throw any doubt on the satisfactoriness of the valuation. That was the 'appearance of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> upon the scene. And it does appear to me that the evidence presented by that gentleman should absolutely have prevented any Minister from taking any action whatever. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> presented a copy of a letter. The very fact that it was a copy would have barred it from being received anywhere else. Suppose there had been a Select Committee of the Senate appointed to inquire into a matter affecting any one's interest. Would that Committee have received a copy of a letter, especially as it came from a man who was personally interested? The Select Committee would have said, " We cannot accept that ; if you wish to make us acquainted with the things contained in that letter, you must bring some substantial proof." I do not impute that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay's</inline> motives were bad. No doubt he was interested, and people who are interested are generally biased - it may be unconsciously. It is reasonable to assume that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> is also biased. In all good faith, no doubt he brought forward a copy of a letter, and that was the only thing the Minister had before him in determining to increase the valuation of the harvesters. I say that that was absolutely insufficient. </para>

                            <para>- The only evidence disclosed is to the effect that a copy of a letter was presented, and that as a result of that the Department - moved by what I regard as absolutely fair and proper considerations - indited a' letter to the Massey-Harris Company, containing certain statements. The Department said to the company, " We ask you to show us reasons why we should not increase the value of your harvesters." Here, I cannot help saying, comes in the element which I do not like about the whole transaction - the appearance of a growth of departmental lobbying. We have one of the papers marked with a note, to the effect that the letter from the Department to the Massey-Harris Company should " stand over until <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> had seen <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smart,"</inline> the Collector. It may have been a perfectly innocent interview which took place between those two persons, but it suggests the early stages of a practice of interested parties interviewing the Customs officials in a way which they should not do. Why should that letter have stood over until <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> saw <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smart?</inline></para>

                            <para>- I come back to my starting point that it is an absolute obligation on the Minister whether he is a freetrader or a protectionist to exercise to the full all the powers conferred by the section of the Act, but he ought to see that there is sufficient evidence to justify his action, and, above all things, he ought to see that when he receives evidence from persons who are distinctly interested, other parties who are also interested have an opportunity to state their case. It seems to me that the Minister, in this instance - probably with the best of motives - has been moved by evidence quite insufficient to justify the drastic action which he has taken. Above all, the information placed before the Senate goes to show that it appears that the Minister has taken that action without extending to the Massey-Harris Company the ordinary - <inline font-style="italic">T</inline> will not say courtesy ; but absolutely the right to place their view before the Department, and to bring under notice the facts that they allege in justification of the value placed bv them upon their goods. </para>

It is to be regretted that anything of that sort should be done out here at the present moment ; because just now in England, the place from which we have borrowed money, and from which we still propose to borrow money, there is a very strong prejudice against the way in which legislation is passed and administered in the Commonwealth. Numbers of cases have been put before the English public in an extremely exaggerated form, and have acted very largely to the prejudice of Australia. </para>

The reason why it seems to me to be abundantly clear that the Minister was not sure of his ground when he acted in this way is to be found in the point suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline> Under section 161 of the Customs Act, the Minister had a right to seize these goods if he considered that they were under valued, to sell them for what they could bring in the market, and to appropriate for revenue purposes the proceeds of the sale above the amount of the valuation. </para>

                            <para>- I do not intend to debate that point. T. merely say that the Customs had a right to take the machines and sell them at a profit if they could. The honorable senator's interjection accentuates my argument. If harvesters had not been sold for less than ^90, it makes it all the easier for the Customs Department to sell these machines at a profit. But the honorable senator knows as well as I do that he is not correct in his statement, and that the Customs do not dare to make a seizure because they think the goods will be sold at a loss. I will leave that point, and consider how this injustice can be remedied. I take it that that is the object of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford's</inline> motion. I am glad to know that the injustice will remedy itself under the operation of the Customs Act. We can see for ourselves on which side justice lies, provided that we take good care that the Customs place no obstacles in the way of justice being done <inline font-style="italic">y</inline> and that 1 presume honorable senators on both sides will be prepared to do. Under section 158, the owner of property which has been valued for Customs purposes in excess of the amount, which he believes he ought to pay duty on, has a right to refuse the duty demanded. That, 1 presume, will be the action taken by the Massey-Harris Company. They will refuse to pay the duty, and the Customs Department will then be obliged to sell the goods. Under these circumstances, it seems to me that the Act itself provides a remedy for the grievance which has been, brought under our notice, very properly, by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford;</inline> and we should be wasting time if we proceeded with this debate any further. </para>

                        <para>- It is all very well for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> to say that we are wasting time in proceeding with this debate, but the matter which has been brought under our notice is of considerable importance. It is not a matter of a day. Correspondence has been proceeding for the last eighteen months. I myself eighteen months ago called attention to the fa$t that the harvester was an Australian, invention, belonging to the workmen of Australia, not to any individual ; that copies of it were being bought in the Commonwealth, sent to America, and were there absolutely being, pirated, sent back to Australia, and sold at a price that the Australian workman could not compete with. </para>

                            <para>- At any rate, it was about i860. The machines sent in were not perfect in any instance, but a number of them showed such merit that it was decided to give a bonus on each. Amongst the machines was the Ridley stripper, which has absolutely formed the ground work for every similar machine subsequently invented in Australia. This- stripper is not applicable to many countries outside Australia; and it was the workmen, and not <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay, Mr. Martin,</inline> or any other employer, who invented the harvester, and brought it to its present perfection. At the present time there is a great attempt on the part of the Vanderbilts, the Standard Oil Company, and other American capitalists to exploit Australia with agricultural implements ; and I do not think that there is a single honorable senator, whether he be a free-trader or a protectionist, who is prepared to say that such a position tends to the benefit of Australian agriculturists. The Standard Oil Company,  i  who are really the harvester company, admit that they have command of 90 per cent, of the trade in agricultural implements in the United States and Canada. </para>

                            <para>- I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> makes a mistake in springing a question of this importance on the Senate. Notice of motion ought to have been given, so as to permit honorable senators to obtain the information necessary in a debate of the kind. The papers, which have been laid, not on the table of the House, but on the table of the .Library, include a number which I cannot decipher, though I am able to read the hand-writing of most people. My contention is that honorable senators ought not to be asked to come to a decision until they have fully grasped the whole of the facts. This is an Australian invention, and the workmen of Australia, if anybody, should have the benefit of it. </para>

Why does the honorable senator not copyright the chunks of wisdom of which he is the author, instead of allowing them to go freely abroad for the benefit of the community? This is not a question of the harvester alone; there has also to be considered the matter of the stump-jump plough, which no one, I think, will deny is also an Australian invention. </para>

                            <para>- I do not propose to do so, but I shall try, so far as I can, to show that the action of the Minister of Trade and Customs has been arbitrary, and in my view, unfair. I feel sure that the real valuation of imported harvesters is not ,Â£40, and the Minister of Trade and Customs, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay,</inline> should have known that it is impossible that the cost could be ,Â£65. The nature of the business which Massey - Harris, and other importers of similar goods are conducting in the Commonwealth, is such that they cannot carry on such a business without a considerable margin of profit between manufacturing and selling price. Their system carries with it a great risk, a great interest charge, and a number of other expenses which amount to a very considerable sum. The Massey-Harris Company has planted their goods throughout Australia upon a system which I hope has been profitable to themselves, but which I know has certainly been profitable to the producers. They have distributed their goods on such conditions that often in the first instance no cash at all has been received, and in many cases they have not been paid any cash for two or three years, that is in bad seasons. They have run a very great risk in a plucky manner, and 1 believe the result of their enterprise has been that we have at present a larger area of land under cultivation than we should otherwise have had. Whilst they have taken this plucky risk, and assumed a heavy burden of interest on money for several years, they have had to face also a number of bad debts. </para>

                            <para>- I contend that it is impossible to arrive at a proper valuation of these articles unless we take into consideration the manner in which they are distributed. Some honorable senators have referred to the profit that is made upon them, and they contend that the difference between Â£90 the selling price, and Â£38 the invoice price, is so large as to make it improbable that these implements could have been manufactured for Â£38. I therefore contend that the conditions under which- the goods are sold have a material bearing upon the question. The Customs Department have based their valuation of ^65 on evidence secured in a secondhand way, and apparently on the ground that these goods are invoiced elsewhere at Â£65. If it can be shown that the valuation of <inline font-style="italic">Â£6$</inline> is absolutely out of the question, in view of the charges which must be faced by those distributing the goods, that is clearly very pertinent to the question under consideration. I am certain that the Minister who has fixed the valuation at <inline font-style="italic"> Â£65</inline> must have taken these matters into consideration. I cannot see how he could do otherwise. There is another question to be considered, and that is whether we are doing justice to important firms, who, in the days gone by, have, as we believe, conducted their business in the Commonwealth under fair conditions, and to the advantage of our producers. It must be remembered that Massey-Harris and other firms have a credit and good, name to sustain, and if the authorities 6T the Customs Department, on quite insufficient evidence, assert that these films have been deliberately invoicing their goods at from 50 to 60 per cent, below their true valuation, that is a serious charge to make against firms having a character to maintain. </para>

                            <para>- There is some difference between ^29 and .Â£38; but there is a very much greater difference between .Â£38 and <inline font-style="italic"> Â£65.</inline> Altered conditions of manufacture might, in a few years, materially decrease the cost of production ; but surely altered conditions in this case cannot account for an increase in cost of production from ^38 to" ^65 ? As I have already said, the valuation of .Â£65 has been arrived at on evidence on which it would not be safe to hang a cat. I consider the matter from a business point of view. We should do what we can to create a feeling of confidence in those who do business with us. If the Massey-Harris Company have been deliberately placing their goods upon this market at a valuation of 50 per cent, below their true value, they have knowingly and deliberately robbed the Commonwealth, and for that they deserve punishment. But if, on the other hand, they have not done that, it is cowardly on the part of the Government to deliberately brand them with dishonesty without affording them an opportunity to fully meet the charge. I say that it is cowardly on the part of the Minister, and also on the part of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay.</inline> I have met <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay,</inline> and I know him to be an able man. He is not a fool by any means. He must know that these harvesters do not cost <inline font-style="italic">Â£65 to</inline> the Massey-Harris Company, as if they did they would have to increase their charges here, and could not carry on their business, as they are now doing, and have done in years gone bv. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLean,</inline> the ex-Minister of Trade and Customs, has stated that he took every means in his power to find out the actual cost of these machines when landed in this market. He applied to the Government officials in Canada for information, and although he admits a strong bias as a protectionist, he has said that he feels .that the invoice price quoted by the importers is a fair price, and he could not see his way to increase their valuation. Yet almost at a moment's notice and without any sufficient evidence, entirely different action is taken. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLean</inline> says that having read the further evidence on the subject, he still retains the opinion he previously held. If it is a question of believing <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLean</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne, I can tell who the people of New South Wales will be prepared to believe. </para>

                            <para>- That is so honestly in this case, though, perhaps, I should not have said it if the honorable senator had not brought it out. This is not a question of free-trade or protection. Personally, I am a free-trader ; but I would prefer to see the manufacture of every article in Australia placed under fair and equitable conditions in the interests of the whole of the people of the Commonwealth. We are here to do justice, and we are not here to consent to a false valuation being put upon these goods. 1. believe that the present Minister of Trade and Customs now knows that he has placed an unfair valuation upon them. Why has the honorable gentleman taken this action? I shall leave it to honorable senators to decide, because I am not allowed to draw the inference. I do ask honorable senators in future to be very careful not to allow the legislation of the Federal Parliament to be interfered with by any Minister under similar circumstances. It has been said that we might have a free-trade Minister who would do the same kind of thing. T can speak feelingly on this matter, because something similar took place in New South Wales as affecting the firm with which I am connected, and we should have lost Â£12,000 on goods on the water, if a protectionist, in the person of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton, had not come forward in a plucky manner to defend us against the New South Wales Minister of Customs of thatday. </para>

                        <para>- Some of us have been placed in a rather unfair position by this discussion being sprung upon the Senate. We have not had an opportunity to look into this very important question. To my mind, it is really a motion of want of confidence in the Minister of Trade and Customs. It has been made quite clear that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kingston,</inline> when Minister of Customs, was not a bit too strict. Sometimes I thought he was, but now I consider that he was not It appears that these harvesters were imported at an invoice price ofÂ£29. The importers now say that they did not know their value, and they have agreed to accept the value ofÂ£38 10s., plus 10 per cent, without making a protest. The company were landing their harvesters in the Argentine Republic at a value ofÂ£41, although the distance to that country from Canada was only a third of the distance to Australia. </para>

                            <para>- A man would not go to a boiler-maker, or a lawyer, or a journalist, but to the man who makes the machines. On a question relating to boots, the Minister would most likely consult a boot manufacturer. Even if men are manufacturers, they are not all liars. I have no doubt that some honest men can be found amongst manufacturers as well as amongst importers. The manufacturers could not be very much worse than the Massey-Harris  Company. It was also insinuated that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> has a factory at Ballarat. This very unworthy insinuation was intended as a reflection upon the Prime Minister, who represents that city. The honorable senator who made the comment did not know what he was talking about, for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay's</inline> biggest factory is at Braybrook, about eight miles from Melbourne, where his head office is. At all events, this discussion has done some 'good. It has opened the eyes of the public to what they have to pay for imported articles. We have heard that these harvesters have been invoiced atÂ£29, and sold to the public atÂ£89. Those of us who were not "in the know," have been called upon to discuss this question at a great disadvantage. Other honorable senators, knowing that it was to be raised, have been reading the documents in the Library. The Minister said that it was only five minutes before the Senate met that he was made acquainted with the intention of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford.</inline> I shall vote against the motion which, I repeat, is really one of want of confidence in the Minister of Trade and Customs. This is, I think a very serious accusation to make against that honorable gentleman, and this is not the place to make it in. If he has been wrongly advised, he will have to put up with the consequences. I presume that the importers have aremedy. </para>

Although <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy,</inline> as a business man, has estimated (he fair invoice price of these machines at betweenÂ£40andÂ£50, yet the Massey-Harris Company have been invoicing them atÂ£29, and did not open their lips when the value was increased by the late Minister toÂ£3810s.

                            <para>- I do not admit anything. I do not want any favours to be granted to anybody, but when it becomes a question of favour, if it ever does, a man is to be commended for favoring his own countryman rather than the foreigner. In the estimation of honorable senators opposite, it is a heinous crime for any man to be guilty of such an extraordinary thing as looking with favour on the manufacturer in his own country. The Minister of Trade and Customs took action which was absolutely essential to carry out the law. What are the facts? For a very considerable time harvesters were being imported at an invoice price ofÂ£29, and sold from one end of Australia to the other at Â£90. That is an extraordinary state of affairs. If these people can get Â£90 for their harvesters they should not object to pay duty on an invoice price ofÂ£65, and to take a very reasonable profit. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> states that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> and other colonial manufacturers sell their harvesters at the same price. Undoubtedly they do, but they do not contend that theirs cost them onlyÂ£29, whereas the foreign manufacturers do, and claim that it is a very fair value. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> says that the machines cannot be manufactured for less than from Â£60 toÂ£65. He does not pretend that they can be manufactured forÂ£29. </para>

It has been urged by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould,</inline> and others on his side, that if the Minister were justified in taking this step he should have instituted a prosecution against the men who were formerly sending in these machines at an invoice value of <inline font-style="italic">Â£29.</inline> because they were guilty of fraud. Why did not their own pet Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLean,</inline> take that course when he raised the invoice price from <inline font-style="italic">Â£29</inline> toÂ£3810s. ? Not one word did they say about his action, but as soon as a Minister comes in, who is not of their particular colour, they seize every opportunity to trv to heap obloquy upon him. What has he done? He has simply exercised the powers with which he was invested by Parliament for the protection of Australian manufacturers. </para>

                            <para>- I take it that as the Tariff was, to a certain extent, protectionist in its nature and incidence, the power was also given to the Minister for the purpose of seeing that the Australian manufacturer was not imposed upon by unfair competition. What is the evidence on which the Minister has acted ? It is said by honorable senators opposite that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLean,</inline> when Minister, was justified in increasing the invoice price. But they seem to have forgotten that a considerable amount of evidence has been gathered since <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLean</inline> left office. Is not the present Minister of Trade and Customs justified in dealing with the facts placed before him, just as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLean</inline> was? Evidently not, according to honorable senators opposite. A Minister who is not in a Government which they support is to be tied hand and foot, but a Minister belonging to their Government is allowed to do as he pleases. What does the evidence show? Can we have better evidence than the statements of the firms themselves? Here is a letter written by the Massey-Harris Company to a gentleman at Milan, in Italy - </para>

                        <para>We are in receipt of your favour of 1st inst., and are sending, under separate cover, copy of our English catalogue giving description of stripper-harvester. We have sold large numbers of this machine in Australia and South America. As you no doubt understand, this machine can only be used in warm, dry climates where the grain is ready to be threshed before or as soon as it is cut. So far, we have not introduced them in Europe, as, unless in the extreme south, we are doubtful if the climatic conditions would <inline font-style="italic">be</inline> suitable. We have, however, arranged for two or three to be tried this year in Algeria and Tunis, and there is also one at present on the way from the works for Italy. Messrs. DelPeloPardi and Co. have arranged for it to be tried in June next in the southern part of Italy. If you are interested in this machine, and would care to be present at these trials, we shall be pleased to advise you later as to exact date when they will take place. The machine is manufactured in two sizes, viz.,4Â½ comb and 5 comb. Prices would be as follows : -4Â½ comb stripper-harvester complete,Â£65; 5 comb ditto, Â£67; delivered in cases c.i.f., Genoa or Naples. </para>

                    <para>Can anything be plainer than that? Remember that the Minister was entitled to take their own valuation, plus 10 per cent. But the Minister's decision was that the machine should be valued at <inline font-style="italic">Â£65,</inline> including the 10 per cent. He has accepted a lower valuation than the firm itself put upon the machine, although theÂ£65 was their price quoted for delivery at a place -where the freight would be considerably less than to Australia. What could we have which more amply justifies the Minister's action, than the fact that the firm itself valued the machine for delivery in another part of the world at exactly the price at which it is valued by the Customs for duty in Australia? I approve of what the Minister has done, and I shall also vote against the motion, because I believe that it is a veiled attempt to thrust a dagger into the present Government by honorable senators opposite. If we were to have a discussion of this nature on so important a matter, it should have been on a proper occasion, and not on a motion for the adjournment of the Senate. An honorable senator who desired to go into the subject fully could not do so in the limited time at his disposal, when the Senate is considering such a motion. For my own part, I believe that if the Minister were to pursue his inquires with regard to other imports of a similar nature, he would find cause to justify him in taking equally drastic action with' regard to some other goods. I trust that the Customs authorities will be particularly vigilant in future to see that the revenue is not defrauded, and that Australian manufacturers are not subjected to unfair competition from people who have no conscience at all when they are sending goods to this country. </para>

                        <para>- I am glad that this opportunity has been afforded to place before the public of Australia the true position with respect to the action of the Minister of Trade and Customs. We have heard to-day that the Minister took evidence from one side only. But it is clear that he had evidence from the importers, which showed him that the harvesters had previously been undervalued for Customs purposes. The evidence from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford'</inline> s side was that the value wasÂ£38 10s. That was found to be absolutely unreliable. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles</inline> put the matter very clearly when he said, in justifying the action of the Minister in obtaining evidence, that he would not go to a boot-maker if he wanted to know the value of a clock, nor would <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> go to a carpenter to find out the value of lifeboat soap. He would go to a soapmaker or to a washerwoman. That is what the Minister did. He went to the people who knew something about the manufacture of this class of machinery. </para>

                            <para>- Has the Minister no judgment of his own? Is all the wisdom of Australia to be found in the admirable noddle of the honorable senator? Does he think that no one else has any judgment in this country but himself and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford?</inline> Let us inquire what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> did. According to his own admission, when he heard about this matter he hurried off in a secret manner - not telling any honorable senator what he was going to do - to the representative of the Massey-Harris Company, in Sydney. I do not know whether the meeting took place in the dusk of the evening, or whether it was quite dark. Certainly, the honorable senator did not advertise the fact. When he came to Melbourne he hurried off in an equally secret manner to the representative of the Massey-Harris Company in this city. Then he comes to the Senate, and talks about taking one-sided evidence from interested parties. Why did not <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> give <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles, Senator Trenwith,</inline> and myself, who are pronounced protectionists, fair warning that he intended to bring this matter forward? We could have gone to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay,</inline> or to James Martin and Company, or to some other manufacturer, or to the Massey-Harris Company to get information of a similar character. But he has sprung the whole affair on us. I gather, from the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> and from other honorable senators opposite, that in their opinion the Minister should have taken the same course of action with respect to these machines as he took with respect to some Japanese fancy goods that were suspected to be undervalued. But there is a vast difference between seizing a quantity of fancy good's of that, description and seizing machinery like harvesters. Fancy goods can be sold anywhere at very little cost; but machinery and articles of high value require agencies in different parts of the country for their sale. </para>

But if the Minister does not take action under section 161,. the aggrieved company, as has been pointed, out, can take action under section 158. If the Government are compelled to take these goods they will also have to be prepared to distribute them all over the country and. be in a position to get a proper price for them - something like the price that the Massey-Harris Company and other machine manufacturers obtain. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> wishes to force the Government into that position I am with him all the time. Then the Government will be able to make as. handsome a profit as any importing company can do now. Did the Government seize the fish in the recent fish prosecution ? I should think not. But, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> has said, whoever is Minister of Trade and Customs is subject to the advice of the officers! acting under him, and if those officers think that the Commonwealth is going to make a good bargain, or do a right thing in following a certain course of action, the Minister would be very foolish in not taking their advice. I should like to point out to those who think they are striking a blow at the Minister of Trade and Customs that they are making a very great mistake. They are not striking at the Minister but at the Comptroller of Customs,. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Wollaston.</inline> All over Australia, the integrity, the ability, and the honesty of that gentleman is recognised, and neither <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford, Senator Gray,</inline> nor any one else will be prepared to throw doubts upon his good qualities. </para>

He said to-day that the evidence would not hang the leader of the Government, and then he added, in his nice manner, " not that he did anything to deserve hanging." That is the way with people who pretend they are going to do you a service, but who give you a slap on the ear, and then suggest that you take castor oil to cure the hurt. I do not appreciate tactics of that description ; and, in my opinion, there is just as much honesty on this side of the House as on the other. I believe the Minister of Trade and Customs is acting in the interests of the revenue, and of the people of Australia;: and I, like other honorable senators, will certainly oppose the motion., </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator PULSFORD</inline>(New South Wales). - I should like to say a few words in reply. It has been suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> that I desire to depreciate the services of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Wollaston</inline> ; but I can assure honorable senators that I have no such thought or intent. If honorable senators will refer to a statement which I made some time ago, when dealing with Customs matters, they will find that I there expressed a very high opinion of that gentleman.

                            <para>- I should be quite willing to trust <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Wollaston</inline> to deal with any matter pertaining to myself, always providing I was satisfied that he was fully seised of all the facts. Honorable senators, who have gone through the departmental papers, cannot fail to see that those from the hands of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Wollaston</inline> have been written under great pressure; and it is impossible for a man to be Comptroller of Customs with a Tariff such as we possess, and not to have the greatest demands made upon his time and thought. I am certain that if any man in Australia is sick of the very name of harvester, it is <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Wollaston,</inline> I was verv) careful in introducing the motion, to bring my remarks up to the point at which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLean,</inline> the late Minister, fixed the duty on a basis of Â£38. Since that time, the letter already referred to has been received from somebody in Italy, and on that letter the whole of the action has been taken. I also pointed out that the local manufacturers were consulted, but that, although a letter was drafted to the Massey-Harris Company, asking them to show cause why the assessment should not be raised, the letter was never sent. The first time the Massey-Harris Company knew of the assessment being raised was when they received a letter informing them that in future duty would have to be paid on a valuation of Â£65 ; yet during several weeks preceding the officers of Customs had been in consultation with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay.</inline> That is neither English nor Australian justice. The Massey-Harris Company ought to have been afforded an, opportunity to give evidence, or make a statement, just as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> was able to do ; and I am sure every honorable senator will agree with me in that view. We have heard some very remarkable statements this afternoon about the price of these harvesters. One or two honorable senators have talked about Americans and attempts to ruin the Australian trade ; and yet, in the same breath, they have contended that extraordinary prices are obtained for imported harvesters. If those high prices have been obtained, the local manufacturers are not being unfairly competed with or having their businesses ruined. There is not a word of evidence that any attempt is being made by the Massey-Harris Company to use their great advantages for the purpose of ruining the local manufacturers. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> has several times interjected that imported harvesters are sold at Â£90; and I dare say some have been disposed of at that figure ; but the ordinary price is, I believe, Â£81. No doubt, when those implements have to go to far distant places, say, in Western Australia, where railway freights are heavy, the price may run up to Â£90. </para>

                            <para>- The implements are sold generally at Â£81, and the return, after the canvassers' commission is deducted, is reduced to Â£73. Then the firm keep a staff of men, whose duty it is to travel and keep the machines in order, and teach farmers how to use them. I believe that the firm undertake to keep the machines in order during the whole of one season ; and that, of course, involves considerable expense. The machines which are quoted as costing Â£38, reached, under the old duty, a price of Â£58; and the difference between that amount and Â£73 is only Â£15. When interest on delayed payments, and expenditure involved in sending inspectors and instructors around the country, are considered, there is very little margin. Everything goes to show that it would have been only right and proper to call on the Massey-Harris Company for a full and explicit statement before this wonderful change was made in the duty - a change so drastic as to amount to a charge of fraud, which ought not to be disposed of in the way adopted by the Minister. I again suggest that the facts show reason why the decision of the </para>

I have given notice, so that the continuity of the evidence on the question may be preserved. </para>

                        <para>- One of the reasons stated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> for his motion has induced me to rise to speak to it. I do not think that it is desirable that, if, for any reason, the inquiry of a Select Committee has been stopped, the evidence adduced before it should be made a record of the Senate in the shape of any report. While I am desirous, as are probably other honorable senators, of seeing this evidence, I suggest that it might, be laid on the table without necessarily appearing as an official record of the Senate. </para>

                                <para>- I will say "some honorable senators opposite." The Senate appointed a Select Committee last year to inquire into the question of the tobacco monopoly. The Committee sat upon a number of occasions, took a great deal of evidence, and incurred a considerable amount of expense, and now some honorable senators opposite wish to consign the whole of that evidence to the waste-paper basket, so that the money expended and the information which has been obtained may be wholly lost. </para>

I will put the matter in this way : Suppose any company appoints a number of men to look into a particular matter, and make a report upon it, and suppose those men incur expense, and secure evidence, and the company after all this refuses to receive a report from them, what should we say of the business capacity of those managing the company? That is just the position in which some honorable senators opposite are endeavouring to place the Senate, and it isa ridiculous position, but the opposition to the purpose of this motion is so keen, and so intense, that they are prepared to lose no opportunity to do what may prove detrimental to it. </para>

A committee re-appointed cannot report the evidence taken before the committee in the previous session, except as a paper in the appendix. To obviate that difficulty, on the 29th April, 1852, the House ordered the evidence of the previous session to' be laid before them ; and, when presented, it was referred to the committee, with leave to report it forthwith. </para>

                    <para>That, in accordance with standing order No. 234, fÂ°r proceedings on the Bill, intituled " A Bill for an Act relating to Assurance on the Lives of Children by Life. Assurance Companies or Societies," which were interrupted by the prorogation of Parliament on Thursday, the 15th day of December, 1904, be resumed at the stage then reached in connexion with the said " Bill ; and that the Bill be read a second time this day week. 1 may say that the Bill had reached the first-reading stage in the Senate, but, of course, in another place, it had passed through all its stages. The advantage of reinstating the Bill, which I think is almost non-contentious, although very useful, is that, if it be passed here without amendment, it need not go back to another place. I take it that there will be no opposition to the motion. ' </para>

                            <para>- This seems to me a most extraordinary motion to bring before the Senate. I think that the mover and his seconder, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson,</inline> might give us a definition of what "Home Rule for Ireland" means. There are several definitions of the term ; some portion of a definition perhaps we can approve of. I understand that it means that Ireland wishes to be a sovereign State, to have a Parliament practically independent of the Imperial Parliament, and to control its own Customs. I am not sure that many do not wish that it shall control even its own army. </para>

                            <para>- England is, .historically, merely an appanage of the Scottish Crown. If there is anything known to the world it is that ever since the famine - I think in 1848 - Ireland has had every reasonable treatment from the United Kingdom. The Irish are not troubled with an established church. They enjoy just the same freedom as we do. They have more liberal land laws than other parts of the United Kingdom. Speaking as the executor of a person who left property there, I can give an idea of what the Irish land laws are. For ten years no rent was received from the tenants. When I found that the Irish lawyers were afraid of their agents being shot, I employed' my brother - a Writer to the Signet in Edinburgh - to go over and employ new lawyers. We sent down a man with twenty-five persons, and as soon as we went to get our rent the priest came forward and offered to mediate with the tenants, who had not paid rent for ten years to a widow in Australia. What was done? They offered to pay us four years' rent, but we have not been paid yet, as the money is still in the Irish Courts. Had we waited two years more before we made the demand, the Irish land laws are so liberal that the tenants could have kept the land for all time. That is an illustration of what the Irish land laws are. It is said that the Irish are not treated liberally. Why, in the British </para>

                            <para>- -The late Lord Beaconsfield, when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Disraeli,</inline> did not believe that there was any cure but one for Irish grievances. " Sink Ireland! under the Atlantic Ocean for twenty-four hours," lie said, " and then we would have no more Irish grievances." I do not agree with his plan. I have a great respect for the Irish people. Three years ago I went to Ireland, which is a most beautiful land, and I admired the people immensely. I may mention that I am married to an Irish lady, and I have good reason to speak well of the Irish ; but much as I love them, I think they are much better off as they, are than they would be under any kind of Home Rule. </para>

                            <para>- It will be seen that the north is going ahead. It is the people of that part who do not want separation from the old country. Am I not right in saying that it is the people in the least prosperous part of Ireland who want to have control of their own Customs, and to introduce a protectionist policy when the policy of the Home country is free-trade? I would recommend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dawson</inline> to withdraw the motion. It would be a dignified thing to do. I believe that no one would be more annoyed than himself if the Home authorities were to question' our right to treat the kanakas as we are doing. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, but I do not see any use in our expressing an opinion. What good would it do? It would only cause a row here. We are a peaceful community, and we can settle our differences without interfering with Ireland or any other place. I' maintain that Ireland has no reason to say that she is not well treated by Great Britain, however she may have been treated in days gone by. What other country but Great Britain would allow such awfully disloyal organs to appear as do appear in Ireland? They can please themselves about what they write. They write in a most disloyal way, and speak with disrespect of .the Royal family. For a long while I have thought that it would be a good thing if the Royal family had a Royal residence in Ireland. I hope that His Majesty the King will go over to Ireland as often as he goes to Scotland, or more often. I do not intend to speak much longer, because I hear that an honorable senator is prepared to follow rae. I am glad to think that some person here is able to take up the cudgels for Great Britain. I happen to belong to the part of Great Britain north of the Tweed, and I abhor a, person who is disloyal to the great country we belong to. There is no other country in this world in which such great personal liberty is enjoyed, and I am very much afraid that if Home Rule were granted, it would be a case of God help Ireland. </para>

It is not to be supposed that the 100,000 Irishmen in Glasgow are to be considered as representing Scotland. A few persons can make a great noise, as we all know, and people living at a great distance are apt to think that those persons are very much more important than they really are. The Irish would be about the finest people in the world if they could only be taught to be loyal to the British Government. Somehow or other, a spirit of disloyalty runs through a portion of the land - I do not understand why it does. </para>

When I was down in Killarney three years ago, in going over the mountains, my wife was riding one horse and my daughter was riding 'another. Noticing that the owner of the horses was very cheerful, I said to him, " Are you very loyal down here"? "Oh," he said, " We are very loyal to one another, sir." I laughed, because I thought it was a very good answer. </para>

                                <para>- So I say. But I hold strong opinions, and have held them, for a considerable time. I do not hold them in consequence of theory or book reading, because I have been quite long, enough in the world- to have gained experience and knowledge of my own. Book reading is very good sometimes, and it helps the knowledge which one acquires, otherwise. But it is in consequence of my own experience that I am speaking now. Twenty years ago, as honorable senators can find if they look up the records of the Victorian Legislative Assembly, I happened to second a motion proposed by thelate <inline font-weight="bold">Sir James</inline> Patterson. At that time I represented Rodney. The motion was one censuring certain members of Parliament who had referred to Ireland under the British Crown as being " Under the hoof of a foreign- despotism." That is strong language it will be admitted. That was the sentence to which we took exception. I have always been on the side of loyalty to the throne and of the flag - that flag under which all countries and peoples on the face of this earth have been treated with the greatest consideration, moderation,! and fairness. </para>

                                <para>- The kind of persons who shed blood in past times would probably shed blood again if they were brought up in the same way. At any rate, the British people are the best judges of this matter, and let it be left to them. Another reason for opposing the motion - and I want this to be noted publicly - is that whenever England is in any trouble, whether it is in the Transvaal, or in the Orange Free State, or elsewhere, 90 per cent, of the advocates of Home Rule are opposed to England. I know that this is a serious statement to make, but I make it without any anger. I can prove to honorable senators opposite that I have befriended' Roman Catholics and Protestants alike. I have made no distinctions. </para>

                                <para>- One of my reasons for my present attitude is that when the English flag was in trouble in the Transvaal, not one of the Home Rulers came to the rescue. When the people of Ireland unanimously appeal for Home Rule - that is for an extension of municipal government, or anything of that kind - I shall not have the remotest objection to see their wishes gratified. But it is not within our province to express ourselves in favour of Ireland receiving full1 political self-government independent of England. As I said at the beginning of my remarks, I do not see what political1 grievances the people of Ireland have, considering that they are so largely overrepresented in the British Parliament. </para>

                                <para>- I say that Ireland has political and other advantages that Scotland never enjoyed, as is shown by the land legislation, the educational expenditure, and the number of Irish representatives in the Imperial Parliament. Although Scotland should have 105 members in the House of Commons, the representation is only seventy-two, whereas Ireland, which, on a population basis, is entitled to sixty-seven or sixty-eight members, has 105. I do not desire to prevent a vote being taken on this motion, but I am convinced that, if a poll were taken in Australia tomorrow, the people of the Commonwealth would declare that England, Ireland, and Scotland ought to be left to attend to their own political affairs, especially as it has been found that all Home Rulers are against the English flag when it is in danger. The latter is a statement I am able to- prove, or otherwise I should not make it. ' . </para>

I have suffered a great deal because of my honest convictions, but surely I am entitled to express those convictions' on the floor of this Senate. I have no desire to be extreme, and I only wish I could destroy all aggressiveness on either side. I must say, however, that when it is even attempted to hold meetings on the other side in Victoria, those meetings are not allowed to proceed. Some reference has been made to Dill Mackay. </para>

                        <para>- Of course, I may be mistaken ; but I am clear in my own mind that I put the motion and declared it carried before the honorable and learned senator rose. That is what I thought then, and what I think now. The honorable and learned senator will see that this is a casein, which the debate takes place on the question as a whole, and I put the motion in two parts, deeming it to be what is called a complicated question. 11,or example, some honorable senators might wish to resume the debate on some other day than Wednesday next, but the whole proceedings on the motion, except the voting, are concluded. </para>
