          <para>- Recently I informed the honorable senator that the Auditor-General is a servant of the Parliament, not of the Ministry. He does not take any command from the Ministry, he is in a perfectly independent position. I have inquired why his report for the past financial year has not been issued. I have been informed that it is because, in some cases, the necessary vouchers to show the accuracy of the statements issued by the Treasurer have not been forthcoming in time. There is very great trouble at times in getting necessary vouchers from outlying parts of the Commonwealth. Although the Treasurer bases his statement on what he believes to be accurate information, still that information has not been checked with the necessary documents. The Auditor- General waits for the whole of the documents to come in from the Departments, and if one Department is a little lax in that regard, it tends to delay the compilation of his report. I know that the Treasurer has done all that he possibly could to expedite the supply of the necessary information to the Auditor-General, so as to enable his report to be prepared. Everything is being done on the part of the Ministry to help this officer. I fear, however, that if the Treasurer delivers his Budget early in the financial year, say, in July or August, it will be impossible for the Auditor- General to be supplied with the information in time to enable him to make a report which will be available for, at all events, the House of Representatives, when the Estimates are being dealt with. At the same time, I think that matters might be expedited, so that before the Senate considers the schedule to the Appropriation Bill, the report may be furnished. We will do all we possibly can next year to secure the accomplishment of that very important object. </para>

            <para>- It appears to me to be rubbish, and unless strong reasons are given why such a course should be adopted, I shall oppose it. It amounts to duplicating audit staffs all over the Commonwealth. In each State there is an Auditor-General, with his staff who, previous to Federation, audited the accounts of the Post Office, Customs Department, and the Defence Department. Why should they not continue to do that work under the supervision of the Commonwealth AuditorGeneral ? It is all very well for the Federal Auditor-General to say that he must have his own staff. I have no doubt that he would like that to be the case. So, probably, should we. But we must have some regard) to the financial conditions of the States. We might very well proceed under the present system, at least for some time longer. The Minister of Defence says that it would not be possible to present the Auditor-General&#39;s annual report in. July or August, when the Treasurer makes his financial statement. No one expects that. Probably the vouchers do not come in before the end of July. Certainly a month would not be sufficient for the preparation of the report. But this is not the month of August. We are now in November. The report, in all likelihood, will not be ready until December, when it will be of no earthly use to us in considering the schedule to the Appropriation Bill. One of the principal objects in appointing the Auditor-General was to insure correctness in the payments, and that the law was obeyed in all particulars. But under the present system we might as well have no such official. I trust that an effort will be made to hurry up the report in future. </para>

          <para>- In connexion with the vote for the Government Printing Office, I wish to bring under the notice of the Government a matter which requires serious consideration. The Commonwealth has purchased a number of linotype machines for use in the Government Printing Office. Operators have been engaged to work them. So far, those men have been given no definite status. The rights of other public servants are conserved by the Public Service Act and the regulations. But these men, who fill responsible positions, have no status whatever. They may be dismissed at a moment&#39;s notice. In addition to that, they are doing their work at lower rates of pay than are received by men who are doing a similar class of work outside. Furthermore, they do not know, according to the statement of the Treasurer, whether they are working for the State or for the Commonwealth. On the nth of September, the operators, very properly desiring a settlement of the questions relating to them; formed a deputation, which was introduced by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tudor,</inline> a member of the House of . Representatives to the Commonwealth Treasurer. In the case which they placed before the Treasurer, they asked first- </para>

        <para class="block">Let me point out that these are lower rates than are currently paid in outside offices to men who are doing the same class of work.

            <para>- If . these men are not allowed to have the same rights as other Commonwealth servants in other respects, why should they be compelled to accept the disabilities under which other officers labour? If they accept the disabilities, undoubtedly they should enjoy the rights as well. If I work in a mine or in a factory, after I have completed my eight hours&#39; work, overtime payment begins, if I am expected to work longer. During the recent long sittings of the House of Representatives, these linotype operators had to work fourteen hours a day. It was most arduous work. But they only received the ordinary pay. There is nothing under the present system to prevent their being employed forty-two hours at a stretch before they receive any overtime payment. It should be remembered that the operators are only paid time and a quarter, when any overtime is allowed to them, whereas in accordance with the ordinary rate prevailing in the trade they should be paid at the rate of time and a half. </para>

            <para>- Is there any logical or equitable reason why a distinction should be made between the engineer in charge of the machines and the men who work, the machines? The memorandum goes on to state that the advertisement resulted in the engagement of a number of operators from the various States of the Commonwealth, who threw up positions to accept these situations in Melbourne. The majority of the operators, thinking that the rate of pay and other conditions would be at least as good as those in private establishments, resigned good positions elsewhere, but found on their arrival in Melbourne that the wages paid was the minimum! in Victoria, namely,  &#163;3  10s. for both day and night, or &#163;1 per week less than formerly. I do not desire the Commonwealth to pay extravagant salaries, but the Commonwealth ought to be a model employer. Instead of grinding men down to the lowest wages paid in any office in which these &#39;machines, are used, the treatment accorded ought to be at least as good as that of men in outside employment.  .1  have already pointed out that the hours of work are often cruelly long, extending on several occasions to fourteen hours a day, while the payment for overtime does not commence until the week&#39;s work of forty-two hours has been completed. After repeated requests to the Government Printer for the former rate of wages of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;4</inline> ros., an increase of 10s. extra per week to those employed on night work was granted. As a matter of fact, I know of linotype operators, who are no more skilled, and do no more arduous work than those in the Commonwealth employ, but who earn as much as  &#163;7  and <inline font-style="italic">&#163;8</inline> per week. There has been some dispute between the operators and the Government Printer as to the quantity of work done. The specified work, according to the advertisements, was at least  6,000  per hour of long primer corrected matter ; and those honorable senators who are acquainted with the printing trade will know what that means. The linotype operators assert that they constantly set up more than  6,000  per hour. As I pointed out, these linotype machines are about the best in Australia, but, nevertheless, it is more difficult to set matter on them than to do ordinary newspaper work. The Commonwealth machines contain italic founts, and small capital founts, and the printing has to be done in a superior style, these founts being used for the emphasis of certain portions of the matter. This sort of work is seldom called for in a newspaper office, or if it is, those who do it are paid double. In the Commonwealth service, however, this work is not counted as anything; extra ; and I specially emphasize the point that the linotype operators are afforded no opportunity to verify the amount of work with which they are credited. A very moderate request made by them is that they shall be furnished with proof slips of everything they set, so that they may be able to check the Government Printer&#39;s compulation ; but they have not been able to obtain that fair concession. The operators assert, and I know from my own experience, that one column of matter in the Government printing office is equal to a column and a half of ordinary newspaper work. I do not know, and I do not believe that .the operators know, what the system of computation is, but they assert that the average output per man at the present time is nearer  7,000  than the  stimulated 6,000  per hour. That being so, the Government Printer can have no complaint as to the work done ; but I repeat that it is only fair that the men should have an opportunity of verifying the computation. In all outside establishments, it is customary to pay overtime after .the completion of the ordinary day&#39;s work of seven and a half hours, or whatever time is agreed upon. But no later than a week or so ago, the men in the Government Printing Office were called upon to work fourteen hours at a stretch without receiving any special consideration. There is no doubt that their desire to be given the status of public servants in the employ of the Commonwealth, is reasonable. The <inline font-style="italic">engineer</inline> in charge of the machines is a Commonwealth servant, under the Public Service Commissioner, and his salary of &#163;285 is set down in the Estimates now under consideration. Is there any reason why this officer should be under our sole control, and have an assured position, while the linotype operators, who work the machines, are left in their present anomalous position? It must not be forgotten that if the operators occasionally work for the State Government, the engineer in charge of the machines must do the same. I do not desire to press the matter, but merely to ventilate what is undoubtedly a grievance. I hope the Minister and the Government will take this matter into consideration, and do a tardy act of justice to men who sacrificed good positions in order to find employment under the Commonwealth. Unless our public servants are fairly treated, and satisfied with their employment, we shall not be able to obtain the efficient service we desire. No men have more arduous or more important duties to perform than these linotype operators, who must possess high technical skill; and they ought to get the same justice that is accorded to every employe of the Commonwealth. </para>

          <para>- I do not profess to have the expert knowledge of the printing trade possessed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens,</inline> nor to have been aware of the facts of this matter; but it must be admitted that the honorable senator has made out a fair case for inquiry in connexion with this very mixed Department. The advertisement which appeared in the Western Australian papers was worded as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> has said, and the first batch of men who came from that State to Melbourne understood that they were to be permanent employes under the Commonwealth. I notice that in the sub-division, where the provision is made for the salary of the engineer, State servants, such as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brain</inline> and the State classified staff of the Government Printing Office,&#34; are also provided for, there being an allowance to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brain,</inline> and a sum set down as the proportion of the salaries of the classified staff. Why are allowances made to some, and direct salaries paid to others? A sum of &#163;4,300 is set down for compositors, and I do not see why they should be so described, and yet the proportion of salaries spoken of as allowances. It seems quite clear that we do recognise the compositors and linotype operators as our special employes, and the other people as extraordinary employes, for whom allowances ought to be provided. The Minister might explain the system under which joint Commonwealth and State printing is done. How is the cost of work done by a linotype operator for the State separated from that done for the Commonwealth? What allowance, if any, do we receive from the State for work done for the State by our men, and what do we pay the State for work done for us by State officers? If we do not employ State men, do we receive anything on account of wear and tear of valuable linotype machines employed in doing State work? I think if the Minister makes inquiries he will find that the men referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> are employed by the Commonwealth, and if they are employed under the conditions stated by the honorable senator, something should be done in the matter. </para>

We found that we could make use of their machines and their type, and we also purchased some new machines for ourselves. It was decided that we could work conjointly, in such a manner that it would not be necessary for the Commonwealth to have a separate printing establishment and staff. The men employed do work partly for the Commonwealth and partly for the State Government, andthe method employed is that a computation is made under a system suggested by the Victorian Government Printer, by which computers keep a record of the amount of work performed by each man. The Commonwealth pays for the work performed for it, and the State for all work performed for the State. These men cannot be called Commonwealth officers, and so long as the present system continues, they cannot be classified as members of the Commonwealth Public Service. We cannot fix salaries and rates of pay for them, except in conjunction with the State authorities. </para>

            <para>- We pay an allowance for the work done by States compositors, and the State has to pay for work done for it by men who are chiefly employed on Commonwealth work. I repeat that these men cannot be called Commonwealth servants, as they are only partially employed by the Commonwealth. They are being paid in accordance with the practice followed all along in the Victorian Printing Department. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> has said that some men outside make as much as <inline font-style="italic">&#163;7</inline> or  &#163;8  per week, but those men would be working on piece, and I do not know what hours they would have to work. The honorable senator also said that men in the Government Printing Office of Victoria are frequently employed for as long as fourteen hours in a day. I find on inquiry that whilst a man may in one day work fourteen hours, twelve hours, or eleven hours, no man works for more than fortytwo hours per week without receiving extra pay. </para>

            <para>- I am informed that time-and-a-quarter is the overtime rate which has always been paid in the Victorian Government Printing Office, and that rate is fixed because of the very large number of holidays which these men get in the year. They get fourteen holidays in the year, for which they are paid. As the office is worked under a joint arrangement, we cannot increase the pay of these men, or bring them under Commonwealth Public Service conditions, without the consent of the State Government. The only solution  of  the difficulty, if there is one, is for the Commonwealth to have its own Government Printing Office. That is a question which, of course, must be looked into by the Minister in charge of the Printing Department of the Commonweal th. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator GIVENS</inline>(Queensland).- The Minister of Defence is trying to blind us to the real facts of the case. He has endeavoured to relieve the Commonwealth Government of responsibility, on the ground that the authority governing the printing office is a divided one. We are told that nothing can be done, because these men are not working in our own office. Let me point out that some of the State printers are occasionally employed on Commonwealth work, but that does not&#39; affect the right of the State Government to deal with them in any way they think advisable. On the other hand, the men working our machines, and engaged principally in our work may, although&#39; occasionally thev do some work for the State Government, be treated by us in any way we think fair and desirable. These men are just as&#39; much employed by the Commonwealth as is the engineer in charge of the linotype machines, and they are just as much entitled to have their salaries set down in these Estimates. As a matter of fact. the State Government does not own any linotype machines at all. Those machines are ours, and the services of our operators are occasionally placed at the disposal of the State Government. I have no fault to find on that score, but that is no reason why our employes should not be treated in s.ny way we deem fair without reference to the State Government in the matter. Why did we not get a separate building ibo. which to place our linotype machines, or a separate building for our officers ? </para>

            <para>- Very well, to that extent, we can make <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brain</inline> a Commonwealth officer, no matter whose coffers the money goes into. He can look after our employes, and see that they do justice to the Commonwealth&#39;, and that the Commonwealth does justice to them. In the letter from <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest, which I quoted, and which will go into <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> verbatim, he stated, I suppose after consultation with&#39; the Government Printer, that arrangements were being made by which any necessity for long hours and; overtime would be obviated. He said that arrangements were being made which would do away very largely, if not entirely, with the necessity of working these long hours and with overtime. But, as a matter of fact, no less than a week or so ago the men had longer hours to work than they ever had before ; and occasionally, while Parliament -is sitting, and its members desire to get <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> as soon as possible, especially towards the week-end, the men are necessarily compelled to work very long hours. I must say, in fairness to the men, that they do not complain in that regard. They are willing to stretch a point in order that the work may be done, and they so express themselves. But they should not be asked to work for less than they would get for doing similar work outside. I hope that the Parliament will insist upon the men being given a fair, deal, as undoubtedly they follow the most arduous occupation which is pursued by any servant of the Commonwealth. Before the vote is passed I desire to ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> whether the men were told bv <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest that arrangements were being made by which they would not have to work excessive overtime, or excessively long hours, and, if so, whether that promise has not and cannot be carried out? </para>

          <para>-  I quite realize the difficulty in which the Government are placed. We are,  so to speak, carrying on our printing operations in the building, and, to a very large extent, with the machinery of the State ; and it is apparent that our employes cannot be put on a proper footing until the Commonwealth has its own printing office. It is, however, within the power of the Commonwealth Parliament to alter the rule with regard to overtime. In the statements read by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens,</inline> it is mentioned that very often the men work fourteen hours at a stretch, but are not entitled to overtime until they have completed a full week of forty-two hours. I interjected when the honorable senator was speaking that that was the rule right throughout the service. To my mind, it is a very bad rule, which ought to be altered at the very earliest opportunity. It was framed by men who either Have had no experience as workmen, or who, if they have had such experience, nave entirely forgotten the fact, because if there is one thing, which is more clearly recognised by the average worker than any other it is that his working power is, practicallyspeaking, his earning capital, and that if it is to be conserved to him it must not be rushed out in periods of lengthened work. For that reason, the eight-hours&#39; limit has been established in a very large number of occupations by the practice of the country; and when a man is asked to expend more of his labour in one day than he thinks is admitted by the rule to be proper, then the ordinary custom is to pay him at overtime rate. I claim that when these men work more than eight hours in any day they ought to be so paid. </para>

            <para>- Many public servants get twelve months&#39; leave of ab sence on full pay, and why does not the honorable senator vote against that rule? He will ignore extravagance in any Department of the Commonwealth, but when it comes down to the working man he is out with his cheese-paring implement, and is ready to pare every time. The Commonwealth ought to be a fair employer, and when it asks men to work more than eight hours at astretch it ought to be prepared to pay at an extra rate for the excess time. I know that a similar arrangement holds good in other Departments of the Public Service, but it has been made by men who have no sympathy with the workers, or who, if they have passed through the mill, have forgotten the fact, and are now the petty tyrants of the working man.

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator GIVENS</inline>(Queensland).- The information which has just been furnished by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> is satisfactory, because it helps to clear up the question. I have no desire to interfere with the working of the State Printing Department, and now that it is clearly understood, on the authority of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford,</inline> that these men are not Commonwealth employes, it will be satisfactory to the men themselves, inasmuch as they will know to whom to look for the redress of any grievance. In the circumstances, I do not intend to press the matter any further, though I think it would be well within the right of the Commonwealth to ask the State Government to see that the men who are partly employed on Commonwealth work should not be required to work unduly long hours1, or to submit to any worse conditions than those to which they would be subjected in doing similar work outside. If it should cost the Commonwealth a little more to get its work done in a satisfactory way, I feel sure that it would be willing to pay the additional sum. I intend to vote for the request in order to express my disapproval of men being compelled to work fourteen hours at a stretch without getting paid for overtime. </para>

          <para>- I do not see that it is possible for me to support the request moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> because the men mentioned by the Minister are employed in the first place by the State, and are doing work for the State. If, however, they do work for the Commonwealth, they are paid by the Commonwealth at the same rates as are paid by the State. If we determine that they are not paid sufficient for the work done for the Commonwealth, the only practical course is for the Commonwealth to establish its own. printing office and fix its own rates of remuneration. I suppose that when operators are doing work both for the Commonwealth and State, the time when they are employed on Commonwealth work is taken, and they are paid for that time at the same rate as when they are doing work for the State. If we say that they shall be paid more for doing Commonwealth work, the position which we shall create will be that the men in the Government Printing Office doing work for the Commonwealth must&#34; be paid in accordance with one standard of wages, whilst the men doing work for the State must be paid at a totally different rate. There is no way out of the difficulty unless Parliament is prepared to establish a Commonwealth printing office. In connexion with all contract work for the Commonwealth, a rate is fixed below which men cannot be employed. I take it that there is a rate below which the men working in the Government Printing Office who are doing Commonwealth work cannot be paid. I cannot support the request, because I do not see that any benefit can accrue from it. </para>

I am anxious that the good name of the Commonwealth shall be maintained, and that we shall not be written down as a lot of sweaters. If the men are compelled to work ten hours consecutively on Commonwealth work, they should be paid overtime rates for the extra two and a half hours. </para>

          <para>-  I desire to direct attention to an anomaly in connexion with the clerks employed in the Defence Department. Some seventy-nine of these clerks are under the control of the Public Service Board, and enjoy all the rights and privileges conferred by the Public Service Act;but there are about thirty-seven, known as military clerks, who are simply under the control of the Minister of Defence, and outside the jurisdiction of the Public Service Commissioner. </para>

            <para>- Some of these military clerks, although they have been in the service from fifteen to twenty years, are denied the benefits of classification, and the right of transfer, and promotion to positions in other Departments. The singular fact is that the naval clerks, the clerks in the Ordnance Department, the Pay Office, and the Rifle Clubs Office, are all under the Public Service Act. Under the circumstances, the military clerks feel their position to be rather insecure. While they have the advantage of permanent employment, they have no permanent classification; and this in itself is unsatisfactory. I believe that the regulations drawn up by the late Minister of Defence make no provision for increments or promotion in the case of these clerks. Although (their work has been classified by the inspector of the Public Service Board as equal, I believe, to second-class work, which, under the Public Service Act, carries salaries of from , &#163;350 to&#163;400 a year, the maximum salary for the military clerks is &#163;260. It has been urged that these clerks must be kept apart, in order that discipline may be observed. That contention is hardly sound when we remember the other seventy-nine clerks, who are under the Public Service Act. and who are doing preciselysimilar work in the Defence Department. If it be a matter of discipline, they may readily be dealt with under, I think, section 73 of the Act. I am simply making these representations from what I have heard, and inquiries I have made; and all I can do is to ask the Minister to direct his attention to the matter, and see that no injustice is done. These men are denied privileges enjoyed by others with whom they work side by side; and, considering the length of service of many of them, it is only right that their case should receive due consideration. </para>

          <para>. - This matter has been considered by the Government, and by the Military Board, and it is felt by both that these men have just claims to be classified as ordinary public servants. At present, I believe that the highest salary that these military clerks may receive is between&#163;250 and , &#163;300 per annum, and their only chance of promotion is within their own little circle. The wider range of the Commonwealth Service is closed to them, and they naturally desire to be placed under the Public Service Commissioner, and receive the ordinary benefits of classification and increments. </para>

            <para>- I believe that is unfortunately so. The Military Board has recommended, and I have approved of the recommendation, that these clerks be classified ; and now, I believe, the only trouble is with the Public Service Commissioner, who objects to them being placed under him. There is also some little difficulty created by the Defence Act, a section of which provides that certain employes, like these clerks, shall not become members of the Public Service. That provision was, I fancy, inserted for some reason by MajorGeneral Hutton. Then it appears that the ordinary public servants do not wish that these clerks shall be brought under the Public Service Act, onthe ground that their inclusion will decrease their own chances of promotion. The selfishness of human nature crops up in all the walks of life. </para>

          <para>- With a view to expedite business, I have hitherto refrained from speaking on these Estimates. I rise now, however, to present an aspect of the matter under discussion, which, so far as I know, no honorable senator has yet dealt with. Prior to Federation these military clerks were, in some of the States, under the State Public Service Acts, while in other States they were military clerks pure and simple. Under the circumstances, a great injustice is done to the military clerks who formerly enjoyed all the privileges conferred by the States Public Service Acts. I suggest to the Minister that, in view of the section of the Constitution which provides that all the accruing rights of transferred public servants shall be conserved, some of these military clerks may justly hold that their present position is unconstitutional. In Western Australia, for instance, these military clerks were previously classified as civil servants, while in Victoria they were regarded as military clerks. If my contention be correct, the clerks of the Defence Department in Western Australia have a strong claim to be brought under the Commonwealth Public Service Act. An important consideration is that the Commandants of all the States have recommended that these military clerks should be given the benefit of the Public Sen-ice Act, and this ought to materially assist us in forming an opinion. Many of the military clerks do more important work, and yet are paid less, than the clerks with whom they work side by side. I am quite sure the Minister does not agree with&#34; that. I might mention that the figures quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> do not agree with those supplied to me. I have been informed that the number of officers who are described as public servants is 116, and the number described as military clerks thirty-nine, but that is perhaps unimportant. The fact that in some of the States before Federation these military clerks were under the State Public Service Acts; ,and the further fact that the States Commandants have reported in favour of the proposed change should be sufficient to induce the Minister to agree to it. </para>

          <para>- In discussing the first item of the Defence Department, I desire to state the position in which I find myself in dealing with the various items of expenditure in these Estimates. The total amount we are asked to vote for naval defence is  &#163;47,609  ; and the total amount for military defence, &#163;523,285. I am not sure whether I am alone in the view I take, but I have no hesitation in saying that if the votes were transposed, and we were asked to vote &#163;523,285 for naval defence, and  &#163;47,609  for military defence, I should do so with a great deal of pleasure. </para>

            <para>- I intended to do so, but I allowed the opportunity to pass. I do not propose to make a second-reading speech now, but I take advantage of the opportunity to say, that in my opinion our expenditure on defence is absolutely topsyturvey. I do not forget that we pay an annual subsidy of &#163;200,000 towards the Australian Squadron. I thoroughly approve of that. But I am not satisfied with an expenditure of &#163;200,000 as a perpetual subsidy to the British Nav:. I am very strongly of the opinion that no time should be lost in forming an Australian Navy. I recognise that no effort has been made by the present, or any preceding Government of the Commonwealth in this direction. My chief regret in connexion with the Department of Defence is that we are doing nothing in the direction of acquiring a Navy of our own. </para>

            <para>- I do not think that the formation of an Australian Navy would in any way| interfere with that unity which I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> is most desirable. If we were asked by the Imperial authorities to contribute more than &#163;200,000 towards the Australian Squadron, it is possible that I should vote for it, because I am firmly of opinion that such a contribution must be maintained. But I should not stop there. I say, let us contribute that subsidy of &#163;200,000, and if necessary, a larger subsidy, but do not let us remain idle, and content to acquiesce  in that position. We should decide, and soon, I think, first of all, what is the total amount the Commonwealth can afford to expend in its defence. If we decide that we cannot go beyond our present total, which is about &#163;800,000 per annum, then when the opportunity arises I shall make such an effort as I can, and I hope I shall receive assistance, to secure that a very large proportion of that &#163;800,000, which is now, in my opinion, very unwisely spent upon military defence, shall be devoted to naval defence. </para>

            <para>- I agree with the honorable senator, and, in fact, I very much doubt whether we are getting like fair value for the expenditure of &#163;47,609. What I should like would be to see the Commonwealth getting good value, and there is nothing to prevent it, for an expenditure of &#163;500,000 a year on naval defence. In my opinion, if it is necessary, in order to do so, we should take something off the amount set down in the military Estimates. If the Federal Parliament were prepared to expend &#163;1,500,000 per annum on defence, I should very gladly do what I could to secure an annual  expendi- ture  of not less than &#163;500,000 on naval defence. If we were to spend &#163;400,000 or &#163;500,000 on naval defence, it would not be very long before the Commonwealth might own a very efficient, though a small fleet, of first-class cruisers. </para>

            <para>- With all respect to the honorable senator, I think we could get first-class cruisers for something under &#163;1,000,000 each. Even if they were to cost &#163;1, 000,000, by making a determined effort, we could gradually acquire a small fleet of first-class cruisers, homogeneous in equipment, and especially in speed. I venture to say that if we had five, or even three, first-class armoured cruisers, we should be in a better position to join with the Empire in maintaining our defence, than we should be if we spent &#163;50,000,000- </para>

            <para>- I do not think that it is. When I consider the absolute waste of money on military defence, I do not think we should sit down and say that that is all we can do. I doubt whether any member of the Committee believes that the Commonwealth is getting anything like fair value for its enormous military expenditure, and I further doubt whether any honorable senator has any degree of confidence whatever in the defence which the expenditure on our present military forces would provide for the Commonwealth in time of need. In discussing defence matters, we are all agreed that our first line of defence is naval defence. </para>

I never voted for the subsidy with any such idea in my mind. I thought it the right thing to do, but I always hoped and believed that it would be supplemented by our own efforts.

            <para>- I am not dealing with that aspect of the question at present, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie will agree that, much as we spend in that direction, we have spent practically nothing in endeavouring to prepare men for naval service. What opportunity is afforded for the training of naval cadets under our defence scheme ? Is there any ? I should be delighted if an opportunity were afforded to enable, say, 1,000 boys to begin training every year as naval cadets in Australia, and if training ships and training schools were provided to meet such a demand. Instead of being prepared to train 1,000 boys for the Navy, as we ought to be. I find that we have made no preparation for the training of even fifty of the youths who might desire to enter the defence service of the Commonwealth by joining the Navy. I am aware that the Minister is giving the whole question of defence his serious consideration. The honorable senator has not yet formulated a policy, and I do not blame him for that; but if, when he comes to formulate that policy, he can give the Commonwealth some opportunity to direct its energy and spend its money in naval defence, be will do more for the real defence of Australia, and for the preservation of our self-respect, than all previous Ministers of Defence have done since the Commonwealth has been established. I hope that some other honorable senators will join with me in the expression of these opinions. I recognise that most members of the Committee, and most public men in another place and elsewhere, in discussing the question of defence, spend all their time in finding fault with existing arrangements, and offering suggestions which have all to do with military matters, and never touch upon naval defence. An agitation is got up, which I regret, as to whether Australia should contribute to the Imperial Squadron, but when that dispute has been settled-- </para>

            <para>- When that question is settled the whole question of naval defence disappears. We have heard objections to the amount of the subsidy; but if we decided no longer to vote &#163;200,000 as an annual contribution towards the Imperial Navy, in my opinion it would become absolutely incumbent upon honorable senators who desire to bring about such a state of things to insist that we should spend at least &#163;2,000,000 per annum to provide an adequate naval defence for the Commonwealth. What I suggest is that, availing ourselves of the magnificent protection we get by the subsidy of &#163;200,000 paid towards the Australian Squadron, we should build up a fleet of our own, even though we may have to do so gradually. As a preliminary, and as a practical suggestion, I urge the Minister of Defence to say whether he cannot make a daring innovation and propose some adequate provision for the training of Australians for naval service. </para>

I hope that in the recess the Minister of Defence will settle down to the real work of formulating a defence scheme, and that he will keep in mind the method of naval defence which, of course, would entail a larger expenditure, and the further encouragement of rifle shooting, so that we shall have a larger reserve to draw upon for our land defence, and at a lesser expense than we now pay. </para>

            <para>- Well, if it does, it will meet the views of myself and, I believe, of a large number of the people of Australia. According to the Minister, our militia cost &#163;8 6s. a head, and our riflemen only &#163;1 10s. 3d. a head. The discrepancy between the expenditure per head is so great, when contrasted with the difference between the usefulness of a rifleman and a militiaman, as to deserve serious consideration from the Minister. </para>

            <para>- We have 30,000 riflemen at an individual cost of &#163;1 10s. 3d. per year, but we have room for 60,000 riflemen. The Commonwealth will have to rely upon the riflemen as the great base of its land force. It was all very well for in Imperial officer like Major-General Hutton to lay down as the basic principle to guide the Commonwealth -in defence matters, that it should not have so many volunteers, but should convert them &#39;into militia. The central thought in his mind was that in Australia there should be raised a certain, number of men upon whom the Commonwealth could call for service in foreign parts. But that idea is not shared by a great majority of the people of Australia. When he mentioned in a report that it was necessary for us to convert our volunteers into militia in order to maintain a higher standard of efficiency, what did he mean? The higher standard of efficiency, I take it, is a higher standard of usefulness. Does the Minister of Defence agree with MajorGeneral Hutton that the higher standard of efficiency should be efficiency in drill, without efficiency in rifle shooting? Let us recall the work which was done by the Boers without that higher standard of efficiency to which Major-General Hutton alluded. </para>

            <para>- Yes, but nothing like military training in the sense in which Major-General Hutton used the term. Their higher standard of efficiency was efficiency in rifle shooting. In the South African war, a small army was able to resist an enormous military power, simply by reason of their higher standard of efficiency in rifle shooting. The back-bone of the land portion of our defence system should1 be efficiency in rifle shooting. That should go hand in hand with an immediate and a very large increase &#39;in the number of cadets. It is simply absurd that Australia should have only 9.000 cadets, while New Zealand has 12.000. Let us either sweep away the cadet system, or put it on a more practical and common-sense basis. I believe that the Minister will give his serious attention to this point, but I am sorry to see that he is not in sympathy with the view held bv a number of us that there should be universal compulsory training to a certain extent. I think that any able-bodied man who is not willing to contribute a little towards the defence of his country or to qualify himself to render some service when called upon is not worthy of the rights of citizenship. </para>

            <para>- It would not be necessary to -incur that expenditure at the start. Either let us have no defence or let us have a defence system on a commonsense and sound basis. No doubt we have nol: \-et arrived at that stage when we should be able financially to place a rifle with ammunition in the hands of every ablebodied man. But I believe that public opinion is gradually coming round to that view, and that eventually we shall have compulsory universal training for a short period, and1 compulsory military service. The principle that the Commonwealth can call upon every able-bodied citizen is, now embodied in the Defence Act. </para>

            <para>- I am sorry to hear the Minister enunciate that view, because I believe that they will when they see that the cost of defending the country or of always being in a position to defend it when necessary will be far less under that system than under the present system. What are we getting from the present system? As the Minister knows, we are getting very little indeed. We have to expend nearly &#163;600,000 on the Military Forces, and  &#163;47,000  on the Naval Forces, which, I think, is entirely inadequate - quite irrespective of the naval subsidy which we pay to the Imperial Government. </para>

            <para>- It is for us to speak in general terms, and for the Minister to carry out the details. He is a thoroughly practical man, and will, I believe, agree to a large extent with what I am saying. We should also go as far as we possibly can with the view which Captain Creswell has laid down in regard to our naval defence. It is satisfactory to think that if his view be adopted a large portion of the work could be done in Australia. I am informed that we could build a certain portion of the torpedoes and torpedo destroyers. </para>

            <para>- This fact shows that a very careful watch should be kept on the Department, and on the work of every officer. It is evident that there are officers who have very unsatisfactory ideas as to our financial position, and who do not recognise that we have only a certain amount of money to spend, and that it is better to spent it on rifles and ammunition than on accoutrements, which are not absolutely required. I trust that the Minister of Defence will, during the recess, devote himself to the task of formulating a complete defence scheme for Australia, and will keep in &#39; mind the two important points to which I have referred. We must certainly incur heavier expenditure in relation to our Naval Forces. I hope that he will adopt, to a very large extent, Captain Creswell&#39;s recommendations in that respect, and that, in relation to the land forces, he will see whether he cannot reduce still further the expenditure on our present military system. He should increase the expenditure for rifle shooting by purchasing more ammunition, and giving greater encouragement to able-bodied young fellows to perfect themselves in the art. It is worth while to consider whether it would not be a great incentive to our ablebodied men to practise rifle-shooting to hold out as a prize a certain sum of money for sending a team of rifle shots annually either to Great Britain or America to compete against the world&#39;s best rifle shots. I have always been in favour of that course. </para>

            <para>- The ambition of every good cricketer is to get into an Australian Eleven. We should make it the ultimate goal of every good rifle shot to get into a team to compete against the world. The expenditure would be very small in comparison with the gain. I have had a great deal to do with rifle shooting in my time. It is a fascinating pastime, but an expensive one for a working man with a small salary. If there was a chance of riflemen eventually reaching the goal of their ambition, and being able to compete against the best shots in the world, that would be a great stimulus to them. It is worth the while of the Minister to consider the point. </para>

            <para>- I have always held that view, and therefore I was glad to hear the honorable senator advocate it as he did. When we were dis-&#34; cussing the naval agreement during the first administration of the Commonwealth, I said that the proportionate allocation of money between our three lines of defence was altogether wrong. On our first line of defence, which is the sea, we are spending something like &#163;247,000. On the second line of defence, forts and mines, we are spending something like &#163;100,000. On our third line of defence, the land forces, we spend something like &#163;500,000. That third line of defence will only become operative in case the British Navy is defeated or evaded, and a large military force is able to land in Australia. </para>

            <para>- And it has to be remembered that the British Army has to garrison distant territories. We are not sp situated. I myself think that we ought to adopt the same policy as Canada has done, and devote the greater part of our money towards an Australian Naval Defence Force, which could be used in conjunction with the Imperial Navy in time of war. It goes without saying that we are absolutely dependent for our protection on the British Navy. That must be so for a great many years to come. </para>

            <para>- We should adopt tha same attitude as <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Wilfred</inline> Laurier took up at the Colonial Conference, when he said that all the money that Canada devoted to naval defence would be spent on men and ships, and not on a subsidy. If we adopt a policy somewhat on the lines of Captain Creswell&#39;s recommendations, we shall be doing something at least to prepare for local defence in a more efficient manner than is the case at present, when we have no protection at sea beyond that which we receive from the British Navy. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe</inline> has spoken about the necessity for universal military training. I am satisfied that if we adopt that system we shall absolutely negative the possibility of having a system of naval defence. Whilst in Switzerland compulsory military training is necessary, in Australia we occupy an exactly opposite position. We are surrounded by the sea, and have to look principally to naval defence. Switzerland is surrounded by military nations, and has to look solely to military defence. There could not be a stronger antithesis. </para>

            <para>- Exactly. If we adopt compulsory military training it will mean the equipment and preparation of something like 500,000 or 750,000 men. We are told by the highest authorities that it is exceedingly improbable that any attack will be made on Australia by a large military force. We should therefare have armed, say, .three-quarters of a million of men, whose  Tides  and accoutrements alone would cost  ^4,000,000  or &#163;5,000,000, and _ should thereby negative the possibility of being able te devote any considerable sum oF money to naval defence- I am quite in accord with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe</inline> when he urges that </para>

We could &#39;not have a cheaper and better service than is provided by a very large number of efficient riflemen. They provide an effective guarantee against invasion.

If our defence&#39; scheme were complete - if we had an effective scheme, effective guns, and an efficient force - it would not matter very much if foreigners knew all about it. But when our guns are obsolete - or as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> said, &#34;obsolescent&#34; - and our defence scheme is incomplete, it is foolish to point out all our deficiencies for the benefit of foreign nations. I have before me a letter from a German gentleman who. occupies a position of some importance.

          <para>In reading your Australian papers and the speakers in your Legislative Assemblies, I have&#39; for many years been struck with the frankness with which you debate your military matters. In speaking with officers of different foreign nations, I have always found that they shared my opinion. Military matters such as you debate in Parliament or in the Senate are in other countries kept dark. One only has to read <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> to know how many guns you have - if they are oi any use or not, what ammunition you have got, how your fortifications are manned, and by what class of soldiers, and so on. I think there should be a little more secrecy in the matter. A few years ago, when the war vessel called here, I. came in conversation with the Commander. Talking about Sydney Harbor, he laughingly told me that he had made a plan of Sydney Harbor, where all the details were marked. Asking him how be had been able to do this, he pointed to a bottle of champagne, and said, &#34; This is my informant.&#34; Where so many are in the secret there is no secret. A German Commander some years back told me, &#34; If only the people (in Sydney) would talk less of their fortifications, and their military matters, it would be a great deal  pleasanter  to stay there. We do not want to spyaround, but they make me sometimes feel like a spy in honouring me with their unwarrantable confidence.&#34; I write you this to show how other people think about such matters, and you may be sure that all such communications are taken notice of. In this matter you might learn a little from </para>

        <para>Germany. The German army can remodel their artillery or their infantry entirely without a soul knowing it. It is an Historical fact that in 1866 the German artillery had proved insufficient, and that the French artillery was far superior. The enmity of France grew more threatening after 66 than ever before, so that it was. clear that eventually a war was unavoidable. When the Luxemberg incident took place, Germany would have gone to war at once had it not been that the remodelling of the artillery had not been carried through at the time (1867),and took two more years to get completed. This was kept so secret that the German artillery in 1870, when the war broke out, was a relevation to the French. </para>
        <para class="block">I know that there is great difficulty in keeping such matters secret - that, in fact, it is practically impossible to do so. When we are discussing certain forts - when we show exactly the condition of the guns and the mountings, the quantity of ammunition available, and give the most minute details - we do something which no nation in the world does. </para>

Especially when we have defences which are admittedly insufficient - when, at strategic points of Australia, there are guns which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> states are obsolete or practically useless - it is inadvisable to make the facts public. Before the defences are described publicly, they ought to be in a fair state of efficiency, and raised to a standard which would render us safe from ordinary attack. </para>

I should not speak at all now, if it were not for the fact that our practical Minister of Defence keeps making statements which are detrimental to the views embodied in my motion, and which are utterly contrary to the fact, and show that he is really out of touch with modern thought on the question of universal training and military defences generally.

            <para>- I should like to be allowed to speak for five minutes without interruption. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> says that universal military training is an academic question ; but I would remind him that in every leading newspaper and magazine, the subject is dealt with by military men and other experts all over the world. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> regards this as an academic question, all I can say is that his ignorance of what is going on in the world is colossal. The next contention of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> is that there is no need to have any compulsion in connexion with a national cadet force - that boys are so glad to have their caps braided and wear a uniform, that they will all join. That idea is absolutely contrary to fact. There has been a cadet system in Australia for ten or twelve years, and there are now only 10,000 cadets, as against 12,000 in New Zealand. </para>

            <para>- I doubt whether any State Acts are necessary.It might be advisable, perhaps, to have Acts laying down certain conditions ; but, in my opinion, everything could be accomplished by conference and regulation. There would, of course, have to be payments made for the drill instruction given, and for the use of the schools. </para>

            <para>- They will allow the use of the schools and the schoolmasters in return, I am sure, for a mere pittance for the extra trouble and service. Having told us about the satisfactory conference in Sydney, the Minister, in the next breath, tells us that the system cannot be carried out without Acts of Parliament. The most extraordinary of all the arguments used by the Minister is contained in his question, &#34;Do you mean to say that the Commonwealth will stand compulsory service without payment?&#34; Here is colossal ignorance ! Itis recognised in all Englishspeaking communities, and by the highest authorities, that in return for the enormous advantages and privileges of citizenship - free education, free libraries, parks, amusements, and so forth - every boy, youth, and man ought to help to defend their country. But that sacred duty cannot be performed without some slight modicum of training. Just as we compel boys and girls to learn to read and write, lest their ignorance should prove a &#34;danger to the community, we ought to provide some universal and national system of training every youth to assist in defending the country. In asking that question, the Minister shows that he does not understand the foundation principle on which this universal training rests ; and I am afraid that if he keeps repeating that fallacy it will &#34;catch on.&#34; I find that throughout the Empire whenever a man desires to oppose universal training he endeavours to show that it means conscription. </para>

            <para>- I did not quite catch the honorable senator!&#39; <inline font-style="italic">s\</inline> last interjection. If the Minister and I cannot agree on this question, we must agree to differ, though I cannot understand the Minister of Defence daring to deny such a principle. Does the Minister contend that the young men of Australia owe no duty to their country in this matter? Does the Minister contend that to compel the young men to turn out in time of need is unjust or any violation of rights? As a fact, it is&#39; in accordance with our, rights to demand this service which they owe. I should have liked to have read to this practical Minister of Defence an article which recently appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">United Service Gazette.</inline> That article pointed out the folly of the action of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest in opposing <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watson</inline> and the members of the Labour Government when they desired to support <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> in his proposal for some system of universal training. The article is scatching  and sarcastic when it points out&#34; how <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest opposed, on the one hand, such a system, and, on the other, assisted in passing an Act compelling men .to serve, some of whom have never held a rifle, or know anything of shooting - compelling these men to turn out in time of war, to be shot down like partridges. What is the use of calling out men who do not know one end of the rifle from the other? What is the use of imposing the duty of service, when not one hour or one shilling is devoted to training. </para>

            <para>- The honorable senator is quite right. Some of the generals who took part said that the war would have &#39;been over in twelve months if the men sent had understood military drill, and, to some extent, had been trained soldiers. We have all read the lamentable accounts of men being drilled hourly and daily for months before they could be sent into the field in South Africa. Some of them had to be helped on to their horses, and almost held there, in order to serve as mounted men. It has been declared over and over again by experts that if England had had any form of universal training, or compulsory rifle shooting, which Lord Roberts suggests, the Boer war would never have been a fact. It was simply the knowledge of the weakness of the British Army, and of the power of a handful of skilful shots against thousands of men accustomed to city streets, but foreign to the veldt, which brought about the conflict in South Africa. With all this knowledge, information, and experience the Minister sits here, and says,: &#34; It is academic. The people would never stand it. I am going to have cadets, but I will not have a compulsory system.&#34; We compel our youths to learn reading and writing, but we are not to have compulsion for physical training and drill. I believe, and&#39; I can give good authority for the belief, that the English nation is losing ground physically and mentally, because there is no di&#39;scipline in the national life. </para>

            <para>- Because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> is a giant himself, and has begotten six sons, each of whom is over six feet high, he says that everything is well, and the race is. not degenerating. I tell the honorable senator that it is. &#34; I tell him, further, that a great deal of the increasing prosperity of the German nation is owing to the system they have adopted. The discipline, order, and method they have followed are recognised as the causes of their physical and commercial prosperity. I do not propose to sit here and be dragged two or three generations behind the age. The Minister will find in the <inline font-style="italic">Times,</inline> the <inline font-style="italic">Spectator,</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Fortnightly Review</inline> article after article dealing with this important matter. If the youths growing up in our midst are left without any discipline or order in their lives, what can we expect. They will know that they may have to become soldiers some day, and yet no attempt is to be made to drill them, or teach them anything of the &#39;business. I am astoni&#39;shed at the statement made by the Minister, and if, in the sYstem of defence which he formulates, he includes any of the fallacies which we have recently heard from him, I shall be found opposing it to the very uttermost. The despatch which has come from England is, <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> my opinion, a most important document. I have listened with very great astonishment to honorable senators talking about Australian navies and&#39; Australian naval defence, and I have wondered why Ministers have never conferred with the Imperial Government, and could produce no despatches from the Imperial authorities on this important subject. It4 appears now that they have received one such despatch. It is produced rather late in the day, but, so far as I can gather, it is. dead against our having an Australian Navy. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> has said that he believes in Australia starting a Navy of its own, and in his very next sentence the honorable senator added : &#34;To act with the Imperial Navy.&#34; </para>

            <para>- This is not the time to start an Australian Navy. If we were to make a beginning now, in ten years&#39; time everything we had got together would have to be displaced for something newer and better. If honorable senators will read <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford&#39;s</inline> speech on the second reading of the Bill, they will find that it bristles with statements about obsolete, and partially obsolete, guns, which have had to be set aside as useless. If we set to work now to create an Australian Navy, in ten years&#39; time we may find that torpedo boats and destroyers are considered of little value, and that submarine vessels will have supplanted them. If we once launch out upon expenditure in the creation of an Australia Navy, we shall not know where it will end. As I understand the despatch which has been received from the Imperial Defence Committee, which comprises the most experienced naval experts of whom the world knows, and men who have been considering questions of defence for the last thirty years, the statement is made that immediately torpedo boats and destroyers are necessary for the defence of Australia, they will be supplied, but that if anything happens to change the aspect of affairs in Europe, the whole matter will require to be reconsidered, and therefore, in the opinion of the naval au thorities the time is not ripe when we should be called upon to expend over &#163;2,000,000 in providing torpedo boats and destroyers for Australian defence. I should not dare to express my own opinion in this matter, but I am quoting the highest authority we  can get. The Imperial Defence Committee certainly know quite as much about this subject as does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons.</inline> Although I have the very greatest respect for that honorable senator&#39;s gigantic intellect, it is impossible that he can always be right. If we have the Imperial Defence Committee to advise us in these matters, one cannot be blamed for quoting their opinion. </para>

            <para>- With our enormous coast-line, it would be impossible to have torpedo boats and destroyers so stationed as to be able to defend every part of it. If the time ever came when the Imperial Navy would be beaten, and the Empire had to give up the command of the sea, with 20,000 trained men here, Australia might be taken from us. But if we had a citizen army and an armed people in Australia, with 100,000 trained men, and 200,000 or 300,000 rifles, I do not know that any power would be able to take possession of this country. With these remarks I shall resume my seat ; but I shall have something further to say on the subject when my motion comes before the Senate </para>

            <para>- To a country like Great Britain an expenditure of &#163;1,000,000 per annum is nothing. But we are all workers here, or ought to be, and 1 am entirely opposed to the idea of universal armament. I think we had better develop our country, and make whatever defence we have provided for as efficient as possible. There is no reason why we should undertake immense expenditure for this purpose. Let honorable senators consider what some other countries do. Take, for instance, a country like Denmark, in themidst of warlike neighbours, and we shall find that in some respects our expenditure on defence exceeds that of Denmark. Is it rational that we should rush into the enormous expenditure proposed ? </para>

            <para>- I object to knock off any sum unless it is clearly shown that it is advisable to do so. 1 think that we should rely upon the old country for the defence of our coast. The recent information we have is that Great Britain is now going to spend a large sum of money in making the straits which lead to Eastern Australia, almost impregnable. That circumstance, taken in conjunction with the recently formed alliance, will provide ample security for this country, if we make our Military Forces efficient. I trust that honorable senators will not be led away by this craze for enormous expenditure upon defence. It is ridiculous in a country like this. Let us consider what Canada and the United States have done. Until within recent years, when the United States has taken a part in European politics, they practically had no Navy at all. </para>

            <para>- Great Britain, as no doubt the honorable senator is aware, has been garrisoning certain places in Canada, until the Canadian Government are ready to undertake the work for themselves. It is all the more credit to them if they like to undertake that work, but we are not in a position to do what is proposed at the present time. If we allow the Government to develop a proper military force on economical lines, that is all we can expect of them. In the circumstances, I think that all we can do is to allow ourselves to be guided by the expert advisers of the Government, and accept the Government proposal. </para>

On behalf of New South Wales, we are asked to vote &#163;6,357 for 2,490 volunteers, &#163;3,500 for cadet corps, and &#163;13,405 for rifle clubs. So far as direct payments are concerned - that is, without taking into account the miscellaneous expenditure - I find that the volunteers cost about &#163;2 a head. That is very cheap. </para>

            <para>- The estimated expenditure on the Military Forces this year is &#163;591,431, and for that amount we are only able to put into the field a small army of 24,000 men. What the Government ought to do is to abolish the militia system, and to largely increase the expenditure on the volunteer force. We must have a small permanent force which will be the nucleus of our Army ; but the paid contingent ought to be abolished. It is impossible to run a partially-paid force and a volunteer force side by side. That is abundantly proved by the small number of volunteers we have. Year by year, the number of men who join the volunteers is decreasing. If mv suggestion be adopted, I calculate that for the same expenditure we ought to be able to put nearly 50,000 men into the field. </para>

            <para>- We are trying to inculcate into the minds of the people of Australia the desirability of every man taking his share in its defence. What greater sacrifice could any man make for his country than to offer up his life for it, whether he be rich or poor? The rich man ought to pay more in taxation than the poor man, and if he does not he should be called upon to do so. But to attempt to make invidious distinctions between the rich and the poor in the matter of defence seems to me to be altogether beyond the question. We have had a great deal of loose general talk on the subject of defence, but no attempt, so far as I know, has yet been made to lay down any definite lines upon which the Government ought to proceed. I have a proposition to make, and it is that the militia force should be disbanded, not now, but within a certain time, and that the money which is now spent thereon should be diverted&#39; to the maintenance of the volunteer system. In order that I may ascertain the mind of the Committee on the subject, I propose to move that the item of &#163;45,726 for the militia, or partly-paid force, be reduced by &#163;1. </para>

            <para>- Yes. Some point should be given to the discussions which take place here from time to time. We have had a great deal of talk on naval and military defence, but we never seem to make any progress towards the adoption of a definite scheme. Here is a scheme which I propose, so far as our land forces -are concerned. If the Committee approves of my idea, it will support the request which I propose to move when the general discussion is concluded. If it does not, well, I do not know whether that will be taken as an, instruction to the Government to continue the present system or not, but it will look very like it, and if it turns out to be the case, then we shall have some idea as to what the wish of honorable senators is.- </para>

          <para>- The general question of defence has been under discussion for a good while, and we have had some very interesting speeches. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> opened the discussion by advocating the establishment of an Australian Navy, and other senators seem to regard the development of the land force as being the more desirable. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> gave us an interesting speech as to the universal military training of our young people. I am entirely in favour of a citizen defence force as against a standing Army. I believe that when the call is made the people will show themselves to be ready, willing, and, I believe, capable of successfully defending Australia. I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> is advocating a course which should be taken by the Commonwealth when he presses his proposal for the universal training of our young people. But it ite a mere confusing of the issue to confound that with compulsory military service, because it is not military service at all. Whenever <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> submits a concrete proposal, I shall be found voting in favour of the universal military training of our young people, because I believe that, in addition to enabling them, when they have grown up, to be effi cient defenders of the country, it would have a valuable effect in developing their physique and promoting their health. But I do not agree with the honorable and learned senator that we should not start the nucleus of a Navy straight away. It is just as important for us to be selfreliant in the matter of naval defence as in the matter of land defence. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> was perfectly right when he urged that we should start as soon as possible the work of building up a Navy. I am ready to vote millions for our own defence when it is- necessary, and we can do it in our own way, but not a shilling in the way of tribute. That is all I wish to say on the. general question. One of the most important branches of the Defence Force is the instructional staff. The value of our forces as efficient fighting men depends largely upon the instruction given to them by that staff. Last year I moved for a return to show the status and pay of the instructional staff in The different States. Such a return was afterwards tabled. It shows some very curious anomalies. Soon after the return was tabled, a classification of the instructional officers took place; but, strange to say, although Federation had then been established for about four years, the classification was made on a State basis instead of on a Commonwealth basis, with the result that there were the most extraordinary differences in the classification and pay of officers in the different States. It is extremely difficult to understand on what basis that classification was made. The warrant and noncommissioned officers of the instructional staffs are divided into four classes - (1) warrant officers, (2) sergeants-major. (3) staff sergeants, and (4) sergeants. Take the position of the Queensland instructional officers, and compare them with their fellow officers in the other States. We find an enormous difference between the salaries paid to men belonging to the same classes in the various States. I have prepared a return, which shows the state of things exactly. It is taken from the official records, and no one can dispute its accuracy. It shows the position at a glance. The New South Wales instructional staff officers in class 1 receive ,&#163;242 16s. per annum. The same officers in Queensland receive &#163;193, showing a difference as against the Queensland officers of &#163;49 16s. In class 2, the New South Wales officers receive &#163;208 6s. 8d. ; the </para>

        <para class="block">Queensland officers receive &#163;173 7s. 6d. ; showing a difference against the Queensland officers of &#163;34 19s. 2d. In class 3, the New South Wales officers receive &#163;i73 ns. 3d. ; the Queensland officers receive &#163;364 6s. 7d. ; showing a difference as against the Queensland officers of &#163;9 3s. 8d. In class 4, the New South Wales officers receive &#163;154 I2s. id., and the Queensland officers &#163;140 3s. iod. ; &#34;showing a difference against the Queensland officers of &#163;14 8s. 3d. The instructional officers in New South Wales, Tasmania, and Western Australia all receive higher rates of pay than they do in Victoria, J South Australia, and Queensland. I have worked out the averages for the whole Commonwealth. The average for the Commonwealth in class 1 is &#163;205 is. 9d. ; the average in Queensland is &#163;193; showing a difference of &#163;12 is. 9d. as against Queensland officers. In class 2 the average for the whole Commonwealth is &#163;190 17s. ; the average in Queensland is &#163;173 7s. 6d. ; making a. difference of &#163;17 9s. 6d. against the Queensland officers. In class 3 the average for the Commonwealth is &#163;172 4s. 1 id. ; the average in Queensland is &#163;164 6s. 7d. ; showing a difference of &#163;7 18s. 4d. against the Queensland officers. In class 4 the average for the Commonwealth is &#163;149 us&#39;, iod. ; the average in Queensland is &#163;140 3s. iod. ; showing a difference of &#163;9 8s. against the Queensland officers. If the Victorian and South Australian rates of pay are compared with the average rates for the whole Commonwealth, similar differences against the officers in the two States mentioned appear. I have only worked out the figures affecting the State which I represent, because I am quite sure that honorable senators from the other States will look after their case. I want to know from the Minister of Defence why these anomalies exist. Is it because of economy? Is it because of anything that was done by the States prior to Federation? It must be remembered that the officers of the Public Service were not classified on a State basis. The whole service was classified on a Commonwealth basis. In a similar manner the officers of the instructional staff should be classified in accordance with a Commonwealth scheme. If it is said that the differences which I have shown are due to economy, I reply that I have worked the matter out to the last fraction, and the result shows that if the whole of the mem bers of the instructional staff in all the States were paid at the rate of the New South Wales instructional officers, it would not cost the Commonwealth &#163;500 more than is now paid. A miserable saving of that sort is too small to be offered as a reason for continuing the dissatisfaction that exists amongst the officers. I have here a list showing every instructional officer in every State of the Commonwealth, and the salary which he is receiving. Any honorable senator can tell at a glance by looking at this document what salary is paid to any officer. The preparation of the paper has occupied a great deal of time, and caused great trouble, but it gives valuable information in a very convenient form. I am prepared to place it at the disposal of the Minister, in order that he may be able to appreciate the position precisely. It is a &#39;remarkable fact that the salaries are higher in New South Wales, Tasmania, and in Western Australia than they are in the other States; and it is also remarkable that they are highest of all in New South Wales. That ought not to be so. When, as I have pointed out, the total amount that the Department saves by perpetuating these differences is less than &#163;500, I think I have said sufficient to convince the Committee that there is a genuine ca.use of complaint. In New South Wales, the highest paid officers in the &#39;instructional staff receive &#163;270 per annum. There isa difference of &#163;78 8s. 6d. between that and the salary paid to another instructional officer. Yet both officers belong to the same State. So that even officers, in the same class, and1 in the same State are not paid at the same rate. The position of Tasmania is peculiar in this respect. In that State, there are men in class 2 who receive on an average &#163;15 per man more than their seniors receive in class 1. Can the Minister explain that? </para>

The details are bulked in the Estimates in such a way that it is not possible to find out that such anomalies exist.

            <para>- I should like to compare the salaries paid to the military instructors with the salaries paid to the military clerks. I make bold to say that the salary of an instructional officer should be quite as large as that of a military clerk. The work of the former is, at least, equally valuable to the Commonwealth. </para>

            <para>- That is so. Instructional officers must have as much ability and training as any good clerk. It must be recognised that it is easier to get an efficient clerk than an efficient instructional officer; so that, if anything, the remuneration paid to the latter should be the higher. As it is, however, the clerk, who has not nearly such onerous and important duties, is paid the greater amount. I do not wish to weary the Minister by going fully into the details, though I have them here all set out in a most carefully prepared statement, which I believe to be accurate in every respect. Some reasonable attention ought to be paid to this matter, so as to remove the anomalies Ihave pointed out. At present there is a great deal of dissatisfaction, which cannot be of advantage to the Defence Forces, which we all desire to see placed in an efficient  state. If, however, discontent is caused by unfair and invidious treatment, we can scarcely expect that high standard of efficiency which we all regard as desirable. </para>

            <para>-Col. GOULD (New South Wales). - I am sorry I was not here during  the  second-reading debate, when I should probably have spoken at greater length than I shall have an  opporunity  to do on the present occasion. The question of defence is one of preeminent importance, as has been clearly shown by the . discussion that has taken place while the Estimates have been before us. When we bear in mind that defence was one of the foremost objects of Federation, it is seen  at  once that it is a subject to which great attention ought to be paid. While I congratulate the Minister on the candour with which he placed before us the lamentable state in which the Commonwealth stands so far as defence is concerned, I very much regret that he has not laid before us some definite scheme to remedy the many defects so plainly and distinctly pointed out. The speech of the Minister of Defence follows, in respect of its candour, the lines of that I heard delivered at a public meeting in Sydney by one of his colleagues, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ewing.</inline> I was amazed that a Minister of the Crown should deem it necessary to take the public so largely into his confidence in regard to the position of the defences. I know that when the Government come to Parliament for the purpose of obtaining money for defence purposes, ir is always regarded as necessary to give the fullest possible information, in order to induce members to grant Supplies. There is no necessity, however. to expose all our weaknesses, nor do I think that honorable senators are reasonably entitled to expect the details to be made public, unless the Minister accompanies his statements with some remedial scheme. The history of the military defences in Australia goes back a great many years  anterior to Federation. Officer after officer, brought out from time to time for the purpose of advising the different State Governments, has pointed out the necessity for granting larger sums of money, and strongly impressed upon the authorities the desirableness of having some Federal scheme of defence, under one control, instead of a separate organization in each State. Without some Federal scheme, they contended, it would be impossible for Australia, as a whole, to adequately defend herself. The first Commonwealth Govern ment endeavoured to obtain a military adviser who would be in a position to give an opinion as to the be3t method to defend Australia*, and they chose Major-General Hutton. That gentleman did not come here as an unknown man, or as one whose opinions on defence matters were not pretty well known. While <inline font-weight="bold">Major- General</inline> Hutton was in command in New South Wales, some years before, he was engaged with the representatives of other States in conferences on the defence question, and ait that particular time he pointed out how necessary it was to evolve some better scheme ; and when he assumed control under the Commonwealth he expressed a very similar opinion. How was that opinion received? Major-General Hutton came here with a great reputation, as an officer well fitted to be the trusted adviser of the Government and the Commonwealth generally. But no sooner had his scheme been placed before Parliament than steps were taken, not simply to economize in a reasonable way, but practically to destroy the efficacy of the proposals by reducing by large sums the money that Parliament was asked to provide. In that I think- a very great mistake was made. We should have been better off had we accepted Major-General Hutton&#39;s advice, so far as concerns the re-organization and strengthening of. the Defence Forces. </para>

            <para>.- That was not essential to the carrying out of the scheme proposed. Major-General Hutton pointed out that we ought to have a force of 30,000 or 40,000 - I speak from memory - on a war footing; but he was invited to reduce his Estimates by something like &#163;170,000. That, of course, interfered very materially with his scheme. Exception has been taken to Major-General Hutton&#39;s suggestion that we should rely largely on the partially-paid or militia forces. I know there &#39;is an idea amongst people in Australia that we ought to rely absolutely on what is called a citizen, or purely  volunteer, force. When the Defence Forces were originally started, we relied on citizen soldiery - a purely volunteer force. That force, however, was not found to work as efficiently as it ought to have done. I know that in New South Wales, at any rate, a law was subsequently carried to provide that, after a certain length of service, the members of the force should be entitled to a grant of land. That plan was not found to work satisfactorily, and then was instituted the partially-paid system. I can speak of these matters from personal knowledge, because I have served in the forces of New South Wales under the purely volunteer system, under the system of land grants, and under the partially-paid system. From my experience I am convinced - and in this I am sure I shall be corroborated by others who have seen similar service - that the partiallypaid system is unquestionably the best. The reason is not far to seek. In the first place there is much better chance of discipline being observed, and of the work being carried out on&#39; military lines. With a purely volunteer force, many men join, I admit, for the love of soldiering; but, at the same time, they are not imbued with the same idea of discipline which attaches to a man who recognises the fact that he is paid for certain services to the State. It is perfectly true that it is the duty of every citizen to do what he can to defend the State. At the same time it is, unfortunately, found that volunteers will not accept the restrictions which they deem unnecessary, but which are really imposed in order to make them more efficient ; and the result is a lack of discipline. It is necessary that men should give a certain amount of time to training in order to acquire the necessary efficiency. With a purely volunteer system men find that they cannot afford the time, and, therefore, drop out of the ranks ; butwith a partially-paid system, it is regarded as a duty to attend the drills, just in the same way as a man in any other walk of life considers it his duty to do the work for which he is paid. In the northern districts of New South Wales a number of men in the ranks of the partially-paid forces are recruited from the coal mines. These men regard the day that is set apart for training as one on which they will earn a little more money, and this is a consideration, in addition to the patriotic motives which induced them to join. It was always made a rule, in that district, in order to suit the convenience of these men, to have the drills-, as far as practicable, on pay-day, and the consequence was that the companies were always full, and the men attentive to discipline, and prepared to do the work for which they were paid. I feel convinced that if the partially-paid forces are abolished, and we return to a purely volunteer system, we shall experience a failure which will compel us to retrace our steps. </para>

            <para>.- That is so: though I admit that the payment there is small. Wherever there is conscription there is payment; and it would be almost impossible to get men to assent to a system under which they received no payment for the services rendered. If we introduced conscription into the Commonwealth what would be the effect? I presume that we should find some 500,000 able-bodied men in the Commonwealth, and we should require a very great number of drill instructors to train them. The honorable senator will admit that those instructors would have to be paid. </para>

            <para>.- I think that the two terms in effect mean the same thing. If we take the system proposed, and assume that there will be, say, 500,000 men in the Commonwealth capable of bearing arms, we should require an army of instructors to drill them, and an enormous expenditure to provide them with arms and ammunition. We should find ourselves faced with the neces- sity for expenditure in every direction to maintain a force which would not be required for the defence of the Commonwealth. It is far better that we should provide for a more moderate force, and see that it is entirely under our own command. In connexion with these Estimates, the question of naval defence has also been raised. I do not suppose that many honorable senators will say that we should adopt a solely military or a naval system alone. They will probably be prepared to recognise, as I do, the merits of both. I have had an opportunity of seeing Captain Creswell&#39;s report, and I recognise the very great force of many of the observations which it contains. I should gladly welcome a proposal on the part of the Government to provide a certain number of torpedo boats, destroyers, and vessels of the class &#39;referred to by Captain Creswell. I believe that Ministers are prepared to propose something of the kind, but the weak point in the scheme is that they propose to distribute not only the expenditure, but the providing of the ships over a certain number of years. They propose, I understand, that a period of seven years should be devoted to acquiring a fleet&#39; of the character recommended by Captain Creswell. We know that events do not stand still. The world is marching, dangers are increasing, and the interests to be protected are growing. I should prefer to see the Government cut down Captain Creswell&#39;s proposals, and provide for a certain number of ships now, raising the money by means of a loan, and providing for a sinking fund, by which, year after year, the whole expenditure might be met at the end of seven years. </para>

            <para>.- No more borrowingis a very good maxim, but we must see whether our circumstances permit of its adoption. If we require a defence force,we must pay for it. and if that should be necessary, in my opinion, it would be reasonable to borrow money for the pur- pose. We should have no difficulty in raising the money required, and if an adequate sinking fund is provided for. there is no reason why the Commonwealth should get into a position of any serious indebtedness. </para>

            <para>- He could not do so if proper provision were made, and Parliament saw to it that the promises made to the money-lenders were faithfully carried out. I regret that the Minister has not yet been able to propose a suitable scheme of defence for Australia. Five years have elapsed since the Commonwealth came into existence, and we are not in  as  good a position to defend ourselves to-day  as  we were five years ago, when the various States had their own defence in their own hands. </para>

If our Defence Forces were required to act at the present time we do not know whether the Inspector-General or a junior officer would be placed in command. We might have an officer placed in command who is not in touch with the forces throughout the Commonwealth, as is the Inspector-General, whose duty it is to inspect the various branches of the forces and report on their efficiency. I believe that some time ago the Inspector-General made application for some assistance, and the reply he got was, &#34; We cannot give you any assistance; when you accepted the position you knew that you would be without assistance of the character for which you ask.&#34; I believe that in Canada there are some seven or eight officers attached to the InspectorGeneral of the forces, to assist him in his work of supervision. If the circumstances of Canada demand that the InspectorGeneral should have such assistance, the circumstances of Australia demand the adoption of a similar course here. It has been suggested that we might allow the officers in charge in the various States to make inspections and report to the Inspector-General, who could pass their reports on to the Council of Defiance ; but the special object of appointing an Inspector-General was to secure an absolutely independent report on the efficiency of the various units in the different States. We should have such a report without any intervention on the part of such officers as the State Commandants. </para>

            <para>.- I admit that we have a right to assume that the State Commandants can be relied upon, but we have appointed an Inspector-General to report independently, in. order that there may be no mistakes. The Commandants are no doubt good men, but they have not the same knowledge of the whole of the forces as has the Inspector-General. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> says that they are removed periodically from one State to another, it should be remembered that the Commandant in one State is paid &#163;500, in another &#163;600, and in a third <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1,000</inline> or <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1,200,</inline> and we could not promote a man getting &#163;1,200 to a position in which he would receive only &#163;600. The only thing we can do, when a man gets to the top of the tree as a State Commandant, is. to make him InspectorGeneral, or let him go altogether. </para>

            <para>.- I was laying some stress on the advantage of having independent reports on the forces in each State. I think it would have been well if the Minister could have seen his way to comply with the Inspector-General&#39;s application for assistance. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson,</inline> in speaking about the cadet force, was very insistent upon the advantage of a compulsory system. I feel that the cadet forces in the past have not received the encouragement which they ought to have received. Australian boys are only too delighted to avail themselves of the opportunity to join a cadet corps. As members of a regularly drilled force, they begin to feel that they are of some importance in the community. Whether the system adopted is voluntary or compulsory, there can be no doubt that Australia will have to depend very largely in the future on the training of young lads to the use of arms, and to efforts made to imbue them with the idea that it is a part of their duty to defend the country in which they live. </para>

As the Minister is a member of the Council of Defence, no doubt he knows how often it has met, and how it is managed. I hear that it has given rise to very great dissatisfaction, and I hope that the Government will devise some way of making iti a more effective body than it is. I also wish to draw the attention of the Government to the want of fortifications at Hobart. Although this is one of the most important sea-ports we have, still it is one of the weakest in its &#34;defences..

I will repeat it for honorable senators&#39; information. The Council has met twice. One meeting, at which questions of defence were discussed, was rather important. The second was in regard to a matter which was not very important. The Council consists of the Minister for the time being, the Treasurer, and a number of officers, naval and military. It is called together when the Minister needs its advice. At the present time I do not see any utility in calling the Council together, but there will be a meeting before the scheme, which I hope to be able to lay before my colleagues, is ready. The Council will be able to criticise it before it is placed before the Government for approval or disapproval. The defences of Hobart have not been neglected. We are spending money just below Hobart now. We are manning a - very effective gun to protect that very interesting little city. True, it is but one gun, but it is up to date and efficient. </para>

            <para>- It is high time that naval reserves were established throughoutthe Commonwealth. I believe an attempt has been made to recruit by sending the <inline font-style="italic">Protector</inline> round. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> has suggested that we shall be able to recruit a considerable number of seamen, not only to serve in our own Defence Force, but to assist the Imperial Navy if necessary. He has said that it will be better to assist the Imperial Navy by means of men than by money. In England,no matter how much money Parliament is prepared to vote for naval purposes the trouble is to enlist men to man the fleet. I believe that it is our duty to do something to assist in manning our own coastal defences, and that therefore the recruiting of naval reserves should be pushed forward vigorously. It has been said that England is prepared to let us have ships of war. What is the use of having those vessels if we have not men to man them ? There are men on the Australian coasts who would be prepared to render this service if they were trained. But the encouragement given is very small. Let honorable senators realize the fact that we spend over &#163;600,000 in land defences, and only about &#163;45,000 in naval defence. A considerable sum is spent in harbour defence, which should be undertaken by trained sailors. My own opinion is that the whole of the harbour defence of Australia should be under one command, and that a naval command. The men at the guns on shore would have to fight in conjunction with the seamen, and the officers on board the ships ought to know  everything about the guns at the forts. I trust that the Government, in considering the defence scheme during the recess will be able to propose something definite in this regard. There is plenty of room for economy ; and if I am in order, I should like to draw attention to another matter. A whole company of men are withdrawn from the Queenscliff forts every week to do duty at Government House. I regard this as an absolutely useless expense, seeing that these men are not provided with any ammunition, and could not afford us any protection whatever, not even having the power to arrest an offender. Their whole duty is to walk up and down at Government House, and be relieved every four hours. A fresh company is brought from Queens-  cliff each week by train at a cost of about 15s. per man. The time occupied on the journey is seven hours, whereas these men could very well travel by steamer at 2s. 6d. a head in two hours and a half. Surely some economy could be exercised in this connexion, instead of reducing the force for the coastal defence of a State to twelve men. </para>

These arrangements were made before I took office, and I found these items in the Estimates. I can see no reason for the particular numbers, except, perhaps, that they may have been arrived at on a population basis. </para>

        <para class="block">My object is to get an expression of opinion as to whether the Militia Forces should be continued. My own impression is that wewould get a much more effective and certainly a more numerous force, if the money at present spent on the militia were diverted to the support of the volunteer system. In the Militia Force we have 16,540 men. whereas there are only 5,850 volunteers. The volunteers, in direct payments, cost &#163;2 per head per annum, while the militia cost <inline font-style="italic">&#163;9</inline> per head ; so that if the whole of the money spent on both branches were devoted to volunteers,we should, as I say, have a much larger force. Of course, the question of efficiency arises; and I should like an expression of opinion as to whether the extra drill to which the militia are subjected, is a compensating advantage for the expenditure. To my mind it is not a compensating advantage. We ought to specially encourage rifle shooting in the land forces. The drill of the barrack-yard does not appear to be of much consequence in modern warfare, and certainly would not count for very much in the defence of Australia. The mere ability to perform certain evolutions, so far as I can gather, is of very little moment on the battlefield of to-day ; what is wanted principally is the capacity to shoot well, and the power to march, and to endure hunger and fatigue. We are much more likely to get a good class of men in the volunteers than in the militia. I know a number of men who would not be in the militia, but for the money inducement. What we want is not a comparatively small number of men able to go through certain evolutions, but a comparatively large number of men able to shoot well. Honorable senator after honorable senator addresses himself to the subject of defence, but we do not seem to make any progress towards, a definite defence system. I advocate the abolition of the militia, and the substitution of a small permanent force, with a comparatively large volunteer force. We should spend the money much better in encouraging volunteers by offering prizes for shooting, and providing ammunition, <inline font-style="italic">ad libitum,</inline> if it be desired. In that way we should train up a nation of sharpshooters, who would be able to give a good account of themselves, if Australia ever had the misfortune to be invaded. We could, I believe, by this means raise an Army of 50,000 men equal in every particular, to the 22,000 who now make up the militia and the volunteers. </para>

          <para>- I should like some information regarding the item of &#163;579 set down as a contribution towards the maintenance of a telegraph station at Goode Island, and cable communication with the Prince of Wales group of Islands, Torres Straits. A short time ago it was reported that the Colonial Defence Committee had recommended a fortification at Goode Island. I should like to know from the Minister whether it has been finally decided to fortify Goode Island, and whether the vote to which I have referred is asked for in order to give effect to that decision? </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator PLAYFORD</inline>(South AustraliaMinister of Defence). - No. A similar vote was passed last year, before the suggestion with respect to the fortification of Goode Island was made. Last year we voted &#163;838 for this purpose. The provision is necessary for the maintenance of the cable between the groups of islands in Torres&#39; Straits, and particularly in order that Thursday Island may be in cable communication with the mainland in time of war. The vote has nothing to do with the fortification of Goode Island. On that subject we have only some memoranda forwarded by the Colonial Defence Committee and a report by an officer who was asked to investigate the matter. Unfortunately, it has been found that the port at Thursday Island is silting up with very great rapidity. It is a question whether it would not be better to have the coaling station and fortifications at Goode Island rather than at Thursday Island ; and if that is the case, of course an unfortunate mistake was made in the selection of Thursday Island in the first instance. No definite request has been made in connexion with the matter, and at the present time there is no necessity for immediate action. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator STEWART</inline>(Queensland). - I wish again to direct the attention of the Committee to the amount spent on the paid forces and their number, and the amount spent on the Volunteer Forces and their number. In the Permanent Forces in New South Wales we have 505 nien, who mop up &#163;70,776; 5,127 militia, or partiallypaid men, who cost us &#163;45,726 ; and 2,490 volunteers, who cost &#163;6,357. The volunteers cost a little over &#163;2 per head, the militia, or partially-paid forces, &#163;9 per head, and the Permanent Forces &#163;150 per head. I do not know whether honorable senators have given this aspect of the question the consideration which it deserves, but it appears to me that it would be very much better for the Commonwealth if we disbanded the militia and partially-paid forces and spent the &#163;51,000 now spent on those forces and on the Volunteer Forces entirely on the volunteers. We should then have a verv much larger force, and, in my opinion, it would be as efficient as the present force. The number of men at the service of the Commonwealth might be doubled, or more than doubled, for the same money, and that ought to have some influence with the members of the Committee. If honorable senators are determined on continuing militia, or partially-paid forces, I shall be compelled to move a reduction on the amount set down for the Volunteer Forces, with the object of getting an expression of opinion as to whether honorable senators desire that those forces shall be continued. My own opinion is that we cannot have the two forces running side by side successfully. Men who desire to be paid will not join the volunteers, but very many men would certainly join the volunteers if there were no paid branch of the service. They are not willing to volunteer while there is a paid branch. They very reasonably say : &#34; Why should we give our services for nothing when these other men are paid?&#34; It is an absolute waste of money to have these two arms of the service maintained side by side. If the Committee determines to keep the militia, or partially-paid force, they should disband the volunteers, and spend all the money available on the rifle clubs and cadet corps. I move - </para>

            <para>- I propose to support the honorable senator now, but I do not think he took the right step before. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> has placed his finger on the weak spot in our defence system. He has said that we should have a militia or partiallypaid force at the cost of &#163;7 or &#163;8 per head, or a volunteer force at a cost of less than half that amount. If the request moved is supported, Ministers and honor-  able members in another place may take it as an&#39; indication of the feeling of the Committee that up to the present time the authorities of the Defence Department, in administering our land forces, have not paid sufficient attention to rifle shooting, and have paid too mud&#93; attention to drill. There can be no doubt that the money paid to the members of the militia, or partially-paid forces, is an incentive to many to join those forces, and it is looked upon as a wellearned return for the work they put in at drill. I believe that a large proportion of the members of the militia or partiallypaid forces who receive or <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> a year, and earn it, could not hit a man at 200 or 300 yards distant. That is well known to those in charge of our land forces. </para>

We know that at the various rifle matches held throughout the Commonwealth, in the majority&#34; of cases the best shots are members of rifle clubs who have not spent much time in drill-halls, but who have spent a great deal of time on the rifle ranges.

            <para>- I have admitted that it is necessary that the men should do a certain amount of drill, but I contend that it would be better to spend the money in teaching the militia or partially-paid forces the use of the rifle rather than on uniforms, and in return for the work done in the drillhalls. I can see no necessity for having members of rifle clubs and volunteers under a different heading. Neither of these forces are paid. </para>

            <para>- Under what liability is it necessary to place them beyond that of having to serve in the defence of their own country in time of war? The idea of Major-General Hutton, in encouraging the militia, or partially-paid forces, against the volunteers, was to raise up a Defence Force which could be called upon, if necessary, to serve outside the Commonwealth. That I hold is utterly repugnant to the feelings of the people. We do not wish to impose upon the members of rifle clubs any liability of that kind!. </para>

With a big military force such as we have, it is a great deal cheaper to be our own insurers than to pay a company, who would charge sufficient to cover all risks, and to leave a profit.

There were eightyfour candidates to fill one vacancy, so that the imposition of the fee yielded a very nice sum. I do not know whether the candidates had to be examined in subjects other than arithmetic. I shall read the paper on arithmetic. In view of the fact that the occupant of the position would probably never be asked to do anything but pack away stores, I should like honorable senators to say whether they approve of all this superfluity of examination.

          <para>- We wanted a labourer in the Department, but he could not be obtained except through the Public Service Commissioner. An advertisement was published, and I think eighty-four applications were received. In order to decide who was the most fit and proper person, an examination was held. I do not hold either myself or the Department responsible for this tom-foolery. There was no necessity for holding an examination, when we merely wanted a labourer for packing stores in the ordnance branch. But that is the way in which the Public Service Commissioner treated the applicants. It certainly would not have occurred if we had been able to obtain the services that we required ourselves. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator PLAYFORD</inline>(South Australia - Minister of Defence). - This is one of the matters we took over from the States. Queensland had divided her territory into a number of districts, in which rifle associations had been formed. We do not think it right to diminish the amount formerly paid by the State Government. And as was admitted to me by a gentleman in Adelaide, who is connected with military matters and rifle associations, with whom I was talking over the matter, there is some justification for a larger amount being paid in Queensland. She has an immense territory, with a population extending along a coast-line hundreds of miles in length. Each district has its own. rifle association. We are only too pleased to give these associations money to encourage them to perfect their rifle shooting. But there is no doubt that the amounts voted to South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria, and New South Wales are not on a fair basis, My attention was not called to the subject until I had been Minister of Defence for some time. I have since looked into it, but I do not wish to decrease the amount voted to Queensland. She is entitled to much consideration on account of her peculiar position. But in justice to the other States, we must increase the amount voted to them, and if I have the honour to draw up the Estimates next year, honorable senators will see a change made in this direction. </para>

The increase in the receipts since 1901-2 was ?106,000, and the increase in the expenditure ?122,000.

            <para>- That would account for only a very small proportion of the increased expenditure. In the Victorian Post Office the receipts last year were ?682,000, and the expenditure ?634,972. The increase in the receipts since 1901-2 was ?91,000, and the increase in the expenditure ?75,000, showing Victoria to be ?16,000 to the good. In Queensland the receipts last year were ?331,000, and the expenditure ?419,775. The increase in the receipts since 1901-21 was ?18,000, and the increase in the expenditure ?25,000, showing Queensland to be ?7,600 to the bad. In the South Australian Post Office the receipts last year were ?266,000, and the expenditure ?269,541. The increase in the receipts since 1901-2 was ?9,000, and the increase in the expenditure ?38,000, so that South Australia is ?29,000 to the bad. In Western Australia the receipts last year were ?257,000, and the expenditure ?290,422. The increase in the receipts since 1901-2 was ?31,000, and the increase in the expenditure ?30,^00 - the two just about balancing. In Tasmania the receipts last year were ?112,000, and the expenditure ?118,353. The increase in the receipts since 1901-2 was ?21,000, and the increase in the expenditure &#163;17,000, showing Tasmania to be &#163;4,000 to the good. The total increase in the receipts throughout the Commonwealth since 190 1-2 was &#163;258,000, and the increase in the expenditure &#163;307,000. </para>

            <para>- I cannot see why the expenditure should continually increase at a greater rate than the income. One would expect exactly the opposite to be the case, as I believe it would be, with good and economical management. I shall have occasion this evening to lay one or two cases before honorable senators, which, I believe, are only symptomatic of a veryserious state of affairs in the administration of the Department. The figures I have quoted ought to be taken into serious consideration by the Government. I do not wish any cheese-paring to take place in connexion with our Public Service, or that any one should be underpaid, but I certainly object to extravagant management. The figures denote carelessness - to use no strong term - in the outgoings,. The increased expenditure caused by the minimum wage does not account for the difference which the figures disclose. </para>

          <para>- It may be as well to remind ourselves and that portion of the public who are constantly crying out about extravagance in the transferred Departments, that, while, as against an anticipated increase in the revenue this, year of &#163;51,000, there is an anticipated increase in the expenditure of ,&#163;90,000, the latter to the extent of &#163;52,000 is on account of the over-sea mail contracts. It is remarkable that the people who are loudest in their denunciation of Federal extravagance, are those who, to a large extent, were loudest in their request for the increased expenditure on the mail contracts. These same people may also be informed that the adoption of penny postage throughout Australia would mean a further increase in the expenditure; and it is to be hoped. that the request for the adoption of this policy will not be listened to. It is estimated that for at least a year or two it would mean an additional annual expenditure of about &#163;300,000; and I cannot see why the whole of the people should be called upon to contribute to a loss incurred for the benefit of a comparatively small section, consisting for the most part, of the mercantile classes. Only one State in the Commonwealth has adopted penny postage, and I trust that the other States will hold fast to their present system, because if penny postage were brought into force in those States, the people who are now asking for it would be crying out against the increased expenditure of the Department, and Federal extravagance generally.- * </para>

Another reason for the increased expenditure is the fact that better services have been instituted in the back country.

For the credit of the Department the Minister in charge of these Estimates should make some explanation on these points. </para>

I take it that the honorable senator had no other object in making them than to point to the improvements effected in connexion with this Department, in contrast with the condition of affairs that existed under the several States. Several factors contribute to the increased expenditure in connexion with the Post and Telegraph Department. In the first place, since the transfer of the States Departments to the Commonwealth there has been an  allround  increase of salaries. </para>

            <para>- I shall deal with that- presently. I am dealing now specially with expenditure. As honorable senators are aware, the application of the provision of the Public Service Act with respect to the minimum wage has increased the expenditure of the Post and Telegraph Department, as of other Departments of the Commonwealth, service. There is a further factor in the increased expenditure common to all the transferred Departments, and that is that all works, new buildings, and properties required for those Departments are now paid for out of revenue earned, by them, and not as previously under the management of the States Governments, out of loan  moneys, or public works accounts. I think that Western Australia was the only exception to the latter rule. </para>

            <para>- That is so, by reason of the fact that the ordinary annual increments would have to be paid if the Departments had remained under the control of the States. The revenue from this Department is very satisfactory, whilst very great improvements have been effected since the establishment of Federation. Very considerable reductions have also been made in the charges made to the public, especially in connexion with telegraphy. I suppose that there is no part of the civilized world to-day where it is possible to send more matter over a longer distance by telegraph at a cheaper rate than in the Commonwealth of Australia. The rates now charged in Australia are remarkably low, and lower than those ever previously charged &#39;by public or by private enterprise in any other part of the world. The reductions made have been surprising. A telegram which, before Federation, cost from 3s. 6d. to 4s., can now be sent in the Commonwealth for is. We have that balance of great advantage to set against any depletion of revenue, and when the figures submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> are considered, it is found that the revenue has not suffered very considerably. </para>

I was told, in answer to my question, that these gratuities represented1 the amount paid as poundage rates. In the circumstances, it appears to me that the wrong term is used. If we are paying for the carriage of mails at per lb., it is misleading to describe the charge as a gratuity. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator KEATING</inline>(Tasmania- Honorary Minister). - After this matter was mentioned by the honorable senator last week, I caused inquiries to be made, and I find that postally  the word &#34; gratuity &#34; is used in a technical sense. It means the payment made to non-contract vessels as distinguished from subsidies paid to contract vessels. In several State Post and Telegraph Acts the word appears, and in the Estimates of Expenditure of those States it was invariably used. When this Department was transferred&#39; to the Commonwealth, and Estimates, were framed in connexion with each of the States Postal Departments, the word &#34;gratuities&#34; was retained, and I think rightly, because it serves to indicate to those concerned with State finances what particular sums are being expended in this way. I have received a memorandum on the subject, in which it is said - </para>
        <para>The same wording has been continued in the Estimates of Expenditure for the Commonwealth, but arrangements will be made in connexion with the 1906-7 Estimates to amend the wording so as to make it clear that these payments are payments at poundage rates. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator GIVENS</inline>(Queensland). - In reply to a question put in another place a day or so ago, the astonishing information was given that big places of business like the Hotel Australia, in Sydney, and the Grand Hotel, in Melbourne, have an attendant all to themselves in the telephone exchanges, and the cost of this attendance comes to more than the total receipts received from these hotels for the telephone services they enjoy. That is altogether wrong. There are other expenses in connexion with these telephones, such as the expense of putting the lines to the hotels, and of fitting up telephones in them; and if all the figures were supplied, I suppose it would be found that these two hotels secure complete telephone services for half, or less than half, the amount they cost the Commonwealth. That should! not be tolerated. I understand that there is a special rate for hotels, but it should be differentiated in some way, and the charge made according to accommodation. If, for instance, an hotel can accommodate twenty guests, it might be charged the minimum charge, but if it can accommodate 200 guests, it should be charged accordingly on some ascending scale, so that the actual cost of the service shall not be about twice as much as the total receipts from it. </para>

            <para>- The salaries were jumped up for a particular reason, but the Commissioner was not satisfied, and he had to give them another hitch up. Apparently, while increasing the salaries of the more highly-paid officers, he has set himself assiduously to cut down the remuneration of the more lowly-paid officers. Of course, if the Committee approve of that policy, I have no more to say.I gave them an opportunity yesterday of saying whether they did or not. They decided that they did, and now it will go forth to the people that the Commissioner is supported in this policy by the members of the Senate. </para>

The Act was passed just prior to Victoria entering the Federation. In effect, its Parliament said, &#34; Our letter-carriers and telegraph operators are going over to the Commonwealth.

The Act provided that every transferred officer should receive for his services a salary equal to the highest salary paid to any officer performing similar services in any other State. It was thought at the time that the Commonwealth was going to obtain gold from a treasury which was then hidden upon which it might provide all these men with an increase. As a matter of fact, the men have been receiving the salaries, and Victoria has had to pay them because they were transferred officers. </para>

In order to determine the value of the work done by the different persons, and their efficiency, he had to subject them to an examination.

            <para>- I think it can override that Statute of Victoria. If we are going to have a classification, it must be based on uniform principles. We cannot adopt as a uniform principle an Act which would give a letter-carrier of nineteen or twenty years of age in Victoria the same salary as a letter-carrier in South Australia who perhaps has put in forty years&#39; service. These men have been reduced in some instances from &#163;130 to &#163;120 as the result of the examination. They have not proved, in the opinion of the Commissioner, their efficiency to do work for which a salary of &#163;130 ought to be paid. But all those who presented themselves for examination did not fail. </para>

The complaints we hear come from those who failed to pass the examination,&#34; and who, therefore, have had to go back from &#163;130 to &#163;120, so that they will be on the same level as officers who are doing corresponding work in other parts of the Commonwealth. The fact of the matter is that the Victorian Act gave a certain number of persons anartificial salary, and now, when the classification scheme has been adopted, and uniform principles have to be applied throughout the Commonwealth, they have, in some instances, to get down to a salary equivalent to the work which is being done. If officers in Victoria cannot show that they are rendering services equivalent to a salary of &#163;140, they will have to go back to a salary of &#163;120 until they can demonstrate their efficiency to attain to the higher rate after which they will proceed by the ordinary increase until they reach the highest salary in the division, namely, &#163;160. </para>

            <para>- That is the most extraordinary answer I have ever heard. If the salary was artificial then, it is artificial now, and a dozen examinations would not make it real. The men are doing exactly the same work now as they were doing previously. They were not able to pass some fancy test to which they were subjected bv the Commissioner. The Minister says that the salary is artificial. If it was artificial in the one case it was artificial in every case. If these men are not doing their work properly, they ought to be dismissed. If they cannot earn the salaries which they are receiving, they should get their walking ticket. It seems to me to be an extraordinary method of &#34; cutting down men&#39;s salaries, more especially those in the lower grades of the service, who are getting very poor remuneration at best. And1 if these men were subjected to a test, why were not officers in the other States subjected to the same test? We hear a great deal about uniformity. Why did not the men in the other States have an opportunity of showing whether they were capable of earning the increases which had been given to these officers? &#39; It appears to me, speaking without prejudice, that the whole thing is a complete jumble, and that the service is seething with incapacity from top to bottom. I have a word or two to say 1 with regard to Queensland. It will be fresh in the recollection of honorable senators that a few days ago I put a few questions to the Minister representing the PostmasterGeneral. Replies were given. But probably honorable senators do not know the inner history of those questions. I propose to give some information on the point. At the end of January last, an employe&#34; in the Brisbane Post Office was found to have stolen a sum of &#163;8 belonging to the Department. I understand that on the discovery of the theft he was told to go home. In the beginning of February he was tried in Brisbane, convicted of larceny, and sentenced to six months&#39; imprisonment. But he was liberated under the First Offenders Act. On, the 24th of June he received a letter, informing him that he had been suspended on the charges that he had absented himself from duty without leave; that he had failed to account for the sum of &#163;8 odd ; and also that he had been convicted at the Police Court in Brisbane on this charge, and sentenced to six months&#39; imprisonment. This letter, be it noted, was sent on the 24th June, about five months after he had been convicted and sentenced. He had left the office at the end of January, had been convicted of larceny at the beginning of February, and was suspended on the 24th June. He was called upon to answer the charges in writing. He saw the  Deputy  Postmaster-General, who asked him to resign. But meanwhile some kind friend had whispered in his ear that, not having been suspended or dismissed, he could make a claim for his salary. He did make that claim, and the sum of &#163;83 and some odd shillings was paid to him for which he never did a single hour&#39;s work. These facts disclose a most extraordinary state of affairs. Here is a man discovered in an offence at the end of January. He is told - I suppose by his superior officer - to leave the office. In the beginning of February he is charged and sentenced to six months&#39; imprisonment, but is liberated under the First Offenders Act. He was ultimately dismissed, I believe, some time in August; but the Department had to pay him&#163;83 - his salary from the date in January . when he left the office until the date when he was suspended. I want to know why he was not suspended the moment the offence was discovered, and why he was&#34; not dismissed the moment he was sentenced? I want to know, further, what officer was responsible for this neglect of duty ? That officer, I submit, ought to have two alternatives placed before him - either to pay the &#163;83, or to leave the service. The facts disclose a state of affairs which is really lamentable. How can we place any reliance upon an Administration which conducts its affairs in this slipshod fashion? If the interests of the Commonwealth are neglected in these particulars, how are we to know that the whole of our Post and Telegraph business is not going to rack and ruin ? I shall be glad to hear whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> has any information to give. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator KEATING</inline>(Tasmania - Honorary Minister). - -The matter to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> has referred was brought up by means of a question put to me one day last week. Since then I have been making inquiries, and I find, as he has pointed out, that the case first arose in January last. The officer in, question, Butler, was guilty of the larceny of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;8</inline> 14s, 3d. He was brought before the justices and convicted.

        <para class="block">The question had been submitted to the Crown Solicitor - I do not know whether it was an abstract question or whether a concrete case was mentioned - as far back as October, 1903, whether an officer convicted of an offence on an information - as compared with the word &#34; indictment,&#34; used in the Public Service Act - could be deemed to have forfeited his office. It was pointed out that the word &#34; indictment,&#34; under section  27A  of the Acts Interpretation Act, included &#34; information.&#34; An opinion was given by the Crown Solicitor to the effect that a conviction on an information would not necessarily cause an officer to forfeit his office, because he might be convicted, for instance, upon an information for riding his bicycle without a light. When this particular concrete case arose, in the early part of this year, I find that what was done by the then Government was that the matter was referred for advice as to whether the conviction of Butler brought him under section 66 of the Public Service Act. That was immediately after he had been released under the First Offenders Act. </para>

          <para>Butler was&#34; charged with, an indictable offence, but apparently was dealt with summarily under the State Justices Act. The question is whether he was convicted on an indictment or a presentment within the meaning of section  66  of the Commonwealth Public Service Act 1902. Section 27 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 provides that in any Act, unless the contrary intention appears, the word &#34;indictment&#34; shall include information. The Crown Solicitor has previously advised that summary conviction for an offence which is not indictable is not a conviction on indictment or presentment. My view is that information in section 27 of the Acts Interpretation Act means an information in the nature of an indictment, and does not include an information before justices; and consequently that the officer in this case was not convicted on &#34; indictment or presentment.&#34; &#34; Indictment &#34; in English law means an indictment by a Grand Jury. In Australia indictable offences are mostly prosecuted by information or presentment of the Attorney-General or other Crown Law Officer- and it is submitted that the intention of the Acts Interpretation Act is merely to make the word indictment extend to this procedure. </para>

        <para class="block">If the Department is to be administered in this way we shall soon have complaints, not only of extravagance, but of disgraceful management. I never heard of a case in which a man in the Public Service was charged with theft, or an offence of that character, who was not thereupon suspended, and, if convicted, dismissed as from the date of suspension. I hope that such a case will not occur again. A matter of the kind should not be allowed to pass unnoticed, or without strong protest. This man was dealt with very leniently in the Court - and I do not complain of that, because there may have been some reason - but he was subsequently paid &#163;83, because, owing to some peculiar reading of the law or unfortunate technicality, he had not been dismissed. In my opinion the Minister at the time would have been absolutely justified in suspending the man immediately. </para>

A public servant will only need to steal &#163;7 or &#163;8 in order to have a present made to him of &#163;83 or thereabouts. The whole position is simply ridiculous. I say emphatically and unhesitatingly that the officer who is guilty of the blunder in regard to this man ought to be called upon to repay the &#163;83. The provisions of the Public Service Act are so plain that he who runs may read, and it is useless for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> to say that it could not be known whether or not the man, was guilty until he had been convicted. </para>

            <para>- I am glad to have elicited that information, which ought to be made public. It seems that a gross blunder was perpetrated &#39;by the  Deputy  PostmasterGeneral. The first step to be taken was undoubtedly to suspend this man. There could have been no danger of an action for wrongful dismissal. </para>

            <para>- That delay seems to have been justifiable. The action in regard to the suspension was wrong ; but before the man could be dismissed it was as desirable to make this something in the nature of a test case. To put the matter in another way, it was desirable to have a final decision, from the highest legal authority, and the opinion of the AttorneyGeneral of the time was properly obtained before the question of dismissal could be decided. The real blunder was in not suspending the man. We have ascertained that that is the fault of a man no longer in the service, and I do not mind saying that it is a good thing he is not. </para>

            <para>- The offence should have been reported to the Deputy Postmaster-General by his own officer. If the present Postmaster-General adopts in regard, to this sort of thing the easy indifferent attitude which is adopted by the leader of the Government in the Senate, God help the service. We shall find the public servants riding roughshod over everybody, stealing everything, neglecting everything, and the service will go to ruin. I have another case to bring up. I am very sorry that I have to refer to these matters, but we must probe these things if we are to have a healthy administration of our Departments. I propose to refer to the case of the man Hart, though I have been told that it would not be proper to refer to the case because it is. <inline font-style="italic">sub-judice.</inline> This is a case the beginning of which was about a man&#39;s lunch. It all hangs upon a man going out to his lunch, and yet it has already involved the Commonwealth in hundreds of pound&#39;s of expense. There is now a case before the Court, and, win or lose, it is probable that the Commonwealth will have to pay the piper to the tune of another few hundred pounds, so that before the matter is finally settled &#163;1,000 will have been taken out of the long-suffering taxpayer&#39;s pocket. We shall probably never have an opportunity to refer to the case if it is not referred to now. In December, 1903, this man Hart was employed in the Brisbane Post Office, and his immediate superior, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cooling,</inline> complained that he was in the habit of going out for luncheon without first obtaining permission. My information is that the other men in the room were in the habit of taking their luncheon inside the building, but Hart, who had a delicate stomach, insisted, as he had a perfect right to do, on going outside for his lunch. The matter was. referred to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Crosbie, Mr. Cooling&#39;s</inline> superior, who ruled that there was nothing in the regulations to prevent an officer on staff duty taking the regulation time off. Hart consequently insisted on going out for his lunch, and taking the three-quarters of an hour for the purpose allowed by the regulations. He only took that time. </para>

            <para>- On each occasion. Cooling&#39;s reason for insisting upon that was that it was necessary he should have his men always at his command, so that the receiving of incoming mails should not be interfered with. Hart&#39;s reply to that is that he had nothing whatever to do with the mails, that he never left until some other man had come to relieve him, and that the business of the Post Office was not delayed or inconvenienced for a single moment by his going out for luncheon. On one occasion it appears that Hart went to Coolingto ask for permission to leave, but Cooling happened to be absent, and he told Cooling&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">locum tenens</inline> that he was going out for lunch. This was in the end of September, 1903. On the 7th January, 1904, Hart was suspended for leaving the office without permission while on duty on the 30th December, 1903. I should like the attention of honorable senators, because I am not talking to <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> I am trying to impress on the minds of honorable senators that there is something rotten in connexion with the administration of our Post Office. </para>

            <para>- Whether it is in Brisbane or in Adelaide, it ought to be rooted out. Hart was suspended, and I direct SenatorClemons&#39; attention to the fact that there was no difficulty about his suspension. The only offence he had committed was that of going out for his dinner without asking permission of his superior officer, but, strange to say, when a man steals &#163;8, he cannot be suspended without the opinion of the Solicitor-General, the AttorneyGeneral, and Heaven knows how many other generals. That seems to me to be red-tapism run stark, staring mad. Hart claimed that he was illegally suspended. A Board of Inquiry was appointed, but the question of his illegal suspension was not permitted to be heard. The only question before the Board of Inquiry was whether Hart had left without asking the permission of his superior officer. </para>

            <para>- And thereby committed an offence ; but my contention is that the Board should have started at the beginning. Hart claimed that he left for lunch, as he was permitted to do under the regulations, and therefore his superior officer had no power to suspend him on that account as for an offence. That is where the initial mistake was made in this case. It all springsout of the petty tyranny practised on so many occasions by superior officers in these Departments. I claim that the Board of Inquiry should have settled whether Hart was entitled to go without asking permission. If that had been decided against Hart, he would have deserved whatever punishment was inflicted upon him, but, seeing that he raised that question, and that it was not settled, the whole of the subsequent proceedings are a serious reflection upon the capacity and management of the superiors of the Department. On the 29th January, after three weeks&#39; suspension, he received notice of the constitution of the Board of Inquiry. In addition toobjecting to the form of the charge, he took objection to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lowther,</inline> a member of the general division, being on the Board. As <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hart</inline> was a clerical assistant, he objected to another member of the Board, on the ground that he was a relative of the  Deputy  PostmasterGeneral, that is the lamented <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Buzacott,</inline> who made the other mistake, and who is now safe out of the firing line. He has retired with all the honours of war, and cannot be got at now ; but this is another of his mistakes. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hart</inline> had made a charge against him, but no notice was taken of those objections. The Board met, and said that the only matter for inquiry was whether he had left without <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cooling&#39;s</inline> permission. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hart</inline> had&#39; admitted that he left the room without permission, but said that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cooling</inline> was absent at the time. &#39;How could he possibly ask permission from a man who was not there? The whole thing appears to me to be just a piece of petty persecution on the part of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cooling.</inline> When the inquiry was closed, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hart</inline> appealed, and under regulation 276, he required acopy of the report of the proceedings, but that was refused. He then communicated with the Commissioner, claiming first that the Board of Inquiry was illegally constituted, secondly, that it had illegally restricted his case, and thirdly, that it had refused a copy of itsreport to him. The letter, I am informed, was ignored by the Commissioner. Surely <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hart</inline> was entitled to a copy of the Board&#39;s report ! The next communication he received was from the  Deputy  PostmasterGeneral, on the 2 is? March, when he was informed that his suspension was removed, that his salary was reduced from &#163;170 to <inline font-style="italic">&#163;162,</inline> and that he was transferred to Bundaberg. That was the decision of the Board. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hart</inline> claimed that it had no right to deal in that way with him. Then, although he had been under suspension from the 30th December, 1903, to the 21st March, 1904, and had practically been convicted of an offence, he was paid his full salary. If a man is convicted of an offence against the rules or customs of the Department, it is not common, I believe, for him to receive full salary. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hart</inline> refused to go to Bundaberg, and on the 29th March he was suspended for refusing to go there. On the 10th May, fortyseven days after the suspension, he was informed that another inquiry would be held. On the 16th May he was informed as to the constitution of the Board, and again he objected to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lowther,</inline> a member of the general division, having a seat thereon. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hart,</inline> I may say, was one of those unfortunate men who had passed a civil service examination, but whose work had been classified as general division work by the Commissioner, and who was treated, so far as this Board was concerned, as a general division officer. Honorable senators will recollect that an officer is entitled to have a member of his own division on any Board of Inquiry which is appointed to investigate a charge against him. On the 26th May the Board met, and when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hart</inline> again claimed that he had been illegally suspended, it refused to deal with that objection, and said that his refusal to go to Bundaberg was the only question with which it could deal. Again he applied for a copy of the Board&#39;s report, and did not receive  it. He then submitted his case to the  Deputy  Postmaster-General, who decided that it could not be re-opened. On the 25th June, the  Deputy  Postmaster-General informed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hart</inline> that the suspension had been removed, and that he was immediately to proceed to Bundaberg. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hart</inline> repeated his former objections, and again refused to go there. On the 16th July an. Order in Council appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette,</inline> ordering him to go to Bundaberg. Again he claimed that the position of assistant in Bundaberg was a class below that of officer of the travelling pest-office, and demanded a proper inquiry. The Commissioner then referred his case to an Appeal Board. On the 25th June, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hart</inline> again received his salary in full. Notwithstanding the fact that he had not done a single stroke of work for the Department from the 6th January, he was paid his salary up to the 25th June. I do not intend to enter into all the ramifications of the case, but the fact remains that for twelve months he humbugged the Department, or it humbugged him ; and that both of them humbugged the taxpayer to such an extent that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hart</inline> drew over &#163;200 without doing a single hour&#39;s work for the country. The initial mistake was made when the Board of Inquiry refused to inquire whether he had disobeyed a reasonable order or not. Apparently it was taken for granted by the Board .that any order issued by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cooling</inline> was a reasonable and lawful one. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hart,</inline> as a man who was on his trial, had every right to question the legality of the order. It was not permitted to be questioned, and I submit that from that mistake the whole of the subsequent difficulties sprang. All this shows again the essential incompetence of some of the men who occupy high positions in connexion with this Department. Some one has seriously blundered in connexion with this case. Even if Hart&#39;s claim for damages is not upheld by the Court, it is evident that some officers have been guilty of the very grossest neglect, and are not fit to keep the positions of responsibility that they now hold; In July, 1888, Hart entered the Public Service as a clerk in the Post and Telegraph Department at Roma. On various occasions he acted as postmaster there. In 1897 he was promoted to the position of travelling mail officer, doing duty in the Roma district. In the early part of 1901 he was acting as relieving travelling mail officer on the most important section in the State, that between Brisbane and Woolloongabba. While on that duty, he made suggestions to the Department which were adopted, and resulted in a saving to the State of about &#163;200 a year. This, however, Hart says, roused the resentment of an officer, who hinted that he would be removed. We  can easily understand that. We know how men in high positions in the Commonwealth service resent a suggestion from a subordinate. I have heard of dozens of cases where, when men made suggestions which would facilitate business, they were told to mind their own affairs, and not interfere in matters which concerned only their superiors. At about the same time Hart called attention to a looseness in the system of accounts in connexion with, certain charged letters, with the object of preventing a leakage of revenue, estimated at probably &#163;1,000 a year. He was then complimented by the Under-Secretary of the Department, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. R.</inline> T. Scott, who is now Secretary of the Commonwealth Post and Telegraph Department. An unworthy officer surely would not be complimented by the head of his, Department. I need not enter into the remaining portions of his statement. I have touched on the most salient points. I am not advocating Hart&#39;s case. I do not pretend to say whether he was in the right or in the wrong. What I wish to emphasize is the gross incapacity of the men in charge. Why was it possible for Hart practically to defy the Department for twelve months? He compelled them to pay his salary during the whole of that period, when he did not do a single stroke of work. A Department that permits such a state of affairs seems to me to require to have the hose turned upon it. Something needs to be done to purify and cleanse it. I hope that the present Postmaster-General will keep a keen eye on the administration of his Department. If he does not, other cases, such as this, will arise all over the Commonwealth. I am afraid that these cases are merely an indication of a disorder which is deep-rooted. I ask the Minister to probe the internal arrangements of the Department, and see whether there is not something seriously wrong with it. </para>

        <para class="block">Most honorable senators know the circumstances, but I shall briefly relate them. The mails conveyed between the mainland of Australia and Tasmania, are paid for by a subsidy which appears in the Estimates as &#163;11,000. That payment, being under the head of transferred services, is borne wholly and solely by Tasmania, with certain reservations as to poundage fees, into which I need not enter, and which I think ought not to embarrass the question in any way. I shall give a few illustrations in support of the request which I have moved. I first drew attention to this matter in connexion with the telephone services provided for in the Appropriation (Works and Buildings) Bill which was before us a little while ago. As honorable senators remember, there was in the Bill an item of &#163;30,000 for the provision of a telephone service between Melbourne and Sydney ; and it was pointed out at the time that this money would be paid for by all the States <inline font-style="italic">per capita.</inline> Although this was a service any profits from which would go to the two States involved, the expenditure, as I say, had to be borne by the whole of the States. </para>

            <para>- Of course. There was another illustration later on, in connexion with the Vancouver service. Some years ago the expense of this service was borne by the two States chiefly concerned, namely, New South Wales and Queensland. When we discussed the matter the other day, it was decided - and I do not object to the decision - that the whole of that expense should be borne <inline font-style="italic">per capita.</inline> The fruits of that decision may be seen in the Estimates now before us, according to which Tasmania will have to pay &#163;1,194 as her share of the expense of conveying the mails by Vancouver. I need not say that Tasmania does not derive benefit representing anything like that amount. </para>

            <para>- I need not say that Tasmania gladly pays her share, but I am pleading for uniformity in our system of mail conveyance. There is a still further illustration- in these Estimates. The expenses of the service to New Guinea appear, not, as they might, in the Estimates of the PostmasterGeneral&#39;s Department, but in the Estimates of the Department of External Affairs. The regular subsidy of &#163;3,600 is under the head of transferred expenditure, but there are items under the heading of &#34; other &#34; expenditure, and it is to this class of expenditure that I desire the Tasmanian subsidy to be placed. In the case of New Guinea, .there are three items of &#163;400, &#163;2,000, and &#163;6,000, a total of &#163;8,400, under the heading of &#34; other &#34; expenditure. </para>

            <para>- I regret that the subject of these services was not brought up ; I do not; ask for more than I am prepared to give. The request is for bare justice, which, however, I should not like to see confined to Tasmania to the exclusion of any other State. On every occasion I have voted for the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> distribution of such expenditure. The argument has been used that Tasmania should bear this expense, because each State has to deliver its own mails. In reply, I have to say that Tasmania is prepared to pay for the delivery of her own mails ; but this subsidy means a great deal more - it means the conveyance of the mails of the whole of the other States of the Commonwealth to Tasmanian territory. The position is not analogous to that of two bordering States. Each State on the mainland conveys its mails on its own railways to its own boundary, where they are picked up by the trains of the adjoining State. The position of Tasmania, however, is very different. We are prepared to convey our own mails to the limit of our own State; but when we have done so we are faced with this sea passage. The question is - who ought to pay the cost of conveying the mails over this sea passage? I. do nol see any fair and honest reason why the whole of the expense should be borne by Tasmania. The benefit is shared by the whole of the States?, more or less. I may be told that there are not many people in the &#39;two remotest States of Queensland and Western Australia who send letters to Tasmania. </para>

            <para>- I frankly admit that, incidentally, that was so; but the whole basis of the inquiry was the expeditious delivery of the mails. I remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> that the demand made by Tasmania, and practically agreed to or sympathized with by the other States, especially Victoria, was that there should be a more frequent and rapid delivery of mails - that was the essence of the whole inquiry. I admit that the present provision, while it secures the rapid delivery of mails, gives excellent facilities to passengers. But why should Tasmania pay the whole cost of f acilities which are shared by every citizen on the Continent? This rapid steam-ship service is a distinct convenience to the people of Victoria. </para>

            <para>- It might not cost the Commonwealth very much ; but what &#91; am asking for will cost the Commonwealth hardly anything. It matters a good deal to Tasmania when she has to pay every penny of it, but if it is made a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> contribution it will fall very lightly on the whole of the Commonwealth. The mails which go to Western Australia by the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company and the Orient Steam Navigation Company&#39;s boats are paid for <inline font-style="italic">per capita ;</inline> West ern Australia does not pay a farthing under the heading of &#34;transferred&#34; services for the carriage of those mails. Honorable senators may say that such an arrangement could not be avoided, but that does not affect my argument, nor the comparison I am making, nor does it in any way weaken my claim tor fair treatment for Tasmania. </para>

            <para>- I do not think that would be a fair comparison. I have already said that I am quite prepared to have this rule, which I believe to be a sound and wholesome one, applied to every similar service in the Commonwealth. More than once I have expressed the opinion that now that we have taken over the sole control of the Postal service of the Commonwealth, all these subsidies should be paid for <inline font-style="italic">per capita,</inline> since the whole Commonwealth benefits by the services. I say again that Tasmania is the main instance of an exception to the rule. That State, whether for her sins or otherwise, already suffers very considerably with regard to postal and telegraphic facilities. She has lately had an additional amount of about &#163;1,000 placed against her because of the Vancouver mails, which she will willingly pay. She pays herself - and I make no objection whatever to this - gratuities for the conveyance of mails by non-contract vessels. I do not ask that that should be considered as &#34; other &#34; expenditure. She has to pay a special subsidy, as every one knows, in connexion with the Tasmanian cable. I make no claim whatever in connexion with that ; but it should not be necessary for me to remind members of the Committee that it costsTasmanians considerably more to cable to the Mainland than it costs, say, a resident of Adelaide to cable to Port Darwin. </para>

I do not propose to try to remedy that matter; but  surely  it is fair to point out how much Tasmania suffers in connexion with postal and telegraphic communication, because of that reason superadded to all others? I point out that there is an opportunity now afforded the Committee to do justice, and at the same time to initiate a uniform system which, if it is imposed, will extend its advantages not merely to Tasmania, but all over the Commonwealth. What I propose should appeal to every member of the Committee, no matter from what State he comes. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator KEATING</inline>(Tasmania- Honorary Minister). - The matter referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons,</inline> who proposed to transfer this amount of &#163;11,000 from the &#34; transferred &#34; expenditure column to the column for &#34;other &#34; or &#34;new&#34; expenditure has been dealt with in a variety of ways at different times in the Senate. Speaking for myself, it is one which has naturally engaged my attention and interest as a representative of Tasmania, and particularly because, as honorable senators aTe aware, I was  chairman  of the Select Committee to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has made reference. I think that it is well, before we come to any decision upon the point,  that we  should  be acquainted with the facts. As honorable senators are aware, in connexion with the transferred Departments of the Commonwealth, we are under an obligation under sections 89 and 93 of the Constitution to maintain those Departments as at the time of transfer, and consequently in connexion with &#34; transferred &#34; expenditure, when we pass it here as such, we debit the particular&#39; State To whose transferred Department it is applied. When Tasmania came into the Commonwealth, this was the condition of affairs with regard to her mail communication with the outer world, as disclosed before the Committee of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> and myself were members. Tasmania had a contract entered into prior to Federation with the Union Steam-ship Company of New Zealand for the carriage of. all mails out of the State of Tasmania to Australia, but for the carriage of no inward mails, except the English mails, every week from Melbourne. For this service the State was paying the Union Steamship Company at the rate of &#163;6,000 a year,&#39; and received a tri-weekly service during what were called the summer months, but which were not specified, between Launceston and Melbourne, and she was entitled to receive a service one day per week between Melbourne and a North-Western Coast port, and I think an increased service of two days per week was optional. All, therefore, that Tasmania secured under the contract was that there should1 be at least four trips each way every week during the summer months - three between Launceston and Melbourne, and one between the north-west coast and Melbourne, with perhaps, at times, an additional trip. During the winter season, which lasts about eight months, there were to be two trips a week each way between Launceston and Melbourne, and one between the northwest coast and Melbourne. But, under the new contract called for by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake,</inline> when Postmaster-General, Tasmania gets three trips a week each way between Launceston and Melbourne all the year round, and two trips in the summer and one in the winter each week each- way between Melbourne and the north-west coast. Furthermore, the contract requires that steamers of greater speed and larger capacity .and accommodation than were formerly being used shall be employed. Tasmania gets this improved service for &#163;11,000 a year, less about ,&#163;2,000 in poundages. Prior to Federation, however, the State was paying &#163;6,000 a year for a much inferior service, in connexion with which she contracted for the carriage inward of her English mail only, whereas she now has all her mails, inwards and&#39; outwards, contracted for. </para>

            <para>- It is an important difference. It is necessary, to be candid with the Committee, to make this contrast. I have thought f rom the outset that part of  the &#163;11,000 which is now paid should be treated as in excess of the transferred obligations of Tasmania, and as  chairman  of the committee to which I have referred, and as a private member, I have made representations on the subject, and in regard to the cable, to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> and his successors, and the heads of the Postal Department; and, consequently, as soon as the present Government came into office I was asked to write a memorandum putting forward the case of Tasmania. That memorandum, when written, was submitted to the Cabinet, and was dealt with by the Treasurer, and the Postmaster-General in particular. I think that, without breaking a confidence, I may say that the feeling of the Ministers is in favour of the allocation of part of this amount on a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> basis. The question arose as to what portion of it should be so treated, and we were immediately confronted with the fact that there are a number of Inter- State services of a similar character, such as between the north-eastern ports of Australia, along the coast of Queensland to Port Darwin, between the north-western coast of Australia and the Northern Territory of South Australia, and between Adelaide and Port Darwin and others. The Cabinet therefore decided to obtain a complete list of these services, andthen to deal comprehensively with the whole question. It is impossible to deal with the whole of this amount, as suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons.</inline> It cannot he said that Tasmania should not pay at least the  &#163;6,000  which she previously paid for the despatch of her mails to the mainland, and the conveyance of her English mails from there. For the conveyance of her English mails the same provision has now been made at poundage mileage rates as was made in connexion with Queensland by an. addendum to the resolution ratifying the contract with the Orient Steam Navigation Company, added in another place, and agreed to here. Therefore, Tasmania herself now pays only for the conveyance of her Inter-State mails. Each State on the mainland pays for the conveyance of the mails of other States across its territory, or from its borders to its capital. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> has said that Tasmania pay*- for the conveyance of the mails of a number of States, but the other States all do the same. For instance, when mails are sent from Western Australia and South Australia to Queensland, Victoria is responsible for their con- veyance between&#34; Border Town and&#39; Albury, and New South Wales for their conveyance between Albury and Wallangarra. Of course, the question arises : What about the strip of sea intervening between Australia and Tasmania? </para>

            <para>- The waters between Wilson&#39;s Promontory and the mainland of Tasmania are under the jurisdiction of Tasmania. It is only a few years since some Victorian fishermen were using certain trawling nets in Bass Straits prohibited by the Fisheries, laws of Tasmania, and, when interfered with, claimed that they were practically on the high seas, and that the Tasmanian authorities had no jurisdiction over them. The firm, with which I am connected was engaged in the case, and we conducted the prosecution successfully and gained a conviction. </para>

            <para>- No, I think not. In the letters patent of 17th June, 1880,. issued under the great seal of the UnitedKingdom to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick&#39;</inline> Weld, asGovernor of Tasmania, Tasmania was described as &#34;the Island of Tasmania and all the islands and territories lying to the south* of -Wilson&#39;s Promontory in  39  degrees 12 minutes of South latitude.&#34; Tasmaniaclaims, as against Victoria or other States, jurisdiction to within three miles of Wilson&#39;s Promontory. One of the nets in the particular case to which I have referred was alleged to be six miles long, so that it alone would have extended to a distance beyond three miles of the coast. My point is this : So far as Tasmania is concerned, it could never be suggested that the original contract for  &#163;6,000  was not a transferred&#39; obligation. How far the increased cost is due entirely to the new service - disregarding the interests of Tasmania - and how far it is due to the maintenance of the Depart* ment as at the time of transfer - having regard, of course,, to the necessities of extension and development - is difficult to determine. But, so far as the Government are concerned, they propose to re-organize the whole system of the allocation of the cost of Inter-State mails, whether they be carried by land or sea, and they intend to follow a uniform principle. When I ask honorable members not to agree to place this &#163;11,000 in the column &#34; other &#34; or &#34; new &#34; expenditure, I wish it to be distinctly understood that I do so, not because I think that Tasmania is not entitled to claim that a certain portion of the amount should be treated as Commonwealth expenditure, but in order that the new arrangement may be carried out comprehensively, systematically, and uniformly. I do not think that any one could fairly urge that Tasmania should be relieved entirely of the obligation that attached to her, in common with the other States, prior to Federation, to forward and receive her mail matter. It we had not been federated, Tasmania would still have been under the obligation to send her own mails out. Previously she was paying  &#163;6,000  for sending the mails out of Tasmania and conveying the English mails in. I think that a substantial portion of the &#163;11,000 should be debited to the Commonwealth, but as to what that proportion should be, I am not in a position to advise the Committee. The Government are considering the matter, and are obtaining the fullest information, with a view to treating all similar services throughout the Commonwealth upon uniform and systematic lines. </para>

The Tasmanian people urged that better steamers should be employed, in order to encourage the tourist traffic, and the Committee took that into consideration, and recommended - I agreed with the recommendation - that the Postmaster-General should make the payment of the increased subsidy conditional upon the provision of better steamers. I would point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> that if this were to be regarded as a mail service pure and simple, to be paid for by une Commonwealth, it should be made the subject of open tender. </para>

            <para>- Yes, but with a certain stipulation as to the character of the vessels to be employed. All that was required, so far as .the Commonwealth was concerned, was that the mails should be carried upon certain days and within a certain time. This, of course, &#39;is an Inter-State service, but there are some State mail services which are almost upon all fours. In Western Australia we have a service between Albany and Esperance, which was subsidized by the State partly as a trade service. When the Commonwealth took that service over, the PostmasterGeneral said, &#34; Why should my Department have to pay a subsidy which is intended to encourage trade within a State ?&#34; He proposes to take away the conveniences which they have enjoyed in the past. Although Western Australia has to bear the expense of that service, it is to be taken away from that State because the PostmasterGeneral says that it is not the policy of the Department to continue it. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> that a just proportion of the amount paid under Inter-State services of this character should be charred upon a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> basis, but I cannot pick out an item here and there in that connexion. I am. however, prepared to vote for the general application of that principle throughout the Commonwealth upon some recognised plan. </para>

          <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating&#39;s</inline> argument that this part of the ocean belongs to Tasmania can not, I think, be sustained.

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;KEEFE</inline>(Tasmania).- It is just as well that this matter has been raised. It is all very fine for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> and others to say that they do not believe in one or two items being picked out for special treatment. But I would point out that this is the only item which could be selected to illustrate the argument that has been used in favour of adopting a uniform system. What I specially wish to bring under the notice of the Committee is that, although this question has been previously discussed in the Senate, the Postal Department has utterly ignored the arguments used upon former occasions. If the matter had not been again raised to-night, the existing condition of affairs would have obtained next year when the Estimates came under review. In my opinion, it is time that the Postal Department tackled this matter in a proper manner. Of course, the Minister representing the PostmasterGeneral, has assured us. that the whole question will be gone into thoroughly. But it seems to me that if we did not keep pegging away at it, its determination would probably remain in abeyance for years. The argument that, because Tasmania paid  &#163;6,000  per annum for the old service, and because the new improved service is costing &#163;11,000 per annum, that State is deriving the whole of the benefit, is a very weak one. I submit that at least the difference between the cost of the old and the new services should be distributed <inline font-style="italic">per capita. .</inline></para>

            <para>- When she entered into Federation, Tasmania asked for an improvement in her mail service. Incidentally that meant an improvement in her passenger service. But will any one seriously contend that any State should be content to continue the old, obsolete, service which it had prior to Federation? If a State is granted an improvement in its mail service, is it to be urged1 that the whole of the cost of that service should be debited to that State? Is not Tasmania paying her proportion of the cost involved in an improvement in, the Vancouver service? In my opinion <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> is not asking for anything that is unreasonable. I quite agree that we should have uniformity in this matter. Let us bring about that.  uniformity by charging the whole of the expenditure on these services upon a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> basis. Certainly the difference between the cost of the old and the new Tas.manian (services1 should be &#39;allocated on that basis. </para>

          <para>- I express the hope that my colleague will be satisfied with the assurance of the Minister. &#34; Fair play is bonnie play.&#34; We have been told that the case which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> has been advocating, with all other similar cases, will be dealt with on one basis by the Ministry. We cannot ask for anything more than that. I have always thought that Tasmania had a claim, but not in respect of the full amount of &#163;11,000.. I have argued with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> himself upon the very lines that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> has argued. Tasmania stipulated that she should get a better service, with more passenger accommodation and greater speed. We have obtained those benefits. True, Tasmania is not the only State that benefits from the improved service, but we have gained to a considerable extent. A point that stands out prominently in this debate is the need for putting the whole of the mail services upon a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> basis, whether thev are Inter- State services or services within a State. It is just as important to a man in a remote corner of the Commonwealth that his letters should be carried swiftly and safely to another part of the same State as it is to a man in Tasmania that his letters should be carried safely to the mainland ot Australia. I think, moreover, that Tasmania will come out of the bargain worse off if we insist upon the whole &#163;11,000 being debited <inline font-style="italic">per capita,</inline> because in that case other mail services must be debited in the same manner. </para>

            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> emphasizes my point. It has been urged that Tasmania has succeeded in making this contract for the benefit of her passenger traffic. Tasmania had nothing whatever to do with it. As to the time we have to wait, I may remark that what I complain of has been going on for many  years. When is it to be discontinued? For- over three years, -certainly, Tasmania has been  paying considerably more than the &#163;6,000 which she formerly paid. I absolutely refuse to wait any longer. I am surprised at what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> has said. I am surprised that he should urge another representative of Tasmania to hesitate to press this motion and do his best to secure its object, on the absolutely ignoble, descreditable, dishonorable grounds-- </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator GIVENS</inline>(Queensland).  -  I voted for the request moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons,</inline> because I think it is a good Federal principle that all mail carriage within the Commonwealth should be a Federal charge. I know there are similar cases elsewhere, with which we have not attempted to deal ; but the fact that we have missed our opportunity in respect to these, does not absolve us from doing what is right in the case of Tasmania. For that reason, although Queensland and Western Australia suffer, I am still prepared to extend this amount of justice to Tasmania. However, I rise to say that, in my view, either the whole amount should be a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> charge, or no part of the amount. For that reason I cannot support the request submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy.</inline> The honorable! senator may laugh, but I think my position is perfectly logical. </para>

As the Committee has decided that the whole vote shall not be treated as a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> charge, I do not see how we can now stultify ourselves, by voting that a certain portion of it, incurred chiefly for the benefit of Tasmania, should be so treated. </para>

        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator TRENWITH</inline>(Victoria).- We are all agreed that the cost of mail services, and every other Federal service, should be distributed on a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> basis between the States. That is the principle underlying the Federal movement, but in order that there should be no great dislocation of existing arrangements, it was provided that during a certain period which has not yet expired, certain bookkeeping should be maintained. That is why this vote does not appear as new expenditure distributed on a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> basis. With reference to the proposal to make &#163;5,000 of the vote <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> expenditure, I point out that while I agree that some portion of the vote should be distributed <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> since it is in no sense transferred expenditure, but added expenditure, it is very difficult&#39; to know what portion of the vote is added expenditure. </para>

I desire to admit quite candidly that Tasmania! asked for the new service, principally because she desired better accommodation for the tourist traffic. Still, whatever advantage Tasmania has derived, it must be admitted that the Commonwealth also derives some advantage,&#39; and I am, therefore, prepared to vote for the &#39;request. </para>

When speaking before, I indicated that if the whole sum of &#163;11,000 was not treated as <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> expenditure, at least the increase of &#163;5,000 should be so treated. I do not believe in moving a request, and immediately afterwards withdrawing it.

There is nothing illogical in the request, and nothing that is not warranted by what has already been sanctioned in the schedule. The Committee has already sanctioned, in regard to the mail service to the Pacific Islands, an arrangement analogous to that which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe</inline> wishes to have made in connexion with Tasmania. Three thousand six hundred pounds is provided under the head of transferred expenditure for a subsidy towards the mail service between New Hebrides and other Islands, while three other amounts - for additional subsidies on condition that black labour is not used, for the extension of the service, and for its improvement - are provided under the heading of &#34;other&#34; expenditure. </para>

          <para>- I would ask honorable senators to agree to the reconsideration of the two items with regard to which it has been decided to prefer requests) to the House of Representatives. In connexion with subdivision No. 1 of division No. 25, relating to Government House, Sydney, the Committee decided to request that the vote be reduced by &#163;1,000. I am now in a position to tell honorable members that, so far as the Government are concerned, this line shall never appear on the Estimates again. If any arrangement is made in the future with regard to the occupation of Government House, Sydney, by the GovernorGeneral, it will have to be embodied in a Bill, and discussed on its merits, altogether apart from the Estimates. I would point out to honorable senators that this vote has been struck off at a moment&#39;s notice, and without any warning to the New South Wales Government, and that, if we insist upon our request, we shall lay ourselves open to the charge of having acted cavalierly towards the State authorities. I feel quite confident that, if I had been able to say last night what I am able to announce this evening, the request would not have been agreed to, and I would therefore ask honorable senators to agree to the reconsideration of the item and the withdrawal of the request. I also desire that the request with regard to the reduction of travelling expenses for members of the Senate should be withdrawn. Honorable senators know that they have already accomplished all that they desired, because the expenditure to which they objected will not be again incurred. If honorable senators will agree to adopt the course I have suggested, the Bill will become law to-morrow, and the public servants of the Commonwealth will receive their salaries at the usual time - on the last day of the month. If, however, the Senate persists in its requests, the payments to public servants of their monthly salaries will be delayed. I therefore move - </para>

He gave no such undertaking. In fact, he went further, and said that he absolutely refused to entertain such a proposal, and that he would vote against the whole item. He went on to say, as a justification for the expenditure, which the Committee subsequently decided was not justifiable, that it was a fair thing to take money out of the Commonwealth purse in one direction, because others - meaning members of the Senate - were helping themselves out of the Commonwealth purse in another direction. When we did get that, information, I gave <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker</inline> an opportunity of preventing any request being made. I said that if he would give an undertaking that such a charge would not be made against the Commonwealth any longer, I would not go on with the request. He refused; and it was because of his refusal, and for no other reason, that the request was made. </para>

            <para>- If the item in regard to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker</inline> is reconsidered, it will be open to the fullest discussion. The other day we dealt only with an admission by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker</inline> that there was an item of&#163;1010s., which he had charged the people of the Commonwealth for the purpose of his own convenience. We accepted that admission without going into details, and during the whole of the discussion we did not, as we might properly have done, deal with the question as to the amount that had been absorbed for the same purpose in previous years. I point out seriously that if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> secures a reconsideration of the question, he will certainly make it possible, and only too easy, for any honorable senator to go into the whole question as to how long these payments have been going on, and as to what the total is which, in the opinion of the Senate, has been wrongly appropriated for the purpose of paying for extra berths for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker.</inline> If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> will let the matter drop now, he will avoid much that may be unpleasant. I warn <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> that if the item is committed, he cannot expect anything buta full and complete inquiry, from the 1st day of May, 1 90 1, to the present day, as to the amount of public moneys appropriated for this particular purpose. </para>

            <para>- Precisely; the Minister says that if it is right to have an inquiry, it is right to go into the whole question from the beginning of Federation. Speaking generally with regard to the reconsideration, it does not add much to the dignity of the Senate for a Minister at 1.30 o&#39;clock a.m., to ask us to reconsider items which have already had proper consideration in our usual hours of sitting. If the Senate adds to the many examples of weakness it has already shown since this Parliament first met, by backing down - for that is what a recommittal would mean in the case of an important measure like the Appropriation Bill - I say advisedly that we shall run considerable risk of becoming a laughing-stock to such members of the public as take an interest in Federal parliamentary proceedings. We shall be told that the moment we are threatened we are prepared to swallow our own opinions. </para>

            <para>- The Minister has been a large mass of threats for the last three or four days, beginning on Friday, when he used a threat, repeated last night, to have an all-night sitting. I said at the time that I thought the Minister was in earnest, and so he proves to be; but I never thought that he would attempt to sit all night on a proposal to reconsider  certain items in the second schedule of the Appropriation Bill. It might have been necessary to insist on the consideration of the Bill being completed, and to that end I should have been glad to assist. I have never wasted two minutes of the time of this Senate since I entered it; but to-night things are changed. I have given a full undertaking to be no party to any obstruction to-morrow if the Senate is now adjourned, and we meet at the time provided for ; but every honorable senator is entitled to protest against an attempt to reconsider what we have already  done at this hour of the night. </para>

          <para>- As the most important request for the reconsideration of which it is proposed to reconsider the second schedule was moved by me, I think that I should be allowed to say a few words at this stage. I repudiate all responsibility for any inconvenience which may occur through our action in delaying the passing of the Bill. If the Government had desired to pass it in a proper, orderly way, they would have sent the requests of the Committee through the House of Representatives, and they must take the responsibility for what has happened. Is the Senate to be a mere recording body? Are we to swallow, holus bolus, without a grimace or a wry face, anything that the Government may choose to put before us? We are asked to reconsider our action in this matter, because of the bluster and bounce of the Premier of New South Wales, whom the Government are anxious to placate. Therefore, they ask us to repudiate to-night what we did last night, after full discussion and fair consideration. It would be ridiculous, and beneath the dignity of the Committee to take such a step. Moreover, according to the metropolitan newspapers of New South Wales, which&#39; the senators from that State continually hold up to us as the leading press organs of the Commonwealth, we shall be carrying out the expressed wishes of the Premier and the people of the State in insisting upon our request. I have no wish to delay a decision on this matter, but I wish to protest as strongly as I can against the proposal&#34;&#34; that the Committee shall go back upon what ft has decided. Are we a parcel of school children that we can be induced, by a threat of a whipping from the Premier of New South Wales, to swallow our principles? Why should we reconsider this matter ? The action that we are now asked to reverse was taken in accordance with the express wish of the Premier of New South Wales, and of the press of that State. A short time ago <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers</inline> openly stated that if the Commonwealth Government did not take care they would be given notice to quit Government House, Sydney. </para>

            <para>- I agree with the honorable senator. I think that the people of Sydney are kicking up all the row, and that the people of New South Wales would act a proper and sensible part if they were left to themselves. The ridiculous jealousy which exists between Sydney and Melbourne, which is; utterly unfederal, is allowed to operate to the detriment of the best interests of the Commonwealth. As I have said, the Premier of New South Wales openly threatened to give us notice to quit Government House, Sydney, and we should not be influenced to reverse our vote merely because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers</inline> has changed his opinion, and has apparently made up his mind to work up a grievance in any case. If he chooses to act as a spoilt child, that is no reason why we, in our &#39;turn, .should make ourselves ridiculous. Last night I read an extract from what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> admitted to be the leading newspaper in New South Wales - the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Morning Herald</inline> - which expressed the opinion that, within a few days, something would be done towards ending the present arrangement, t think we should be wanting in dignity if we refrained from putting an end to that arrangement before we were kicked out. In order to show that, not only the free-trade, but the protectionist press of New South Wales is in favour of the course I propose, I desire to read a leading article which was published in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Star</inline> no later than Monday last. The article is headed &#34;The Houses Twain,&#34; and reads as follows: - </para>

          <para>What everybody knows with respect to the arrangement by which two Government Houses are maintained Th Sydney is that it was led up to under circumstances very different from the existing ones. Nobody dreamt at the time - nobody possibly could dream - of the turn which matters were to take when the Federal Parliament decided as to the financial and other conditions which should regulate its obligations with regard to the Governor-General. No objection here is to be raised to the fact that in the discussion which then took place on the question as to the salary and &#34; allowances &#34; of his Majesty&#39;s representative in the Com&#39;monwealth economy was supposed to be the order of the day. That is a principle indeed which is most admirable in itself, and against which of course not one word is to be said. But in the pursuit of it in the particular instance referred to the economists deliberating in Melbourne came to not a few conclusions which were in the nature of surprises for the people of New South Wales. </para>
          <para>Some of those Federal legislators, it will be remembered, were sufficiently frank in the expression of their opinion that Melbourne was to be considered as the one and only place in the Commonwealth where the Governor-General should have a fixed residence. They laughed to scorn the idea that there was anything in the Constitution which more directly associated the GovernorGeneral in such a relationship with Sydney. This and a great many things besides which were affirmed in the Federal Parliament were most decidedly in the nature of after-thoughts. There was no whisper of them when the question as to how the Governor-General would be apt to divide his time between the two principal Australian capitals was raised in the first instance. The assumption was - and a very natural and reasonable one - that when the Federal Parliament was not actually sitting in Melbourne the GovernorGeneral would reside in Sydney, in the chief city of the State which was to furnish the site for the Federal capital. All this, to be sure, is comparatively ancient history now. It however necessarily recalls itself in connexion with the fact that what may be termed the second chapter in the history of the Governor-General&#39;s official residence in Sydney, as duly provided by agreement between the State and Federal Parliaments, is nearing its close. Is the arrangement to be renewed ? The Federal Government Is understood to be very willing that it should. The prospect however is not a very enticing one for the State. </para>

        <para>Yet honorable senators say that we are seeking to do an injustice to New South Wales. The article proceeds as follows : - </para>
        <quote>
          <para>The Governor-General spends only about three months out of the twelve in Sydney. The upkeep of the establishment, whether occupied or not, tots up to an annual amount which is sufficiently heavy. There has been an expenditure of not less than ,&#163;20,000 incurred with respect to the temporary residence of the State Governor at Cranbrook. The suggestion now is that the State Governor should be assigned the quarters so long identified with his predecessors before Federation came, and that no separate establishment should be maintained for the reception of, the GovernorGeneral on his occasional visits. It is hinted in fact that in future when such a distinguished guest is welcomed by the State it should, so to speak, &#34;board him out,&#34; and let the privilege of entertaining be accorded to the State Governor. Of course in this playing the host to his bigger official brother the State Governor would have to be provided with the ways and means by an allowance from the State Parliament. An arrangement of the kind might bring its inconveniences and difficulties, and possibly might occasion little paltry  hagglings  in Parliament, which would not redound at all to the credit of the State, when it was a maTter of settling the extra outlay incurred when the two Governors were under the one roof. The only thing that is positively certain is that the present system of two Government Houses involves a very large amount of expenditure to no purpose at all. It is utterly useless extravagance. </para>

        <para class="block">We propose to put an end to a condition of affairs which is apparently unsatisfactory to the people of New South Wales, and also to the Commonwealth Government. Certainly, judging from the vote given last night, it is unsatisfactory to honorable senators, who represent the whole of the States. It is represented that we have been loaf- ing upon the mother State, and I think that we should do all we can to remove any such reproach at the very earliest opportunity. We do not desire to loaf on New South Wales. We wish to do the fullest possible justice to that State, as well as to every other State in the Commonwealth. New South Wales, however, is entitled to nothing more than a fair deal, and I shall never be a party to giving her anything more. We are told by the Minister that if we allow the vote of last night to be reversed this item shall never again appear upon the Estimates. He has promised that if the present arrangement is continued it will be under the authority of a specific Bill, which will be discussed in both Houses. I admit at once that that position would be much more satisfactory than is the present one. But the experience of the Commonwealth is that Ministries come and go. A Government may be in power to-day, and may be displaced to-morrow. It may vanish like the mists before the rising sun. Let us suppose that by some turn in the political wheel of fortune the present Government were defeated, what would happen? A new Administration might be formed which would decline to abide by the promise which has been given, and we should then occupy the laughable position of having recorded a certain decision upon one day, and of having reversed ^ it the next. </para>

            <para>- The strongest argument which can be used against the maintenance of an establishment for the GovernorGeneral in Sydney was not brought forward last night. If, out of deference to the views of New South Wales, we continue to maintain a vice-regal residence there, we shall be committing ourselves to a policy which it will be very difficult to abandon. I can easily imagine that after we have removed to the Seat of Government, a claim might be raised for the maintenance of a vice-regal establishment, not only in New South Wales, but also in Victoria. In that case, we should have to maintain no less than three separate residences for the Governor- General, which would be a very expensive matter. Last night, I mentioned what is done by Tasmania in connexion with the annual visit of the Admiral of the Australian Squadron. The Government invite him to that State, and provide him with suitable accommodation. Similarly, if New South Wales desires the Governor- General to reside within her borders during a certain portion of the year, she is entitled to his presence if she is prepared topay for it. In this connexion, let the other States follow the good example which has been set by Tasmania. Then, when we remove to the permanent Seat of Government, we shall not be tram melled by any  precedent  which it will be  difficult  to  overthrow. </para>

          <para>- I agree with the view that two Government Houses are undesirable, and I hold that there is much to be said for reconsidering this item under the circumstances. Much has been made of the fact that we are asked to reverse a vote given last night, and that that seems like changing our minds. It is nothing of the sort. Last night we said that, in our opinion, it is unnecessary to maintain two Government Houses, and in order to emphasize that fact we adopted a somewhat rule of thumb method, by requesting the other House to reduce an item by &#163;1,000. That was a clumsy means of signifying our desire. Now, however, we have an assurance from the Government which I venture to say is bound to be given effect to whether this Government remains in office or not. </para>

            <para>- Decidedly. Sometimes Ministries leave office on account of their policy, and that policy is reversed by an incoming Government. But we are now deciding that, in the opinion  Of  the Senate, it is undesirable that the present method of maintaining two Government Houses should be continued. We have technically decided that the vote for that purpose shall be reduced in the future. We have achieved our object by what we did last night. The question now is whether we can proceed in a way that will prevent friction. I think the way now proposed will have that result. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> has said that there is bad feeling between Melbourne and Sydney. I have always felt that there has been no bad feeling on the part of Melbourne in this matter. Perhaps I am wrong in that, but. at any rate, there is too much of an un-Federal spirit somewhere. If we can achieve our end without causing undue friction, surely it cannot be said that by doing so we have changed our opinion. It is merely a change of method for the achievement of the same object. I earnestly hope that the second schedule will be reconsidered for thepurpose of proceeding in that way. We shall have the assurance that what we desire will be attained, but at the same  time  the undertaking in regard to Sydney Government House will not be terminated in the middle of the arrangement. That is the feature of it that is objectionable. If we terminate the existing agreement at the end of the year, and simply discontinue it for the future,, there will be. less cause of complaint on the part of New South Wales. I have always felt that there has been a great deal too much un-F&#39;ederal spirit since Federation was effected. I am not astonished at that. Such has been the history of all Federations. We have not been unusual in that respect. The great American Federation, which is now work.ing so smoothly, had to contend with a great deal of un-Federal spirit, and with much more severe friction than we have had, in its early years. All true Americans, however, wished1 that that friction should be removed, and I am sure that all true Australians are anxious that such means as are possible shall be taken to remove every cause of ill-feeling in this country. For the mere dread of seeming to change our minds, or being labelled as fickle and unstable, we ought not to be afraid of reversing our decision, or rather of driving home our position in a less objectionable way. </para>

          <para>- I was not able to be present last night when the vote was taken on the matter under discussion. I was paired in favour of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens&#39;</inline> proposed request. I remember very well that some three years ago, when this subject was before us in the Appropriation Bill, I was amongst those who thought that it was entirely opposed! to the spirit of our Constitution that any money should be set apart for a second Government House. I thought that while Melbourne ,was the temporary Seat of Government, there should be one residence- for the Governor-General. But a very strong appeal was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor,</inline> who was then the leader of the Government in the Senate, on the ground that we might appear to be unFederal, and to be doing something which would not foster the Federal spirit, but would promote &#39; friction if we did not agree to what was proposed. If the representatives of the other States take the proper course in refusing to continue this expenditure, I do not see that New South Wales is given any reasonable ground of complaint, or that any friction need result. When this question first came before us I voted for the item, in deference to the appeal of the then leader of the Government in this Chamber, who was from New South Wales, and. in consequence of the representations of other New South </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para class="block">Wales senators, that the whole of the people of that State were anxious for the Governor-General to reside there for a certain period. But I have always felt since that I voted contrary to the spirit of justice, and not in accordance with the interests of Tasmania or any of the other States. It seems a -most ridiculous assumption that, because New South Wales happens to be the oldest State, and the largest in point of population, it has a claim to a residence for the GovernorGeneral at the cost of the Commonwealth. The sooner the Federal Capital is established in New South&#34; Wales the better ; but until that time arrives it is absurd to maintain a second Government House. I am fortified in that opinion by the fact that the very Federal spirit we are asked to show to New South Wales is absent on the part of the Parliament and Government of that State, though I do not say it is missing on the part of the people. As a matter of fact, almost every possible insult was, in the course- of recent correspondence, heaped on the Federal Parliament and Government by the Premier of New South Wales, supported by a majority of his Parliament. I deny that any want of the Federal spirit Has been shown on the part of the Federal Parliament, and I am glad the Committee took the action it did last night, if only as a protest, which will make it clear that i.he Federal Parliament has &#34;turned&#34; at last. Indeed, it is probably largely owing to the miserable, pettifogging spirit displayed by the Premier- of New South Wales, and to the language and threats he used, that that action was taken. I may say that, though I was absent, I was paired in favour of the request to strike out the item ; but at the. same time I recognise, after giving the matter earnest consideration, that the Government are taking a proper course under the circumstances. I take that view, not because of any idea that the retention of the item might harass the Government in another place. </para>

            <para>- On the contrary, we shall have done a great deal. The agreement will not be renewed by the Go vernment because of the action taken last night by the Committee of the Senate. With regard to the other item which the Government proposes should be reconsidered, I can have no objection to its reconsideration, because I voted against the request. When we discussed the question, I said, as I say now, that I did not agree with the action taken by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker,,</inline> and I certainly could not agree with his very unworthy remark, &#34;Some members of the Senate get it in one way, and some in another.&#34; It is just as well that the honorable senator should know that every member of the Senate takes exception to that very unworthy remark, which would leave it to be understood that we desire to &#34;get at&#34; the Commonwealth. I utterly repudiate that suggestion. I have no desire to &#34; get at &#34; the Commonwealth, if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker</inline> has. As I voted against the request for the reduction of the item of &#163;1010s., I have no objection to the reconsideration of that request. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator CROFT</inline>(Western Australia).Last night by my vote I expressed my objection to keeping up a Governor-General&#39;s residence in Sydney. I desire to be consistent to-night, and in order to do so, I find it necessary to vote for a reconsideration of the subdivision dealing with that matter. I supported the request for the reduction of the vote by &#163;1,000. I am satisfied that Government House, Sydney, might be kept up as a residence for the GovernorGeneral, even though the vote should be cut down in the way proposed by honorable senators. The leader of the Government in the Senate has promised, with the consent of all his colleagues, that the vote will never appear again in an Appropriation Bill and that if any new arrangement is proposed as to where the Governor- General shall reside until the Federal Capital is established, we shall be given an opportunity to record a vote upon it in a specific Bill. Let us look at this matter as practical men, not allowing its consideration to be affected by personal spleen. We have already spent about half the sum set down in the Bill, and to reduce the vote by &#163;1,000 would not prevent the Governor-General from going to Sydney to reside, if he wished to  do  so. Besides, we ought to give notice  of  our intention  to  quit. I should like to deal with this matter by such a Bill as the Minister of Defence has spoken of. </para>

          <para>- I am very glad that honorable senators consider that the Bill should be recommitted for the reconsideration of the subdivision relating to Sydney Government House. I recognise that a number of them are opposed to the maintenance of two houses for the Governor-General, and, as a representative of New South Wales, I shall be glad to have the whole matter settled clearly and definitely by means of a Bill. Such an arrangement would put an end to the long and acrimonious discussions which arise when this matter comes before us in the Appropriation Bill each year. </para>

            <para>- I regret that there has been friction between the Commonwealth and the State of New South Wales in regard to the settlement of the Federal Capital Site. I do not defend the New South Wales Parliament or the New South Wales Premier, because they have made serious mistakes, nor do I exonerate the Commonwealth; but we should realize the friction which exists, and should do all we can to remove it. If the New South Wales Parliament says that it wishes to terminate the arrangement in regard to Sydney Government House, well and good ; but do not let us be accused of adding fuel to the flames by interfering with the understanding already existing. The people of New South Wales have felt that the Governor-General should reside in that&#39; State for a portion of the year, and if a Bill is introduced, I shall be prepared te explain mv reasons for desiring the continuance of the present arrangement; but I shall not debate the subject further now. With regard to the request affecting <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker,</inline> I think that, a protest having been made, we have done all that is necessary. The chief officer of the Senate will, no doubt, feel bound in  honour to regard the opinions which have been axpressed, so that the matter can be settled without further heat or unpleasantness. </para>

            <para>- I am tired of hearing that excuse. If the Government had forwarded the requests of the Committee, the measure could have been dealt with very rapidly. The delay has been caused by the refusal of the Government to act on the express wishes of honorable senators. If we now vote the money it will be equivalent to saying that we desire that it shall be spent. The Government should have accepted the decision of the Senate, and sent the request on to the House of Representati ves . </para>

          <para>- I have no objection to the proposed recommittal, but so far as the ten guineas for travelling expenses is concerned I shall vote exactly as I did on a previous occasion. My reason for adopting this attitude is this : We have had an indication to-night of the absolute impotency of the Administration. We were told that a certain officer of the Commonwealth purloined a certain sum of money, that several months elapsed before the Government knew whether they could dismiss him, and that it cost &#163;80 to obtain that information. In the event of our voting these ten guineas,&#39; who knows- but that when another twelve months have elapsed1, the Government will feel bound to make provision for a similar sum on the next Estimates, lest the man who might have spent the money should claim compensation ? I certainly think that we should prevent any such provision from ever again being made. At the risk of being regarded as inconsistent,  I am prepared to reverse my vote with regard to the reduction of the amount set down for the maintenance of the Government House and grounds in Sydney. I am induced to db this by the promise given by the Minister of Defence that any further arrangement that may be made with the New South Wales Government with regard to the occupation of Government House, Sydney, by the Governor-General, will be embodied in a Bill, and submitted to the Senate for consideration on its merits. It seems to me that, in the first instance, honorable senators did not take the trouble to acquaint themselves with the actual bearings of the situation. They were in ignorance as to whether or not there was any agreement between the Commonwealth and the New South Wales Government with regard to the occupation of Government House. Sydney. I place implicit confidence in the assurance given by the representative of the Government, so far as that particular matter is concerned, and I shall vote accordingly. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator CLEMONS</inline>(Tasmania). - So far. I have not touched upon the second question proposed for reconsideration. I admit at once that I regard it as the more important of the two, and I regret that we should have to seriously con sider such a proposal at this unreasonable hour. One of the chief advantages enjoyed by this Chamber in comparison with other Upper Houses is that &#34;it possesses the power to make requests for amendments in Bills which appropriate money. But up to the present time we have not made a single request to the other Chamber to amend an Appropriation Bill. Last night this item was discussed very earnestly and exhaustively, and it was decided that a request ought to be made in respect of it. I hold that before taking any backward step we should assert the right of the Senate to deal with the measure in an effective way. &#39; Upon the merits of this question, I desire to say that I am not animated by jealousy towards New South Wales. Indeed, if there is one State, apart from Tasmania, towards, which I am more friendly than another, it is New South Wales.&#39;&#39; </para>

            <para>- To me the Minister&#39;s statement throws a new light upon the subject. It is practically an undertaking that if this item be retained on the present Estimates, it will not appear upon the Estimates of next year. I accept the Minister&#39;s assurance, but I hold that it affords a poor reason why we should waive our undoubted rights in connexion with this matter. I admit that there is not the faintest&#39; chance that a Bill dealing with the matter will ever be submitted for our consideration. That suggestion has been put forward with a view to capturing the votes of some honorable senators. I believe that the very name of &#34;Bill&#34; has been sufficient to catch the votes of Senators Henderson and O&#39;Keefe. </para>

I do not doubt the assurance that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> has given. But it is a very poor excuse for reversing a vote of the Senate to say that the objectionable vote will not appear upon next year&#39;s Estimates.

            <para>- There is no Bill which could be of greater importance to the Senate, as affording an opportunity to assert the position which this Chamber ought to hold. There is no party question involved. In the affair of the disbursements by the  President,  I shall do as I did before, because I do not like to reverse my vote; but, apart from that consideration, I have no strong feeling in the matter. As to the subject immediately under consideration, however, I take a different stand, because we are afforded a good opportunity to assert our strong position in regard to the Appropriation Bill. I have entered my protest, and I think, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> that if you at this moment occupied a seat elsewhere in the Chamber, you would join with me in objecting to the misuse of the power which the majority may exercise. If the Minister of Defence persists, I say advisedly and calmly that he will be largely responsible for distinctly lowering the position of the Senate, which has fallen low enough in past years. There is nothing to prevent our meeting early in the morning, except the convenience of a few people in the matter of telegrams. That is the only reason <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> can suggest for degrading the Senate. I should be. glad, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> ifyou were to express your view of the action proposed by the Government for the reconsideration of these items, in order that the Committee may reverse its vote, and failto give public expression to its opinion on these subjects. I am certain that if you did so it would be likely to have some effect upon the Minister. </para>

        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator PEARCE</inline>(Western Australia). - I have not occupied the time of the Committee at all on this question, and as our trains will not leave for some little time, I may as well say a word or two. Never on any occasion have I altered a vote I have previously given with less compunction than I shall do on this occasion. When I voted for the request for the reduction of the vote for the up-keep of Sydney Government House, I did so, not with the object of inconveniencing the Government, or lending assistance to &#34; stone-walling &#34; in another place, but in order to terminate the practice of keeping up two residences for the Governor-General. I find that I have accomplished my object. The Government now say that if they are responsible for the framing of next year&#39;s Estimates - and when I come to consider those who sit opposite, I devoutly hope they will be - they will not bring forward this item in those Estimates. Many honorable senators who are present to-night were members of the first Federal Parliament, and they will recollect that every time an Appropriation Bill has come before the Senate there has been a squabble over this particular item. Its removal from the Estimates will have at least this good effect - it will put an end to that annual squabble. Then the leader of the Government in the Senate, says that if the Ministry has any proposals to make with respect to a second Government House, they will submit them in the form of a Bill. If, when that measure is brought before us, it provides for two Commonwealth&#39; Government Houses, and we think there should be but one, we can amend the Bill, as we shall be masters of the situation. I regard that as satisfactory. I scarcely know on which point <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> feels most strongly, but for some undefinable reason it would appear that the honorable senator greatly desires that the Committee should adjourn now,- and meet again at 10.30 a.m. That appears to be an object of tremendous importance to the honorable senator. </para>

          <para>- I do not like the course, which we have now adopted on several occasions, of coming to a decision on one day and reversing it the next. On the 17 th June, 1902, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> moved the reduction of the vote for the rent, repairs, and maintenance of Sydney Government House by <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1,</inline> with a view to expressing the opinion of honorable senators that the expenditure was unnecessary, and next day we reconsidered our decision and withdrew the request. Of course the position has altered greatly, since then, bv reason of the deliberate statement of the Minister of Defence that he can promise, with the consent of his colleagues, that the item shall not appear again in the Appropriation Bill. Therefore, if we sent the request to the other House, and it refused to accept it, we should not be in such a strong position as we are in now. We have objected to the expenditure, and I hope will always object to expenditure which&#39; we consider unwise ; but I think that our object will be secured if we do not press matters further. I am sorry that so much has, perhaps inevitably been made out of the expenditure bv the  President  of &#163;10 10s. on sleeping berths. It would have been better if we had intimated our own views on the subject without the lengthy newspaper reports which&#39; have appeared ; but I think that the vote come to the other night shows the opinion of honorable senators, and it will not be necessary to send the request to the other House to have it complied with. </para>

        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator PLAYFORD</inline>(South Australia - Minister of Defence). - I maintain that there is nothing childish about the course which honorable senators are being asked to adopt, because our object is to pass the Bill at the earliest possible moment. If. we insisted upon our request, the Bill would have to be sent back to the House of Representatives, where it would require to be considered in Committee. That would involve delay, which would result in serious inconvenience to the whole of our public servants whose salaries would not be paid upon the usual date, namely, the last day of the month&#39;. But for the delay that would be involved. I should never have asked honorable senators to reconsider the matter, because I am quite certain that, the vote being one connected with the Senate, honorable members in another place would have readily agreed to our request. </para>
