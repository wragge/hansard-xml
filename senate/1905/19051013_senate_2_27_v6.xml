                        <para>- I ask leave to withdraw the amendment for the present. Apparently some honorable senators either misunderstood the remarks with which I first introduced the amendment to their notice, or assumed, because I said that if adopted the whole of this part would require to be recast, that necessarily it would involve material amendments therein. I desire to indicate what alterations would be necessary in order to give honorable senators the fullest opportunity of considering an amendment which, as the Minister said, is far-reaching, and which, I think, will certainly make for the smooth working of our electoral machinery. Under the principal Act a Commissioner is appointed for each State to divide the State into a number of electorates corresponding with the number of members which it returns to the House of Representatives. After he has discharged that duty and published the design of' his work, and invited objections thereto, a certain period is allowed for the lodging of any objections or suggestions. In the light of any objections or suggestions which may be lodged, he has to revise his scheme. After the revision is completed the scheme has to be submitted to the Minister, and to be accepted or rejected by each House of the Parliament. It is only when the scheme has received the approval of each House that it can become operative. In the past some schemes have not been acceptable to honorable members. There must be an inherent objection on the part of those honorable members whose constituencies are affected by a proposed change in their boundaries. It seems to me inevitable that in such cases the representatives are hardly in a position to be impartial judges as to what is best in the interests of the whole community.. The main object of my amendment is to remove from parliamentary control the question of the distribution of the States into electorates. In order to remove this pernicious influence, I propose to create a Commission for each State which will follow the same procedure as is now followed by an individual Commissioner up to the point where a scheme is revised in the light of the objections or suggestions offered. After the revision of the scheme by the Commissioner for a State, I propose that it shall become operative without reference to both Houses. If the determination of this important question is to be removed from parliamentary control, it would be somewhat dangerous - perhaps open to serious objection - if it were placed in the hands of a single individual. For that reason, I propose that in each State there shall be three Commissioners instead of one Commissioner, believing that, in this case at any rate, there may be wisdom in a multitude of counsellors. I have suggested three officials whose special qualifications and positions seem to me to offer a guarantee that the work would be performed, not only impartially, but accurately. I have suggested the appointment of a Judge of each State, the head of the Survey Department of the State, and the Chief Commonwealth Electoral Officer for the State. I am not particularly wedded to those three officials, but they appear to me to possess special qualifications for the performance of the work. The Chief Electoral Officer would be familiar with the working of the Electoral Act, and would be able to deal with the enrolment and grouping of electors very readily. The knowledge which would be possessed by the head of the Survey Department ought to be particularly valuable in determining boundaries and delineating them upon maps. It is desirable to have upon the Commission for each State a gentleman who would readily understand the purpose of the Act, and be able to determine fairly on the evidence submitted, and who, in addition, would bring to the work considerable capacity and that unchallengeable impartiality which has always been accredited to our Judges. My amendment, however, makes provision for the appointment of other persons if any cause should . arise to prevent any one of those three officials from acting . on the Commission. It may happen that either of these officers may be incapacitated through ill-health or absence on holiday, and it is, therefore, desirable to leave the Executive with some power to make another appointment. I have done that. But in the amendment which I have Suggested, the indication is so clear that these three officers are to form the Commission, that, except on such occasions as those to which I have referred, the Government would feel that they had no option to appoint any one else. I submit the amendment, and I invite honorable senators to consider it thoroughly, as I am sure they will do. I put it forward free from all party significance. It is to the interest of every party, of every member of Parliament, and of every elector, to have our electoral machinery as free from any pernicious outside influence as possible. It should be made free from party interest or personal intrigue, and from even the suspicion in the mind of any elector that it is not absolutely fair and uniform, and beyond the possibility of influence in any emergency or contingency which may arise in ordinary party conflicts. Whilst I am in no sense wedded to the particular words I have chosen, or to the details of the scheme, I do invite the Committee to see whether it is not possible by the acceptance of the proposal I submit to place our electoral machinery above the turmoil of party conflict or the advantages or disadvantages of the circumstances surrounding individual cases. I ask permission to withdraw the amendment for the time being. </para>

                <para class="block">The purpose of these subdivisions seem to me to be' as follows: At the present time we have in our electoral machinery electorates and subdivisions which are called polling-places. A polling place represents rather a division of an electorate than an area; but it creates that division in an electorate. It is proposed to have a further class of divisions, called subdivisions ; and those subdivisions are to be entirely optional. The proposal is made, I understand, in order to enable us in adjusting our electorates to work in with the requirements of the States in adjusting theirs. I admit that that is a very desirable object to attain wherever we can do it. But there is always the question how much you get in paying for an advantage; and it seems to me that the advantage to be derived is very problematical and doubtful, and is far outweighed by the complication and disadvantage that will arise. </para>

                        <para>- If honorable senators read the minute prepared by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Garran</inline> they will see at once that the ground work of this Bill is a scheme for the division of the whole of a State into subdivisions, which were' to be the units of the main scheme. These units were to be so reasonably small that it would be possible to group any number of them together to make an electorate. If it were found that an electorate was too large, whilst an adjoining electorate was too small, the idea was that one of these units should be taken off the larger electorate and added to the smaller one. The idea also was that this scheme would enable the States to group any number of the units together to make a State electorate. That would be an excellent plan if we were able to carry it out. But it is not possible to do so. It was pointed out by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Garran</inline> that to divide the whole of Australia into units of this character, so that they could be grouped in the way I have described, would be impossible; because it would mean not merely drawing out these localities upon the map, but having also absolutely clearly defined boundaries that could be gazetted. It is admitted, I think, that to divide Australia in that way at present would be a stupendous undertaking. The units would have to be fairly small. It is a matter of estimate, but honorable senators will see that to make that scheme easily workable the unit would have to contain not more than two or three hundred electors ; otherwise it would not be workable. If you were to divide the whole of Australia into areas, each containing approximately, that number of electors, it would mean covering Australia with lines so numerous, and in many cases so long, that it would probably take all the Survey Department's of all the States, and a large sum of money, to complete the work. That fact is recognised, and therefore it is not proposed to do it except in certain cases. The fact that the proposal is not to be uniform is the the first objection I have to it. </para>

You can take a block formed by four streets. There is a boundary clearly defined. It is rather in the rural districts that the difficulty would arise. </para>

                        <para>- I do not say anything of the kind. I am pointing out the disadvantages, and I say that one is that you cannot get uniformity. A second objection is that it is desirable to have simplicity in our electoral laws. If it is desirable in any law to have simplicity it is especially desirable to have an electoral law which an ordinary individual can understand. This Bill proposes that in some cases there shall be polling-place areas; in several other cases subdivision areas. In one case there may be a subdivision and no polling-place, and in another place there may be a polling-place and no subdivision. In one case a subdivision may be coterminous with a polling-place; in another a subdivision may contain several polling places; whilst in a third a polling-place may contain several subdivisions. As there are different directions as to how an elector may get enrolled, whether he is in a division or polling-place area, he would not know what to do or how to do it, and another elector would not know how to tell him how to get registered, because he would not know the circumstances surrounding any other person's electorate. Therefore, on the ground of its lack of simplicity, I oppose this proposal. Whatever small sum of money may be saved it would be altogether a ruinous bargain for us to make. </para>

                        <para>- No, but I object to an additional subdivision. This Bill proposes to make polling-place areas surrounding each polling-place. To that I have no objection. But when you bring in an alternative subdivision which is not to be uniform, and which may take the place of a polling-place area, and may run side by side with it, the effect may be that we may have one subdivision in one electorate which may contain several polling-places, whilst we may have other subdivisions without polling-places. </para>

                        <para>- But there is some simplicity. Take the case of an ordinary elector. Our present machinery provides that there may be several polling-places within a division to meet the convenience of electors. At the present time a man may vote anywhere within his division. If one polling-place is not convenient to him he may enroll to vote at another place which may be more convenient. But if you had subdivisions as here proposed you would compel an elector to vote within his particular subdivision. The subdivisions are proposed in order to enable either a State or the Commonwealth to transfer bodily the electors living within that subdivision to another electorate. Consequently under this Bill you would absolutely compel the elector to vote within his subdivision. </para>

                        <para>- The object of the amendment is to enable the Commonwealth and the States to work together in the re distribution of electorates. And that is extremely desirable, if it can be done without imposing any disadvantage on the elector. Honorable senators will recollect the confusion which existed in the minds of electors, and of parliamentary representatives as well, at the last election, when nobody seemed to know exactly where they stood, and when the newspapers were so full of complaints and inquiries, that a joint Select Committee was appointed to investigate the matter. Is it not possible to simplify rather than complicate our electoral machinery ? It is not as if it were proposed to have a uniform system, so that all electorates would be similarly dealt with. It is proposed to have alternative subdivisions, with the possibility that no two electorates will be alike. If the idea were to apply to the system generally, I admit that the chief force of my objection would be gone. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. I should like to know whether the Minister can give us any idea as to the extent he thinks this proposal could and would be availed of. I venture to say that the Minister cannot give us any definite idea on the matter, because this is a provision merely for some circumstances which may arise, and which as time goes on, may be shown to be desirable. The advantages are entirely speculative and problematical, and are far outweighed by the disadvantages arising from want of uniformity, complications, and increased uncertainty in the mind of the ordinary elector. </para>

We could not attempt to pass a definite law at once to bring about those results which. I think, both from the Commonwealth and the States' point of view, are deemed to be desirable. At the Hobart Conference of Premiers the principle was affirmed that, as far as possible., the States and the Commonwealth should co-operate in electoral administration.

                        <para>- I am not aware whether any individual State has taken action, but this is the first attempt on the part of the Commonwealth to give some effect to the principle. We could not provide in the Bill that the Governor-General should absolutely forthwith, or by a certain date, divide up all the divisions of each of the States in such a way that the Commonwealth and the States could act jointly, and take advantage of the same rolls, officers, and machinery. But in order to do as much as possible, it is proposed that the Governor-General, in any case he thinks fit, may, by proclamation, divide divisions into subdivisions. In a certain State it might be possible to deal with every division on these lines. It might be possible to subdivide each Commonwealth division in such a way that the States would be able to take advantage of the subdivisions and subdivisional rolls, officers, and machinery ; and in such case the benefits would be mutual. </para>

                        <para>- That is so; half-a-dozen electorates in a State might be dealt with. On the other hand, there might be a particular State in which it would be found impracticable to carry out work of that character. If we were to throw upon the Governor-General the responsibility of either doing this work absolutely throughout Australia at the one time, or not doing it at all, we should, in my opinion, be taking a wrong course; and the optional provision is to enable the plan to be carried out whenever and wherever practicable. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> seems to think that a subdivisional system would operate in such a way as to prevent an elector from enjoying some right he now possesses. That, however, is not the case. Of course, it is provided later on that if a division be divided into subdivisions, an elector may only have his name on the roll for the subdivision in which he lives; and the interjection of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> suggests the object of that provision. Whenever we use the word " division " in this Bill, or in the principal Act, a Commonwealth electorate is meant, such as Balaclava, Melbourne, Darwin, or Bass. At present each and every one of these divisions has within it a number of polling places, which are established rather with regard to groups of electors than to particular territorial considerations. If the electorate of Melbourne, for instance, were divided into five subdivisions, there would be no reason why each and every one should not have a number of polling places. There may, in fact, be one polling place for parts of two divisions. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Garran,</inline> in his memorandum, which was submitted to the Hobart Conference, and which appeared as an appendix to the report of the proceedings, says: - </para>

Even if I did admit that there is a restriction of the kind suggested, it would be no hardship to the elector, who is placed on the roll for a particular subdivision for a reason which must be quite apparent. The reason is that he lives in that subdivision for which his name will appear on the Commonwealth roll ; and if arrangements under this Bill be made with the States, the presence of the name on that roll will enable the elector, as a State elector, to vote in that subdivision, which, under another name, will be a State division. </para>

                        <para>- This provision is to prevent an elector having his name on the roll for more than one subdivision. If we are going to have subdivisions and divisions, an elector's name should not appear on more than one subdivisional roll, because that might give him an extra vote in a Commonwealth, and two or three votes in a State election for separate State electorates. If honorable senators will remember that the provision is not intended to limit a man's right to vote in any way, but simply to prevent the possibility of his name being duplicated on a Commonwealth electoral roll, and so at the same time appearing on the rolls of two or more State electoral divisions, they will see that it is not only a desirable, but a necessary provision. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so. I. have pointed out that where subdivisional rolls may be availed of by Commonwealth and State authorities, it would not be desirable to register a Commonwealth elector for any subdivision other than that in which he lives. One effect might be that he would absolutely lose his vote for the State electorate comprising the Commonwealth subdivision in which he lives, as it might be contended that he was not entitled to be on the State roll which included any other subdivision of the Commonwealth division. If we are going to act in co-operation with the States in this matter, we must recognise that it may be necessary to impose on electors, in very infrequent cases, some personal inconvenience, but the balance of advantage to the individual and to the community, from the stand-point of Commonwealth and of State, will result from the establishment of some such principle as is here affirmed. I think that the States Governments will carry out the resolution arrived at by the Premiers' Conference, with the result that in the not far distant future the advantages and economies which we hope will follow from co-operative electoral administration throughout the Commonwealth, will be secured. </para>

                    <para>- I recognise that the object of the clause is a very worthy one; but I point out that substituted clause 24 is left purely optional, and I confess that I should prefer to see it put in some stronger form. It is in sharp contrast in this respect with the mandatory construction of sub-clause 2 of substituted clause 31. I do not care to use the word " shall " in connexion with the Governor-General, but I think that in the use of the phrase "if he thinks fit to do so," there is an element of danger. It would be preferable to provide that " the Governor-General may in every case in which it is possible" - using the word "may" in the sense of " shall." </para>

                        <para>- The object of the clause is not merely to simplify the Commonwealth electoral machinery, but to make the best effort we can in this Bill to work in harmony with the State electoral laws. It is also proposed, where possible, to divide an electoral division for the House of Representatives into subdivisions which will comprise two or more State electorates. If we can succeed in giving effect to that object, we shall obviously be co-operating more closely than we are at present with the various States in their electoral legislation. I refer again to the contrast between substituted clause 24 and sub-clause 2 of substituted clause 31. In the latter case, we are saying to the Commonwealth electors that although it may be convenient for them to determine on what roll of a Commonwealth division their name shall be registered, yet for the purpose of working in harmony with the States, we have decided to limit them to registration for the subdivision in which they absolutely reside. If we were framing an Electoral Bill without regard to States legislation on the same subject, I do not suppose that such a proposal would be made. We should certainly provide that an elector should have his name placed only on one roll, but we are here deliberately saying that every Commonwealth elector shall forego certain rights or privileges which, in other circumstances, he might very properly demand, in order that we may work in harmony with the requirements of the various States. </para>

I should like substituted clause 24 altered in the way I suggest. At present it is left entirely optional with the Executive for the time being to effect some sort of subdivision which may make for harmony with States legislation. As this is left optional, the Executive may refuse to do what is proposed, and there would be no danger in using the words " the Governor-General may in any case in which it is possible." That would make it evident that we are absolutely in earnest in this endeavour to help the States to simplify their electoral machinery, and to save expense to the citizens of the Commonwealth. </para>

                    SMITH.We did not, but with the experience we have since gained, we are in a position to make certain improvements. When we have exactly the same people, under exactly the same franchise, electing members for the Federal and States Legislatures, it is strange that we should require different rolls, necessitating the heavy expense of twice collecting the names of electors for the compilation of those rolls. It is: absurd to say that purely technical difficulties should prevent us from adopting such a clause as is here proposed. Surely the united wisdom of officials, draftsman, and Parliament will enable us to arrive at some solution of the difficulties mentioned by
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen.</inline>
                    in order that this reform may not be blocked. The proposal made is that where a Commonwealth division comprises two or more State electorates there shall be subdivisions of the Commonwealth division. Where a Commonwealth division comprises three State electorates, we shall have three different rolls for that division, which will at the same: time be the rolls for the separate State electorates. I cannot see why there should be any difficulty in bringing that about, so that an elector may be able to vote for a Federal member on exactly the same roll, and in exactly the same manner as he wilt vote for a State member.

                        <para>- The principal object of the clause is to avoid' the duplication of expense in the preparation of rolls for Commonwealth and State electorates. I really cannot see any difficulties in this matter. If a Commonwealth election is taking place, an elector can goto a polling place, and, if he is enrolled, he can vote there in just the same manner as he could vote at a State election, provided that all the conditions of the law had been complied with. I believe that an enormous expense would be saved by the adoption of the provision. It would not come into operation throughout the whole of the Commonwealth in the first instance, but as it gradually came into force we could see how it worked. We should endeavour to make the machinery of the Commonwealth as little expensive as possible to the people. In all the States there is a great outcry that the "new" expenditure under the Commonwealth is very much greater than was estimated at the Adelaide Convention. The States Treasurers are continually complaining of the increase in the "new" expenditure. I believe that if there are any difficulties in the way, they can be overcome in the interests of economy. </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline>
                    desires. The word " may " is used there as governing all the powers which are specified in paragraphs
                    <inline font-style="italic">a</inline>
                    to
                    <inline font-style="italic">d.</inline>
                    Undoubtedly the power vested in the Minister by paragraph
                    <inline font-style="italic">a</inline>
                    is one which he would have to exercise, and for the non-exercise of which he would be responsible immediately to the Parliament and the country. I do not think that there is any necessity to deviate from the drafting which is used in this instance, and is usual in all such cases. I think we can well expect that when the Minister is vested by a section of an Act with a number of powers, some of which he has to exercise at his discretion, and others of which he must exercise in the public interests when the contingency arises, he will do his duty. We had better adhere to the provision as it stands, and not, as I said on a previous occasion, in reply to
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline>
                    introduce at this stage a distinction between "shall" and "may" which might give rise to a considerable amount of discussion as to the meaning of words which have been used in so many Acts of this Parliament.

                    because I feel quite certain that he is right in his contention. Practically the only argument we have heard against making the proposed alteration now is that we have been committing this error since the institution of this Parliament. It may suit
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline>
                    to argue that when we have been travelling along the road of error for a very considerable time it is inadvisable to deviate, but, somehow or other, that sort of argument' does not generally find much favour here when there are honorable senators present to hear it. This question has been considered, as
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline>
                    once pointed out, by the Parliament of New South Wales, and section 23 of their Interpretation Act reads as follows -

                <quote>
                    <para>Whenever in an Act a power is conferred on any officer or person by the word " may," such word shall mean that the power may be exercised or not, at discretion. </para>
                </quote>
                <para>Is not that precisely what we want to do? There are occasions when we want to give discretion to an officer or person, as I am reminded by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> we do in a later part of this clause. On the other hand, there are many occasions on which we want to say definitely, that the Minister shall do certain things, and do not wish to give him a discretion to do them or to leave them undone. The provision in the Interpretation Act of New South Wales goes on to say - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>But where the. word "shall'" confers the power, such word shall mean that the power must be exercised. </para>
                </quote>
                <para>Frequently we are confronted with a case in which it is our distinct intention that a power shall be exercised, and that there shall be no possibility of evading the exercise thereof. When we desire to bring about that result, we should use the word "shall" in contradistinction to the word "may." A practice has grown up here which largely destroys the value of one of these two words, and has the result of causing "may" to be interpreted as "shall." I think it is high time that we took a stand on this matter. I do not believe that any member of the Committee wishes to use either " may " or " shall " in a slipshod way. If we do not start to use the right word now, when is a start to be made? The longer we go on making this blunder the more firmly will it become established. I trust that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> will call for a division, and will draw our attention to the fact whenever the word " may " is wrongly used in a measure. Of course the provision in. the New South Wales Act applies to any officer or person, but not to the Governor. </para>

We have already taken up more than an hour in discussing this question. A former Committee decided upon the use of the word " may " in such cases. I see no reason to depart from the language of the provision. On a previous occasion I pointed out that if we tried to use " shall " when we meant "shall," and ' " may " when we meant " may " we should get into a state of confusion. </para>

                    in spite of his moderate exaggeration of about 300 per cent. when he said we had been discussing this question for an hour, although it is not yet a quarter of an hour since I moved the amendment, to observe that the provision is not consistent as regards the use of this word, because later on it says that there shall be rolls of the electors in each State. There is no greater necessity for affirming in clear terms that there shall be rolls than there is for saying that there shall be a chief polling place. The one without the other would be useless. Why should we affirm that there shall be a roll for each division, and only say that there may be a place at which the persons whose names are on that roll can vote? If, as
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline>
                    says, the word " may " places an obligation upon the Minister when the public necessity requires him to do a thing, to do it, equally it would be quite sufficient if we said that there may be rolls of the electors in each State. That is the only option. However, I shall not labour the point. If, because a previous Act affirmed a certain thing, we ought not to alter it, we should not have passed such amending clauses as have already been agreed to in this Bill. It is because previous legislation was wrong that we remedy it. If I could get the Committee to my way of thinking, the way would be open for possible amendments of our Acts Interpretation Acts, which would at once remove all possible danger. I point out that we have already passed a clause which says that the Governor-General may "appoint a Registrar." Now we come to a clause dealing with the Minister. We are not usually so sensitive in dealing with Ministers as we are in dealing with the Governor-General. Surely there can be no objection to say that the Minister " shall " do what is desired. But if " may " is to be retained here, we ought to make the Bill uniform by using " may " in clause 16,' where the word " shall " is used as applicable to rolls. I shall not withdraw the amendment.

                    has attempted to draw between the use of the word " may " in the provision under notice, and the use of the word "shall" in clause 1.6, is not a correct one. The latter provision says "There shall be rolls." It does not say that the Minister shall prepare rolls. But if we were using the words in connexion with a particular person we might say "may." Wherever officers are intrusted with judicial or administrative functions, we use the word "may," which the Courts have interpreted in certain classes of cases to mean" shall."

                        <para>- That is what I think ought to be done if any amendment is to be made. But even then we may create difficulties. We should have to go through all our past Acts, and pick out the individual instances in which Parliament intended the word " may " to mean " may " in the popular sense, and where it meant " may " to mean " shall," and we should have to pass a comprehensive enactment governing all those cases. I repeat that I am in favour of the principle mentioned, but I doubt whether this is the proper way to carry it out. I would ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> not to press his amendment in this case, because if it were carried it might lead to obscurity and danger in many other places. </para>

                    has created a difficulty with regard to the Acts Interpretation Act, and says that if we pass this amendment, we shall find ourselves in trouble with regard to our previous legislation. The answer is that the New South Wales Parliament must have found itself precisely in the same position. But it did not refrain from passing an amendment on that account, and evidently it created no confusion in so doing. There would be none. Further, there is nothing whatever to prevent us from passing
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen's</inline>
                    amendment. . But the real difficulty that faces us is this - that at present we are sometimes using " may " to give discretion, and sometimes when we intend to impose an obligation. There is the strongest difference in the world between giving a discretion, and imposing an obligation, and yet we are told that when we read " may " in our Acts, it does not mean that discretion is granted, but that the Courts will interpret it as obligatory. The fact is, we have used the word in both senses, and I defy any one to go through our Acts, and to say exactly where, when " may " is used, a discretion is permitted, or an obligation imposed. The only solution appears to be that when we intend to give a discretion we should use an obviously absurd word, "might."

There may be separate rolls for each polling place, and the provision for the establishment of a polling-place area is very desirable in connexion with more thickly populated centres.

                    (Tasmania - Honorary Minister). - A polling-place area is really in effect a particular division, and the phrase is new in the Bill. It is proposed to give the Minister power to define by certain boundaries an area for which a' particular polling-place shall be the polling-place. At the same time, of course, it will be competent for anybody in an electorate, if the polling-place area be in his subdivision, to be registered for the particular polling-place, although he may not live within the polling-place area. The object of the clause is to carry out, as far as possible, the desired co-operation with the States, and it will be extremely convenient if the electors, say, in one metropolitan electorate can be grouped together bodily, in such a way as to work harmoniously with the State electoral machinery.

                    (Tasmania).- I begin to understand that "division" means a Commonwealth electorate, and that the desire is that "sub-division" should, in many cases, practically refer to a State electorate. I recognise that another division of locality is a polling-place area, which, in all probability, will be smaller than a State electorate.

                        <para>- That must be understood. The whole purpose of the Bill will fail unless a subdivision may be so small that three or four of them may be grouped in order to form a State electorate. That, in practice, is what these subdivisions must be if the Bill is to have any good effect at all. We have, to some extent, drifted from the matter to which I first directed attention, in connexion with substituted clause 26. The Minister has confined his observations entirely to alterations which might take place within a division, but I refer the Committee to the last line of the clause, which deals with the external boundaries of a division. Whilst it is obvious that there should be some power to transfer the name of an elector from one roll to another when the boundaries of a division are altered, I still affirm that there is a conflict between substituted clause 26 - which deals with the internal boundaries of a division - and section 63 of the principal Act. I lay stress on the fact that I am now dealing, as this clause does, with the external boundaries. Section 63 of the principal Act provides that - </para>

                <para class="block">That is clear, and we need not again confuse it by referring to the difference between transferring an individual elector and a group of electors. The Bill provides that wherever the boundaries of a division are altered the Minister shall give directions in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> as to what alterations are to be made, and how they are to be made. There is a conflict here between the Bill and section 63 of the principal Act. I admit the whole of the Minister's contention with regard to any alteration of internal boundaries, but my point remains good when we come to deal with the external boundaries of a division. It is with me a question whether I can give expression to my views better by proposing that the words " division or " shall be left out, or that section 63 of the principal Act shall be repealed. In view of the fact that it is better that a single authority should deal with all matters of a similar character, I should prefer the repeal of section 63 of the principal Act. It is ridiculous to say that the Minister shall give directions for alterations rendered necessary by the disturbance of the internal boundaries of a division, and leave it to the returning officer to make alterations rendered necessary when the external boundaries of a division are disturbed. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> might consider whether the Minister ought not to be vested with the sole power of making all alterations rendered necessary by any disturbance of the boundaries of a division. </para>

                    (Tasmania- Honorary Minister). - So far as this clause is concerned, in the use of the words " boundaries of a division," there does seem to be some overlapping with section 63 of the principal Act. I have no objection to remedy that.

                    has suggested the repeal of section 63, and I think that would be the better course to adopt as the work would then have to be done under directions which would be gazetted, and an opportunity would be afforded those affected by proposed alterations to obtain some knowledge of them which they are not able to obtain at present, when the making of the necessary alterations is left to the returning officer. I have in the circumstances no objection to the repeal of section 63 of the principal Act. If that is done, as
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline>
                    has pointed out, the whole of the events' on which directions for alterations may be made will be dealt with in one part of the Statute.

                    finally decides that that is the best way in which to deal with the matter, I direct attention to the fact that in substituted clause 26 it is contemplated that such alterations as shall be made will affect State rather than Federal electorates. If section 63 of the principal Act is not repealed we shall provide that our own electoral officer shall deal with a division which is wholly a Federal, and not a State division. Under substituted clause 26 the Minister is asked to do certain things which will largely tend to bring about the harmony to which reference has been made, but in section 63 of the principal Act the only duty imposed is, I repeat, a purely Federal duty.

                        <para>- Substituted clause 26 surely imposes a Federal duty solely, inasmuch as it does not affect the creation of any polling place, but merely provides that when certain action has been taken, possibly in conjunction with State officials, the Minister may give directions as to how any alteration of the rolls that is rendered necessary shall take place. </para>

                    <para>. - This clause purports at once to repeal sections 27 to 54 of the principal Act. and ' to substitute in lieu of those twenty-seven sections the provisions which are numbered 27 to 36 in this clause. Honorable senators may desire that the different provisions of this clause comprising the proposed substituted clauses should be dealt with separately, and it would be as well, before the discussion on the clause commenced, if it were understood that they will be put separately from the Chair. </para>

                    <para>- I direct attention to the fact that whilst clause 16 proposes the repeal of the whole of part V. of the principal Act, and purports to substitute other machinery, it leaves certain gaps. In part V. of the principal Act it is not only laid down that rolls are to be prepared, but how they are to be prepared, and the whole of the machinery necessary for their preparation is provided. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator suggests that after the machinery in the principal Act is repealed, some officer will take into his hands the existing roll, and see that it is continued. If we were to deal with our public officers in that manner, we could shorten our Acts very materially. We should adhere to our policy of giving clear directions as to the duties of the electoral officers, and the manner in which those duties are to be discharged. In the three Electoral Acts of New South Wales, very clear directions were given as to the duties of the various officers. I cannot help thinking that Part V. of this Bill has been prepared on the assumption that the machinery of the principal Act will continue to operate after it has been repealed by this Bill. I am sure that the Minister does not wish the measure to be passed with a gap. I hope that he will be able to give such an explanation as will render it unnecessary for me to move for the retention of some provisions in the corresponding part of the principal Act. </para>

                    (Tasmania- Honorary Minister). - This part of the Bill proposes to substitute for sections 27 to 54 of the principal Act eight or nine clauses, because in the great majority of instances, the operation of those sections has been exhausted. The circumstances which necessitated their insertion in the main Act have since ceased to exist. When we were providing for our first electoral machinery, it was necessary to provide, as we did in section 27, that there should be rolls of the electors prepared in each State. The rolls were prepared and acted upon in connexion with the first elections held under the Act. It is now proposed to replace that section of the Act with this provision -

I wish to point out that, although it is left quite optional whether there shall be a polling place roll or a subdivision roll, it is affirmed that the roll for the division shall consist of the subdivision and the polling-place rolls. Suppose that there are no such rolls, what will constitute the rolls for the division? Sub-clauses1 and 2 are contingent upon the happening of certain circumstances, but if there are no such rolls as are therein referred to, it is essential to have a roll for the division. The object of the clause is quite clear; it is merely a matter of draftsmanship. My purpose is to provide for a case in which there are no subdivision or polling place rolls. I move -

                    <para>- I know that, but what I want to know is this : There is a provision for a subdivision roll. I take that to mean that it is intended to fit in with the State electorates. For instance, any State electorate might be made a subdivision. There may be a dozen different polling places within that subdivision. Will the names of the electors be grouped around their own polling places as at present, or will the names run alphabetically without any reference to the polling places? </para>

                    (New South Wales).I wish to indicate an amendment that I propose to submit. The substituted clause provides that the Commonwealth and State authorities may, by a joint arrangement between the respective Executives, prepare joint rolls, which can be used both for Commonwealth and State elections. But, in order to do that, there would have to be upon those rolls some individuals who are electors for both Commonwealth and State, some electors for Commonwealth and not for State, and some who are electors for State and not for Commonwealth. Thus there may be three classes of electors. I do not think the clause makes ft quite clear that these three classes shall be indicated. It only provides that two of them shall be indicated. I propose to move an amendment to make it clear that if these joint rolls are adopted the three classes of electors shall be distinguished. I also wish to propose an amendment to limit this joint arrangement to those States in which the qualification of electors is similar to the qualification for the Commonwealth.

                        <para>- I do not' mention any State, but I think that the joint arrangement ought to be limited to States in which the franchise is the same as our own. The amendment which I first intend to ask the Senate to adopt is, after the word " State," to insert the words " in which the qualification of an elector is .similar to that of the Commonwealth." The effect of the amendment would be to limit the arrangement for joint rolls to those States in which the qualification of an elector is similar to that of an elector in the Commonwealth; and the proposal may be considered quite apart from the other to which I referred. The present proposal raises the question ,as to whether the joint rolls should include electors whose qualification is different to that in the Commonwealth. It seems to me that if we were to permit this we should create a great deal of confusion, and possibly end in disfranchising, either for State or Commonwealth purposes, a large number of electors. </para>

                        <para>- The difference between the qualifications may be nominal ; but, technically, it may prove sufficient, in certain instances, to debar a man from the exercise of both Commonwealth and State franchise - sufficient to prevent a man from being an elector for the State, although an elector for the Commonwealth. The difference being so slight, it is not too much to ask the States to bring their electoral machinery into conformity with our own. If the difference were a great one, I might say that the gap, perhaps, was too great to be bridged over. If there be different qualifications, an elector, seeing his name on the roll, may probably not take the trouble to ascertain whether it is there for both purposes. At the last election quite a large number of electors in New South Wales, who thought that, because they held a State right they were entitled to vote for the Commonwealth Parliament, only found that such was not the case when they presented themselves at the polling-booth. This confusion will become largely intensified, and much more general, because, if men see that their names are on the Commonwealth rolls, they will assume that they are there for Commonwealth purposes. It may be said that such ignorance would show negligence on the part of the elector in making himself acquainted with the electoral laws, but we have to take electors as we find them. Outside the State of Victoria, where the suffrage is limited to males of twenty-one years of age, the difference between the Federal qualification and that of the States is quite nominal. </para>

I propose this amendment in the interests of the electors. And, in my opinion, we are entitled to say to the States thai:, if, in the interests of their Treasury, they request us to have joint rolls, we in the interests of the electors, may ask the States to remove little anomalies likely to lead to confusion on the part of the elector. I speak with a lively recollection of the difficulty, uncertainty and confusion which occurred at the last election. After this lapse of time, honorable sen'ators mav be inclined to discount the difficulties which then arose, but they must! remember how every candidate and newspaper raised protests against the state of affairs which I do not want to see repeated. The Bill, as it stands, tends to increase the uncertainty, and I ask honorable senators whether any objection can possibly be raised to the amendment ? </para>

At present, the Bill permits joint rolls on a varying franchise, with a later provision for an indication of the purpose for which the elector is enrolled. But with the amendment, the name would be on the roll with the knowledge that it was there for- both State and Commonwealth purposes. The amendment is clearly in the interests of simplicity, and however it may be received, I feel it my duty to submit it. I move - </para>

                    object is to safeguard, as far as possible, this provision for joint action, and to prevent the elector from being misled. But I really see no necessity for the amendment. After all, we simply propose, by this substituted clause, to confer a power, which may or may not be exercised, and which, of course, will only be exercised where it can be with advantage. For instance, the qualification of an elector for the Commonwealth may vary from the qualification in a particular State, but the points at variance may Be practically immaterial so far as carrying out the purpose of the clause is concerned. It is desirable when conferring a power like this - to be exercised only in certain contingencies, which, perhaps, in some cases do not at present arise - that we should make the provision as elastic as possible. Already in substituted clause 29, it is provided that the rolls may be in the prescribed form and contain certain particulars, and " such other particulars as are prescribed." In any case in which it was sought to exercise the power, the form of the rolls to be used would be prescribed, and then it would be open for those who were prescribing the particular forms of rolls to deal with the particular circumstances of that case and the necessities arising from them. Of course, as honorable senators know, the regulations must be laid before each House of the Parliament. I can understand that it may be urged that very often regulations do not receive from honorable members that attention which they should. But I consider that a regulation in connexion with electoral administration - the preparation of the rolls - would invite just as much attention as did the regulations framed under the Public Service Act.

When the exercise of that power is called for it is desirable that the regulations prescribing the forms of the rolls shall be such as will meet the particular necessities of the case. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has referred to the case of persons whose names were not found on the Commonwealth rolls at the time of the last elections, but who were qualified to be enrolled.

                        <para>- I intend to deal with that point. Suppose that the power proposed to be given by the provision is exercised, both the Commonwealth and the State will work towards a common end, and in so doing the likelihood of a man's name being incorrectly enrolled or placed on the rolls with imperfect additions will be less likely to occur, because each' authority will, so to speak, act as a reciprocal check upon the other. I think that to a verv large extent the risk of a man being enrolled for the exercise of one franchise when he was entitled to exercise two franchises will be considerably minimized when the two authorities are focussing their efforts. The variations or differences between the State and Federal franchises may very conceivably be so immaterial as not to in any way affect the principle. In such a case it would be desirable that the Governor-General should have power to deal in that State as in other States where the qualifications were precisely similar. </para>

                        <para>- It does not necessarily follow that the Governor-General would exercise the power given to him by the provision, but if it were couched in mandatory terms there might be some force in that objection. It is desirable that as far as possible this power should be given in the widest terms possible. It may or may not be exercised, and I take it that it will never be exercised unless it be for the mutual advantage of a State and the Commonwealth. In my speech on the second reading, I pointed to a statement in the report of the Select Committee on electoral administration, as to the sum of money which might have been saved to South Australia by printing a joint roll for the State and the Commonwealth. Similar information could be given in regard to Victoria. The saving would be not merely to the State concerned, but to the Commonwealth and the State. We have already passed a provision dealing with the form in which the roll may be compiled, and the particular details referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> can, I think, be properly prescribed in the regulations to meet the circumstances of each case. </para>

It must be remembered that the power given in substituted clause 30 is purely permissive, and that it is not at all likely that the Governor-General would extend the exercise of the powers to' those portions of Australia in which the qualifications for the suffrage were extremely divergent. Suppose that some slight differences in the qualifications had been overlooked by this Parliament, and that both the State concerned and the Commonwealth desired that a joint roll should be compiled, it might not be possible for some reason or other to make the necessary alteration, and the Governor-General would be prohibited by the amendment from taking a step which would save considerable expense to the taxpayers. Iri that way, great hardships would be inflicted. </para>

                <para>Under the Commonwealth law, it is allowable for a person who has been enrolled for three months to vote, but in the case of some States the term is longer. That difficulty can be got over. At the Premiers' Conference, held in Hobart last February, the subject of the differences between the franchises was discussed. It was suggested that in the case of Victoria it would be possible to so compile the rolls as to show by the use of different type those persons - women - who were ineligible to vote in a State electorate, so that at a State election it could be seen at once whether certain persons, whose names were on a roll, were entitled to vote or not, and <inline font-style="italic">vice versa.</inline> It will be far better to leave this matter to the discretion of the Governor-General, because it is not likely that the provisions of the substituted clause would be extended to those parts of Australia where the electoral qualifications are so divergent, or where the differences are such that they cannot be reconciled by any compromise. </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen's</inline>
                    amendment. He suggested that the Commonwealth Parliament ought to give the lead to the States as to what their franchise should be, with a view to securing uniformity with the Commonwealth franchise. He must remember that all the States are not in the happy position of New South Wales, with a nominee Upper House, for which no electoral rolls are required. In the case of other States, the electors for the Upper House are required to possess a strong property qualification, and, therefore, it would be impossible to assimilate the rolls for those Houses with the Federal rolls. I am satisfied that if the amendment were carried, the Upper Houses in the States would complain very loudly about this Parliament interfering with a view to bring their franchise into line with the franchise for the Senate.

                        <para>- If we leave out of consideration the Upper House, we have only the rolls for the Lower House to deal with. There is only a slight difference between the qualification of electors for the Lower House in South Australia and the qualification for electors for the Commonwealth. Last year the position was this : South Australia had to .print at the expense of her taxpayers a roll for the State for the purposes of her State elections. Then the Commonwealth had to print - not in Adelaide, but in Melbourne - a set of rolls for the whole of South Australia, containing absolutely the same names as were included in the rolls for the State elections, with one slight difference - namely, that the State rolls had an extra column showing whether the elector on the roll had been registered for six months. Under the South Australian law persons are not entitled to vote until they have been on the roll for six months, and to indicate that fact the date" of registration is placed against the name. If that slight addition were made to the Federal rolls there could be no misunderstanding. A man would go to the nearest post-office and consult the roll. If he had not been three months on the roll, he would not be en titled to vote for the Commonwealth ; if he had not been six months on the roll, he would not be entitled up vote for the State. This clause provides that the rolls are to be in a prescribed form. It would be very easy for the Government to prescribe for the South Australian rolls that the date of registration should be placed against the name of the elector. That would make the Commonwealth rolls available for State elections. As to the preparation of the rolls there can be no difficult)'. In South Australia we prepare our rolls as follows : When the census is taken every ten years, in addition to the census paper an electoral application form is delivered. The person who wishes to vote makes his application, and his name is placed on the roll just as he is enumerated in the census. In the interim between censuses application forms are kept at every post-office and by every electoral registrar throughout the State. A person can get a form, fill it up, send it in, and get his name placed on the roll. Nothing can be simpler. When the Commonwealth came into existence, other means were adopted for compiling the rolls. The police called at the houses of the people, and from their lists the rolls were prepared. Nor is there any difficulty in regard to the revision of the rolls. Indeed, the Commonwealth has practically adopted the South Australian system. I see no necessity for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen's</inline> amendment. We cannot compel the States to accept our franchise for the Upper Houses. I think that the Government in making this proposal have made the best arrangement possible to get near to uniformity with the States in the preparation of rolls. . Consequently I shall support it. </para>

                    has mentioned would not be interfered with in the matter we are discussing. The only rolls affected in his State would be those for the House of Assembly. At present, a South Australian elector has to get on three rolls - that for the State Legislative Council, that for the State House of Assembly, and that for the Commonwealth. The whole question which we have to consider is not the special franchise for the Legislative Council, but the franchise for what is called the popular House, which is based upon manhood or womanhood and residence.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline>
                    sets at rest any doubt I may have had as to the efficacy of my proposal, when he admits that a man can get on the roll for the House of Assembly in South Australia and for the Commonwealth, quite irrespective of any property qualification which may entitle him to vote for the Legislative Council. That however, is merely a side issue with which we are not concerned.

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen's</inline>
                    attention - the effect of the word " similar." I take it that the idea underlying his amendment is to deal with cases where there is no doubt about a man being qualified to be upon both rolls in a State. Take the South Australian instance, where an elector has to be on the State rolls six months before he can vote. Suppose a man had been resident nine or ten months in the Commonwealth, but only one month' in South Australia. In that case he would be entitled to be an elector for the Commonwealth, but not for the State. If we pass this amendment a number of cases like that might be affected. That is a phase of the situation that seems to have escaped attention. I ask the Committee to pass the clause as it stands.

                    (New South Wales). - I have already placed in the hands of the Minister an amendment, which does not affect the principle involved in this proposed substituted clause, but which would, I think, set it out in a more definite fashion. By the rejection of my last amendment, we have adopted the principle that general rolls may be arranged for between States and Commonwealth. The clause goes on to say that if those joint rolls are prepared there shall be an indication against the name of an elector if he is not enrolled for Commonwealth purposes. To make that abundantly clear, I think that we should set out that these joint rolls shall indicate either by initial or by some other means to which of the three classes the elector belongs. It ought to be indicated whether the elector is qualified for the dual purpose, or is only a Commonwealth elector, or only a State elector; whereas only two of these classes are indicated.

                        <para>- Why should the two classes be provided for in the clause, and the Minister left to indicate the third class by regulation? There appears to me to be a want of balance in the Bill; and either the whole should be left to regulation or the whole defined by legislation. The fact that the Bill indicates two out of the three classes furnishes the strongest argument in favour of the position I take. It appears to me that the draftsman assumed that he had provided for the three classes, and probably, he indirectly did so, but not in that clear and definite way which is desirable. There ought to be a provision that electors may be enrolled who are not State electors, if that fact be clearly set out. The amendment which I intend to move provides that the three classes shall be clearly indicated ; and I point out that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Garran,</inline> to whose admirable paper I have already referred, adopted this very principle when he outlined the scheme, because, if I remember aright, he suggested that the letter "C" might be placed opposite the names of the Commonwealth electors,  and  the letter "S" against the names of the State electors, and that where both of these letters were absent it would be assumed that the qualification was both State and Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- There is something more. The Bill does certainly provide that certain persons shall be designated in a certain way. so as to show their qualifications or want of qualifications, but the possession or want of those qualifications relates to the Commonwealth franchise, which is within our own domain. This provision can never come into operation unless some agreement has been arrived at with a State, in which case it will be necessary for the State to make the complementary provision, in order to designate who are and who are not State electors. </para>

                    (Tasmania).- I believe that a majority of honorable senators have quite decided that, on its merits, the amendment of
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline>
                    is a good one, and the only difference of opinion is as to whether the initiative in this legislation should be taken by the Commonwealth or by the States. I think it is agreed by most honorable senators that
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline>
                    has attempted to draw a very clear distinction in his amendment, which will make everything quite plain. The only argument which has been advanced against his proposal - and I do not think it is one of much importance - is that the table would be bulky and lengthy. So long as the chief object is secured, I do not think that the table will be too bulky from our stand-point. I believe that the inclusion of one column will cover all that is required. If we go so far as to introduce one column, it will not matter how many different paragraphs it may contain. It will be an effort to bring into harmony conflicting methods in the States and the Commonwealth.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline>
                    can say nothing more against the amendment than that it is quite sufficient for us to go to a certain extent in the direction of producing that harmony, and to leave the States to pass complementary legislation. I cannot see why we should not go to the furthest extent which we deem desirable. I think that the amendment is a very good one.

                    (Tasmania- Honorary Minister). - The rolls, if they come into existence under this amendment, will not be the rolls of the Commonwealth or the rolls of the State, but the rolls of both the Commonwealth and the State. So far as the Commonwealth is concerned, the proposed substituted clause as it stands provides that where the name of a person appears on a roll, and he is not a Commonwealth elector, that fact shall be indicated. It is manifestly the duty, in fact it is the prerogative of the States in connexion with the rolls, which they hold jointly with ours, to make a corresponding provision, and it is not for us to legislate to that extent. With regard to those persons who are both State and Commonwealth electors, there is no necessity for making any mark. There are only two other classes to be considered, namely, those who are Commonwealth but not State electors, and

Surely it is within the proper domain of the State which wishes to co-operate with the Commonwealth to enact what it desires to have in regard to the class who may be Commonwealth but not State electors. Seeing that this is only a permissive provision, and one which' cannot come into operation except in agreement with a State, we ought not to say to the States that we have already imposed the condition with which they shall have to comply in order to take advantage of this legislation. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister conceded that something will have to be done before we can give effect to the provision for joint rolls. The only point is whether we, instead of making a partial proposal to the States, should not state fully what we think ought to be the rules to be observed, and the form to be adopted in preparing the joint rolls. The Minister thinks that we ought not to take that course. But suppose that the States make a. proposal which we are not prepared to accept, it will delay negotiations still further. I did not suggest, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> has said, that there should be five columns, because, in my opinion, one column will be quite sufficient. The entry of the initial will not take up any more room than is occupied by the date of enrolment on his own State roll. I would remind the honorable senator that the principle of publishing the date of enrolment does not prevail except in South Australia, and in, I believe, Western Australia. </para>

                    <para>- I believe that the Minister is unwise in resisting the amendment. It is a comparatively small proposal, but, if accepted, it will lead to that which is very desirable, namely, uniformity. Otherwise, we might have joint rolls with one State in which a distinct indication of this character existed, and joint rolls in another State in which there was no such indication. As it is admitted to be a thing which in itself it is desirable to provide for, I think it is wise to make it a condition of the joint roll. I urge the Minister to withdraw his objection to the amendment. </para>

                to consider whether or not the words "or subdivision " in subclause 3 are not only unnecessary, but are likely to be confusing. He will observe that a previous sub-clause absolutely lays it down that if there is a subdivision the elector can only have his name on the roll for that subdivision. This sub-clause appears to give the elector an option. I admit at once that the option is only apparent, because it is destroyed by the words "except as provided in this section." The clear purport of the provision is that he shall have no option, if a subdivision roll exists, and yet it says that he may be on any subdivision roll.

                <para>In Western Australia, especially on the goldfields, a very large percentage of the electors are constantly moving about, and, in order that supplemental rolls shall be printed at least every twelve months, this amendment is necessary. It will meet the requirements of many nomadic persons, not only on the gold-fields, but in other parts of the State. If a longer interval than twelve months were allowed to elapse before the supplemental rolls were printed, a very large percentage of the voters might find themselves disfranchised. </para>

                        <para>- The difficulty is this. You might have a roll printed today, and' in nine months' time there might be an election. There would then be nothing to compel the reprinting of the roll. I presume that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie has in view the circumstances of Western Australia. But there might be no necessity to reprint the rolls for twelve months' in more settled districts, and it would be a waste of money absolutely to oblige the officers charged with the Administration of this measure to reprint rolls in every State, in order to suit the circumstances of one. My amendment would compel the Minister to have the rolls brought up to date immediately before an election. Whether we can fix a period, I do not know, but it seems to me that we could not. Suppose we said, " within two months." An election might be sprung upon us to-morrow. As far as we can meet the case, we should do so. At this stage, I merely indicate my amendment. If that of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie is carried it will not be necessary for me to move it. But if it is not carried I shall proceed with mine. </para>

                        <para>- It is a limit which seems to me to operate verv inconveniently to the elector, and has done so on more than one occasion. If we had our supplemental rolls brought up to date every twelve months, we should be nearer to meeting the case than we are under present circumstances. I have no objection to supplemental rolls being printed immediately prior to a general election ; but if we allow our rolls to get into a backward state, as we have done, and are likely to do if we do not take care, there will be all the more difficulty in bringing them up to date at a time when they are required. </para>

                    Largie's amendment and

                    suggestion, and that either would defeat to some extent the objects which both honorable senators seem to have in view. But I should like to have time to look into the matter further.

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator CLEMONS</inline>
                    (Tasmania). - I wish to ask the Minister to look into this matter carefully before determining to accept an amendment. It is provided in section 53 of the principal Act that these supplemental rolls shall be printed immediately after the holding of a revision court and before a general election. It is certainly desirable to have them printed as near as possible to a general election. We have adopted another method of revising the rolls, instead of having revision courts, but I have been unable to find out by a perusal of Part VII. at what period the revision is to be made under the new Bill.

                        <para>- I understand that the removal of names from the rolls, and the addition of new names, may be going on day by day at all times. Ought we not to have some means of ascertaining from that process when it would be desirable to have the supplemental rolls printed ? Of course it is always desirable to have them printed as near as possible to a general election, but it appears to me that by means of the process prescribed for the continuous revision there might be a means of determining when it was necessary to print new ones. </para>
