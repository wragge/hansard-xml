                        <para>- I do not intend to express a final opinion now; but it seems to me that in all probability ' the notice of motion relating to public servants, which has just been given by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Staniforth</inline> Smith, ought not to appear on the notice-paper, as it is in contravention pf the standing order, which forbids the anticipation of the discussion on a. question. Honorable senators will see that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> has given notice of his intention to discuss on the 9th November, the Public Service Commissioner's report, and to move a motion relating thereto. </para>

                            <para>- I know; but an honorable senator, by altering the terms of his motion, and discussing different phases of a question, could initiate several debates on .the same subject-matter. On this particular question it is quite competent for an honorable senator to so word' his notice of motion as to bring, forward apparently a different issue. If that is so, certainly it is in contravention of the spirit of the standing order. The question resolves itself into this : Can <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> move the motion, of which he has given notice, as an amendment to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild's</inline> motion. If he can, undoubtedly the subject -matter is the same. I shall look into, the question, and if I come to the conclusion that the notice- of motion ought not to appear on the notice-paper, I shall give: a direction accordingly. </para>

If one may speak for honorable senators generally, the Senate appeared to be entirely with you on that occasion. I desire to inquire, if any steps have been or are being taken to bring the matter under the notice of the Standing Orders Committee with a view to give effect to your opinion. </para>

                        <para>- In reply to some questions put by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe.</inline> yesterday, the Minister of Defence said that the Government wanted to get a High Commissioner, but they did not know whether they would succeed. I wish to ask the honorable senator whether he meant by that reply that he does not know whether Parliament will pass the High Commissioner Bill, or whether, if that Bill be passed, the Government may not be able to get a gentleman to fill the position? </para>

                        <para>-Man proposes sometimes, but a bigger power disposes. Therefore, in stating yesterday that I did not know if we should succeed, I only spoke the truth. There is not a single member of the Senate who knows whether Parliament will pass the High Commissioner Bill. I believe it will, but I am not sure. </para>

                    <para>-. - On looking through the Bill, I find that the words " the copyright in a book," "the performing right in a dramatic or musical work," and " the lecturing right in a lecture," appear not only in this« clause, but in other clauses. For instance, clause 13 defines " the copyright in a book"; clause 14 defines " the performing right in a dramatic or musical work ' ' ; and clause 15 defines "the lecturing right in a lecture." It is desirable to adhere to the words used in those clauses, so that there may be no doubt or obscurity. There are other kinds of copyright - for instance, the copyright in an artistic work - which is dealt with hereafter; and clause 33 deals with trie protection of newspapers. There might be questions raised as to how far the word 1 " copyright," if used baldly and vaguely, as proposed by this amendment, might be construed in relation to the copyright in an artistic work, 'and the. copyright in news. 'For the sake of insuring greater certainty, and uniformity, it is better to retain the words " in a book " in this clause. </para>

                    <para>- Of course, the question is simply one of making the clause effective. My honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating's,</inline> observations do not touch the point. What is the property we are dealing with ? Copyright. Are we to make copyright personal property in every instance, or are we only to make .copyright in a book personal property? Our object is to make property in every kind of intellectual production copyright. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> says that in this clause we are referring only to books. It is clear that the definition must be enlarged ; but apart from that, we do not want to .limit the description of". personal property to property in a book. There is also copyright in musical productions, and in artistic works. Copyright, no matter to what it appertains, should be personal property. Therefore, we should so define it. The word copyright is the term which we employ to define this form of personal property, just as we might use the word land, or easement, or any other of the terms with which lawyers are more or less familiar. I quite agree with what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> has said as to the complexity of a Bill of this kind, and, of course, he cannot be expected, off-hand, to see the full effects of every amendment. But this is an amendment the advantage of which, it seems to me, is so obvious, with a view to create the kind of personal property that is dealt with, that I would ask my honorable and learned friend to give fuller consideration to the point. </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator KEATING</inline>
                    (Tasmania.- Honorary Minister). - In deference to the suggestions made last evening, I have given full consideration to the matter, and I would1 ask the Committee to assist me in adhering to the clause exactly as it stands. No doubt we do intend to provide that copyrights hall be, in every instance, personal property. But the scheme of this Bill is to deal with literary, musical, and dramatic copyright in one separate division. Later on we shall consider the clauses respecting artistic copyright. In that part of the Bill we make a similar provision. If we were to provide simply in a division of "literary, musical, and dramatic copyright," that "copyright" baldly and vaguely shall be capable of assignment, licence, transmission, and so op. it would not tend to make the measure clear. Clause 34 describes what copyright in an artistic work means. But if, before we reach that clause, we provide baldly that "copyright" shall be personal property, it will be open to question whether the copyright we provide for is not the copyright we have already dealt with. Part 4 of the Bill is devoted to copyright in artistic works.

                        <para>- I propose to meet <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake's</inline> objection to the present form of the clause by providing in the definition clause that the word ' ' book " shall cover the case of an article that is separately contributed to a magazine or periodical. But in this division we are simply dealing with "literary musical and dramatic copyright." So far, we have not touched " artistic copyright," or defined what it means. In Part 4, which deals with that division of the subject, there is a clause similar to this, providing that artistic copyright shall be personal property capable of assignment, and so on. </para>

                    <para>- The Minister' in charge of the Bill stated that honorable senators who followed his argument in moving the second reading will see the reason why the Bill has been drafted in its present form. I must admit at once that whilst I followed his argument I am utterly unable to appreciate the conclusion to which it seems to have led him. If the Bill means anything, it makes it as clear as possible, taking clauses 24 and 43 together, that the intention is to make copyright personal property, whether it subsists in a book, an artistic work, or a dramatic right. It seems to make the Bill unnecessarily cumbersome, and likely to lead to confusion <inline font-style="italic">to state in</inline> three clauses what could be stated in. one. Clauses 24 and 43 both . state that copyright, when secured, shall be personal property. Why not say so in one clause? Nothing that the Minister has advanced convinces me that there is wisdom in setting out in many lines what might be stated in two. </para>

                        <para>- I am not sure that we should gain in that respect, because, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> has pointed out, this Bill deals with particular kinds of copyright. A person who is interested in artistic copyright is concerned only with Part 4 of the Bill. He is not concerned with copyright in a book. His rights and privileges are sent out clearly in Part 4. If the parts dealing with copyright in1 books and artistic works there were not declarations as to personal property in copyright, but simply a general declaration at the end of the Bill, that would1 be vague. It would be a loose method of drafting, and might lead to some doubt as-to whether there was personal property in these particular kinds of copyright. The most that can foe said on the point . is that it is one of drafting. It is a mere question of which is the better way to put what is intended. It seems to me that the Bill as it stands is better in form, and will lead to less confusion than the course advocated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen.</inline> I support the clause in view of the promise of the Minister that the definitions will be extended to meet <inline font-weight="bold">"Senator Drake's</inline> point. </para>

                    SYMON (South Australia). - I should have thought that when a Bill was passing through the Senate it ' was desirable that whilst in the first place it should give effect as far as possible to our intentions, it should also be a credit to us in respect of lucid arrangement and draftsmanship. I agree with
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline>
                    that to begin with this is very bad draftsmanship. I should like the Bill when it leaves the Senate to be a model in every way. It should, as far as we can insure that end, go down to the House of Representatives in a shape above criticism, and it should also be so perfectly clear that he who runs may read. The Minister will not, I am sure, say that if there, is a declaration in this clause that, copyright shall be defined as personal property, the effect will not be to make .it personal property from beginning to end of the Bill. But he says that copyright in this Bill relates to different kinds of works, and, therefore, he thinks that we should reproduce the same clause under the heading of artistic copyright in Part 4. It must be remembered that the headings in Bills are arbitrary. A heading has no relation to the construction of the measure itself, any more than has a marginal note. An Act is construed by a Court quite irrespective of headings and notes. We are dealing with the subject of copyright, and providing that a copyright shall have all the qualities of personal property, and shall be assignable. That is merely giving to copyright certain qualities which property of this character possesses, in order to put within clear limits the nature of the possession. My view is that we have ir» the Bill a duplication of words which might be avoided. In the very next clause it is provided that copyright in a book, the performing right in a dramatic or musical work, and the lecturing right in a lecture, shall be deemed to be distinct properties. Why should this Bill be made, perhaps, a third longer than is necessary, by this repetition in s&amp; many clauses? I should like to see the whole of these words struck out, not? merely,- in clause) 23, but in subsequent clauses, with a view to simplicity and clearness, and that brevity which no man ever more exemplified in drafting than did the late Minister of Trade and Customs,
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kingston.</inline>
                    The measures prepared by that gentleman are, in that respect, models, there not being one word too many ; whereas the Bill now under consideration contains many words which are unnecessary. If clause 34 were omitted, it would still be provided that copyright in every subject-matter of copyright is personal property. This' is a mere matter of arrangement, and I commend the suggestion of
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline>
                    to the Minister. It would be more artistic to have one general clause inserted before the provision dealing with infringements, in order to define the property itself as personal property with the incidents thereof, and, in my opinion, we ought to eliminate all words which are superfluous.

                    (New South Wales). - The Minister asks us Jo retain this clause, and also, presumably, the clause dealing with artistic copyright, on the ground that it is desirable to have a separate provision of the kind under each division of the Bill. Whatever strength that argument might have had is destroyed bv the Bill itself,' because, if it be desirable to have a separate mandate in the Bill to the effect that copyright is personal property under the various headings, why does the Minister have separate provisions in the division of the Bill dealing with infringements? In clause 45, for instance, the whole of the copyright, whether in a book, a dramatic work, a- lecture, or artistic work, is dealt with at once, and the same course is taken in clause 53-

                        <para>- That is true; but, while the Minister is asking us not to group the provisions in one simple clause, the Bill itself, in the division dealing with infringements, adopts that very reasonable course. In ninety-nine Acts of Parliament out of a hundred, the practice now suggested is followed. The Constitution itself, instead' of multiplying provisions which are common to several divisions, sets them out separately so far as is necessary, but where provisions ' apply to more than one matter, they are grouped under one heading. For instance, there are separate divisions for the Senate and the House of Representatives, where necessary, but there is a third division dealing with matters common to both Houses of Parliament. Clause 24 is common to more "than the subject dealt with in that clause - it is common to copyright in any form. Fo.r that reason it appears to me that this multiplication of provisions makes the Bill unduly cumbersome, and likely to lead to complications. </para>

The honorable senator suggests that" it is my desire to repeat certain provisions in every division of the Bill. There are eight parts of the Bill; and Part 3 deals with " literary, musical, or dramatic copyright " ; while Part 4 deals with " artistic copyright," each division being self-contained. But when we come to Part 5, which deals with the " infringement of copyright," we find one of those general divisions which apply to the whole scope of the measure, in the same way, as do those general sections of the Constitution referred to by the honorable senator. </para>

                        <para>- We provide in clause 23 that copyright in a book shall be personal property, because books are dealt with in clause 13; and we make the same provision in regard to dramatic and music a! works and lectures, because these are wait with in clauses 14 and 15 ; but thus far we have not in any way considered the question of artistic copyright. '"'When, we come to the next division of the Bill, which deals with " artistic copyright," we start with a definition of what artistic copyright shall mean, and the whole of Part 4 deals with that question, providing that it shall be personal property. The suggestion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> is an alternative ; and I a'sk honorable senators, who have had an opportunity to consider the Bill, to adhere to the provisions as drawn, unless very good reason can be shown to the contrary. The Bill has been circulated for a considerable time; and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> has expressed a hope, which I re-echo, that when the Bill leaves this Chamber it may be in a form creditable to us. </para>

It has been suggested - I am not now dealing with the alternative proposal - that when we provide that copyright shall be personal property, we mean copyright throughout the Bill, including artistic copyright. I have my doubts as to the accuracy of that view. </para>

                        <para>- By the Acts Interpretation Act we have made an express departure from what is the usual law1 on the subject. The honorable and learned senator, in arguing that a general provision as to copyright should cover all subsequent clauses, rested his argument on the foundation that marginal notes and, divisional headings were on the same plane. But, in view <inline font-style="italic">oi</inline> the Acts Interpretation Act, I ask honorable senators to assist me in adhering to the present form of the Bill, which, after consideration, I think will make for greater certainty in the law, and certainly make, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has pointed out, for greater convenience on the part of those who, in their own interests, may have to consult this measure. </para>

                    SYMON (South Australia). - I am quite aware that so far as the headings to parts of a Bill are concerned, they are regarded as dividing it into parts, but the marginal notes and headings have no more weight with a Court in construing the meaning of the general sections of an Act than the section fixing the date on which it came into operation! If we adopt the amendment we shall give the property we create, which is the copyright, a clear and definite expression to which all the incidents that we wish" to associate with property are attached. That might also be done by the alternative method suggested, and which', I think, is the better of the two, of substituting a clause dealing with the matter before we deal with the question of infringement.

For the sake of lucidity this matter should be dealt with immediately before we deal with! the question of infringement. In that way we shall define the property which is dealt with in the subsequent clause as the subject of infringement. I have no wish to press my amendment for the mission of the words "in a book " if the Minister thinks that it would be better to deal with this matter in a subsequent clause expressly dealing with all subjects of copyright, and to follow that up by a provision for proceedings on infringement. </para>

                    <para>- I drew attention to this matter because it appeared to me that it was very important that there should be a simple and easy means of assigning the copyright provided for under clauses 21 and 22. Those clauses deal with the most difficult cases which will arise under this Bill, in which a kind of dual copyright is involved. It is particularly important also in view of the new clause inserted at the instance of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen.</inline> ' I understand that the Minister admits that "article " is not covered by the definition of " book," and the honorable and learned senator proposes to amend the definition of " book " to cover " article." I would suggest that it is necessary ta put in a specific definition of the term "article." because the question must, arise under the claims wilh which we have already dealt - What is an article contributed to a periodical ? Is a letter written bv any person to a newspaper and for which no payment is received, an article? I think it is. Any contribution sent to a newspaper and signed is a signed article, and the writer would be entitled to copyright in it. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, and if such a letter were published in. some other newspaper, the writer of it might have a cause of action, against the proprietor of that newspaper. I foresee that it will lead to this: That in the majority of cases, when people send articles of any kind to a newspaper, they will have to state, in definite terms, that they do not claim copyright in their productions. In ninety-nine- cases out of a hundred, the writers of such articles would not desire to claim any copyright. The Minister suggests that we should pass this clause as it stands, and deal with the difficulty in the interpretation clause. If there were any species of copyright proposed to be given which it is not desired to make personal property, I could see no objection to the adoption of that course ; but when we propose to make every copyright given personal property, I do not see why we should not say so in one clause. There would then be no possibility of any difficulty arising in consequence of a matter for which copyright is provided being omitted from the clause. I notice that the term used in the first of the clauses dealing with infringement of copyright is " any copyright conferred by this Act." </para>

                        <para>- I do not understand why it should be insisted upon that this clause should appear in this part of the Bill. Why should it not come immediately before the clause dealing with infringement, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> has suggested? We should then lay. down, first of all, that copyright is personal property, then that it. can be assigned in certain ways, and we should next provide for penalties for its infringement. The illustration of the Constitution Act is entirely in favour of the adoption of that course. Where we can deal with a matter in a comprehensive way, desiring to make no differentiation, we should do so in one clause. An amendment of this nature would entirely meet the difficulty I pointed out, whilst I am not sure that an amendment of the definition of " book " would do so. I think we should need also a definition of the word "article," as there might be great difficulty in defining exactly what an article means under this Bill. </para>

                    had indicated the course he is prepared to take. I am sure the honorable and learned senator will feel, as I do, that, to a certain extent, I am criticising my own Bill. I do not wish that my honorable and learned friend should think that in yielding to any suggestion he is interfering with a work peculiarly his own. I am aware that he has given a very great deal of consideration to the measure, but I feel a paternal interest in it also.

                    (New South Wales).It appears to me that the pernicious system of duplication is going not only from division to division, but from clause to clause. The clause contains some new matter, but at the same time it is largely a duplication of clause 23. If I can draw any conclusion from recent events here, it is that the Minister has made up his mind not to regard any suggestion even when it is offered in the most friendly spirit, but simply, so far as he can, to adhere to the Bill, irrespective of its merits or demerits. If the Committee see fit to retain a duplication after it has been pointed out, and the Minister is quite satisfied to have an imperfect measure,, let the responsibility rest with them.

If, however, the Committee is content to take the clauses as they are drafted, without really considering whether they are necessary, and conduce to the simplicity of the measure, it is not discharging its duty in that high way in which I think it. ought to. </para>

We need not carry it quite so far as my honorable friend does', but he has really spotted the defect, and made it glaring by means of his suggestion. There are two things", however, which may happen. One is that if an author makes alterations of a comparatively unimportant character, it will give his work the character of a new book. The second is that there is no definition of what an edition is. An edition may consist of ten, twenty, forty, or fifty copies, and all that an author will have to do in order to evade what we have after considerable debate laid down, and so extend his copyright, is to publish a limited edition of his book, which will be rapidly exhausted, or make a few alterations of more or less substance, whereupon he will get a fresh lease of copyright in the book, and so go on for ever. </para>

                    by Captain Burton, which has since teen published in various expurgated editions. The original edition, because of its prurient character, attained a considerable value, and probably it may be republished if called for. In the first edition of his
                    <inline font-style="italic">History of New Zealand,</inline>
                    Rusden libelled a man called Bryce, who had served in the Maori War, and who, in England, brought an action against him for the libel. He was successful, and the result was that the first edition was recalled, and subsequent editions were published without the libellous paragraphs. With the exception of such cases as these, the first edition of a book is rarely, if ever, republished. Therefore, all that can be reproduced is the first edition. But what I am strongly opposed to is the empowering of an author to evade the period of copyright established by the Bill, and to secure for himself stepping-stones of different periods by making a few alterations in his book, or by publishing a limited edition. An edition depends upon the number which the author or the publisher desires to include in it.

                    <para>. - I do not know whether the honorable senator means that this provision is something unknown to the law, but I would point out that the effect of it is to provide that in the case of a new edition of a book copyright may be obtained in the new edition only. That is at present the law in England. Questions of great nicety have at times engaged the attention of the Courts as to what is or is not a new edition. Obviously there must be protection for new editions. For instance, a man may write a book of a highly valuable and technical character, dealing, say, with wireless telegraphy Five years later he may write a second edition of that book containing a great deal of further information that he has secured during the interval. It is obvious that he should be able to secure for that new book copyright, which should be co-extensive with the copyright in a book published for the first time. With regard to the present condition of the law, we know that the state of affairs to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> has referred exists. There has been no inconvenience arising out of it; in fact those persons who are more directly interested have shown no sign of disapproval. </para>

                    <para>Questions of great nicety and difficulty may arise as to how far a new edition of a work is a proper subject for copyright. A new edition of a book may be a reprint of the original edition, which does not entitle the author to a new term of copyright running from the new edition. </para>

                <para class="block">That is a statement of the common law. In every individual instance it will be for the Courts to determine whether the book in respect of which copyright is claimed is a new edition or is simply a reprint. Copinger goes on to say : - </para>

                    <para>Or it may be so enlarged and improved as to constitute in reality a new work; for example, a scientific work 20 or 30 years old may be comparatively worthless, owing to the progress of science in the interval ; but a new edition, particularly if it be the production of the original author, would be as valuable at a later period as the original edition of the book was at the time it was published. There are many courses which lie between the two extremes, and the difficulty would be to lay down any general rule as to what amount of additions, alterations, or new matter would entitle the second or new edition of a book to the privilege of copyright, or whether the copyright extends to the book as amended or improved, or is confined to the additions and improvements themselves, as distinguished from the rest of the book. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, it is the law at present, so far as Great Britain is concerned. There have been some cases where notes have been added to a book; it has been decided that copyright cannot subsist in such a case. Similarly in regard to a book the second edition of which was issued with an index. The Court has held that copyright should only extend to the index, and not to the book itself. The Court in every case would decide whether or not the alterations were substantial. A particular instance that occurs to my memory is, though I do not speak with certainty as to the details, the poem of Edward Fitzgerald, the translation of the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam. That poem passed through- four editions. I understand that the first edition only is at present obtainable in a cheap form. Many editions have been published of the first version, but I do not think that copyright has run out in the subsequent versions. (Consequently purchasers have to pay a little more for subsequent versions than for the first. There were alterations of a substantial character, sufficient to extend copyright to the subsequent editions. </para>

                        has taken a considerable amount of time to explain to us what the common law of England is in relation to new editions of books, but the point is whether this clause does not fail to carry out the views that he has expressed. He has laboured at some length the fact that in order to secure copyright in a second edition of a book the alterations and editions have to be extensive and substantial. But in this clause those important words are left out, and we are asked to enact that any alteration or addition shall be sufficient to entitle a new edition to copyright. I will give one or two instances. Take any work of legal procedure, or a text book such as
                        <inline font-style="italic">Archbold,</inline>
                        or
                        <inline font-style="italic">Bullen and Leake.</inline>
                        The slightest alteration in such a book would make a new book of it under this clause.

Under this clause a man could, by putting on the top or bottom lines of an already published sheet of music, optional notes, get an entirely new copyright. If it is intended simply to give copyright to a new edition in which substantial and extensive alterations are made, why not say so? </para>

                    <para>- There is considerable force in the contention that the word " any " does not carry with it the idea that the alterations must be of a substantial character, and, therefore, might leave the Court no option. At the same time, I cannot see the force of the contention that the clause should be struck out. If a man published a very valuable work, and, , a few years later, on some recent discovery which had been made, he brought out a revised edition, it would be a real hardship to deprive him of copyright in that edition. </para>

                    <inline font-style="italic">bond fide,</inline>
                    a new edition is to be regarded as a new book. No one can take any exception to that view, because it would be very unfair to a man, who practically remodels his work, to refuse him a copyright. Such an author makes use of the old frame- work of the ship, in order to produce what is practically a new vessel ; and the law of England, at this moment, is that a new edition, which is altered substantially in that way, is to be regarded as a new book.

                        <para>- No ; copyright, as we understand it, is the creation of the Statute. The Judges, who do not give copyright, have to define what is a new took; and the Courts have decided that, in all fairness, a new edition, which has been altered to the extent I have indicated, is entitled to be considered a new book. But the question remains - What is an edition ? An author may publish a limited issue of 100 copies, and, five or ten years later, if the book becomes popular, he may make some extensive or substantial alterations, and publish another limited edition. The public ought to receive something in return for the copyright which they give, and there ought to be some definition of "edition," or otherwise the public may be robbed of the consideration tq which they are entitled. </para>

                        <para>- At any rate, the position would be no worse. Whether the clause be struck out or not. there ought to be a definition of " edition." The amendment is to introduce words which may or may not exhaustively cover the basis of the Court's definition as to what is a new book. If the amendment does not exhaustively dover the basis, then it must be embarrassing, and may interfere either with the rights of authors, or the rights of the public. </para>

                    (Tasmania). - I am not quite sure that it is desirable to insert the words "extensive or substantial." "An author could make a mass of wholly irrelevant and immaterial alterations, which might fairly be called "extensive," but which would not alter the scope or character of the book in any way. What I think we all have in contemplation are "substantial" alterations.

The original copyright may have expired, and then any person might publish the book. But even while the copyright in the original edition subsists, if any substantial alteration is made, another writer could apparently get copyright and retain the same name for his book.

                        <para>- If the circumstances are such that the public are misled into buying the second man's book under the impression that it is the book published by the first man, the question of copyright does not arise. There is no question of copyright in the title of a book or of a newspaper ; but if, by the use of the same title, an author leads the public to believe that his book is the -production of another author, the author whose property is depreciated in value by the use of a similar title for a later book may have a common law action for damages, and so with a newspaper. I think that the word "substantial " would meet all the circumstances ; but, as it' appears to be the desire of the Committee to use the words "material or substantial," I have no objection to the amendment. Perhaps the word " extensive " does not properly apply. The learned Judge who used it in the case to which I have referred may have had in his mind the circumstances of that particular case, in which extensive alteration might have had a good- deal of influence in determining the nature of the new book. MacGillivray, in writing on the law of copyright, refers to a case in which a Judge held that a single alteration in one line of a poem was sufficient to render a book a new book. </para>

                        <para>- Whatever words we put in, we shall make it easier for an author to get an extended copyright for a new edition. The Courts have held that a new edition, to be entitled to copyright, must be substantially a new work,, and' various words have been, used, such as colourable, extensive, material, .and substantial, to define what is meant. Any words we insert here will be restrictive, because only the particular terms we use will then come into operation, and everything else will be excluded from the consideration of the Court. An author may publish a small first edition of his work, for which he will get a long term of copyright, and when it is about to run out he may produce a fresh edition with some substantial, alterations in it. Publishers who would be prepared in ordinary circumstances to issue the very latest improved edition of the work, would be confined to the publication of the first edition, as only the copyright of that edition would have run out. Why should not the best edition be given to the public, under such circumstances? Without this provision, an author during the term of the copyright of his work - and it would probably be to his interests to do so - might bring out fresh editions, subject to the term of the copyright of the first edition. If this provision is agreed to, when the copyright of the first edition runs out, publishers who desire to secure profit from the sale of the work, may flood the market with copies of the inferior first edition. I think that it might, perhaps, be better to limit the right of an author to secure copyright for a second edition. What is proposed is practically an extension of the term of the original copyright. </para>

                    <para>- Before dealing with this amendment it would be wise to consider the effect of the whole clause. The amendment would be a distinct improvement on the clause. Difficulties will arise, if this clause is passed, that are worthy of consideration. What is to be done in the case of a book or play which is the product of joint authors? A valuable work might be produced by two or more joint authors, and immediately after the first edition of, say, 1,000 copies is exhausted, one of them might make an important alteration in his part of the work and obtain a separate copyright. What then' would become of the property of the other author in the original work ? The new edition, containing the alteration, might have the run of the market, and the other joint author in the original edition would have no copyright in the new edition. </para>

Suppose that two persons collaborate in writing a play - and the copyright of a play is sometimes exceedingly valuable - and that after a short period one of those persons makes a vast improvement or alteration in the play, if this clause is passed that person will be the only one given a copyright in the new version of the play, and the old one may be cast aside. We should not give any person the power to perpetrate an injustice of that kind. </para>

                        <para>- I can see that under this clause as it stands, very serious injustice might be perpetrated. Take, for instance, the case of Gilbert and Sullivan's operas. One person wrote the words and the other supplied the music of those operas. Suppose that one of them had been entitled by making a substantial alteration, to the sole right of copyright in the new version, he would have been given the sole copyright in an opera which was in part the work of the other, and a very great injustice would have been done. I am not prepared at the present moment to suggest an amendment, but I think that the clause ought to be postponed in order to afford honorable senators an opportunity for further consideration. </para>

                        <para>- It arose out of the honorable senator's remarks from an interjection by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen.</inline> If the alterations be separable, or if the added matter be susceptible of copyright, then their author alone is entitled to copyright, but only in respect of them. But if the men have written originally on the principle that they are joint authors, who jointly hold the copyright, then I maintain that the author of an alteration cannot say that he is the author of the new book, and the copyright will ensure for the collaborators. But if, on the other hand, the book be written in distinct parts by separate authors, and the name of each author be attached to the portion written by him, then under clause 20 he will acquire a separate copyright. I think there need be no fear of difficulty of the character suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens.</inline></para>

It is one thing to have decisions given by Judges in relation to the particular facts of each case; but it is another thing to lay down a hard-and-fast rule in a Statute, and ask the Judges to give effect to it in the various complex connexions which it has with other parts of the subject we are legislating about, such as those called attention to by

                    I cannot say whether he is right or not, or what the consequences will be. But the clause lays down a hard-and-fast rule of law to facilitate the operations of authors and publishers in getting; an extended right to the detriment of the reader and the general community. I make that remark because of

It does to a certain extent codify the law, but it does so with a limitation against the community, and an extension in favour of authors and publishers. The question is not whether we are giving a copyright to a new edition, but that we are anxious to give a copyright to what is in substance and in good faith a new book.

                    read, quite properly, the decisions which have been given in relation to particular cases which happened to arise, and which had to be decided according to their own circumstances. That cannot be better illustrated than by the instance he quoted just now from the Scotch, case, in which Lord Deas said that the alteration was such1 as to constitute a new book. The other Judges disagreed with him, and said that in their opinion it had not that effect, and that it would be improper to strain the law to that extent. Therefore, when honorable senators are told, and properly told, that Judges have decided various things in different cases, they must not assume that that is having down a rigid rule of law, which we are to embody as nearly as we can in an Act of Parliament. It merely means that in the circumstances of a particular case the Judges came to a conclusion which they thought was fair and just. They have held that in certain cases there may- be such alteration's, extensive and substantial, and not colourable, as would constitute the production of a new book, as though it had been written from cover to cover, and i no part of it had previously appeared. The essence of their view in the particular case of

                <para class="block">What are we asked to do? With <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce's</inline> amendment, this clause will provide that a work with substantial or material alterations or additions shall be deemed a new book. The Judges say that before a man can limit the right of the reading public by getting a new copyright, he must show such alterations and additions as in the judgment of fair men would entitle, the work to be regarded as a new book. This clause, if amended as proposed, will repeal that law ; therefore, it is not a codification of the law. It may lead us into great difficulty, and produce a crop of litigation. Just as I warn people not to go to law, so I warn the Committee to avoid putting in the measure a clause which is likely to encourage unnecessary litigation. I trust that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> will accede to the excellent suggestion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens,</inline> in order that a full opportunity may be given to us to see that the clause will carry out the intention of its framers. It is very difficult to embody in an Act of Parliament a rigid rule which is supposed to give effect to a variety of decisions, because each case depends on its own circumstances. </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon's</inline>
                    contention were correct, and a new edition of a book were brought out, in which the alterations were of such a character that it was practically a new work. This clause having become law, the author of the edition would be able to get copyright. What would happen? First of all, the older editions of the book would come into competition with the new edition. The new edition would be the monopoly of one publisher, but the old edition could be published' by anybody. That competition would prevent any ill effects that might flow from the author of the alterations obtaining copyright in his work.

The point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> is dealt with -in other clauses. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> has advanced an argument which' I feel sure would receive consideration from any Court ; because in equity, surely, the rights of joint authors would have to be regarded. The rights of joint authors in their property are protected, and there is nothing in the clause we are dealing with to take them away. We might pass the clause, and if, subsequently, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> can think of a desirable amendment, it can be recommitted. So far he has not submitted any amendment, or shown that the clause needs amendment. His points are such as ought to have been raised when we were considering clauses 18 to 20. </para>

                    argues that my suggestion ought to have been dealt with upon clauses 18 to 20. I differ from him. The interests of joint authors are properly safeguarded in those clauses. It is here where we are creating a new right that the interests of joint authors are not considered: As we are creating a new right bv clause 26, this is the proper point at which to safeguard any new or old interests that may be endangered. Although
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline>
                    disclaimed any authority from a legal aspect, he laid down the law in a most dogmatic fashion. Clause 19 can be understood by any one who can read ordinary English. It gives the joint authors of any book or dramatic or musical work joint property. Clause 20 does the same. Clause 26, with which we are dealing, gives the author of any material or substantial alteration copyright in what is defined by this clause as a new work.

My desire is to insert a new clause to provide that in the case of joint authorship, one author may not have power, by making any substantial or material, alteration, to obtain copyright in a new and revised production, to the prejudice of the other author. Any alteration, no matter how substantial or material, would be based on the work of. the joint authors, and, if the new work were to entirely supersede the old one, the author, who had not made the alteration, would have no property in the later book.

                    (Tasmania- Honorary Minister). - This is a most serious and far-reaching amendment, which appears to be fraught with a great deal of danger. Works may have earned great repute, and ba known by their title so well as to give the latter considerable value. There are, for instance, such books as Darwin's
                    <inline font-style="italic">Origin of Species,</inline>
                    and Seeley's
                    <inline font-style="italic">Expansion of England;</inline>
                    and if, in either case, on the issue of a subsequent edition, the title had to be altered, it is quite conceivable that the alteration might be of such a character as to a great extent to deprive the owner of the copyright of the benefits which he might expect. If, on the other hand, the alteration were so insignificant that the owner of -the copyright might retain all the advantages, the public would be in no different position from that at present. The book, Copinger's
                    <inline font-style="italic">Law of Copyright,</inline>
                    from which I quoted: this morning, is, I notice, the fourth edition by J. M. E aston; and it " may be that other editors issued earlier editions.

                    which book has run through a large number of editions, some of great value, and yet older editions are of much more value in New South Wales and Tasmania than the later editions, owing to the procedure dealt with being more in conformity with the -procedure in those

This morning, again, I sent out for Maxwell's <inline font-style="italic">Interpretation of Statutes,</inline> but, to my disappointment, I was given the edition of 1875, which appears to have been the first, the book having since run into about fourteen editions. All these are known as standard works by their very titles, and the question of the edition does not, I think, in any way affect the public, except in so far as the desire is to be supplied with the latest edition. </para>

                        <para>- Many editions of law-books are by different writers. A law-book may be edited by men, long after the original author is dead. For example, I think I have a <inline font-style="italic">Chitty</inline><inline font-style="italic">on Contracts,</inline> of the date 1829, and, of course, nobody would imagine that the bulky tome under that name now in use was prepared by the author of the first edition. Ancient first editions, as a rule, are of no value in. the case of law-books, except historically, and usually the work of the original author represented in the latest editions is very small. I think the amendment would seriously interfere with the rights of authors, and others who are interested in books bearing names which carry a great deal of significance in the minds of that portion of the public concerned with the subjects dealt with. Under the circumstances, I must oppose the amendment. </para>

                    though the idea itself gains some force from the remarks of the Minister, who points out that a title itself may be of value. As the Bill stands, a writer, who had published a work under a certain title, and disposed of the copyright to a publisher, might claim to use the same title again for a revised edition of the work. It might be difficult to prove that it was legally a fraud, but there can be no doubt that morally he would be defrauding the publisher of a portion of the value of the property which he had sold tq him.

Whilst I am prepared to support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce's</inline> amendment as an improvement on the clause, I think we should do still better if we struck the clause out altogether. That would not embarrass the Minister, as he could recommit the Bill for the insertion of a new clause, which would give effect to what he desires without including any provision to which the Committee objects. It appears to me that in this clause we are practically giving a right to an author to a perpetual copyright, or a right to a perpetual lease or renewal of a copyright. Much as I desire to safeguard the interests of authors, I suggest that the rights of the public might also be considered. For these reasons, and in no spirit of animosity towards the Bill, I am satisfied that I should vote against the clause. </para>

                <para>SenatorDRAKE., - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has referred to a case in which an author does not part with the copyright in his book, but whilst an edition is going through the press he makes an alteration which entitles him, to an extended copyright, and he puts the publication of the new edition into the hands of a different publisher. That would be distinctly a fraud on the first publisher. I agree with the contention of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane,</inline> and I shall vote for the amendment. I think it is most desirable that we should have as much distinction as possible between different editions if this is to be the law. There can be no doubt that this provision will enable authors and publishers to evade the principal provision of the law with regard to the term of copyright. It will enable them to get practically perpetual copyright for a work by bringing out different editions from time to time, and securing, the full term of copyright for the new edition. It has been contended by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> that this provision is rendered comparatively harmless by the subsequent clause; which provides for free publication of the first edition, but I think that that, is a most pernicious thing, and will afford no protection whatever to the public. If there is any justification for an extended term of copyright, it must be On the ground that the new edition is an improvement on the first. Generally the object of our laws should be to bring the improved edition of a, book within the reach of the public, and without infringing any rights, to as far as possible suppress the first and inferior edition. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> contends that there will be a competition which will prevent the holder of the extended copyright getting too high a price 'for his work. </para>

                        <para>- It is the competition between the big and the little purse. The well-to-do man will be able to secure the later edition at the higher price, to the satisfaction of the author and the publisher, whilst the inferior edition will be sold cheaply to the mass of the people. I do not think that is a result which we need be particularly proud of. The Minister has referred to legal text-books, and there can be no doubt that in respect of them there is practically perpetual copyright, but that does no great harm, because they are circulated amongst professional men, who know exactly what they are buying. We are here dealing with all kinds of books ; and in most cases people, in buying a book, do not look to see whether what they get is the first, second, or third edition of the work. I take the case of a man who has written a medical treatise, laying down rules of treatment for a particular disease. After a long practice he finds that he has made mistakes, and desires to substitute some improved treatment. He might be sufficiently courageous and honest to say, in a new edition of his work, " I recommended such and such treatment in a former edition, but having found that that 'is not the best treatment, I now recommend a different treatment." On the other hand, he might not do so. He is to be given an extended copyright of the second edition ot His work, going, perhaps-, twenty years beyond the original copyright, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> contends that he will not be able to get too high a price for the amended edition of his work because the first edition, which advises a treatment that is manifestly wrong, is put on the market in competition with it. That would be a most undesirable state of affairs. There would be a "kill 'em" edition and a "cure em" edition, and the general public would be given an opportunity to purchase the "kill 'em" edition. I think that some provision should" be made in such a case to prevent the further publication of the first edition of the book. We should, I think, provide that an extended copyright in a new book shall only- be given to the holder ot the copyright of the first edition, and that the first edition shall not lie published after the new work comes out. </para>

                    has suggested that we should limit the copyright in a subsequent edition of a book to the holder of the copyright in the first edition. That would be absolutely impracticable. In his argument he said, in effect, " It mav be all right to reserve for legal text-books something in the nature of a perpetual copyright, because they are only dealt with by men who are interested in the subject-matter." The same remark applies equally to a medical work, and largely to a mathematical work; in fact, it applies to nearly all branches of science and knowledge. The question of copyright is of more value in connexion with these books than in connexion with the more ephemeral literature. Let me point out how it would be impracticable to give to the first owner of the copyright or his assignee the copyrights in subsequent editions. A few moments ago I referred to a well-known legal text-book, called

                            may have made an arrangement with his publishers at the time.

                        <para>- Very likely the copyright was taken out in his name, and assigned immediately to a firm of booksellers, and it is the owner of the copyright who has been getting the extension for the additions from time to time. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens'</inline> objection, to which the Minister's answer seems to give a good deal of weight, is that under this clause it will be possible for a man to come along and get a copyright in an edition of another man's work. If that is what the Bill means, the clause ought to be struck out at once. I had no idea that the Government contemplated that the copyright in a new edition could be granted to any one who was not the holder of the copyright in the first edition. It would mean a system of legalised piracy and nothing else. </para>

                (Queensland).- Perhaps I can suggest an amendment which may remove the objections of some honorable senators. Under the provision as it stands, any person may make a substantial and material alteration in a book, and get a copyright therein to the prejudice of its author. The author of a "book may sell for a fair value to one set of publishers the copyright therein ; but afterwards, by introducing material and substantial alterations, he may create a technically new book, and his copyright therein he can sell to another set of publishers, to the prejudice of the publishers of the original edition.' Then, again, there is the case of a Look which is the property of joint authors. I think it would get over all these difficulties if we were to insert an amendment after the word " book "-

                    <para>- There seems to have been a great ,deal of hair-splitting in connexion with this clause. During the discussion I have occasionally wondered whether I was sitting in a Legislative chamber or in a Court of Justice, where advocates were trying, from their briefs, to make out the best case for their clients. It appears to me, as a layman, that the clause is quite sufficient as it stands. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce's</inline> amendment has been carried, but notwithstanding, if a dispute arose as to whether the additions made to the book were of a substantial character, the case would have to be referred to a Court. It would be for the Judges to say whether the book was so altered as to entitle it to an. extension of copyright. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons'</inline> amendment, so. far as I can see, does not make the clause any more effective. </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir JOSIAH</inline>
                    SYMON (South Australia). - With a view to show my honorable friend who has just resumed his seat that there is no particular hair-splitting, I will remind him of what the real position is. Nobody asserts that a new edition of a publication is, or ought to be, entitled to fresh copyright. No new edition, merely as such, is, or ought to be, entitled to a fresh period of copyright. No one asserts that a fresh issue of a publication, with additions and alterations, is simply on that account entitled to a fresh period of copyright. No Judge has ever yet decided. that. What has been decided is that if there is a new issue of an old publication already enjoying copyright, and the Court; is of opinion, first, that substantial and extensive alterations have been made in it, and, secondly, that those alterations are of such a character that in the judgment of the Court it is fair and just that it should be so treated, the new publication may be regarded as a new book, and be entitled to fresh copyright. Two things are necessary in order to give a right to a new period of copyright. One is that the Court shall find that there axe extensive material and substantial alterations. The second is that those alterations are of such a character as to make it practically a new book. This clause relates to the first of those conditions. It says that it will be sufficient if the Court finds that substantial alterations have been made. No one can assert that a new edition is entitled to copyright as such. That would be a monstrous thing to say. But where the alterations are of such a character that they practically make the work a new book it is fair that it should be so regarded. This Bill, in the interests of authors, publishers, and the reading public, prevents the Court from granting the concession of extended copyright, unless the alterations made are of such a character as to make it practically a new book. That is the object of the amendment.

                        <para>- Under the present state of the law the Judges have to find two things before a man is entitled to a, new period of copyright. One is that the alterations made are substantial and extensive, and the other is that they are of such a character as to warrant the Court in regarding the publication as new. We take away the whole discretion of the Court if we apply a rigid rule, and say that a new edition shall have copyright extended to it if it simply contains alterations. I say that the matter ought to be left to the Court. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> says that this is a codifying of the law. It is not. It is taking away the power of the Courts to decide these cases on their merits. It is narrowing the law against the public, and enlarging it in favour of the owners of copyright. That is unfair. I do not pledge myself to the terms of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator demons'amendment.</inline> That is a matter for the Minister and the draftsman. But I say that in substance the amendment is right. It does what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> really desires to do, and what I desire. It leaves the Court to find two things - alteration and materiality, plus the fact that the alterations are of such a character as to make the book a new one. I say that we should not take away one leg upon which the law stands. The Court should still look to materiality and substantiality as allowing it to grant extended copyright. Otherwise the Court will say, "We cannot go into the question of whether this book is worthy of being called a new book, because the Legislature has said imperatively that it is. All that we have to say is that material alterations have been made, and we are precluded from saying any more." If that is what we want to do let us say so. But that is not in accordance with the decisions in recorded cases. The best illustration that has been given is that of the Scotch case, where the Judge treated as a material and substantial alteration entitling a poem to a fresh period of copyright what other Judges said ought not to be so regarded. </para>

                        <para>- I have been thinking it over in the interval. The decisions which have been referred to are not common law. They are the results of a body of cases which have been determined on their merits. A decision in one case given according to the facts may be no guide to a decision in another case. We have to avail ourselves of principles laid down as far as we can. </para>

Although I have not the terms of the amendment before me, I take it that the intention is to give effect to the principle that in determining whether or not a new edition shall be entitled to copyright, the Judge shall decide not only whether the alterations or additions are material or substantial, or both, but whether the result, the sum total, is in the opinion of the Court a production on which it is desirable copyright shall be granted. This proposal, in my opinion, is out of harmony with the English law. </para>

                    (New South Wales). - I take strong exception to the remarks with which the Minister commenced his latest address to the Committee. The honorable senator reprimanded honorable senators for not having circulated notice of amendments in order that he might consider them. But I ask any one with the slightest knowledge of Committee work, whether it is always possible to do so? In the present case the amendment has been suggested largely as the result of discussion on a previous amendment ; and to say that we are not within our rights, or are not acting in a proper businesslike way in submitting amendments which we consider necessary under these circumstances, is an utter absurdity. What the Minister's claim amounts to is that when he, in consultation with the Parliamentary Draftsman, has (prepared and submitted a Bill no one is to have the audacity to lay, a finger on it. It is a strange doctrine that infallibility rests in the particular draftsman who prepares the measures which the Minister submits. The very fact that the Minister has agreed to one amendment shows that the Committee are doing good work, if we may accept the Minister's authority at all on the point.

                        <para>- The records of the Senate will show that it is correct. That amendment was declined when moved from this side, but after <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> had walked down, and had a chat with the Minister, it was accepted from the other side. I have no desire to refer to these matters, but when I am told that what I say is incorrect, it is time for me to protest. Everything said in support of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons'</inline> amendment, with which I agree, is really an argument for the elimination of the clause ; every amendment brings us back step by step to the common law practice as described by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> himself. We are all seeking to achieve that which would exist without the clause, and yet, because this provision appears in the Bill, there is some hesitancy to strike it out. Are we to be bound in such a way ? On the other hand if we want to alter the existing state of affairs, it is proper to keep the clause; but the very fact that we. are endeavouring to amend the provision shows that we are trying to get away from it in the direction of the existing common law. While I support the present amendment, I shall endeavour to get the clause eliminated. </para>

                    (Tasmania).- I cannot help adding a few words in reply to the remarks of
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating.</inline>
                    It is a most extraordinary position to take up, that when honorable senators on both sides are anxious to improve the Bill, without the slightest suggestion! of party tactics, but animated simply by only the one desire, the Minister, of all others, should have the audacity to upbraid us. It is of infinitely more importance that we should give every consideration to a Bill in Committee, which is the place to safeguard legislation, than, that we should devote four or five hours to making second-reading speeches. I regard the amendment as a fair and proper corollary to the amendment - which was passed at the instance of
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline>
                    but which the Minister declined to entertain, when suggested from this side. I have had the unparalleled audacity to submit an amendment, which, because I have moved it, I feel perfectly sure will be defeated. That certainty, however, will not deter me from pressing the question to a division. It is not sufficient, in my opinion, to say that the alterations or additions shall be material or substantial. Even if those terms are used no one will deny that there are differing degrees of materiality and substantiality; and a Judge, with counsel appearing for the parties, might be forced to admit that an alteration was material, and that as the law gave him no discretion as to whether it was material enough, he would be bound to say it was a new book - a decision he would not have arrived at if he had not been fettered by the clause. The amendment, so far from weakening the clause, strengthens it, and it only carries out the procedure which, especially in measures of this kind, is observed. It is rarely that in our legislation we bind a Court down with any rigid words.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline>
                    will bear me out that the history of legislation shows innumerable blunders committed by Parliaments in making hard and fast rules in legislation of the kind.

It is the pride of our system that a Judge is not absolutely bound hand and foot by the mandates of the Legislature, and that we allow him the exercise of discretion. Not to do so would be to assume that we are able to draft a Bill which will secure absolute justice without the slightest chance of anything going wrong. I propose to press my amendment, merely because I think it a desirable corollary to the words we have already inserted. </para>

                    (Tasmania).- I do not take it that the Minister offers unreasonable objection to the amendments, but he is naturally anxious to adhere to the Bill as it stands. I remind the honorable and learned senator that every amendment of the clause so far proposed has been in the direction of liberalizing its provisions in the interests of the general public. The tendency of the clause as it stands is to confer on the owner of the copyright something more than many honorable senators believe he is entitled to. I think it would be better to state such amendments of the clause as the majority of the Committee think advisable, and the Minister will then be able to consider whether he cannot draft a new clause to meet the wishes of the Committee.

It will be admitted that the discussion on the clause has been illuminating, and we are now better acquainted with its probable effect, and the difficulties surrounding it, than Ave were before the discussion commenced. I fail to see why there should be an outcry against that discussion as though it had been a mere waste of time. It has not been a waste of time. It is within the knowledge of every honorable senator that we have frequently adjourned because we have had nothing to do. Now that we have something to do, and have ample time in which to do it, we should see that it is done properly. I have no objection to the clause passing now, on the distinct understanding that opportunity will be afforded for the fullest right of discussion and the fullest right to amend the clause on recommittal. I propose to indicate now, for the convenience of the Minister, the amendments which I desire should be made. I wish to insert after the word "book," in line 3, the words - and the copyright of the same shall vest in the then owner of the copyright in the former edition.

                    SYMON (South Australia). - I wish to make a fresh suggestion. It has already been suggested, first, that the clause should be postponed, secondly, that it should be allowed to go as it stands, and that opportunity should be given to amend it on recommittal. That is always an uncertain and an unsatisfactory course to adopt, because the clause proposed for recommittal may come on for consideration at a time when honorable senators taking the deepest interest in the subject may not be present.

                        <para>- I did the same thing last session for the convenience of honorable senators who wished to discuss the union label provisions of the Trade Marks Bill. However, in connexion with that measure, when a second attempt was made for the purpose of reconsidering the union label clauses, I refused to be a party to the recommittal, and the motion was withdrawn. If honorable senators are not present to take advantage of an opportunity afforded for recommittal, they should take the consequences. We are now approaching th« hour at which it is usual for the Senate to adjourn on Friday afternoon, and I suggest that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> should move to report progress. That will afford us an opportunity to consider the various amendments suggested in connexion with this clause between now and next week, and it will not be necessary either to postpone the clause, or to seek its recommital. I ask my honorable and learned friend to adopt that course, but if he does not fall in with this third suggestion, I shall address myself to the amendment suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens.</inline></para>

                    (Tasmania- Honorary Minister). - With regard to the third suggestion, I would point out that we have still half-an-hour before the usual time for the adjournment of the Senate, and I think we would be justified in taking advantage of that time to proceed with the Bill.

                        <para>- Quite so. There are a number of persons who need to be protected. For instance, the owner of copyright in a book needs to be protected because, under the clause as it stands, any man could come along and pirate his work by making a few substantial or material alterations: </para>

                        <para>- Yes. Supposing that an author sold the copyright in a popular work to a publisher for a considerable sum, and that after an edition had been published the author were to make substantial or material alterations in his work, this clause would give him a property in a new work which would supersede the old one. He could sell the copyright in the new work to another firm of publishers, and thus practically swindle the publisher of the original edition to whom he had sold his copyright. </para>

                        <para>- The previous amendments were verbal, and practically carried out the spirit of the clause. But this amendment, so far as I can understand it, does not deal with the subject-matter of the clause. It introduces the question of the ownership of copyright, and ought to be moved as a separate clause. I confess that I am in the dark as' to its exact meaning. The clause deals with the copyright in a second or subsequent edition of a book, that is, a new book. The question of the ownership of copyright is dealt with in clauses 18, 19, and 20. If it leaves any doubt as to whether ownership would be disturbed by the issue of a new edition, then the question of ownership should be dealt with in a separate clause, and not in this clause. In all friendliness, I would ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> to withdraw his amendment, and, after we have had an opportunity of comparing his proposal with other clauses, we shall be in a position to make up our minds. In what position will he place us if he presses for a division to-day? He admits, as the discussion has shown, that the question is a complicated one. </para>

                    <para>- What the honorable senator is trying to do now is to get in an explanation.' The clear effect of his remarks, especially his reference to Wednesday, was to show that it is desira'ble to report progress now, in order that the matter may be taken up on Wednesday next, when it will be comparatively fresh in our minds. If, however, the clause be passed to-day, with the promise of a recommittal, some weeks may elapse before we shall be called upon to approach its consideration again, and our minds will not be as closely in touch with it then as they are to. day, after a lengthy discussion. I am satisfied that we all see the clause in an entirely different light from that in which it was presented to us when we first approached its consideration. If three or four weeks were to elapse before we again turned our attention to the provision, the effect of to-day's discussion would be largely lost. If, however, another day has to be spent in the discussion of the provision later on, the Minister must take the responsibility for that consumption of time. I would ask the Minister to consent to report progress, with a view to affording us an opportunity to recast the proposal before Wednesday next, and enabling him to see how far he can go to meet the views expressed, not from this side alone, but from various quarters. </para>

                    <para>- I hope that the Minister will not force us to a division on the amendment to-day. It is a matter for serious consideration whether the amendment ought not to be moved as a new clause, and also whether it really goes far enough. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> has moved an exceedingly important provision, which may raise many issues. It may extend further than the proprietorship of the author of the original book. It may involve many other serious considerations. I hope, therefore, that the Minister will consent to report progress. </para>

We have spent a great deal of time upon the consideration of this clause, and I think that honorable senators on both sides deserve credit for giving their very serious attention to its subject-matter. The discussion has not been a waste of time. On the contrary, it has done a great deal of good, although we have not passed many clauses. If business were likely to be done, I should certainly say let us proceed. </para>

                        <para>- There might be hardship in a case like that. For instance, the editor of a particular work might acquire the copyright in it, and subsequently somebody else, by his own knowledge and research, might give an added value to that work, with the consent of the parties concerned in the copyright, and might wish to have the copyright himself. But the copyright, by the operation of law, and apart from any express arrangement between the parties, would vest in some other person who did not desire to hold it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> has pointed out, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> have by their applause indicated that they hold a similar view, that, in his opinion, a man who is not responsible for an original work can acquire copyright in it by. making some additions or alterations of a material and substantial character. But if the person who made the additions or alterations were to publish the original book for the purpose of his own work he would at once be guilty of piracy, and that would deprive him of any opportunity of getting copyright. He would not be the author of the production, but only of the emendations or alterations. Consequently he could not get copyright. Further, if he published such a work, and drew largely, as he would necessarily do, on the original work, he would be guilty of piracy. </para>

                        <para>- Well, I have to unlearn a good deal that I have studied in connexion with copyright if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons'</inline> view is correct ! He argues that it is possible for a person to take hold of another's book, and, by making alterations or amendments, acquire copyright in it. But I reply that if he were to draw upon the original work he would be guilty of piracy in the first instance, and his very action would void any possibility of acquiring copyright. </para>

                        <para>- The right to produce an original work is vested hi the owner of the copyright by clause13. An original work can only be reproduced by the person who has the copyright in it, or some person authorized by him. Copyright may be assigned absolutely or partially to some other person in some particular locality for some particular period. That is the reason why the words " any person " are inserted. I will give an instance. In the case of some large works of world-wide value, the owners of copyright in Great Britain or America assign, say, to persons in Canada, for a limited term, the right to republish. There is a case in which the Court at. Toronto, in 1903, decided, in the case of <inline font-style="italic">Black</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">The Imperial Publishing Company,</inline> in connexion with the <inline font-style="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica,</inline> that the person who had the right to publish was not the holder of the copyright, but simply a licensee. The words " any person " are included because some other person than the owner of the copyright may have a right to publish - limited as to time or place. Different positions might arise in different situations with regard to holders of copyright. For these reasons I would urge <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> to take advantage of the opportunity which I promised to give to him. </para>
