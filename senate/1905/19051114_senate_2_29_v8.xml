                        <para>- The relationship of my remarks to the question before the Committee is very direct. The matter we are dealing with is of great importance, and when it was before the Senate last year we were met with even a request that we would help to improve the Bill, and I am now suggesting that it would be well if the Government would meet us to-day in a similar spirit, and would believe that we are actuated by a desire, not only to improve the Bill, but to promote what, I suppose, is their object - the interests of Australia. I am putting forward a plea for fair consideration of the remarks which we may have to make, or the amendments which we may feel it our duty to submit. This clause raises the question of empowering the Minister, under prescription, to deal with exports. I do not refer at once to the matter of imports, because the clause begins with again asking for power on the subject of imports which is already conferred by the Customs Act. This is, therefore, a clause specially dealing with exports. I wish honorable senators to be seized of the grave importance of the powers which! are now asked on behalf of Customs officers. Power is asked for them to interfere in practically all directions, to enter any ship, wharf, or place, and open not merely prescribed packages, but any packages, and do anything which, in their judgment, they may deem to be necessary in order to carry out the provision. I believe it would be well if Parliament would confine Customs authorities to the power which they already possess under the Customs Act, and that is the power of dealing with all goods under Customs control. When the question is put I shall vote against the clause. Meanwhile, if any honorable senators wish to submit an amendment, with a view to its improvement, it can be considered by the Committee. </para>

                    <para>- We have now reached what may be referred to as the heart of the Bill. This clause opens up to us what is contemplated'; and I think that if we will only reflect very briefly on the subject, we shall come to the conclusion that the Bill is going a long way beyond anything which has . ever been contemplated before, or which, so far as I am aware, exists in .any other part of the British Dominions. It is well that we should clearly understand what is proposed in the Bill, and to take a bird's-eye view of the scope of the legislation which is practically .intended to be initiated by this clause. If standing by itself, it is merely with a view to enable the inspection of goods which happen to be imported or entered for export to take place, then it is either super-adding to or cutting down the powers which already exist under the Customs Act. In its present form ' the Bill is practically an amendment of that Act. The two measures are to be read together;, but in its essence the Bill really departs from the principle and object of the English Merchandise Marks Act as in operation in England, and, I believe, in most of the States of Australia, and is restricted, so to speak, to what are in reality Customs provisions. I desire honorable senators to look for a moment ,at what is proposed in this clause. It provides, in the first place, that an officer may " inspect and examine all prescribed goods which are imported," and then goes on to provide for goods which are entered for' export or " brought for export to any wharf or place." The intention is first of all to deal with imports, and there is no doubt that certain provisions are salutary and advisable in regard to certain goods. No one can doubt for a moment that there are articles which may or not be prohibited from export. We do not need to travel beyond our existing Customs Act in order to ascertain that the Legislature is in ever\ country solicitous that certain imports shall not be admitted. Honorable senators will find all this dealt within section 52 of the Customs Act of 1901, which enumerates a considerable list of prohibited imports. I do not intend to occupy time by reading the entire list; but honorable senators, and certainly those who were here when the Customs Bill was passed, will recollect the very lengthy discussion that took place as to the inclusion of certain articles, for instance, "exhausted tea, oleomargarine, butterine, and similar products. There is a sub-list covered by the letters of the alphabet from "a" to "i" enumerating specifically prohibited imports, and providing in regard to other goods which may be prohibited by proclamation. Any one who considers how the Customs Act ought to be framed and administered will recognise that as a very salutary and necessary provision. There is also a provision, showing that this is entirely a matter for the Customs Act, with regard to prohibited exports, which are of a much more limited and restricted character, as shown by a reference to sections in and 112. These goods are greatly restricted for a very obvious reason. We do not wish to do either one of two things; we do not wish to restrict in any way exports from this country - it would be nonsensical to talk of doing anything of the kind - nor do we wish to proclaim to the world, with whom we do business, that the exports from Australia are of such a character, and open to such suspicion, that special legislation is necessary in order to overhaul them and put a brand on them so as to prevent people being misled and injured by their consumption. I0 mention these matters generally, in order to show that, while in regard to imports, there must be some kind of legislation and restriction as to what is prohibited and what is not--- </para>

                        <para>- Yes; some kind of fairly practicable restriction, so that anybody may clearly understand what the prohibited imports are, and that we are not handing over <inline font-style="italic">carte blanche,</inline> to the Minister of the day, who may or may not be trusted in relation to these matters, power to unnecessarily interfere. But, in my opinion, the Customs Act provides for all that is requisite in regard to imports. It is necessary that there should be specific legislation dealing with what we know as fraudulent descriptions ; that is, descriptions of goods, the importation of which may lead to the consumption of adulterated or deleterious products. </para>

                        <para>- Food, for instance. Undoubtedly, such legislation is very desirable and necessary, but I point out that any legislation by the Commonwealth Parliament in this respect will utterly and absolutely fail, unless, on theo part of the States themselves, there is legislation in relation' to internal trade. We may do what we please in order to insure that goods landed on the wharfs shall answer particular descriptions, but the moment those goods come to oe distributed, opportunity ;is afforded, if it be desired, by not very honest traders, for adulteration and all the other mischiefs which, unhappily, are occasionally incidental to trade. It is well to legislate in respect to misdescriptions, and say that goods bearing such descriptions shall not be admitted; that kind of legislation exists in England as part of the Merchandise Marks Act. But the Bill, of which clause 5 is the initial clause of a series, goes a great deal further. I do not think it has been realized what the Bill proposes to do in respect of imports'; and we ought to consider these clauses with the utmost care. This legislation is proposed not merely with- a view to excluding imports that are improperly marked, as to which', as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> say®, there ought to be proper and practicable legislation. The Bill goes on, beginning with clause 5, to prescribe that goods shall not be imported unless they bear a mark which the Minister may prescribe. </para>

Let us prohibit, if we like, goods, particularly foods for consumption, which bear a false and fraudulent description, but we have no right to put it in the power of any Minister, at any moment, to prescribe by regulation, which may, at the particular time, not have a chance of coming before Parliament, that some particular mark shall be placed on particular imports. </para>

                        <para>- It is not my intention to address myself to every clause as it comes before us. I am- now dealing with the first of a series of clauses; and I say that it is bad, first, because it deals with imposts; and, secondly, because it deals not with fraudulent marks, in regard to which we ought to legislate, but with marks which may be prescribed by the Minister for any reason or no reason, and without which the goods cannot be 'prohibited. If honorable senators are convinced that what the clause proposes is right and proper, and that the Minister ought to be intrusted with' this power, then .the provision may be passed unamended. But' we .have no precedent, so far as I know, of any legislation of the kind in any country of the world. </para>

                        <para>- If honorable senators feel that there is no reason for adopting this departure, by all means let us pass the first part of the clause. Of course, the absence of precedent is no argument if the clause be good ; but we must not overlook the fact that there is not a precedent for such a piece of legislation, so far as I am aware, in any country of the world, certainly not in England. It is provided in the clause that we are not merely to shut out goods which' are fraudulently marked, but that we are to shut out goods, no matter what their quality may be, if they do not bear the mark which the Minister prescribes, for any or for' no reason. A Minister may prescribe a mark with the very object of shutting out particular goods, and honorable senators ought to realize what the Bill means before they pass it. </para>

The effect of this clause would be to damn Australian produce in the eyes of people in. other countries who. deal with us.

                        <para>- The classes are limited, but the goods are not enumerated, the clause referring to " all prescribed goods " which are " entered for export or brought for export to any wharf or place." That clause leaves us open to the imputation that there is a necessity for this legislation, to put the matter in no other way. It leaves us open to the imputation that there is a necessity for stringent examination of the goods we sell, because there is a general practice current in the commercial and trading classes, and in the producing classes as well, to export goods which are fraudulently marked. </para>

                        <para>- We are placing in the Bill a placard which must intimate to our customers that, in the particular classes of goods indicated, though not specified, we are so utterly dishonest that it is necessary to legislate to protect those customers, and prevent them from being misled. If it were limited to that, it would be sufficiently mischievous. Of what use as it to complain of people in the old country giving us a bad name, or of Australians who do not praise the legislation of the Commonwealth Parliament? People must be honest. If any one asks what this measure means, we can only say that it is a libel on the producers of Australia. We can only say that it is mischievous legislation. How else are we to defend Australia from the inferences which may be drawn from the passing of a Bill of this kind ? </para>

                        <para>- I am trying to point out what this Bill provides. It is, intended to be of general application. We have, by our legislation, done enough injury. It is of no use to ask me, or any one else, to hold our tongues when we are asked to express an opinion on legislation which is disparaging to Australia. I say that this Bill is ill-considered. I am not blaming the Government in any way ; but, in dealing with the measure, I say it is unwise to attempt to place such a Bill upon the statute-book. If it were a mere matter of Customs regulation, I should not take any particular pains about it; but I am anxious that we should uphold our reputation, and that we should not give a fresh handle, to those who are only too ready to run down everything that relates to Australia. I take the earliest opportunity to protest against the passing of this clause. So far as regards mere inspection, the provision is quite unnecessary, because there is a power to inspect, as there ought to be, under the Customs Act; but I do object to the use of the word " prescribed " as applied to goods that are imported. If it is intended that this measure shall deal with fraudulent descriptions, let us plainly say so. Do not let us limit it- to any goods that are hereafter prescribed. We have already in the Customs Act a distinct section dealing with prohibited imports. Let us adopt a similar course here. The object of the clause, so far as it refers to imports, is to keep out those that are fraudulently or improperly described, in order to prevent adulteration of foods, and so forth. We can provide for that by inserting in the Bill a schedule of the goods with which we propose to deal. I move - </para>

                <para class="block">If this' amendment is accepted, I shall subsequently, move' the insertion, after the word " imported," of the words " enumerated in the schedule." I propose the amendment, not with a view to binding Ministers in any way to adopt the method proposed, but in order to signify that the imported goods which ought to be the subject of this legislation should be goods fraudulently marked. Honorable senators will find that in the Imperial Merchandise Marks Act the goods which are prohibited from being imported are goods bearing a fraudulent mark, and no other. If we are legislating on the same lines, and for the same purpose, we should limit the prohibition of imported goods- to goods of that character. </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon's</inline>
                    speech, I was wondering whether, after all, I had not been labouring under some tremendous delusion. The honorable senator has stated that, from his point of view, the clause is intended to destroy the trade of Australia, and will have that effect. My impression was that the intention of the Government, in submitting the Bill, was not to destroy the trade of Australia, but to build it up and to give Australian goods such a reputation in the markets of the world that there would be no difficulty in finding buyers for them, because a guarantee would De given as to their purity and value in the country of origin.

If we adopt the course of adding, a schedule of goods to the Bill, we may omit some that should be included, and include some which it may not be .necessary to include. I intend to support the clause as it stands. </para>

                    <para>- I hope the Committee will accept my assurance that I propose to offer no factious opposition to the passing of this Bill. I desire, as a business man, to pass workable provisions, to give practical effect to the beneficent principle underlying this Bill. The whole of the debate on the measure but tends to strengthen my belief in the necessity for' expert advice in dealing with it. It is proposed to call upon people to accurately describe their goods, whether imports or exports. Our object is, with regard to imports, to protect the public, and, with regard to exports, to protect the reputation of the Commonwealth. These are desirable things. But the question is - Can we, by legislation, carry out those objects? For the sake of illustration, let me assume that this Bill,, as it stands, has become an Act of Parliament, and that a Customs inspector has been sent down to overlook a certain shipment for the purpose of seeing whether the goods comply with the description of them, as invoiced. Let us assume that the object of his inspection is to protect the public. To begin with, we are not going to protect the consumer by means of this Bill. We are hoping that the States will do that later on, if it can possibly be done. We are going to protect the importer ; and the importer generally knows a great deal more about the goods in his own trade than the inspector does. Assume that the inspector finds a piece of material invoiced as union. Very well ; he is not satisfied as to whether it is a union of linen or cotton, or whether it is a piece of calico or a piece of linen. He has to go to an analyst, to get that question determined. He takes a sample to an analyst, who tells him that the stuff is union - that is, that it contains both linen and cotton. But that piece of stuff may be union of the very highest quality, and its value may be greater than that of a piece of pure linen of coarse make. It may be a far better wearing material, and there may be no intention of deceiving the public in regard to it. </para>

                        <para>- What protection to the public is there in marking the goods as union? Absolutely none, as I shall be prepared to demonstrate by producing samples upon the table of the Senate. Take the three materials which I have just referred to - cotton, linen, and union. I have brought some samples of materials with me, so as to be able to show honorable senators that, with the best intentions possible, this measure will not do anything that will be of material advantage to the public, or tha't will protect the importer. Let me begin with the simplest illustration I can give. I hold in my hand a linen handkerchief. It is made of material manufactured by one of the best Belfast houses - a house known all over the world as being thoroughly honest. I hold in my other hand another linen handkerchief. Both are pure linen. But the handkerchief first mentioned is sold at 18s. a dozen, whereas the second is purchasable at 5s. 2d. a dozen. The same description - " linen handkerchiefs " - applies to both. What assurance has a man who goes into a shop to buy a linen handkerchief that he will not be charged 1s. 6d. for the inferior article? What protection does this Bill afford? The next day the same customer may go into another shop and buy a linen handkerchief priced as low as 6d. He gets a pure linen handkerchief in the second case, just as he did in the first. But everything depends upon the quality of the linen. </para>

I have here two pieces of woollen serge. They are both guaranteed as being pure woollen serge. The one, however, is made of what is known as cross-bred wool. It is a pure woollen material, and can be sworn to as such. It is sold at 3s. a yard. I also have here another piece of pure woollen serge, which is sold at 10s. a yard. Both goods come in under the same title, and there are forty or fifty qualities intervening between the two. Woollen serges are sold in all sorts of qualities at all sorts of prices, and they are all pure wool. What protection is afforded to the public with regard to such goods by means of this Bill ? </para>

Say that a man goes into a shop to buy a complete suit. He wants them cheap. Certain goods are put on the counter before him. He buys a suit for 12s. 6d. Surely he does not want any one to tell him that the stuff is shoddy. He knows it must be. It is impossible for it to be anything else. </para>

I am pointing out that, so far as fabrics are concerned, there are thousands of cases in regard to which it will be impossible to put upon goods any mark or brand that will be any indication of their real quality. The price of the article alone, combined with the credit of the retailer, is the means by which the public determines the quality of goods. </para>

I have also another piece of pure linen - guaranteed' pure - which is sold at 9¼d. a yard. Both are fronting linens, and both are pure. It- is the fineness of the weaving, and the quality of the fibre used, that determine the 'price. Linens can be bought at far lower prices even than 9¼d. I have here also a piece of union - consisting of linen and cotton - which is sold at 11?d. It- is therefore a higher-priced article tRan the other which is a pure linen material. </para>

                        <para>- Unfortunately, the cap does not fit, for politics has pretty well knocked me out of trade.' These qualities overlap each other. It is possible to purchase &amp; union, the price of which is higher, and which is a better material than a low-grade linen. You can also purchase a cotton which again overlaps a union, and is higher in price than a low class union. These remarks apply, of course, only to one particular branch of trade, but I ca.n very well understand that the same considerations may be carried a great deal further. There are certain things as to which the public do require to be protected from themselves and from the importer. Those goods come under the heading of imports of foods. Goods that are manufactured for use as food stand in a class by themselves. We should do all we can to see that .they are wholesome, but we require to make certain that it is possible to carry out the provisions that we enact. In regard to exports, the Bill provides that exporters are required to furnish descriptions where goods are prescribed. Here, again, so tar as the trade in fabrics is concerned, and so far as concerns woollens exported from Australia - if any are exported - It is very doubtful if we can give any application' to the clause. I have very little misgiving, so far as woollen exports are concerned, because Australia has not yet become a woollen-exporting country. Honorable senators say that the Minister will not do such silly things as sometimes are insinuated; but we do not know what a particular Minister may do. We are framing a law, and it will be the duty of any Minister to try to administer that law according to the intention of Parliament. A man, even although actuated by the best intentions, might make serious mistakes, which would militate very greatly against the success of our export trade. I have already stated what has happened in Tasmania, where the legi.sla.tors did possess some knowledge of the export trade in apples. We are asked to empower the Minister to require, if he pleases, that all shipments, of fruit shall be inspected, whether it suits the shipper or not. That inspection is quite unnecessary. The trade has developed without the aid of such legislation, and is increasing every year. It will place the trade at a very great disadvantage if we give to the Minister a power which he might exercise, even with the best of intentions, in&gt; an arbitrary and' improper manner. What is the remedy? It seems to me that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> has proposed the right remedy, and that is to prescribe in a schedule not merely the classes of goods, but the different lines, that we wish to have inspected prior to exportation. I cannot shut my ears to the arguments which have been adduced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> with, regard to the export of leather. In the interests of the manufacturers themselves it is desirable that properly-made leather should be exported.. There are some articles which should be inspected with a view to keeping up the reputation of our exports, but there are other articles which cannot be inspected with: advantage to the country. Undoubtedly the underlying principle of the Bill is good and sound, but the questions to be considered are: "How far can it be carried out with advantage?" and "Where is it likely to cause harm?" </para>

                    <para>. - I only rise to say a few words, because it is not my intention to make a second-reading speech. At the previous stage .the principle of the Bill was affirmed by a good majority, and the Committee has to deal with, the' details only. It is considering clause 5, but almost the whole of the last speech was directed to an alteration of clause 15, by the omission of paragraph <inline font-style="italic">d,</inline> which relates to apparel, including boots and shoes, and the materials from which they are manufactured. lt is better not to anticipate the discussion of that clause. I want to deal with the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> who says that the1 power which clause 5 proposes to give is, so far as imports are concerned, a.1 ready contained in the Customs Act. Under that Act we have the power to inspect imports, but we have no power to take samples of them. This clause enables us to take samples, and it is a very important addition to our powers. We must be placed in a position to direct the inspectors to deal with exports in the same way as they can now deal with imports. I ask honorable senators to agree to the clause on the ground that it gives a very necessary power to Customs officers. </para>

These are the sort of men with whom we have to deal, and whom the honorable senator is constantly championing.

                        <para>- The money was. paid with the approval of the .Minister of Trade and Customs, and accepted by him as a fair and_ satisfactory settlement. The state into which the Minister worked himself just now is as nothing compared with the state into which the trade of Australia might be worked if these unheard-of pro- posalswere enacted. Suppose that tomorrow an importation of Worcestershire sauce arrived, and it was said that the article was not genuine. I should like to see the Minister of Trade and Customs trying to make an experiment on a bottle of the sauce, and satisfy himself as to whether it was genuine or not. Biscuits of all sorts, and values are imported. How is any Minister to draw up regulations to define biscuits? By this Bill we are creating numerous offences. What we want is a simple Bill to make fraud punishable whereever it be found to exist, and not a Bill to enable the Minister to prescribe how a certain article, about which he knows nothing, shall be marked, with the possibility that a failure to give certain information, or an error, may cause the party concerned to appear at a police Court as a criminal. That is not the sort of legislation by which to crush absolute crime, and if honorable senators be wise they will put the Bill in the waste-paper basket. </para>

                    <para>- It would have been better, and more in keeping with the business in hand, if the Minister of Defence had addressed one or two arguments to the exact amendment which I have moved, rather than have loudly denounced a firm in a very improper way, and dragged in by the hair " King Charles' head." When we are discussing a business matter of this kind, it is well for the Minister to show some sense of proportion as to the time at the disposal of the Senate. I do not think the time was well spent in making unjust reflections on a firm, which happened to be a party to litigation, in which the Commonwealth was the other party, and between whom an arrangement was made, though certainly, as far as I can see, not for the purpose of shutting out facts. The Minister tells us that that is his inference; but, if so, he ought not " to measure other people's corn by his bushel." He ought not to make a reflection of an unkind character after a case has been settled. It is always desirable after a compromise has been arrived at in litigation of the kind, that neither of the parties shall be exposed to such insinuations and statements as have been made to-day - insinuations that a compromise was arrived at in order to prevent the facts being made public. The Minister does not seem to realize what my amendment is. </para>

He has no right to endeavour to prevent debate, by threatening that' he will throw the Bill into the waste-paper basket if that amendment be carried. The Minister, as I said before, does not seem to realize what my amendment means. Has the Minister referred to clause 9? That clause explains why, in the few remarks I made by way of interjection, I was desirous of drawing attention to what the real object of the Bill is.

                <para>That is what the Bill is for; it is not to enable the Minister to prescribe that any goods he chooses may be inspected, but to prevent the importation of goods to which a false trade description is applied. There is no necessity to have any goods prescribed by the Minister. It either ought to be provided that an officer may inspect and examine all goods, or we ought to specify in a schedule the goods he has to inspect. If the object of the Minister be to have power to inspect all goods in order to prevent the importation of goods possibly bearing a false description, then the word"prescribed" is unnecessary. Why should the Minister limit the examination of goods to those which he prescribed, if the object of the Bill is to prevent the importation of any goods to which a false description is applied? The Minister referred to clause 15, which limits the application of the Bill, but only as to clauses 7 and 11. I ask the Minister whether the goods, which are to be liable to inspection, are those referred to in clause 15? If they are, where is the necessity for the word" prescribed " ? If inspection is to be confined to the classes of goods indicated in clause 15, then all that is necessary is to enumerate them in a schedule, which would simply be a repetition of the clause. I have no desire to interfere with the efficacy of the Bill, if it has to be passed, but as clause 15 does limit the classes of goods to which clauses 7 and11 apply, why not limit the power of inspection to those goods? </para>

                        <para>- I do not think the Minister could. My amendment will give the Minister time to consider whether or not it is necessary to have a schedule or whether clause 15 is sufficient. I do not desire to anticipate, but it is quite obvious that clause 5, as well as clauses 7 and 11, ought to be controlled by clause 15; otherwise, by means of the simple word "prescribe," the operation of the clause under discussion will be extended beyond the limitation of clause 15. The omission of the word "prescribe" would be in no sense as fatal either to the principle or working of the Bill, but it would make the legislation harmonious, and confer the power of inspection on all goods coming within the operation of the measure. If clause 15 sufficiently defines the operation of the measure, then that clause is enough ; if clause 15 does not sufficiently define the operation of the measure, then the additional matters ought to be set out, and not left to be prescribed by the Minister. From these points of view, without entering upon larger and wider matters, the Minister, it seems to me, ought to accept the amendment. If the word "prescribe" be left out, and the Minister assures us that the Bill is to apply to the classes of commodities enumerated in clause 15, I shall support an amendment to include clause 5 with clauses 7 and11, as governed by clause 15. Such an amendment would have the effect of making the whole provision perfectly intelligible. </para>

Up to now, I have been under the impression that the members of the Government in another place introduced clause 15 in response to a general feeling there that the classes of goods should be limited. </para>

During my speech on the second reading, I gave an instance in which no money penalty could be inflicted, but in which the punishment was quite as severe. That was the case of the manufacturer who loaded his leather with the product known as barium. </para>

                        <para>- I am afraid the honorable senator does not know what he is talking about. In the case which I cited it was only one of all the manufacturers in Victoria who so loaded his leather, and the Government of Victoria had no power to inflict a penalty. I happen to know, however, that this manufacturer used every effort to prevent the publication of his name in connexion with the statement of the facts, because such publication might at one stroke have destroyed his business, and thus proved a much more drastic punishment than any fine. The clause as it stands 1s, in my opinion, sufficient. Neither <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> nor any other honorable senator has given any information as to what the proposed schedule should contain, and, therefore, in this connexion the Committee are in the dark. </para>

                    <para>- The debate has revealed the fact that the effect of the Bill will be more far reaching than was at first anticipated. Various Chambers of Commerce have sent in petitions against the Bill, but they could have had no idea that it will have such a far-reaching effect as has been disclosed. I admit that it was generally understood that the object of the Bill was to prevent the fraudulent importation and exportation of certain articles. Honorable senators will recollect that a deputation recently waited on <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne to represent that the Bill extended very much further than was necessary in the interests of the community. The Minister of Trade and Customs at the time promised that the goods included, in paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">d</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">e</inline> of clause 15 should not be affected by the measure. I am under the impression that what he said was that the intention was, to legislate only with regard to articles of food and medicines, and he was quite willing to limit the application of the Bill to such articles. When it came before the House of Representatives it was determined to include articles of apparel, seeds and plants, and manures. It if. clear that the idea running through the minds of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne and the members of the deputation that waited upon him was that the Bill was to apply to certain articles of commerce specified in the measure itself. </para>

If we pass clause 5 as it stands, it may very well be said that we have determined to put the whole trade of the Commonwealth in fetters. I decline to believe that any Minister, however able, honest, and well-advised, is in a position to exercise such powers as are here conferred with advantage to the Commonwealth. While I deprecate, as much as any honorable senator can, dishonest trading, and the placing of fraudulent marks upon goods in order to mislead the public, it would, in my opinion, be better to run all the risks arising from, that than to put the whole of the commerce of the Commonwealth in fetters, and to place its control in the hands of any one man, no matter how able and honest he might be. </para>

The Minister must present the regulations to Parliament within thirty days of their publication, but if Parliament is in recess they may not be presented until thirty days after its next meeting. </para>

In the first instance, in dealing with this measure, much was said as to the necessity of preserving the public health. We were told that it was practically a Health Bill, intended to deal with the adulteration of food and drink.

If the Bill is to have the scope proposed, it will do an illimitable amount of injury to the commerce of Australia, because every article of export will be branded as possibly "bad." Some honorable senator has suggested that petty thieves object to certain legislation dealing with them, but criminal legislation is not on the same footing as this Bill. In all criminal legislation we act upon the principle that a man is innocent until he is proved guilty. We do not bring a man before a police court, and say to him, "We are going to have an examination to find out whether you are a thief or not." But under this Bill every article of export and import is liable to be taken possession of by the Minister. </para>

                        <para>.- The object alluded to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> is that a man might be shown up as being a. dishonest trader, and, as the honorable senator has stated, he might by that means be punished more severely than by any penalty imposed by the Bill. I protest against the Committee passing a clause having such a far-reaching effect without very much more knowledge with regard to the matter involved than we possess at the present time. We should take every care that articles are not dishonestly exported or imported, but we should also bear in mind that every interference with trade hampers the effective conduct of that trade. It must re-act upon the people themselves, because if hindrances are placed in the way of trade and expenses are added to, the consumer has to pay more ultimately, so far as imports are concerned ; and in regard to exports, the exporters have to pay. A man who is to-day producing a first-class article will receive no better price for that article to-morrow - unless prices have gone up generally - simply because it has the Government brand upon it. While I give credit to honorable senators for a desire to maintain: the good fame of Australia, so that people may say that in buying anything that is produced in Australia they may depend upon obtaining a <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> article, which is what it represents itself to be, I say nevertheless that it is possible to go so tar that, instead of helping trade, we shall injure it, and make it harder for business people to extend their operations. To mv mind, this legislation will have that effect. I believe that if we could put it directly to the people of Australia that cur object is to enable the Minister to interfere with every article of export or import that goes out or comes into Australia, the Bill would be universally condemned from one end of the continent to the other, and that condemnation would be re-echoed at the other end of the world. Australia today is not in very good odour, because of what people call our restrictive legislation. This measure is still further restrictive. It will operate greatly to the detriment of the trading community. I do not wish to say that the supporters of the Bill desire to do anything of that kind, but I urge them to give the matter further consideration, in order that, if they find they have made a mistake, they may determine to limit the measure, so that it will effect known evils, and not imaginary ones that may or may not exist in the future. 'I trust that the Committee will accept <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon's</inline> amendment, after which, if they are not prepared to insert a special schedule, I hope that they will accept another amendment which will confine the operation of the Bill to the articles enumerated in clause 5- </para>

                        <para>- Manures. The result of States legislation in that case has not been to limit trade, but to increase it. The States laws have given confidence to producers that when they purchase manures they are supplied with articles that are up to the standard. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> has said that the Bill will shake public confidence in Australian commerce. I do not think it will, because such has not been the case in regard to the article I have mentioned. As to the clause immediately before us, I do not think that the other House overlooked the matter to which reference has been made. Although it restricted clause 15 to certain articles, it has said that outside the prescribed list the Minister may interfere in respect of goods in the use of which there may be danger to life and limb. This is a great mining country. A large amount of mining tackle and machinery is used. Ought not the Minister to have a power of veto if he finds that chains that do not come up to the standard, or ropes that are rotten are being sold! to mine-owners to be used in cases where men's lives are endangered by their use? </para>

                    <para>- The position taken up by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> is very clear indeed. He wants to carry the Bill further than it now extends. But what we want to find out is, what was really the intention of the other House in passing the Bill in its present form. I think it must be perfectly clear to any one reading the Bill itself that clauses 5 and 6 were meant to apply to the particular goods that are dealt with in clauses 7 and </para>

                    <item label="11.">
                        <para>Clauses 5 and 6 simply deal with the power to inspect and examine. For what purpose? To find out whether the goods come under the operation of clauses 7 and 11. Those two clauses, as honorable senators will find from the headings, apply respectively to imports and exports. Then we go a step further, and find that clause 7 and the clauses which follow it deal with imports, whilst clause11and the clauses that follow it deal with exports. It is perfectly clear, from the way in which the Bill was framed when it was first introduced, that the intention was that clauses 5 and 6 should apply to prescribed goods; that is to say, to goods prescribed under clauses 7 and11. In clauses 7 and11 the term used is, "the regulations." What the regulations may do is mentioned. When the Bill was passing through the other House, an amendment was made in clause 15, limiting the particular class of goods that might be the subject of regulations under clauses 7 and 11. Clearly, it was intended that clauses 5 and 6 should apply to those particular goods, and not to others. It bears the appearance of a Bill that has passed through one House of Parliament, and has had a flaw left init. A mistake has been made. It contains the word "prescribed." instead of the term "prescribed by the regulation," or instead of mentioning the particular classes of goods comprised in the regulations. It is perfectly clear that the regulations were the regulations referred to' in clauses 7 and 11, and were limited to those particular classes of goods. I would ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> to look at the Bill again. In his speech he has shown that he holds the same opinion- as we do as to what was the intention of the Bill ; because, when it was pointed out to him  that there is only power to inspect and examine, he said that he thought that if an officer examined goods and found that they were not up to the mark, there should be power to prohibit them, and he has also said that if it is found that other goods than these mentioned ought to be prohibited, it would . give an opportunity to come to Parliament for fresh legislation. Surely it was never intended that we should pass the Bill to enable the Government to inspect goods in order to find out whether they needed fo ask Parliament for further powers of inspection. It appears to me that the original intention of the Bill was that the two clauses should only apply to the particular goods which came under the operation of clauses 7 and 11. We are told that we need have no fear about the regulations, because they will be laid upon the table, andean be discussed. We shall be told that no Minister would be tolerated who introduced regulations which shocked the good sense of the community. But when, we were discussing the time for bringing the Bill into operation the other  day. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles</inline> indignantly repudiated the idea that each House of the Parliament should have an opportunity to discuss the regulations before they were enforced. "No," he said. "We want the Bill to be passed at once, and the regulations to be made and brought into operation without delay." </para>

                        <para>- We must get rid of the idea that there will be a safeguard iri having the regulations subject to discussion in Parliament, because in the absence of this amendment they could be brought into operation before they could possibly be discussed. Considering the nature of the Bill, it is not right to harp so much upon the abuses which have occurred and may recur. The position taken up bv honorable senators on this side is that, although in certain cases it might have the effect of preventing abuses, still there are a great number of cases where it would hamper tha honest trader. It must be remembered that all the persons engaged in producing and trading are not rogues. Probably it will be admitted that by far the larger proportion of them are as honest as we are. We ought to consider the matter very carefully before we do anything which would be calculated to hamper the operations of the producers, because it is upon them that the welfare of the whole of the community depends. While every care should be taken to see that there are no abuses, and that if any do occur, they shall be put down, we should not put it in the power of the Minister to do anything which would greatly hamper1 production or hinder commerce. I do not think we are justified in putting in a clause of this kind if it is simply intended for the purpose which has been stated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline> Apparently' his idea- is to enable the Minister to say to an importer or exporter : " Your case is as bad as it can possibly be; but under the law! I have no power to fine you, or to prohibit your import or export. I cannot give you an opportunity of defending yourself, but I have the right to take samples, and examine your goods, and to put you in a sort of newspaper pillory." I do not know that by any Statute a Minister is enabled to publish a man's name in the press, and i hold him up to the community as a person who is not an honest trader. Certainly where such a power is being given in a measure, it ought to be most carefully safeguarded, and before a man's name is published he should have the most ample opportunity of defending himself. </para>

                    (New South Wales). - I think it must be becoming increasingly evident to honorable senators that the Bill is a great bungle, and that it is liable to bring about great trouble, and at the same time to fail in that punishment of fraud which a simpler measure,, such as the Fraudulent Trades Marks Bill, would have effected. Last session a great deal was said about frauds in connexion with jewellery. Strange to say, under this Bill as it stands such frauds would escape. I understand that
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline>
                    Symon intends to propose an amendment for the purpose of including jewellery within its scope. It is very singular that the measure should take such extraordinary powers against ordinary traders. I regret that since last session several honorable senators seem to have become less alive to the desirability of protecting trade from harassing regulations. For instance, when
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline>

                    <para>I am afraid that on investigation this amendment will be found to be impracticable. In the first place, it implies conditions with regard to foreign manufacturers which is not insisted on in regard to our own manufacturers. It seems to be competent for the Australian manufacturer to assume a trade mark or name, which is an indication that his goods are made in foreign places. The proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> would appear to be impossible in many cases. I should say that the legal definition of " goods " is very comprehensive, seeing that the word applies to all personal property as distinct from land or real property. To apply this amendment to all personal property that is brought into the Commonwealth seems to me to be passing a law which it would be impossible to enforce. </para>

It is not within the scope of this Bill to pass a drastic provision of the kind, which I feel sure is not made in any similar Act in the world. It is of no use our enacting legislation which it is impossible to carry out. </para>

                    <para>- I am sorry the Minister of Defence is not present, because I wish to remind him once more that he has not yet given me an answer to the question which I have so repeatedly asked him; or, at any rate, I have not received an answer which is satisfactory. In view of the fact that the operation of this Bill will cover the whole of the coastal trade of Australia, I wish to know whether it is proposed to have expert inspectors at every port from Townsville, in Queensland, and Hobart, in Tasmania, to Adelaide, in South Australia, and Fremantle, in Western Australia? That is an important question; in view of the cost of such a scheme of inspection, and the information I desire ought to be in the possession, not only of honorable senators, but of all merchants, traders, and producers. The Minister may imagine that, by a system of bluff, he has answered the question, but when a Minister introduces a Bill, which, for weal or woe, inaugurates, an entirely new departure in. the commercial relations of the Commonwealth with the outside world, he ought to be in a position to thoroughly explain and interpret its provisions to honorable senators. I see that the Minister of Defence is now in the Chamber, and I again ask him whether, under this Bill, it is proposed to have expert inspectors at every port in the Commonwealth at which exports and imports, are dealt with? The Minister, though he may bluff to his heart's content, will not bluff me out of an answer to which I consider myself entitled. I have no great personal interest in the matter, but, as I said before, the information I ask is highly important, not only from a business point of view, but also from the point pf -view of the public finances. The Minister this afternoon stated that goods of poor quality - which I take to mean goods which, though of inferior quality, are not in themselves harmful to the health of the community - will not be allowed into the Commonwealth. I fail to see any provision in the Bill which could keep out such goods if they are properly described. It must be remembered that certain goods, although' of inferior quality, may, under certain circumstances, be of practical use to the community at large. We have to consider all the varying conditions and circumstances of life, which create all classes of purchasers. ' Some people buy the very best of goods, while others are compelled, by their means, to purchase goods, which, I suppose, are regarded by the Minister as inferior. In any draper's or grocer's shop we find various customers, from those who purchase the very best. to wage earners, with, perhaps, 30s. a week, who have to make their income go as far as possible. We have to take things as they are, and not as we should like them to be; and I think we shall make a very great mistake if we exclude goods of inferior quality, unless it can be shown that they are harmful to health. References have been made to the Butter Commission ; but I fail to see that the deliberations or findings of that body have much to do with the provisions of the Bill now under consideration. The Commission found, not so much that the butter exported was inferior, but rather that, unfortunately for Australia, commercial men, to their disgrace be it said, permitted butter of inferior grade to be exported as of the best grade, and thus damaged the good name of this country. These men allowed their personal interests to lead them astray, and a system of corruption was the result. But the Commission in their report did not find that the lower grades of butter exported were unfit for human use, or that it was of such a quality as to be a disgrace to Australia. </para>

The situation was to a great extent brought about by the bonus offered by the Victorian Government. The money thus offered as an inducement for the encouragement of the trade found its way into the pockets of middlemen, and of others who showed themselves to be corrupt. </para>

                        <para>- I do not say that. Commercial life, and the pastoral, agricultural, and dairying industries in Australia are just as pure, practically, as they are in any part of the world I know of, except, perhaps Denmark, in relation to the butter trade. In that country the production of butter is the one industry, and there is such systematic inspection that it is almost impossible for butter of an inferior quality to be exported. The same circumstances, however, do not prevail in other countries, and it is a cruel injustice to be constantly referring to the Butter Commission. Such constant references are in themselves a reflection on the honesty of the people of Australia, when, as a. matter of fact, the people as a whole conduct their commercial business with integrity. All that the report of the Commission showed was that there are dishonest men in Melbourne, as there are in Sydney and all over Australia; but this dishonesty is the exception, and not the rule. The Bill has no application to such circumstances- </para>

                        <para>- As I said on a former occasion, when discussing the Bill, a Government brand is of no value whatever, and is not regarded by experienced buyers in the trade. If a large number of dairymen in New Zealand express a desire for the Government brand, it is for quite another reason than that suggested by honorable members opposite. A friend of mine, who is one of the largest butter buyers in Australia, and who is connected with an institution with which many of my labour friends would like to be identified, does not, when in New Zealand, purchase on the Government brand, but knows exactly where the best butter is produced, and goes direct to the dairies. In the same way, buyers in England purchase butter on the quality indicated by the dairy brand, and not on the Government brand, though it may suit them to have the Government brand placed upon it as well as the private brand. I cannot see how the Government brand can have the slightest value as an indication of the quality of the goods to which it is applied. If, for instance, the Government brand is put on butter of No. 2 and No. 3 qualities, it will not make the slightest difference to the actual consumer. The buyers of that butter in England will purchase it for what it is worth, and it will be sold to consumers in Birmingham, Liverpool, and other places, not as second and third class butter, but simply on its quality as ascertained by testing. What is the system which obtains in England in connexion with' the sale of butter, cheese, and other perishable products? Buyers representing large firms go every week to Liverpool, Manchester, and London to purchase perishable goods. A buyer in London will go into Tooley-street and sample the different butters placed on the market there, and he will buy them according to their quality. He sends what he buys to the large stores in Birmingham and Liverpool, where the butter is sold, not as Australian butter, Canadian butter, or Denmark butter, but as good butter, worth so much. A woman coming into a store to purchase butter will take some of it on her finger and taste it, and if it suits her palate she will buy it. </para>

                        <para>- No. After the <inline font-style="italic">expose</inline> this afternoon of the far-reaching effect of the Bill, the Minister should agree to postpone its consideration. If this Bill is to affect the whole of the commercial community of Australia, that knowledge must be a complete revelation to the whole of the members of the Commonwealth Parliament. The measure has been placed in an entirely new light. If, having regard to the previous interpretation of its provisions, I considered that it was one which' should be considered by a Royal Commission, in the light of this revelation with respect to the enlarged powers it confers, it is of ten times greater importance that that course should be adopted and expert evidence called. We previously imagined that the measure would apply only to the goods, referred to in clause 15. Now we are given the startling information that it will apply to every article of import and export in the trade and _ commerce of the Commonwealth, and that the Minister of Trade and Customs will have the administration of ali commercial matters in Australia. His judgments are to be absolute. From what we have heard this afternoon, it is clear that no. such power has been given to a Minister by any legislation passed elsewhere. It will be admitted that such a Bill is one of the last which should be made a matter of party, and I therefore ask the Minister in charge of it to postpone its consideration in order that he may make thorough inquiries as to what its effect will really be, and be able to interpret its provisions in such a wa,y that we shall know what we are doing in passing it. </para>

                        <para>- Perhaps I have departed from the question to some extent. When the discussion on the clause commenced, I believe that no honorable senator present really understood the extent of its application. The revelation made is of such a character that I should prefer to have further time to consider- the effect of the measure, because I now realize its immense importance, and the immense powers which are proposed to be given to the Minister of Trade and Customs. I repeat that the Minister in charge of the Bill should reconsider the position. In the first instance, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> thought it sufficient to introduce the measure with a ten-minutes' speech, on the ground that information concerning it might be obtained from the debates in another place. I venture to say that the honorable senator's contention will not hold good at the present time, because no one in the other House, or in the Senate, ever interpreted the Bill to mean what it is now contended that it does mean. In the circumstances, it is Cut right and proper that the Minister Should give us his interpretation of the Bill in the light of the latest information on the subject. I should like to know, for instance, whether it is likely that a further surprise may not be sprung upon us. It is only fair that we should be given further time to consider the Bill, arid to obtain some knowfed.ee as to what effect it will really have under the altered conditions. </para>

There is no power whatever to interfere further whether the articles concerned are good, bad, or indifferent. But when the Customs Department comes to the conclusion that a man ought to be put on the black list, he is to be so condemned under this provision. That, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> is the theory for leaving in the word "prescribed." If, however, the Bill is to be kept for the purposes for which it was intended, clearly the word " prescribed " ought to come out. </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith,</inline>
                    seems to be a little dissatisfied with my reference to his speech of last year. But I hold that the quotation was in every way fair, and that his change of front is obvious. It is quite true that the clause of which he was speaking last year is not word for word the same as the clause new under discussion. But the important fact is that when
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline>
                    said what he did last year, he referred to
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley's</inline>
                    proposal for compelling all goods to be described, whatever they were. It was in opposition to that proposal, which also is the central feature and controlling factor of this' Bill, that
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline>
                    made that speech. There is no getting away from that fact. I think that the Minister ought to give us some information as to what is involved from the monetary point of view in the scheme of this Bill. Before we have done with this clause. I propose to move for the addition of a fourth sub-clause, which will read -
                </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>No fee shall be charged to the owners or importers or exporters of goods inspected and examined under this section. </para>
                </quote>
                <para>The Minister ought to tell us what the Customs Department anticipates will be the expenditure incurred in the inspection and examination of goods under the measure. As Senior Gray has pointed out, if the clause, as drafted, were fully carried out, and a very complete examination were made in order to detect any possible cases of goods being irregularly or falsely marked, Australia might have to face the expenditure of a very considerable sum. We should be informed whether that matter has been considered. </para>

                    <para>- I should be very glad if the Minister in charge of the Bill would be good enough to favour us with a further explanation of this clause. Personally, as I have before said in the strongest possible terms, I support the general objects of this Bill, and will assist to make it perfect. But. I must frankly confess that on cursorily reading the Bill I did not gather that it was intended to apply to other than the goods enumerated in clause 15; and I fancy that the general public, looking at the measure as I did, would come to the same conclusion. If I remember rightly, the early history of this measure, it was originally framed in open and general terms. A deputation waited on the Minister of Trade and Customs and pointed out the serious difficulties that would arise in applying a radical Bill of this character to all classes of goods. It was then that the Minister said that his real object was to deal with the classes of goods mentioned in clause. 15; that is to say, articles used for food or drink by man, or used in the manufacture or preparation of articles of food or drink; medicines or medicinal preparations ; manures ; apparel, including boots and shoes, and the materials from which apparel is manufactured; and seeds and plants. That assurance of the Minister certainly went far to commend the measure to those who waited upon him. I thought that what he suggested was rather a fair compromise, and that he was really securing, instead of the direct opposition of those who waited upon him, their more or less passive assistance in the passing of so desirable a measure as I conceive this to be. I think that my honorable friends the members of the Government are making a serious mistake in not confining the Bill to goods mentioned in clause 15. There are many reasons why the goods enumerated there should be specially picked out. My honorable friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> says that it is only a power of inspection that is given. That is quite true; but he will understand that this Bill has to be read in conjunction with the Customs Act, which provides the most ample powers of inspection. </para>

I have spoken on the basis of what I have learnt from the Chairman and from the clerks at the table as to what is before the Committee, and I must confess that I was somewhat surprised when I discovered that this clause carried the Bill beyond the scope of clause 15. But I shall be glad to hear what the Minister has to say. If there is any reason for altering the view which I have expressed, I shall take it into consideration. </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator PLAYFORD</inline>
                    (South Australia Minister of Defence). - The contention in connexion with this clause is that it was framed under different conditions from those that exist in connexion with the Bill at present ; that is, that it was framed when there was no special exemption and no special inclusion of any particular classes of goods, and that it was therefore applicable to everything that might be imported or exported. It is contended that when clause 5 was inserted, which limits the application of the Bill to certain classes of goods mentioned in clause 15, it was overlooked that clause 5 went beyond clause 15, and that therefore the other House simply made a mistake. . I am informed that they acted with their eyes perfectly open. It will be noticed that clause 15 says that "sections 7 and 11 of the Act shall not apply to any goods other than those" enumerated therein. The Minister had an object in view in putting in that clause. Clauses 7 and11 allow the prohibition of imports and exports under certain conditions. Under clause 5 the Minister can prescribed any articles under certain conditions. That clause gives him a power which I contend he ought to have, and that is to inspect all prescribed goods, but it gives him no power to prohibit their importation or exportation. All the Minister can do under the clause is to direct that samples be taken of any imports or exports, but he cannot take samples of a single article unless it is prescribed. Quite apart from the articles enumerated in clause 15, there are certain articles coming into the Commonwealth which we believe are injurious to the consumers. The Minister wants power to prescribe such goods by regulation, to take samples of them and examine them. If he be satisfied by the examination that the goods are injurious, and that the importation of them should not be allowed, although he will not have the power to prohibit such importations, still 'he will have what I contend is a very right and proper power. He can say to the importer, "Here is a sample of your goods which, on analysis, we find injurious to the public. Do not import them in the future, because if you do Ave shall -expose you publicly." It is a very useful power for the Minister to possess. It will not be exercised unless it is beyond dispute that the goods in question are injurious. It will be used in an exceptional case, and then only for the benefit of the community as a whole. The word " prescribed " was designedly left in clause 5 by the other House, and I object to its elimination.

                    SYMON (South Australia). - We are all greatly indebted to the Minister of Defence for what he has said. He has given us the most novel explanation of a piece of legislation that; ,1 think, we have ever listened to. The clause gives power to inspect goods, but, as it fixes no standard of description, or quality, or purity, there is no offence that the inspection can disclose; nor does it provide a penalty which may be sought to be enforced against the importer in a Court. My honorable friend justifies the retention of this word " prescribed " on the ground that if, upon inspection, the Minister of Trade and Customs does not like the quality or purity of the goods, he is to have -the right of going to the importer and, on his ow:n word, giving him a hint that he had better not import the goods again.

If he were to say to an importer, " If you please, do not import any more," the importer would snap his fingers at him and say, " You have nb authority to stop these goods from coming in; there is no legislation to that effect." What is the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford?</inline> Did any one ever hear from a responsible Minister such a statement as this : " But we will show him up. We will put his name in the news- . papers"? I do not know whether it will give the importer a remedy or not by action for libel ; I hope it will. But whether it does or does not, I ask honorable senators if they have ever listened to such a confession of legislative 'impotence as the clause would be if it were acted upon ? I think that there will be a very considerable struggle before a provision of that sort is enacted. </para>

                    (Tasmania).- Suppose that a machine were imported for a particular purpose, and that under this provision the Minister called for an inspection of it to be made. It would be inspected by a person who might or might not be acquainted with the working of the machine and who might report to the Minister that, in his opinion, it would not carry out some operation. What is the use of an officer reporting on the article unless the Minister is able to prohibit its importation, or levy a penalty upon the importer, on the ground that it had not been properly described? Surely it must be evident to every honorable senator that by an oversight this clause was not altered in consonance with the improvement which limited its application to certain articles. It would be very much better if the Minister would frankly recognise that fact, and agree to the amendment.

The Minister let the cat out of the bag when he admitted that, under the Customs Act, Customs officers have the power to inspect all imports, but no power to take samples. If, as the Minister said, this clause was designedly left in its present form in another place, we can only conclude that, 'because a section of the Customs Act is defective, the Minister, acting on the advice of the Customs officers, has dragged in the clause to patch up a defect in that Act. </para>

                    <para>- I would urge upon <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> that Ministers are not dealing fairly with commercial men. Every time that the Minister of Trade and Customs spoke - whether to an interviewer or to a deputation, or in another place - he distinctly said he would cut down the large list of articles to which it was originally intended to apply. I think that on one occasion he pledged his word that it should not apply to fabrics: But on no occasion did he ever suggest that he would make an exception regarding imports, and give power to inspect every class of goods. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> intends to insist upon the clause as it stands, he will be breaking faith with the commercial public. If his colleague had said that while he would limit the clauses of the Bill to the articles enumerated as regards prohibition, he would have no limit as regards the right to take samples, and inspect every class of goods, I do not think that the commercial men who waited on him would have gone away satisfied, or that the Bill would have been passed so easily through another place. A charge of breach of faith will be brought against <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> if he insists upon the retention of this clause, which ought to find a place in a Customs Act Amendment Bill. </para>

            <para>The mischief that may be done by this Bill in relation to exports is much greater than that which may be inflicted in the case of imports. As the clause stands at present, with the word " prescribed," it simply gives the Minister a roving commission, without restriction, to inspect every article exported from the country. That is a senseless and futile roving commission, as established by what the Minister of Defence himself said a few minutes ago. The honorable senator told us that, with the power of inspection, there is no power to prohibit or impose a penalty - that there is no standard of quality, of purity, or of any sort, which under clause 5 can be prescribed by regulation. The Minister admits that the power to inspect and take samples is,' in one sense, merely a power to gratify curiosity, without any penalty to enforce, or, if there were a penalty, without any means to enforce it. A sewing machine, a steam-engine, and a harvester have been given as illustrations of imports, and in each case, if the Minister, for any reason, be dissatisfied, his only remedy is to tell the merchant that he must not import that particular kind of commodity again. That is a confession of absolute weakness and impotence on the part of the Minister. As I have already said, the clause may work infinitely more mischief in regard to exports. Oil, wool, or any other commodity may be inspected and samples taken, and if the Minister is not satisfied with the quality, there is no power to stop the export then or at any time. All the Minister can do is to go to the exporter and say that such goods must not be exported again. The Minister of Defence feels the weakness of the position, which, indeed, is really ludicrous ; and, in order to show that some kind of sanction or pressure may be exercised, he declares that if an exporter does export such goods again the Government "will show him up." That is the kind of legislation that is proposed ! There is no provision in the Bill enabling the Minister to "show up" the exporter. </para>

The honorable gentleman will be covered with confusion and ridicule when he hears that same statement made over and over again in his own State. He declares here that there is to be a power of inspection for curiosity, but no power to enforce any penalty. Anything more puerile as a reason for exercising the power of inspection was never listened to. My amendment has failed so far as imports are concerned, but I ask the Minister whether he really wants to retain the power as to exports, or whether he will not adopt the wiser course and accept my amendment. </para>

                    <para>.- Did the honorable senator not say that the exposure might be such as to ruin a man in his business? However that may be, is there any necessity to go further and examine goods for export, when we know we cannot stop exportation, or punish the man for exporting undesirable goods? Under the Bill we can inspect and examine the goods, and that is all. The Minister is powerless, and the exporter may snap his fingers at him, and ask, "What are you going to do now?" The Minister may say that the goods are of such an abominable character that they should not be allowed to be exported, but, at the same time, their exportation cannot be prohibited. There is not one single power in the hands of the Minister except the power to harass, annoy, and injure the commerce of the Commonwealth. Does the Minister propose to submit a new clause providing that a penalty may be inflicted? If so, that might be an' argument for his present position, because then he could ask for the power to inspect in order to ascertain whether an offence had been committed. </para>

Are we to fill up the statute-book with legislation that can have no beneficial effect, but which from its sheer stupidity may do injury to the Commonwealth? I cannot understand why the Minister should persist in retaining a provision when its ridiculousness has been exposed, and when, by passing it, Parliament will only have to admit in the most abject manner that it has consented to place a measure on the statute-book that is not worth the paper on which it is printed, and that will tend only to confuse, annoy, and injure the community. Is that a proper position for Parliament to take up ? I presume that every Parliament makes mistakes, but there is usually some substantial ground for the action of Parliament. </para>

                    <para>.- The public will do the snapping of the fingers, which will show the contempt in which a great deal of our legislation is held. I think that if the public could but realize how we are sometimes guided in the passing of legislation they would decide that it would not be difficult to find men who could do better work. If the Minister can give a reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> I ask him to do so. If he can only say that he knows nothing about it, that he does not know whether it is right or wrong, but that as it is in the Bill he will adhere to it, let the honorable senator make that reply. </para>

                became Minister of Trade and Customs, he inaugurated a very severe policy. I commended the right honorable gentleman for it, and always stood by his action in my own State. He refused to become an arbitrator, and sent disputes under the Customs Act to a magistrate for trial.

When a certain article is being exported, although it may not be specifically included in clause 15 of this Bill, the Minister under this clause retains the power to authorize an inspection of it. For what purpose ? That he may acquire certain knowledge about it. For what purpose does he require the knowledge? The Minister will require special knowledge in order to be able to say to the exporter - "This article is adulterated; you must not export it again. I cannot stop you, but I give you that warning." </para>

I have upheld provisions giving such powers to Ministers. Every one who knows anything of the work of the Customs Department must do so. At, the same time, these powers should be given only where they are absolutely necessary, and in my opinion they are not necessary in this case. We are asked here to give the Minister power, by the publication of his own opinion or that of an inspector with respect to certain goods, to practically prohibit their exportation, if for any reason, political or otherwise, he desires to do so. I cannot deal with imports, because the common-sense amendment proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> has been defeated by a very small majority, but I can say that it would be very much wiser if the Minister would admit, what must be evident to every one, that clause 5 was inserted in the belief that its application would be limited to the articles dealt with in clause 15. </para>

The Government will have no power to prevent the exportation of bad or adulterated goods. When they reach the other side of the world, and go into consumption, it will be found that they are defective or bad, and when complaint is made on that score, 'the Government will have to say, " We knew all about that, because we inspected and examined the goods before they were exported. We can supply you with an analysis of them which will show that we knew exactly how bad they were. We knew all their faults, and yet we permitted them to be exported."

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy,</inline>
                    whose difficulty is that the underlying .principle of the clause is the power of punishment placed in the hands of the Minister.

In the case referred to, the leather was specially manufactured for saddlery purposes. Such leather might not be used for boots and shoes at all. The particular shipment' was made in view of the South African war, and the War Office practically laid an embargo upon all Victorian leather on account of it. That was all due to' one man, whose adulteration practically had the effect of ruining Australian leather on the English market. The provision giving power to take samples of such articles is the best penal power that we could wish for. </para>

                        <para>- Quite right ; I am with the honorable senator as to that. But if we had an Act which said that the addition of a certain proportion of barium was an adulteration, every exporter would know where he stood. The danger of this provision is that, although the Minister is the responsible head of the Department who will set the machine at work, the prosecutions will be instituted practically by subordinates. The lower the subordinate who ferrets out some apparent adulteration, the greater the risk' of intimidation. I know something about exporting. I have looked into the matter, and I know the extent to which an importer would find himself at the mercy of a verv poorly-paid subordinate at the Customs House. You cannot guarantee that all these men will be absolutely reliable. I do not wish to attack the general body of Customs House officers in 'the slightest degree, but in every class of the community there are always to be found one or two black sheep. Those black sheep in this case would be undoubtedly in a position to make themselves extremely rich at the expense of the exporter. They would be able to say to a man. " This is a suspicious-looking parcel of goods which' you are exporting; I think the Minister's attention ought to be called to them." What would happen? The exporter would not want to be troubled. There would be no standard. He would not know how he would be placed if an investigation were made. </para>

                        <para>- It may exist, but not to the extent that it would under this provision. All the exporter would have to do would, be to say, " I think this small lot ought to be allowed to go," and he would possibly pay a little <inline font-style="italic">douceur</inline> to have the matter let alone.

                    <para>- I have not yet spoken on this Bill, but as I take it that the vote on the amendment will be a test vote - at all events, it will be as far as I am concerned - I should like to bring forward a single argument which I do not think has been yet adduced. It is this : <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> said a little while ago that the intervener was an enemy of commerce. I am not prepared to go so far as that, but I do say that we should not legislate in order to force the producer to play into the hands of the intervener unless it is absolutely necessary to do so. But that is what is done by this Bill in some respects; I am talking about a thing as to which I have some practical knowledge. I do not pretend to be a great authority on commerce, but I do happen to know something about the export of apples. The Bill provides that the exporter shall give notice to the Customs House that he intends to export some fruit, and state where it can be inspected. See how burdensome that will be upon the small exporter who picks his own apples, packs them in his own orchard, brings them down to Adelaide in his own cart, and places them on board the ship. What is he to do ? How is he to give notice as to where the fruit is to be inspected? He cannot do it. It is only the large men why buy from the sellers - the interveners - who can do it. They have their three or four hundred - perhaps a thousand - cases of apples in the store. They can give notice to the Customs House officer to come and inspect them. A poor man cannot do that. This is not imagination on my part, because I know that in consequence of the inspection required upon the New South Wales border as to apples going into Broken Hill, the whole of that trade has got into the hands of agents - or, as they have been called, interveners. A poor man cannot afford to put his apples in a store. He only receives, perhaps,1s. 6d. or 2s. a case for them. If you taken 6d. off that he cannot afford to do it. He would do much better by sending his fruit to an intervener who could give notice to the authorities, and have it inspected. The consequence has been, as I say, that the whole of the fruit trade between South Australia and Broken Hill has fallen into the hands of the middleman. That trade would have been retained in the hands of perhaps a thousand small men who could pick and pack their own fruit, and send it by rail, but for the necessity of having it inspected. I have tried myself, and found that I could not afford to send my apples to a store and get them inspected. The Customs House officers said, " If we have to come to your place, and inspect your fruit, we shall have to charge you so much." It would not pay to bear that expense. I appeal to the Labour Party who, I am sure, intend to help the small producers as much as they can to help them by amending this clause. </para>

I think that the arguments offered for its consideration were worthy of that notice which the leader of the Government is generally expected to give to amendments moved from this side of the Chamber. I wish to offer another reason why I think the Committee, apart from myself, is entitled to know his views on the proposal. We have dealt with the question of imports, and are now dealing with that very much larger and more important matter of exports which comes more home to us. With regard to imports, we cannot disguise the feeling that naturally animates us to keep out everything which is deleterious or supposed to be deleterious, or which is improperly described, or described in such a way as to lend itself to deceit, or to mislead the consumers. But in regard to exports, we are in a totally different position. Does my honorable friend really think that this provision would help our export trade? Does he think that its extension beyond the scope of what is prescribed by clause 15 is calculated to assist the producers and manufacturers? It is with them we are now concerned, and not with people over-seas. Every difficulty we throw in the way of our pro- . ducers is a very serious handicap. The vital interests of the country are bound up not merely in its productions, but in the export of them. Unless every possible hindrance Is removed, we are interposing inconveniences between the producers and the people upon whom they rely for their reward. We have had an illustration as to what is becoming a very large article of production and distribution. But there are many others that we can conceive of. If my honorable friend thinks that clause 15, with the catalogue of articles which he says are to be prohibited from export if they do not answer a particular standard or trade description, is not large enough, then let him add to it. Surely that is the straight and plain course which, as men of business, much less as legislators, we should adopt. Let the producers know what it is that the Minister can expect or demand from them. There is no standard fixed in the Bill. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> may say that it is quite right that the Minister should have this unascertained, indeterminate power of prescribing a standard for the quality of a man's wheat, or fruit, or wool. It is being left to the Minister to say whether or not harvesters shall be sent out of the Commonwealth. The Bill does not give the Minister legal power to prohibit the exportation of a harvester, to recover a penalty for exporting a machine or a product, or to forfeit an article if attempted to be exported. It is simply left to the Minister by indirect underhand means- </para>

                        <para>- I appeal to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best,</inline> who is familiar with Customs legislation, to say whether, under sub-clause 1 of clause 5, the Minister will have power to frame a regulation for establishing a standard of quality or purity or efficiency or for publishing a black list in the newspapers. Only the power of inspecting the prescribed goods is given by clause 5, and the prescribing of the goods is to be done by regulations, which are dealt with in clause 17. The power to inspect goods is not to be given by regulation, but by the Bill itself. It is only the subject-matter of the inspection which is to be prescribed by regulation. Our point is that the Minister will have power to inspect and to take samples of even' article which is produced for exportation, and to harass trade in a most terrible way. We cannot say whether that will be done or not, but we have no right to vest such a power in the hands of any man. Look at the difficulties which it must throw in the way of producers. It would be impossible for them to give the notice under clause 6. It refers not merely to goods entered for export, but also to goods brought for export to any wharf or place. The small producer would feel the pinch of all these difficulties more than would the large exporter. </para>

The Minister is quite right in saying that we cannot stop at inspection, but must go a step further in order to make the provision useful. And how is it proposed to make the provision useful? Not by_ providing a penalty, but by leaving it to the Minister to " make it hot " for the exporter in some undefined way. </para>

                        <para>- I am afraid the honorable senator is not looking at the clause; the exports he refers to are covered by clause 15. The clauses, from clause 7 to clause 15, are all right, so far as concern their principle. Clause 5, however, has no object, except to permit inspection ; and the retention of the clause is justified, wrongly, I think, by the Minister of Defence, on the ground that it will enable the Minister, in the absence of any standard of quality, to set up a standard of his own. But if the goods do not come up to the Minister's standard, all he can do is to tell the exporter not tol export similar goods again on penalty of being shown up by the publication of his name, or something of that sort. Ministers are here to-day and gone to-morrow, and we may have Ministers who fix varying standards. Is that the kind of legislation we ought to place on the statute-book? All I rose to do was to point out the distinction between imports and exports, and to ask the Minister whether it is in the interest of producers that difficulties should be thrown in the way of the export business - whether exporters ought to be harassed, or be liable to be harassed, as they may be at the instance of some Minister who can prescribe by regulation any kind of standard he chooses. An exporter may desire to export goods which reach the standard fixed by a former Minister, and find that they do not meet the ideas of the Minister for the time being, or with the approval of some inspector; and if he be not strong-minded enough to snap his fingers at the authorities, he may be so hampered and harassed as to rather lose the season than proceed with the business. I ask the Minister whether he does not see a great deal of force in the objections I have raised - whether he does not think it would be well to leave the clause as merely applicable to imports. </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator PLAYFORD</inline>
                    (South Australia - Minister of Defence). - After the very pathetic appeal which
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline>
                    has addressed to me over and over again 10 give answers to certain questions, I am constrained to say something, but that* something will be very brief. Ira the first place, the clause has been passed, so far as it relates to imports ; and it seems to me that the same reasons which apply to imports apply to exports. If the clause is good in one case, it is good in the other - " What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander" - and, therefore, I shall oppose the amendment.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline>
                    asks whether the clause will assist the exporter and producer; and I say that the answer to the question all depends on what kind of exporter and producer he refers to. The clause, undoubtedly, will not assist the rogue exporter, who desires to export poor, miserable, inferior produce, while labelling it good; but it will help the honest exporter of genuine produce in the markets of the world. The clause will keep up our good name in other countries, in so far as it assists in insuring that the produce exported is of a superior quality. It is admitted that the exportation of goods of an inferior quality tends to destroy trade, and that the honest exporter is injured by the action of the dishonest exporter, who tries to make a few extra shillings by questionable practices. Under the_ circumstances, the honest exporter will gain, and the dishonest exporter will possibly lose, by the operation of this legislation. As to what the producer may expect, no goods will be dealt with under this clause unless they be prescribed. The fact that goods not enumerated in clause 15 may be prescribed, will serve as an intimation to exporters of inferior produce that the eyes of the Customs authorities are on them, and that action will be taken. Any regulation made will be submitted to Parliament; and I have no doubt that the Ministry of the day will be able to give very good reasons for prescribing any products not coming within clause 15. The power will, I am sure, be exercised only in serious cases, and will in its effect be beneficial to the honest exporter, and to the trade of Australia as a whole.

My opinion is that the operation of the clause should be confined to the goods mentioned in clause 15, and, with that object in view, it is my intention to support an amendment in that clause, so as to make it applicable to clause 5. As to the amendment immediately before us, I cannot see mv way to support it. It is desirable that there should be at least some control or inspection in regard to certain lines of export. The Minister of Defence seems to have gone astray in insisting on arguing with the assistance of clause 15-

If he chooses to so prescribe any of the goods there mentioned, he will have a complete, or, rather, an effective control ; but outside that clause he is impotent, and unable to do anything of a satisfactory character. Our desire, is to maintain the highest possible reputation for our goods. We are aware that in a large number of instances Australian trade has suffered in reputation by reason of the export of imitations or deleterious goods.

In his last remarks the Minister spoke of inferior goods, and repeatedly indicated that he desires to prevent their exportation. Surely the honorable senator knows that at times there must be a certain proportion of inferior goods exported. If the Minister proposed, for instance, that there should be a certain standard for wool, there is power under the Bill to order grading, and to prescribe what sort of wool shall be exported.

                        <para>- Wool is used for making clothing, and the inclusion of apparel in clause 15 brings wool within the operation of the Bill. With poor seasons we have wool of inferior quality, and if the standard of the wool in good seasons be fixed, there will be great risk of the export trade being interfered with. There is no question of fraud in this matter. If the standard of good seasons be the one fixed upon by the Minister, what on earth are we to do with the wool of poor seasons? Once, again, the Minister does not seem to know his own Bill, and is rather surprised at_ my statement in regard to wool coming within its operation. I have already pointed out that this position arises from the inclusion of apparel within the operation of clause 15, under which, of course, the Minister will be able to make all sorts of regulations when dealing with wool. There are many other kinds of goods, the quality of which is affected by the seasons. I object, as the Committee should, on behalf of our smaller producers, to any legislation which might impair their ability to sell their produce during unfavorable seasons. </para>

                    <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> mayhold that opinion, but my view of the matter is that while the Bill is a good one so far as it goes, it does not go far enough. I believe' that it is just as necessary, so far as we can, to protect our own people from having goods foisted on them by means of false descriptions where those goods come into one State from another, as it is to protect them from such goods imported from abroad. I believe it is just as necessary to prevent the good name of the trade of a particular State being injured by exports to the other States under false trade descriptions as it is to protect Australian exports generally from injury in markets abroad by exports to those markets under false trade descriptions. Every argument which can be used in favour of the application of this Bill to oversea trade can be used with equal force and effect as applied to Inter-State trade. As a Commonwealth Parliament we have nothing to do with the internal trade of the different States, but we have as complete control over Inter-State trade as we have over trade with other countries. </para>

I think we all agree that; we cannot do better than have inspection where there is any reason to suspect fraud. But I contend that if there is no reason whatever to suspect fraud there is no reason to inspect for export. In the case of goods imported there is undoubtedly reason for inspection, but we are dealing with goods to be consumed by foreigners. Are we. going to hamper the small producers so seriously as this clause will do when there may be no reason to suspect that there is anything wrong with a shipment ? The officer should have "good reason to believe," in the words of the Immigration Restriction Act, before he takes action. </para>

No doubt an officer might have good reason for suspecting, bue we should say in the Bill that he must have " good reason to believe " before he takes any Steps. I draw attention to the very few articles of export in which a large trade is done in Australia. With regard to most of them, inspection would be very easy, but as to the fruit trade, in which my State is so much wrapped up, and which is so important to her, the small producer would be affected to a serious degree. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker</inline> has pointed out, we shaM simply force small producers into the hands of interveners. Fruit may be produced forty or fifty miles from the port of shipment, and this measure may compel a shipper to come down to the port and see that his goods are properly marked and described according to the regulations, unless he is to pay an agent for doing it. Honorable senators can realize how injuriously this wiM affect the poor man in a small way, who has to look after his own business in his own district. Adulteration in the case of goods like leather could easily be detected. I understand that the presence of barium in leather can be discovered at once. If hides are not in good order the defects can be discovered immediately. But it is impossible to discover that there is anything wrong with a case of apples without a close inspection. The Government brand, to my own knowledge, will not increase the price to the producer. Indeed, it will probably decrease it. There is a tendency <inline font-style="italic">on</inline> the part of English buyers to purchase direct from the producer in this country. If the buyer is forced to put a mark upon the fruit which he purchases when he does not wish to do so- if. for instance, he has to brand apples "small," "second-class," or "inferior " - he may say, " I cannot any longer afford to give such a high price." No purpose can be served by forcing a mark to be put on goods. The Minister may reply that the Government will not force shippers to mark all goods. But at any moment the 'regulations may be set in operation. The effect can only be to hamper the producer, without in any way benefiting the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane</inline> has shown no reason in favour of the amendment which he has moved. He has referred to marks upon cases of apples. I cannot see how fruit would be affected. The clause simply provides that .the officer may inspect such goods as are prescribed. The amendment says that the officer shall' not inspect! them unless he has good reason to believe that they are fraudulently marked or described. It would be very easy for the officer. to say that he had "reason to believe." But the objection to the amendment is that it would not permit the officer to inspect unless he said, " I have good reason to believe that these goods are fraudulently described." Take apples, which is the favorite illustration of many honorable senators. I know something about the apple export trade. Suppose a man ships 100 cases of apples, marked " Prime rib stone pippins, Tasmania." The Custom House officer will take a case at random, knock off the lid, and have a look at them. If he finds that they are prime rib stone pippins, down will go the lid again, and there will be no further trouble. But whether the officer has a suspicion of fraud or not, he ought to have the power to examine. We do not wish our apples to be sent to England under a false description. A Customs officer may say : " I have no reason to believe that these apples are falsely marked, but still that may be the case." Surely in such circumstances he ought to have the right to knock the lid off a case and test the quality of the apples. If he finds that the apples, instead of being prime rip stones, are second-class or small, he ought to have tHe right to take such other action as may be provided. I contend that, whether he has a suspicion of fraud or not, it is necessary that he should have the power to inspect a shipment. A large quantity of Australian apples are now shipped to the mother country and to Europe, especially to Hamburg. We wish to give the mother country and foreign nations a guarantee that the marks on Australian goods faithfully describe their character. To provide that the officer shall not inspect unless he believes that goods are fraudulently marked or described would be to defeat one of the chief purposes of the Bill, and that is to secure inspection before exportation. Undoubtedly the inspection will be carried on in a most careful manner. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jones</inline> wrote on the subject of apples and jams the Comptroller- General of .Customs laid down, in his reply, the lines on which the inspection would take place. When I quoted the reply here, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> said : " If that is the case, I shall not oppose the Bill ;" but he is. opposing it as strongly as he can. Evidently he has quite forgotten the promise he made. Under these circumstances I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane</inline> to withdraw the amendment. It ought to be remembered that if the officers want to inspect a shipment they will say that there is a chance of fraud being committed, and that, therefore, they ought to make an inspection. </para>

                        <para>- A few minutes ago the honorable senator s-aid that no Customs officer would inspect a case of apples unless he had reason to suspect that something was wrong. Therefore the amendment would carry out the thought which passed through his mind, that is, if his words correspond with his thoughts. The illustration he gave was not relevant. In Tasmania a shipment of 100 cases of prize rip stone pippins is not branded as to grade. Whoever heard of growers bothering to brand their cases when the buyers at the other end of the world simply buy according to inspection ? Would my honorable friend take a case of apples simply because it was branded with the words "extra prime," when he could raise the lid and look' at them for himself? Would he not think that he knew more about the quality of the apples than all the inspectors rolled into one? From Hobart we may send away by one steamer 45,000 cases merely branded with the name of the apple, and not bearing the words "prime," or "extra prime," or "second class." If that addition has to be made it will do irreparable mischief to our apple trade. I should! have thought that the amendment would have found acceptance with the majority of honorable senators. I find that two clauses of the Foods Adulteration Bill of Victoria contain the words, " If the officer has reasonable cause to suspect." <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane</inline> wishes to provide that if inferior articles are being exported they may be inspected. Suppose that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> had been shipping apples for some years, and that his brand! was well known and appreciated in the old country. Would he like an inspector to treat him as if he were one of those fraudulent! exporters of whom we have heard1? If, however, he had sent away a bad shipment', and that act had been traced home tei him by means of his brand, the inspector would have a right to say to him, " You have been sending away inferior fruit. I suspect that you intend to do so again, and therefore I will have a dozen cases opened." <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane</inline> wishes to provide for a case of that kind. It is impossible to inspect apples in Tasmania when 50,000 cases are sent away by one ship in the course of forty-eight hours. </para>

                    <para>- The Minister's statements are getting quite comic. It is really amusing to hear him! say that in the case of a shipment of 100 cases of apples from Hobart the inspector could have one case opened on the wharf, and decide in an instant whether or not it contained "prime rip stone pippins." How could an officer - perhaps a man who until he was sent to Hobart only knew apples by name - decide at once a question of that kind? It must be remembered that apples are of all sizes and quality, and that it would need an expert to decide whether a shipment of 100 cases could be considered to be of prime quality by merely taking the lid off one case, and looking at its contents. I observe that the power given in this clause is permissive, but there was nothing permissive about the Minister's observations. He seemed to suggest that the safety of Australia almost depended upon one case being opened, and its contents examined. He led the Committee to believe that it was absolutely essential for the proper conduct of the apple trade to have only prime fruit sent away. Although the clause only gives a permissive power to the officer to inspect, still the Minister made it very clear to us that it was intended to have a system of grading by officers who might or might not know what they were doing. I shall support the amendment. </para>

                    (Tasmania).Hitherto I have not spoken on the Bill, and have voted with the Government, because the amendments did not seem to me to be necessary. Certainly this amendment appeals to me with greater force than the others did. It is feared bv
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane</inline>
                    that the shipment of perishable produce is likely to be greatly delayed if it is to be subject to inspection under regulations. Inspection is necessary in order to maintain the good1 name of our produce in parts beyond the seas, and in some cases hardship may be inflicted. I take it "that none of us wishes to inflict hardship upon any producer unless it is necessary. It is only in the case of perishable produce, however, that a delay caused by inspection could be injurious. We all know that the leather trade of Australia was very much injured through the fraud practised in this State by one individual using barium. In the case of such a product not very much injury would be done by a little delay for the purpose of making an inspection. But' in the case of perishable produce very great' injury might be done to the producer by delaying its shipment. I think that the object which the Minister has in view could be effected if
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane</inline>
                    would agree- to insert after the word " export," in his amendment, the words " and where such goods are of a perishable nature." If my suggestion be adopted, no officer, unless he had reason to believe that such goods were fraudulently marked and described, would interfere. The inspection is not to be mandatory, unless we declare that "may" means "shall." I understood trie Minister to say that according to the clause it is not absolutely necessary that goods shall be inspected, and that the inspector would not cause any injurious delay without good reason - unless he felt reasonably sure that some? fraud was intended. If that be so, I cannot see that any harm will follow the amendment of
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane,</inline>
                    if the words I have suggested be inserted. It appears to me that only in the case of perishable products would injury occur through delay. If

                    will amend his amendment in the way I have indicated I shall be able to support it.

                        <para>- I take the broad view that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane's</inline> amendment is a desirable- one to apply to any goods, though I am impressed with what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe</inline> has said as to the inconvenience and, perhaps, loss which may arise in the case of perishable goods. It is admitted by the Minister that no officer will subject goods to an inspection unless for good reason ; and I cannot conceive it possible to predicate of an officer, however zealous he might be, that he would interfere with goods for export unless he had some fair suspicion of fraud. If that be the position, why not act on the suggestion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe?</inline> The amendment, as amended, would merely operate on the official conscience, so to speak, and be a warning, or intimation, to every inspector that he must not officially or wantonly interfere with goods for export. When packages are opened for inspection, it is a frequent result that their contents are extracted, and the re fastening is not always as carefully done as it might be. Another suggestion I make is that this clause should also extend, in the words of clause 15, to "articles used for food or drink by man." For instance, there is nothing more liable to rapid injury than wine. If casks of wine are ready for export, and samples are drawn off by the spigot-hole, the result, in a hot sun, is ullage, and, in a short time, the whole of1 the wine is spoiled. </para>

As the bags come down to the vessel by gravitation, a boy takes a sample from each, and drops the sample into a bucket; and there should be no great difficulty in taking samples of other goods. The clause does not make it imperative that the inspector shall sample every box or case, but only the bulk of the shipment, and I see no trouble in the matter. </para>

                        <para>- Why should we not make a similar provision under the Customs Act? When a cargo arrives the Customs officer singles out cases here and there, with the examination of which he is satisfied, and nobody complains of the practice. I can only suppose that the opposition to this clause means a fear that something may happen which does not now happen in the ordinary course in shipping goods. </para>

That is the position in which the amendment would place the officer, and we must recognise that it would be a most invidious position. </para>

The Government have said that they will not provide for the inspection of all goods, and that the officer must be allowed to exercise discretion, and yet, when from this side it is proposed that he should exercise that discretion in certain circumstances,, we are at once met with the reply that that would place him in an invidious position, and that he would not dare to do his duty.

They may arrive at the wharf in lots of 50 to 200 cases at a time, and may have to be shipped in from twenty-four to thirty-six hours. How, in such circumstances, is it possible to have anything like an adequate inspection of those exports? The Minister has said that one case in a hundred would be inspected, but what protection would such an inspection give?

                    <para>- One would think that some honorable senators were under the impression that this Bill will apply only to apples. I desire to recall a little matter which was exposed by the Butter Commission, and it will be remembered that butter can be dealt with under the proposed amendment. Some inferior butter was brought from New South Wales to Melbourne. It was taken out of the cases in which it arrived in Melbourne and put into cases bearing the Victorian Government stamp. In the event of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane's</inline> amendment being, carried, with the amendment suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe,</inline> in what position would the Customs officer be placed in such a case as that? If he said, " I wish to inspect that butter," the shipper would say, " Do you think that the Victorian Government stamp is a fraudulent mark? Do you think we have any fraudulent intent in shipping this butter?" If the inspector said " No," he would have no right under the amendment to inspect the shipment, and if he said " Yes," he would be making a deliberate charge of fraud against the firm shipping the butter. Is that a proper position in which to place a Customs officer ? The effect of such a provision would be that no officer of Customs would dare to make any inspection at all. I am further informed, on very good authority, that in such circumstances it is possible that an officer making a charge of that kind would render himself liable to a civil action for damages. </para>

                    (New South Wales).The illustration given by
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline>
                    might seem to disclose fraud, but when it is practically considered there is really very little in it. We are asking the Customs House officer or the expert - because the officer will not necessarily have the knowledge to enable him to say what the quality of the goods is - to examine goods for export, and to take all the responsibility attaching to that work. If the goods arrive at their destination, and are proved to be inferior, the officer may possibly be blamed for allowing them to be exported. Does not that responsibility place upon the officer a far more serious obligation, than that of simply exercising prudence and tact. Personally, I am rather sorry that
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane</inline>
                    has consented to accept the amendment moved by
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe,</inline>
                    but even that is better than no amendment at all. Let me illustrate what is likely to occur. Suppose a vessel is about to leave Australia, and that she has a certain amount of' space unoccupied, in consequence of a quantity of cargo not being forthcoming at the last moment. Suppose that she wants twenty-five or fifty tons of goods to fill up her space. The practice is to run round and get goods that are ready for export, which are hurriedly put on the ship, allowing her to leave immediately after. But if that cargo had to be delayed for inspection the vessel would have to leave with her spare space unoccupied. The effect of that would be not only to injure the ship-owners, but also those who have to pay freight. Further than that, is this inspection to be of a character that will guarantee that the goods arrive at their destination in first-class condition ? The interpretation placed upon it by the Minister of Defence is simply absurd. He says that a Customs officer can open up one case or cask out of a hundred. Does he call that inspection? Will that guarantee that the shipment will be landed at its destination in first-class condition ? Some years ago I was the largest buyer of a certain class of goods in Australia. I bought to the extent of over £250,000. But we never bought any goods without sampling every cask. That was the only guarantee we had of the value of what we bought. Simply to take one box out of 100 or 500 is a ridiculous way of testing a shipment. It has to be remembered that we are not only legislating for places like Melbourne and Sydney, but also for smaller places like Launceston and Hobart. A temptation is to be placed in the way of officers, which I venture to say is likely to lead to a system of corruption. If the inspection is to be done at all it should be done thoroughly. Otherwise, instead of it being an advantage to Australia, it will be a disadvantage.

            <para>I think it is very undesirable that we should have two sections dealing with sampling, and varying in their method, as do the section I have quoted and the clause before us. The Act and this Bill are supposed to be read together. The provision in the Customs Act deals with goods under the control of the Customs, that is with imports, and any goods for export which may be the subject of duty or drawback. It will be noticed how differently sub-clause 2 of this clause which deals with only samples is worded. I do not propose to move an amendment, but to content myself with drawing attention to a sample of very undesirable drafting and very unfortunate legislation. </para>

                <para class="block">I feel sure that every honorable senator will recognise that after a cargo has been quickly loaded an officer should not, without very grave reason, order bulk to be broken in order to inspect any goods. Take butter, which is shipped in lots of 1,000 or 2,000 cases : In the first' place it is sent to the stores whence it can only be taken to the ship after sunset. The whole shipment has to be placed on board in the course of three or four hours. We are asked to intrust to an officer the great responsibility of directing bulk to be broken in order that he may inspect some boxes of butter. If this option be left in the hands of any Customs officer, it may result in grave consequences to the producers. Moreover, if the ship be detained until an inspection can take place, it will mean a large loss to her owners. Suppose that a quantity of wool has been shipped rapidly, and an officer assumes that a bale was not properly classed. It may seem ridiculous to some honorable senators to suppose that a Customs officer might require the wool to be landed in order to examine that bale. But such extraordinary proceedings by Ministers and officers have taken place that it is not wise or prudent to place this great responsibility on any person. It is to be exercised, not only by the officers at Sydney, Melbourne, and Adelaide, but also by the officers right round the coast, although they may not possess that practical knowledge which is derived from serving in a large port. It is inconsistent with ordinary commercial rules to place this great responsibility in the hands of officers, because we do not know whether the inspectors at the different ports will be experts or not. Of late, we have had examples of what a Minister may do in certain circumstances. What can we expect from persons who have no knowledge of business matters ? Let honorable senators consider the trouble that may be caused if this power be granted? Throughout the States we have had cases of men in inferior positions being amenable to improper influences in cases where they were not subjected to anything like the temptations to which Customs officers might be subjected under this Bill. In Victoria and New South Wales we have heard of policemen who have persistently received bribes to wink at infractions of the law. It is not improbable that other men might yield to greater temptations. My maxim is to place as little temptation as possible in the way of any man unless it is absolutely necessary. There is no advantage to be gained from making it possible for an officer to order bulk to be taken out of a ship for the purpose of making an examination. The examination should be made when the goods are taken to the ship, except in the case of butter, which should be inspected before it leaves the stores. If it were provided that the owner of the stores should see that the boxes of butter were properly branded before they left the ship, there would be no necessity for a clause of this kind. If the Minister could show any reason for its enactment, I should be satisfied, because I am not against anything which I believe would 'be to the advantage of the Commonwealth. The Bill contains some good provisions, but it also contains provisions which, to my mind, could be improved very much. </para>

                        <para>- Surely it is the duty of the Minister to tell the Committee why the word is in the subclause, if it has any meaning; and if it has no meaning, to take it out. Why are we to follow the exports on board the ship? It will cause intense inconvenience and trouble to the exporters. The proper place to make the inspection is on the wharf. What is the object of waiting until the exports are all on board the ship? Surely there ought to be a regulation made, in the interest of the exporters, that the goods should be examined before they were shipped. </para>

I point out, however, that this. clause deals not only with exports, but also with imports ; and in every port in Australia shippers have taken advantage of old disused ships, and made them storehouses.

                        <para>- These are practically bonded goods : if they were free goods the Customs officers would not concern themselves about them. There is no necessity for the retention of the word " ship." which will only give rise to the possibility of a good deal of trouble. If this power is not sought in connexion with imported goods, why should it be sought specially in connexion with exported goods ? A vessel might be ready for sea, and some message, it might be a hoax, as to the misdescription of goods of trumpery value, might lead to the unloading of the cargo, only to discover a " mare's nest." Surely when goods are shipped, they are shipped. There is no necessity for the retention of the word " ship," which I hope will be' excised. </para>

                    (South Australia Minister of Defence). - Two or three words will show the necessity to retain the word "ship" in this portion of the clause, which deals with exports. On the coast of South Australia there are several small places where coasting vessels pick up their cargo, but where there are no Customs House officers. For instance, a man may ship at Fowler's Bay, which is such a place as I have indicated, and he has to give notice that he intends to take his cargo alongside a certain ocean steamer, and there discharge. The Customs House officer having the notice, must go on board that ship and inspect; and it will be seen at once that the work could not be done at any " wharf or place." To insist on that would unnecessarily harass people; and, therefore, so far, at any rate, as the trade of South Australia is concerned, a provision of the kind is absolutely imperative. I dare say the same conditions prevail to a greater or lesser degree elsewhere.

                        <para>- It will be impossible to make such a regulation if we state in the measure itself that no fees shall be. charged. Some time ago I pressed upon the Minister a question as to the expenditure likely to be involved in the administration of this measure, the arrangements for officers, and so on. The honorable senator made no reply. I presume it was because he did not know anything about it, and had no reply to make, as the matter had not been thought out. I can quite believe that considerable charges might be made in respect of the inspection of goods of little value in themselves. We should set our faces against anything of that sort, which would tend to lessen the profitableness of our export trade. </para>

It does not appear so from the Bill, but it is just as well that the matter should be made clear. If the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> carries out the intention of the Government, it can very well be accepted, and we shall then know that inspections will not be made at the expense of the owners of the goods. There might be an attempt made by means of a regulation to prescribe a fee for inspection.

The authorities said, " We will have it examined at the orchard if you like to pay the expense of sending men out for the purpose." In such a case it might be advisable for the Government to impose a fee for inspection. </para>

                <para>Wales). - In connexion with this clause, several members of the Senate have been approached by persons interested in the fruit trade, who have represented, the undesirability of a clause being put into this Bill binding them to give notice to the Customs of their intention to export goods. It is stated that it is a very common thing for fruit to be on the trees in the morning and on board a vessel a few hours afterwards. The time at the disposal of the producer for picking, packing, and forwarding their fruit for shipment is so limited that it may be out of their power to comply with the regulations which might be made under this clause. We know what the office hours of the Customs Department are, and a shipment of' fruit might be ordered too late in the afternoon to enable notice under this clause to be given to the Customs, on the same day, and it might be necessary to ship the fruit in the morning before the Customs office was opened. In such a case, were this clause given effect, the producer would be compelled to decline the order for his fruit, because he could not give the requisite notice. That would not be a desirable state of affairs,. In connexion with an industry of this character we have a very large number of producers in a small way who have not a staff of clerks and employes to make these arrangements for them, and we can best simplify their work by negativing the clause. If no honorable senator desires to support me in my objection to the clause as a whole, I propose to move an amendment with regard to the penalty. The penalty as, provided by the clause is a very heavy one. I am willing that there should be a high penalty- </para>

To make a charge of <inline font-style="italic">£,1</inline> for a trifling, paltry mistake, is but a piece of robbery.

My objection to it is that it will inflict a considerable hardship on many of our producers. It provides that the producer must give notice to the Customs in accordance with the regulations, and we do not know what regulations will be made.

                <para class="block">The object of the amendment is not to make it obligatory to give twenty-four hours' notice, but to leave it optional. The exporter may give a week's or a month's notice, if he so desires. That, I think, will be a great convenience to shippers. The amendment will fix the minimum notice which they are required to give. The people who will suffer more than others by this provision are those who are shipping small quantities of their own fruit. That happens frequently in my own State. Even now it is a very difficult thing 'for them to get space, and if notice is obliged to be given they will be further hampered. I should feel better satisfied if the Minister could exempt small shippers from the obligation to give any notice at all, though I doubt whether that is possible. At any rate, it will be a great boon if a minimum notice is fixed. </para>

I. am aware that at times it is difficult for small shippers to obtain space in the cool chambers of the mail steamers. Often it is impossible to ascertain until the last moment what space will be available. Therefore I do not wish to fix any hard-and-fast time. I will have attention directed to the statements made by honorable senators in this respect, and they will be considered in drawing up the regulations. We will frame them so as to place as few obstacles as possible in the way of shippers. Possibly considerably less time than twenty-four hours' notice may be -required in the case of small shippers. </para>

                    SYMON (South Australia). - I can give a concrete instance to .show how difficult it is to obtain space for the shipment of a small quantity of fruit. Two or three months ago, during the orange season, I myself wished. to ship to England a few cases of oranges to distribute there. I understood from day to day that the fruit was to be available, but I never knew when it would be possible to ship it. At last an intimation was given to me that it would not be possible during the succeeding week or two, on account of the difficulty of getting space. As the result I have not been able to ship the fruit at all this season. When should I have had to give notice that I intended1 to export a certain quantity of oranges? Had I to give notice when I expected them to be delivered for shipment, or when they were delivered ? I might have been giving notice from week to week. Of course, the shipment of a small consignment like that is not intended to come under this Bill, which is meant to deal with the ordinary large export trade of the country. I mention that as a reason why the notice should be shortened in special cases, though I hope it will be dispensed with in a multitude of cases.

                    Thomson, I understand, sand that notice of the Customs entry should not be required, unless the entry was- the only trade description, and
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline>
                    Lyne assented to that. The matter has been looked into further, and it is found that very probably the Customs entry would be taken as the ordinary entry under the circumstances." and would contain the description. It has not been considered necessary to put a clause in the Bill stating that, because the fact is recognised by the Customs Department. I am- informed that there have been decisions by the English Courts on that particular point.

                    GOULD (New South Wales). - It would be rather a serious thing for the Court to inflict a fine of £10 upon a man who had committed only a technical breach of the law. Under the Customs Act the maximum penalty for an offence is mentioned, and it can be reduced to a twentieth part. In other words, if the penalty is fixed at £20, a fine of £1 can be imposed.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline>
                    is of opinion that in certain cases a fine of a few shillings may be quite sufficient to impose. If, however, the maximum penalty were reduced to
                    <inline font-style="italic">£10,</inline>
                    there would be no occasion to state the minimum, as it would be provided for in the Customs Act, with which the Bill has to be read.

                    <para>- We have now come to one of the vital departures from all existing legislation. I propose very briefly to state my views on the subject, and to call attention to what it involves. I shall take a later opportunity, if necessary, when the attendance is fuller, to have the whole matter rediscussed on a motion for re-committal. I object strongly to this system of proceeding at this late hour with a Bill which has been in Committee only a short time, and which involves questions of the greatest magnitude in relation to our commerce. This clause contains two leading principles. It provides that - </para>

                <para class="block">Of course, that means any portion of the goods enumerated in clause 15 which the regulations may specify. As to that, I have no complaint to make, subject, of course, to the consideration that we shall give to that clause when it is reached. There we have a reference to specified goods which removes the difficulty and inconvenience pointed out this afternoon in regard to clause 5. But clause 7 goes on to say that the importation of these specified goods may be prohibited - unless there is applied to them a trade description of such character, relating to such matters, and applied in such manner, as is prescribed. </para>
                <para class="block">We all admit that the main purpose of the Bill, when introduced last year, and again when introduced this year, was to prevent the importation of fraudulently marked, goods. This is a laudable desirable object, which is carried out expressly by clause 9 in these words - </para>

                <para class="block">That is salutary, beneficial, proper legislation, and no one can object to it. But this clause engrafts on it something altogether different. The first mischief is that it makes the marking of goods compulsory, which is not the case under the Imperial Act, and there is no reason why it should be. Compulsory marking was specially excluded from the operation of the Imperial Act, and if honorable senators will investigate the subject, they will ascertain the principle of all this sort of legislation, which is not new. We are not the discoverers of the mischief to be corrected, or of the remedy to be applied ; we are merely dealing with well-known and well-understood principles. The object is to prevent the public being victimized by having foisted on them goods under wrong or fraudulent descriptions. These principles have been adopted in England and the various States. <inline font-style="italic">Kerly,</inline> at page 19, says - </para>

                </quote>
                <para class="block">This Bill, first of all, makes marking compulsory in the case of imported goods, and, secondly, by an extraordinary perversion of every rule which ought to apply to trade, it makes the compulsory affixing of a mark, which is prescribed, not in the country of origin, but in Australia. The importation of the goods specified <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> clause 15, or which may be specified by regulation, is prohibited unless there is applied a trade description "of such a character relating to such matters, and applied in such manner as is prescribed." That is to say, if goods come here unmarked!, imported by some commercial man, who knows what he is getting, and who may reject them if they are falsely described, they may be marked in. any way the Minister chooses. All this has nothing to do with the consumer, but only with the importer. Goods which come here without any trade description, fraudulent or honest, may, under regulation, be marked by the Minister, even in the most fanciful or absurd) way, which he may prescribe by regulation. These marks are to be conceived in the minds of the authorities here, and to have no reference to the manufacturer or exporter. That is an entire reversal of ordinary methods, and has nothing to do with the principle of the Bill. </para>

                        <para>- What we desire to protect the consumers against is being deceived, which they may be by fraudulent marks, forgeries of marks, and so forth., There are volumes and volumes dealing with the subject of deceit by means of false marks and trade descriptions. The Bill, however, provides that the Minister, if goods come without a mark, may prescribe a mark, or he may change the mark which they already bear. Anything more idle or absurd! was never invented. The whole difficulty with the Bill has been that some extraordinary kind of mind - it is impossible to define the kind of tortuous mind - has been brought to bear in formulating the clauses. That people must be protected against deceit goes without saying; but in some extraordinary way the mind I refer to has been brought to bear with the effect of complicating, and not assisting or facilitating, legislation. This is one of the most vital clauses of the Bill, and I make no apology for directing particular attention to it. If the Minister of Defence desires to keep us here all night, I am prepared to stay; but that is not the way to deal with a Bill of this description, when it has been before us only for the second time really in Committee, and we have reached a clause of importance to which the concentrated mind of the full Senate ought to be given. I shall deal with that matter at greater length at another opportunity presented by the recommittal, if necessary, of the Bill. I am now simply dealing with clause 7, which, as I have already shown, is a departure from well-known principles, and existing legislation, and from the object of the Bill itself. I shall vote against the clause, but I should like to know whether Ministers think it desirable in the interests of the BiU that the provision should be proceeded with. If so* I intend to move a proviso to prevent the place of origin being regarded as a trade description. The place of origin used to be so regarded until a Select Committee or Royal Commission in England in 1891 condemned -it as a serious interference with trade. </para>

If ever there was a matter which ought to be left to the States it is that with which we are now dealing.

                        <para>- The States ought to deal with the goods when, they arrive. If it be thought that goods of a deleterious character are coming here, and may be sold in a fraudulent way, let the States deal with the matter, either as internal trade or as Inter-State trade. But for us to dictate to England, America, Germany, or Japan, what marks shall be employed on their goods is impossible, to a great extent, or if not impossible, is impracticable, and will lose us some of our trade. If the exporters of the world find that our regulations are of an inconvenient character, they will give up the Australian trade unless it be of a very lucrative character, and will endeavour to find new markets. </para>

The same difficulty will arise in connexion with the importation of medicines. They can be imported in casks, and not in bottles ; and after the casks have been imported under a proper trade description, the bottles may be distributed under false trade descriptions, and under this Bill the Minister will be unable to prevent that. If the clause is forced through to-night, it will only lead to the matter being discussed in full later on on a motion for the recommittal of the Bill. </para>

                    <para>- There are some goods imported in connexion with which it is desirable that there should be a true trade description; but they are very few, and they are almost entirely confined to articles of food. In order to protect ourselves against the importation of adulterated foods, it is here proposed to cover a large area of imports, including many goods which it will be impossible to describe. </para>

We should be very careful in giving such powers as are here proposed to be given to the Minister, because with the best intention, and as the result of absolute ignorance, they may be exercised, with very mischievous results indeed. It is proposed to place in the hands of the Minister of Trade and Customs the power to require a trade description to be applied to goods for the protection of the public, which may be of no use whatever for that purpose. </para>

                    <para>- It is very undesirable that this Bill should be pushed on at this hour of the night. Ministers have taken up the attitude that little or no reply shall be made to any objections raised against the Bill from this side. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> has said that he is prepared to believe that members of the present Ministry and of any Ministry who may succeed them will do all that is sensible and reasonable. I tell the honorable senator plainly that I have not that confidence in the Ministry. I believe they are as capable of making mistakes as other Ministries have been in the Commonwealth or elsewhere. So far as future Ministeries are concerned, I have no doubt the same thing may be said of them from whichever side in politics they come. It should not be forgotten that we are merely amateurs in dealing with this matter. Ministers are certainly amateurs on the subject of this Bill, because there is not one member of the present Government who is a commercial man. I ask whether any one of them has had such a commercial training as would entitle him to deal with a measure like this? </para>

                    (Tasmania).I take it that "place of origin " means place of manufacture. How is the importer in Australia! to know the place of origin of the goods which he buys through his agent in London ? If we do not take out those words we shall be penalizing the importer for something he cannot help. It will be very unjust, and will do the country no good. It is not a question of duty, because it does not affect the Customs Department in any way. I shall support the amendment.

                        <para>- The Minister came over to me, and said that he wanted to get as far as clause 10. He never said a word about any hour. I shortened my remarks, and moved no amendment subsequent to clause 7, in order that the Minister might be enabled to get as far as clause 10. I say with great pain that if he does adopt the course which he threatens he will be committing a gross breach of faith with the Senate and honorable senators on this side. I ask him not to allow himself to do a thing of that kind. He cannot deny that he came over to me ait the dinner adjournment, and said that he wished to get as far as clause 10, and I told him that I would do anything I could to help him. He never said a word about reaching clause 10 by 11 o'clock - not a single word. </para>

What is the good of the honorable senator, who never takes an intelligent share in the business of the Chamber, talking in that way ? I am not going to impute that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> would do such a thing, because his reputation is against it ; but I ask him to corroborate my statement, that at the dinner adjournment he came over to me and said that he was going on as far as clause 10, that I told him f would assist him, and that he never said a word about 11 o'clock, or any hour. On the faith of that assurance, we have not moved a single amendment in certain clauses. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> told me that he had a number of amendments to move between clause 7 and clause 10, and I suggested that he had better not move them. That is the attitude we took, and he has gone away. </para>

It would be very much better on the Minister's part to let honorable senators separate in an ordinary frame of mind, because if any unfair proceeding be taken it will only give rise to a lot of disagreement and unpleasantness.

Honorable senators delivered, over and over again, second-reading speeches until we got sick and tired of them. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> was prepared with amendment after amendment. When one amendment was moved, another, honorable senator suggested a certain alteration; when the amendment was withdrawn to be altered, another alteration was suggested, and so the talking went on. We on this side did not say much. The result is that honorable senators have kept us here until later than half -past 11 o'clock. As we have missed our trams and trains, we might just as well stop here and do a little more business. Honorable senators are desirous of proceeding with the Bill, and the Government intend to go on. </para>

It is accurate as far as it goes in regard to the conversation with myself. At the dinner adjournment he came over to me and stated that he proposed to go as far as clause 10. I said I should give him every assistance in order to get to that clause.

We have kept our promise absolutely. </para>

I made no speech on clause 7 ; I moved the amendment practically without a word. I said that I should content myself with placing it on record, and I stated that in a full Senate, if it were necessary, on a recommittal of the Bill, I should have an opportunity to fully discuss the effect of the clause. </para>

                        <para>- There was no condition of any sort or description made. We simply reminded each other of what took place on Friday - that the Bill was to be passed up to clause 4 on that day, up to clause 10 to-day, and the remaining clauses to-morrow. I want to have some fair ordinary dealing in this matter. I am pledged to honorable senators on this side who have gone away. I asked1 <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> not to move his amendments, and suggested that if he wished he should go home, with a view to preventing the possibility of the clause not being passed, and I undertook to go to clause 10. </para>

                    has reached the stage in the Bill which he desired to reach to-night. Certainly it has taken some time to reach that stage. He seems to think that there has been a great deal of obstruction on the other side; but I do not think the Bill has received more than such fair debate as its various clauses required.

                        <para>- I only talked when I felt it my duty to do so, and that I shall continue to do, in spite of any Minister. I approached the consideration of this Bill quite impartially, without any desire to embarrass or hinder the Government, but rather to be friendly toward them. I have no party allegiance here. This Bill appeals to me as a business man most strongly, therefore I wish to see its provisions debated properly and impartially. I do not wish to be lecturing the Committee at all, I only want reasonably fair play. The Minister has got as far with the Bill as he expected to reach to-night, in fact, if the truth is told, a little time ago he did not expect to reach clause 10 before daylight, but now having reached that clause, he wishes to do something which will leave him open to the charge of tyrannizing over the minority. I hope that on reconsideration he will not leave himself open to that charge. </para>

                    (South Australia).I hope that the leader of the Senate will carry out his expressed determination. It will be remembered that after the Bill was read the second time last Friday, the members of the Opposition deliberately wasted the whole of the day.

                    <para>- They announced their intent, if possible, to prevent the passage of the Bill. The whole of the business done that day was really done in the last half -hour of the sitting. The whole of the day having been wasted by the Opposition, the leader of the Government now proposes to do business. We have now missed our trains, and may as well proceed with the Bill. I resent the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> who, in reply to an interjection by me, stated that I had not taken an' intelligent interest in the Bill. I claim to have taken quite as intelligent an interest in the measure as has, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> himself. </para>

                    SYMON (South Australia). - If
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Story</inline>
                    feels at all hurt by my remark, which was in answer to an interjection by him, and not in regard to the measure itself, I express my regret, and at once withdraw it. I should be exceedingly sorry if any personal feeling were generated, over this matter, because I see no occasion for it. I spoke very emphatically on the subject, and related exactly what took place, on the faith of which, as leader of the Opposition, I acted in sending my supporters away, and in inducing them not to move a series of amendments on the intervening clauses between clauses 7 and 10. If
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline>
                    still adheres to the view he has expressed, and prefers not to give to-morrow to the consideration of the remainder of the Bill, as was intended, I shall make no further comment. I should like, however, to appeal to honorable senators whether I am being placed in quite a fair position ? I can only express my regret if, through any inadvertence, inconvenience has been caused to any person, but as I have explained, I did all I could, in order that all the clauses up to clause  10  might be dealt with. I have no desire to take the step, but if
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline>
                    does not wish to do so, it is quite open for me to move that progress be reported. If honorable senators wish to put me in that very difficult position, I cannot help it. I think, however, honorable senators will be more generous, and that, under the circumstances,
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline>
                    will not adhere to his decision. If
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline>
                    feels, however, that he ought to pass the Bill through Committee, I shall' ask honorable senators, on a motion to report progress, to say whether I shall be relieved from the position to which I have referred.

                <para>The articles specially dealt with in clauses 7 and 1 1 are articles which might endanger the health and safety of the people. It will be admitted that in the mining and shipping industries the safety of many people is dependent on sound chains and ropes. We should take every precaution to see that goods of this description are brought within the operation of the Bill. There should at least be provided the same power for their inspection as for the inspection of manures or medicines. In referring to the matter before, I pointed out that, under the Merchant Shipping Act, cables used on board ships are tested and inspected, but running gear and gear used in hoisting cargo are not tested. The adoption of the amendment would, I am sure, result in practical benefit to those engaged in mining and shipping. </para>

                        <para>- I thought that South Australia was as civilized as are other parts of the Commonwealth. Under the mining laws of the other States the inspection of ropes and gear is carried out as regularly as the tick of the clock. Employe's in the mining industry are not prepared to risk their lives on a rope which has been used until it is almost worn out, and the breaking of which might drop them to the bottom of a shaft. We can safely leave the inspection of ropes and chains in the hands of the States Legislatures. </para>

                    gave notice of this amendment, and no doubt honorable senators are aware that there is a very great deal of jewellery at present being sold in the Commonwealth as gold which contains but a very small proportion of gold, though every link of a chain may be marked " 15-carat." A large quantity of the jewellery which is imported is fraudulently marked, and it should be dealt with under a Bill of this character. The Committee will be well advised in accepting the amendment.
