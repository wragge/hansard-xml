                    <para>- I need scarcely assure the Minister of Defence that I have no desire whatever to interpose any difficulty in the way of what, when the close of the session is very imminent, is , a usual motion. But I think the Senate is entitled to some better information than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> has yet given as to the business that is to come before us. There have been of late a variety of occasions on which, in connexion with matters upon which it has, in the first instance, taken a fairly strong stand, and which concerned the business of the country greatly, the Senate has afterwards receded from the position first taken up. I am afraid that we shall get very much into the habit, I will not say of backing down, but of weakening our position, as a Senate, unless we take care that in connexion with motions of this kind we are placed in the same position at any rate, as are members in another place, and are given a clear statement of the programme of business to be carried through. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> has said that the Government require an extra day, and we must accept the honorable senator's assurance in that respect. Private business must, to a large extent, be subordinated to public business ; but we should be told what public business the Government propose to carry through. . This is the 13th December; we are almost on the eve of Christmas; and if considerable business is still to be brought forward, it. would be better to carry it over to the beginning of next year rather than that the Christmas arrangements which honorable senators may desire, and are entitled, . to make, should be interfered with. The Minister of Defence knows quite well that we have on the notice-paper business which is of some consequence. ' We have the Immigration Restriction Amendment Bill, the Contract Immigrants Bill, the Queen Victoria Memorial Bill, and the Manufactures Encouragement Bill. We know that in another place very important measures have been introduced, which more or less directly raise very serious questions affecting the fiscal issue. If these Bills are intended to be proceeded with when they reach the Senate, it will not be Christmas Eve that will see the prorogation of Parliament, but some day in next year. We ought to have some statement as to whether it is seriously intended to go on with those measures at this period of the session. My honorable friend is sanguine to a degree when he expects that, with those measures to be considered, the Government will be able to prorogue Parliament on Christmas Eve. We ought not to be relegated to the position of a House of registration or rejection. We are entitled, as a right, to be made, acquainted with the intents of the Government, so that we may be in a position to say whether or not the time allotted to private business ought to be taken away, or when Parliament is likely to be prorogued. I am referring to this matter, not from a party point of view, but from the point of view of a senator, and of the Senate itself. I think my honorable friend will see that the Senate has a right to claim from him an assurance that the fiscal issue will not be brought into the Senate a day or two before Christmas Eve. </para>

                        <para>- So far as I know, it does not interfere with the Customs Tariff Act. We have four measures on the notice-paper. Apart from the Immigration Restriction Amendment Bill and the Contract Immigrants Bill, we have the Queen Victoria Memorial Bill, which will not take more than a few minutes, because we have already passed a resolution on its subject-matter, and the Manufactures Encouragement Bill, which only alludes to a very small part of the Tariff. The notice-paper of the other House contains the Australian Industries Preservation Bill, the Sugar Bounty Bill, the Excise (Sugar) Tariff Bill, and the Price and Bayly Compensation Bill, which I imagine will not take very long. The other business on its notice-paper has been dealt with here, namely, the Electoral Bill, the Copyright Bill, and the question of the Pacific Cable. In addition to that, we have the Capital Site Bill to deal with. So far as I know, that is all the business we have to consider. I think that by sitting fairly long hours we can give due consideration to all these measures. I should imagine that honorable senators can make up their minds about them without any difficulty, and give a vote thereon. It will depend upon Parliament whether these Bills are passed or not. It will be for honorable senators to exercise their' own judgment ; but we intend, as far as we possibly can, to ask the Houses to deal finally with all these measures before we prorogue. </para>

                        <para>- In the Act, there is no provision for an exemption or a modification of that kind. A few weeks ago I paid a visit to Fremantle, and when I embarked upon the incoming mail steamer, the <inline font-style="italic">Mongolia,</inline> I found that the Australian passengers, for the safety of her master and owners, who are liable to penalties if they bring in prohibited immigrant's, had been obliged, before their arrival, to sign a long statement, declaring where they were born, what their ages were - this was peculiarly irritating to the ladies I am told - and a great number of other particulars. Whatever restrictions, and whatever sort of barbed-wire entanglements we are going to throw round immigration to Australia, we certainly ought not to throw difficulties in the way of our own people returning to our shores. </para>

What I am now pointing out is recognised,' and a modification is intended to be proposed in new clause 4B. It is now suggested that if a man has been resident here for five years he shall, before he leaves for a trip to an outside country, apply under that provision for permission to depart, and to return. Surely we are a free people here ! Why should we be obliged to go cap in hand to a Customs officer and to get his permission to go away; and to return ? </para>

                    <para>. - What is a citizen of the Commonwealth? A Chinaman, or a Hindoo? It is a very indefinite phrase. We know what is meant by a citizen of a certain city, but " citizen of the Commonwealth " is not a phrase which we use in Acts of Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- We shall be opening the door to a considerable extent if we accept the amendment. Of course, all the trouble arises from the fact that we have to resort, not to a straightforward course in regard to our immigration law. If we had been able to accomplish the object we had in view to keep out undesirable immigrants - that is, people of the Mongolian and negro races - in our own way, we should have had no trouble whatever. But we cannot help ourselves. We were informed that if we put in the words "coloured people," or any words- to that effect, the Home authorities would not recommend the Crown to assent to our Act. Therefore, we had to do what so many honorable senators have complained of. But the education test has never been applied to our own citizens returning from Europe or to European people coming to out shores. I think we ought to' leave the clause as it is, and I shall oppose the amendment. </para>

It was a most ridiculous thing : because, first of all, on arriving from Europe at Fremantle, I had to sign a paper; then on going between Fremantle and Adelaide, I had to sign another one; and I understood that if I had come from Adelaide to Melbourne bv vessel I should have had to sign, a third. </para>

                        <para>- But it is all done under Customs regulation. As the Minister of Defence has pointed out, the difficulty arises entirely from the fact that our Act is a farce and a subterfuge. The unfortunate part of it is that although, as the Minister points out, we in Australia understand the situation, persons outside Australia do not. That is the justification for the amendment that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> has moved. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator is quite mistaken. This Bill will go to Great Britain, and will be read there. There will be statements in the press that we have passed an Act by means of which no one who leaves these shores is able to return unless he can pass 'a dictation test. That is the statement that will be made, and it will be logically based upon this Bill. One may spend weeks and months in trying to convince the British public that such is not the fact, but in England they pass Acts of Parliament which are not frauds and subterfuges. They pass Acts which are meant to be read and acted upon. </para>

                        <para>- How is the High Commissioner, when he is appointed, going to explain to the British people that the Act which we have passed means nothing at all, and that its language is not to be read as English? To illustrate the extent to which this position can be pushed, I may mention that to-day I had occasion to inquire how it was that coloured labour was still introduced into the pearling fleets, both at Broome and Thursday Island: I inquired under what regulation these coloured aliens were introduced. The reply was that there was no regulation authorizing their introduction, but that they were introduced simply on the Customs officer being instructed not to put the language test to them. </para>

If the Government have the power to refrain from putting the Act into operation, they also have the power to so administer it as to shut out any person - any white person - offensive to them. A white citizen of Australia who was, for instance, a political agitator, might, on returning to Australia, be subjected to the test by an autocratic Government. If <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest, for instance, were at the head of such a Government, I might be shut out, if I failed to respond to the education test. </para>

                    description of what his position might be under a set of circumstances which he would not be the only one to deplore. The expression " a subject of the King resident in a State" is rather large, and therefore I have adopted "citizens," which is a term thoroughly well known to the law. The dual citizenship we enjoy is that of a citizen of the Commonwealth and a citizen of a State; and it is only the citizens of the Commonwealth who ought not to be bound in the fashion which, for reasons I can quite understand, -and what the Minister has not been slow to stigmatize as a make-believe, the Bill proposes. The point to which I invite attention is that this clause applies to every traveller and every visitor, whether on business or pleasure, who comes to this country from England. It is suggested that an Australian may be Known or easily identified; but that might not be so with Customs officers at outside ports. The result might be that people who were never intended to be affected would be subject to the test.

                        <para>- That is not the frame of mind in which to approach the consideration of this question. It is either right, or it is not right, that this provision should remain as it is, rendering white British subjects liable to exclusion. If the provision is not right, let us adopt some other means to attain our end. Let us say that we do not wish to exclude them ; and then I shall support a provision later on, that coloured &gt; residents of Australia, shall, on returning to the Commonwealth, be subject to the test, just as if they were arriving for the first time. Surely the English language is not so feeble an instrument that we cannot adequately express our intention. My desire is not to interfere in any way with the object of the Bill, but to facilitate 'its operation, though not by placing a ban on people whom we do not wish to exclude. </para>

Had we been completely untrammelled, there would have been an Act on the statute-book specifying the persons whom we desire to prohibit; but out of deference to the opinions of the Imperial authorities, a measure was adopted with the sanction of the country, which was admitted during its passage through Parliament to be largely a subterfuge. It was agreed by Parliament and the country that the Administration should govern and carry out the policy embodied in the Bill. While, of course, it is technically possible that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> or any of us may be subjected to the education test, it is certain that such a test would never be applied. </para>

                        <para>- That is quite true, but there are events sufficiently probable to enable us to act on the probability. We are not sure that the seasons will occur '.in the future as they have in the past, but it would be foolish for a. farmer to, therefore, say that it was no use sowing because summer might not come next year. It is absolutely certain that no European or European citizen of the Commonwealth will ever have the test applied to him. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> has introduced an apparently harmless amendment, that might. I think, entirely circumvent the 'intention of the Act with regard to aliens not located in Australia. I understand that it is correct to speak of our "Chinese citizens," and so with regard to the Japanese and Hindoo, residents within the Commonwealth. If that be so, and this clause were amended in the direction suggested, those citizens, when departing from the Commonwealth for a time might be able to evade the undoubted intention of the people w place them under some restriction. I hope the amendment will not be carried,- and, if I may without being offensive, I suggest that the arguments in opposition to the clause are very much of the same character as the Bill itself- make-believe. Honorable senators opposite do not really think that there are any such dangers as those they point out ; and merely set up a hypothetical case, which is so extremely improbable as to be practically impossible. </para>

                        <para>- I disagree entirely with that view. In what way does the Bill differ from the existing Act in regard to the education test ? Incidentally, the honorable senator mentioned that desirable white immigrants coming to Australia from other parts of the world, and especially ladies, were subjected to much irritation and annoyance, because they were asked their age and other similar personal questions. One would think that such questions are not submitted to immigrants in any other country in the world. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> ever visits America, he will find that he will be asked quite a number of questions. </para>

The captains of vessels carrying passengers to the United States must see that these forms are filled up by their passengers. They must then take them before a United States Consul, and swear to them on oath. They are also required to make a declaration as to the health and condition of the passengers they carry to the United States. Notwithstanding all these so-called restrictions, we find that thousands of desirable people enter the United States of America every year. </para>

                        <para>- I have not been to the United' States, and do not know. In any case, the amendments upon the principal Act proposed in this Bill do not place any obstacles in the way of desirable white immigrants entering Australia. Certain persons within and without the Commonwealth have raised the cry, with a view to damaging the reputation of the Commonwealth, that the Labour Party in Australia do not desire that desirable white immigrants should be allowed to enter the Commonwealth. They have no wish whatever to stop such people from coming to Australia, but what they do desire is that those who are Australians by birth or adoption shall not be walking the streets of the cities of the Commonwealth in idleness. When employment is found for those in the Commonwealth who desire employment, and the affairs of the country are placed on a sound basis, the members of the Labour Party are, perhaps, more anxious than those who profess to be the friends of people abroad for the introduction into Australia of people of their own race. I see no reason why the amendment should be agreed to, because its effect will be to defeat the intention of the Bill. </para>

                    <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> has given one very good reason why the amendment should be agreed to. The honorable senator has said that certain people inside and outside of the Commonwealth have put it abroad that we desire to keep white people out of this country. I take it that the very object of the amendment is to show that that is not true, and that citizens of the Commonwealth can leave and return to Australia without let or hindrance. It is very desirable that any statement to the effect that a citizen of the Commonwealth who leaves Australia can return only with considerable difficulty shall be shown to be absolutely untrue. The Minister has said that the law is not administered in the way stated, but the Act does not clearly indicate what is intended. </para>

                        <para>.- The difficulty is that the Act of Parliament can be appealed to, and people may say : " You can say what you like, but there is the statute law, and we have a right to assume that the authorities in Australia will carry out that law." Honorable senators must admit that the insertion of the amendment can do no harm. We are told that it merely provides for the way in which the Act is at present administered, and why should we not make that clear in the Bill, so that the people who are not intimately acquainted with our legislation may know exactly what we are doing, and may not be left under any misapprehension as to what will happen to them if they come to Australia. </para>

                    <para>- There are a few words which have been used so often in this debate as to have become somewhat hackneyed ; for instance, the words "sham," "fraud," and " subterfuge " have been applied to the existing Act, and1 to this Bill. I am afraid that some more of this sham, fraud and subterfuge will be imported into the Bill by the proposed amendment, to which the same epithets might very well be applied. Time and again the statement has been made that we have passed a law to exclude white men from Australia. Those who have been decrying our immigration laws have industriously circulated that statement, and I am sorry to say that some colour is being given to it by this amendment. As a matter of fact, our immigration laws have not had the effect of keeping any white men out of Australia who desire to come here. That is proved by the statistics on the subject. If a very few white men have been prohibited from entering Australia, they have been kept out by the operation of State laws. I find from the statistics for 1903 that there were in that year 44,117 immigrants introduced into Australia. Of that number, 41,132 were white people, comprising all nationalities - English, Austrians, Belgians, French, Danes, Dutch, Germans, Greeks, Italians, Poles, Portuguese, Russians, Scandinavians, Swiss, and Turks. Out of 44,000 immigrants 41,000 were whites, and the balance consisted of Pacific Islanders and others, who came in to work on the sugar plantations and the pearling grounds. In that year only eight white men were excluded, and these were excluded under paragraph, <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> of section 3 of the Act; in other words,, because they were practically paupers, and were looked upon as likely to be a burden upon the Commonwealth. That action was taken under a law which has long been in force, I believe, in nearly all the States. Out of the total number of immigrants who were subjected to the education test in 1903 only thirteen were admitted. Six persons were admitted for various reasons. Two were horse-buyers, who were regular visitors; two were natives of the Northern Territory, who had returned without any papers, and had to be tested ; and the other two were commercial men, who were on a short visit to the Commonwealth, and who returned to their own country. That accounts for six of the thirteen. Everything considered, I hold that our immigration law has worked fairly well; certainly it has given satisfaction to those who wished undesirable persons to be kept out. It has not excluded any white men, except the eight persons to whom I have referred. What, then, becomes of this cry of the unfairness of our law to white men, and what is likely to result from its retention upon the statute-book? In my opinion, the mistake we have made is in proposing to alter the Act. It has worked admirably, and I should be glad to see this Bill thrown into the waste-paper basket. I am inclined to think that the Act, if allowed to stand as it is, would work more satisfactorily than would the proposed amendment. </para>

He proposes an amendment which would specifically exclude Australians. When we proceed to make a specific exclusion of Australians we make inferentially a specific inclusion of British subjects. That, I think, logically follows. </para>

                        <para>- That, of course, may be said. The honorable senator has quoted from the report of an Agent-General, in which he indicates how serious has been the general impression created throughout Great Britain by the character of our Immigration Restriction Act. We are now engaged in trying to improve the law. If we were to adopt an amendment to specifically exclude Australians from the application of the education test, we should point the moral all the more strongly in regard to those inhabitants of the British Isles who wish to come out. I trust that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> will see his way either to withdraw the amendment, or to enlarge it so as to include all British-born subjects as well as citizens of the Commonwealth. As it is, I see no course open to me but to oppose the amendment. I recognise that the Bill deals with an exceedingly difficult matter. There is no doubt that we are in the mire over this matter of immigration, and tha,t that fact is recognised By all parties. I believe that even members of the Labour Party are prepared to concede a 'little in order to relieve Australia of some of the odium which has been- cast upon her. It is desirable that we should be very careful in all that we do in connexion with the Bill ; that, in so far as it does aim to remove the odium, in so far as it does tend to remove objectionable restrictions or to lighten them in the face of the world, so far we ought to support the Bill ; but in doing so we ought to beware of adding amendments which might defeat the object which we have in view. </para>

                        <para>- I crossed the floor, because I knew that honorable senators on the opposite side were supporting me with the intention of defeating the proposed legislation, as I believe they are now trying to do. Suppose that we were to introduce amendments of the description which has been indicated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> in what position should we put ourselves? We should have to make other amendments which would distinctly stipulate a colour test, and then the Governor-General might refuse to assent to the Bill which would have to be reserved, and would, perhaps, be hung up for an indefinite period. We do not wish anything of that kind to happen. We desire to pass legislation which, whether it be a subterfuge, or a fraud, will carry out our intentions. I hope that honorable senators will endeavour to confine themselves to that view of the question. We have been told by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> that British people are under the apprehension that if they came out they would be subjected to the education test. Will any one point out to me a provision which says that a Britisher or a European will be subjected to that test? </para>

                        <para>- Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> of section 3 of the Act does not say any person is to be put to the education test; but that any person who, when put to the test, fails to pass it, shall be a prohibited immigrant. It does not say that the test shall be applied to a Britisher, or to a European, or even to an African, or an Asiatic. If the Act, together with a copy of the figures quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, were handed to a Britisher, and he were told that he would be a prohibited immigrant if he came out, unless he could pass the education test, he would ask, " Where does the Act say that the education test shall be applied to me?" Neither <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> nor <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> can point to a provision of that kind. The Britisher would say : " The test has not yet been put to a European, and, acting on the assumption that it will not, I am going to Australia." I hope that honorable senators will remember that if they were to accept this amendment they would have to amend the Bill in a direction which would specifically stipulate a colour test, and thus put our legislation in jeopardy. It was only for that reason that I rose to address the Committee. </para>

                    <para>- I am in, favour of the amendment. I cannot conceive why the Ministry do not accept it, or how any man can oppose it. It appears to me that when an Australian citizen desires to enter the Commonwealth he ought not to be put to any test. I have risen to refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating's</inline> interjection that the Agents-General sometimes, or too often, have played into the hands of those who desire to injure Australia. He is acquainted with the Agent-General for Tasmania, and he knows that no man could have been more loyal to his Government, his Parliament, his people, or his clients than has that gentleman. I ask him, therefore, to withdraw his remark. </para>

                        <para>- I am not going to allow the honorable senator to put on to the Agents-General the sins of the , Commonwealth. It is a fact that our legislation, pas.sed in a slip-shod manner - in a manner which our own people do not understand, and that our officers misunderstand - has practically condemned Australia. Does my honorable friend think that an Agent-General, representing 200,000 out of 4,000,000 people, ought to write to the press of Great Britain, and repudiate everything said about the laws of the Commonwealth ? Does he not know perfectly well that it is an unwritten law that we shall not interfere with the States, and that the States shall not interfere with us ? Although some have the bad taste to violate that law, is that a reason why the Agents-General should be condemned, because they have not violated it ? </para>

He must know perfectly well that in proposing this amendment, he is simply beating the air. A little while ago we heard him expressing himself as being extremely anxious for the end of the session. But here he is now wasting the time of the Senate. I can hardly believe that he is serious. </para>

                        <para>- It might be difficult to define the word. If we insert the amendment, we shall be compelled to do the very thing we have been trying to avoid - to differentiate between coloured and other people. So far as I have been able to learn, no Australian desiring to go out of this country for the purpose of visiting any other country has been subjected to the education test on his return. There is no inconvenience whatever. Are we prepared to draw the colour line ? If we are not, we should stick to the Bill. Every one knows that a majority of the Senate was in favour of the education test when the original Act was passed. The consideration that swayed us was that we had the Imperial Government to consider. The original Act which this Bill amends was a compromise. Are we in a better position to-day than we were than when that measure was passed? Are we able to stand straight up on our own feet and say that we will not have any compromise? </para>

We know perfectly . well why honorable senators opposite were so very anxious to amend the original Bill. They thought the result would be that the Bill would be hung up indefinitely, and that Asiatics would be permitted to come in freely during the negotiations. </para>

But where is the trouble in dictating fifty word's, whether the immigrant be writing or not? As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> pointed out, there is great clanger, if the clause remains as at present, of a Customs officer performing his duty in such a perfunctory manner that a person, ineligible according to the intention of the Act, may be admitted to the Commonwealth. Then it is also possible for a Customs House officer, as the Bill stands at present, to dictate some simple little sentence of as few words as he chooses to fix. </para>

                    has not stated the facts quite correctly. In the original Act a passage of fifty words was provided for; and I alluded to the fact that, in many cases, the officers had found that the intended immigrant was utterly incapable of writing one word, and that, therefore, it was of no use proceeding to the full number. In a. case of this kind, which was taken into Court, the officer could not swear he had dictated fifty words; and the case was dismissed at once. I notice that magistrates are always exceedingly willing to put every obstacle in the way of carrying out this Act. In the original Act the provision for dictating fifty words was held - indeed. the Government lost one case on this point - to mean that the officer must not dictate one word beyond that number. In the case I refer to the officer admitted that he had exceeded the number, and the magistrates dismissed the charge. I am quite willing that there should be a maximum and a minimum number, and I suggest that
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline>
                    withdraw his amendment, so as to permit the introduction, after the word " not." of the words " less than twenty-five nor." '

                    that he is not quite just to me when he asserts that I never adopt a course which will assist the Government - although I have done so frequently during the session, and hope to do so again if they conduct themselves properly - I now announce that I intend to support the amendment which
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline>
                    has suggested. There is nothing in the paragraph about spelling, and I take it that spelling is an element of a dictation test. Surely, if an unhappy Greek or Italian is subjected to a test of twenty words in Engglish, it will be sufficient to show whether he knows anything about it ? It should be borne in mind that this test is not an education test, but is being us.ed as a colourable and indirect means - and I am not ashamed to use the word which
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline>
                    has used - a subterfuge, to keep out people of the coloured races. It is not a test as to whether an intending immigrant is an accomplished writer of English essays, an accomplished French or German scholar, or any nonsense of tha-t kind. It is a test intended for the purpose of keeping people of coloured races out of Australia. I may, or may not, agree with it, but that is the policy, and I do not propose to question it on this Bill. Bearing that in mind, it must be evident that it is of little consequence whether the test comprises ten, fifteen, twenty, or five thousand words. If it were intended  merely as an education test, there are numbers of Japanese who could pass it. Scores of them write better English than do any of the members of the Senate. Some Japanese have recently published books in English which are models of style, and would not shame Ruskin, Macaulay, or any of the great writers of England.

It will be admitted that an undesirable immigrant would have more difficulty in writing a passage of fifty words than in writing one of twenty-five words. I think that the Minister should accept <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart's</inline> amendment.

If we had used the word "English" in the clause, we should have been able to impose the test only in one language, and numbers of Asiatics would have been able to come in without any trouble. By using the word "European" in the first instance, we extended the list of languages to a very great number, the object being to give us better opportunities to prohibit the landing of undesirable people. Persons who could speak English well enough might find it difficult to pass the test in Hungarian, Swedish, Norwegian, Russian, and so on. What we are proposing now is to further extend the list of languages in which the test may be imposed, with the approval of Parliament. We propose to take power, with the approval of Parliament, to extend the number of languages indefinitely, and we might, under the Bill, include the whole of the Asiatic languages.

                    <para>- I hope the Committee will accept the amendment. I consider it the most important that can be moved in this Bill. It is ridiculous for the Minister to tell us that the more languages we have the better. I ask the honorable senator whether, with all the European languages included in the existing Act, the authorities could not exclude anybody they pleased if the test were applied with that object ? No person living is an adept in all the languages of Europe. It is merely throwing dust in the eyes of the Committee "to say that the object of this clause is to enable the test to be applied to undesirable immigrants in a greater number of languages. The real reason for the clause <inline font-style="italic">"is</inline> that there has been an outcry that our Immigration Restriction Act should be made less offensive to Japan. </para>

                        <para>- The fact that we provided that the test should be imposed in a European language, and not in a prescribed language, showed clearly and unmistakably the intention of Parliament in the matter, and it has been so held by the Courts. It was thought that only persons who spoke a European language should be admitted. If the phrase "an European language" be replaced with the phrase "any prescribed language," what indication shall we have of the language which may be used in the test ? It is the most dangerous proposal in the Bill. It is admitted that the value and effect of this legislation depends entirely upon administration. Suppose that we had in office a Minister who was in favour of coloured races being allowed to enter. </para>

                        <para>- Such cases are quite common. Therefore, it behoves Parliament to place on the face of every measure a clear indication of what it means. This clause would only make our legislation more a subterfuge than ever, because the Minister, after getting perhaps a catch vote in favour of a regulation, might prescribe the Japanese, or the Chinese, or any language, and he would have the authority of Parliament for taking that course. If, however, we were to retain in the Act the expression " an European language," no Minister could go behind the back of Parliament and prescribe any other language. I take it that we are all perfectly willing and anxious to allow every one of our own race and colour, no matter whether he may come from Europe or from America, to enter the Commonwealth. </para>

                    (New South Wales).- Several honorable senators stated yesterday, time after time, that Japan had not made it officially and authoritatively known that she. felt insulted at the word " European " being used in our Act. After the repeated explanations which have been made here, I cannot understand any honorable senator rising to make that assertion, because if anything has been made clear in the history of politics during the last few years it is that one fact that Japan has explained fully, courteously, and earnestly that the adoption of that term by Australia, differentiating as it does against Japanese, was taken by that nation as an insult. I do not think we need argue whether certain things are so or not. The question is, has Japan made it quite clear that she does feel slighted and offended at the adoption of that phrase? If we are inclined to-day to take a big 'view of things, then we must pay attention to the utterances of our ally. If, on the other hand, we care nothing about the Empire, if any of us is eager to take steps which might even tend to discredit Australia, which might tend ultimately to disintegrate the Empire, then I can understand honorable senators with such ulterior purposes in their minds being ready to bring about a position which might produce that result. We had repeated statements made here yesterday as to the position of a British emigrant to Japan. It was stated positively that, whatever might be our terms of exclusion, Japan's terms of exclusion against the British were more exacting, more arbitrary, and more offensive. Honorable senators' cannot have paid much attention to the paper which was tabled not long ago. on the motion of
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs,</inline>
                    and which is entitled " Treaty of Commerce and Navigation between Great Britain and Japan." I shall quote briefly two or three articles of the Treaty, in order to make clear the terms upon which British people mav enter Japan. Article 1 of the Treaty begins as follows: -

                    <para>Immediately on receipt of your letter I cabled to my Government, and to-day received a cable authorizing me on behalf of my Government to accept the terms and conditions referred to ; showing again that the Consul for Japan has spoken and acted in an authoritative manner. It has been stated by several speakers that the ordinary course of procedure is for the representatives of foreign Powers to address themselves to London, and for their communications to come through the British officials to Australia. But surely those who are anxious to see Australia develop into a great nation - those who have high ideals of what Australia ought to be. and will be in the future - ought, above all others, to be gratified that direct communications have passed between the representatives of Japan and the Government of Australia, without the circumlocution office having first to be dealt with. It was not to-day, it was not yesterday that Japan first of all began to complain of Australian legislation. I hold in my hand a copy of a despatch, dated the 20th November, 1897, from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joseph</inline> Chamberlain to the Governor of Victoria. It  is only one of several despatches that were sent to Australian Governments, in which  the Colonial Secretary intimated that he had received communications from the Japanese Government with regard to Aus-" tralian legislation; and he used the words that " a painful feeling exists in Japan." Is it for us, when we can achieve our object easily and readily, to take steps which will admittedly <inline font-style="italic">give</inline> offence to the Japanese? There is no question of doubt that in introducing this measure to omit the word "European," and to effect the object previously attained by the principal Act in another way, the Government have been influenced - and I think happily and rightly influenced, in the interests of Australia and in the interests of the Empire - by a desire to be at peace with Japan, and to arrange our business on lines that will at least give satisfaction to that nation, and will not be offensive to our own feelings. Only a few minutes ago I said that the whole subject of immigration was in the mire. I have recognised the trouble we are in, and I am grateful for any effort to relieve Australia of any portion of the mire that clings to her. I recognise that this amendment of the law makes some effort to .meet a great difficulty,, and one which reflects much discredit on Australia. It is for this reason that I ask honorable senators to pause before proposing to hark back again to the conditions, of the existing Act. I hope that the time will come when we shall be able to effect our object in a much more satisfactory way than we do by means of this Bill. I have had a motion on the business-paper of the Senate for some time, and it has been discussed on several occasions, on the lines of making an arrangement with Japan, and, of course, with other countries, with regard to immigration. </para>

                    I do not see that there is anything to be gained by perpetuating what we are all calling a subterfuge. "The beginning of sin is like the letting out of water," and once we begin this kind of legislation there is no end of it. The provision under discussion affords an illustration. We propose to use the words " In any prescribed language." That is clear. But there is to be no other prescribed language than an European language until next session, when some other language, we do not know what, may be adopted by the Legislature. Until some other language is prescribed, the test is to be applied in an European language, as defined in the existing Act. It is merely a pretence to say that we are wiping away a reflection on the Japanese. Let us be a little honest in our legislation, and not perpetuate a dishonest method. We all admit that our- policy is to exclude Asiatic labour. That policy has been enunciated by this Parliament. None of us is prepared to question it now, whether we are in accord with it or not. We then have to consider what shall be our instrument - what means shall be adopted. Our Act imposes an education test in an European language. That is an instrument which has been effective in the past. Tt will be effective in the future. But when we pass this Bill, and put it upon the statute-book, removing the expression. "European language," we are still going to leave the existing Act absolutely intact,' still wounding, the susceptibilities of the Japanese. No one believes for a moment that when we meet again next session we shall change the European languages in which the education test is applied into Asiatic languages. The Bill merely says that power is given. We do nothing. This Bill does not really alter the thing one iota. If the Japanese are wounded toy European languages being prescribed in the existing Act, they will remain prescribed after this Bill becomes a Statute. If the existing law is a blot in the opinion of the Japanese, it remains a blot.

                        <para>- When the Bill is passed it will have to be read in conjunction with the existing Act. An European language is prescribed in that Act, and this Bill makes no alteration. The position is that the measure does not alter the European language provision which stares the Japanese in the face in our existing legislation. We are reducing our legislation to a perfect farce, and I am with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> when he wishes to say plainly what we are trying, by means of this Bill, to escape from saying. We are a pack of cowards if we do not say it plainly. Let us have some courage, and some political honesty, in telling the Japanese that, whatever modification may be. made by Parliament hereafter, it is by a test in an European language that their admission is to be governed. Will any one tell me that we are going to prescribe Japanese as one of the languages in which the test may be administered? I think not. It is a mere hollow farce to suggest that we are going to do anything to relieve the feelings of the Japanese by putting the Japanese language on the same level with an European language, when we do not intend to do anything of the sort. Why should we treat the Japanese in this fashion? They are not children. Such legislation is not worthy of us, and for that reason I shall support the amendment proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart.</inline></para>

                        <para>- If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> intends to vote against the proposal of the Government, in the belief that some one's feelings may be more hurt than they are at present, he has, no doubt, some reason in his mind for the belief ; but what a very extraordinary "mind to be capable of arriving at such a conclusion ! I had the honour to be a member of the Parliament in which, I believe, was first introduced this, education test, and I would have much preferred to state in positive language exactly what it was proposed to do. However, an intimation was received from those to whom we have a right to defer that they would be pleased if we adopted another course, which would not embarrass them, or be offensive to a nation with whom they were on friendly relations. The position is the same to-day. Most of us have a little .courage, but I am not hankering after strained relations with other parts of the world. I am not " looking for trouble," if the desirable ends I have in view can be otherwise achieved. It seems to me that the Government have adopted a course which is commendable. [ feel as s.trongly as any man in. the Commonwealth in regard to the underlying principle of the Bill. It is in the interests of the Commonwealth to keep this continent to be owned, managed, and enjoyed by people of our own race ; at any rate, we ought not to admit within our borders persons who obviously never can blend with us. Having achieved that initial principle, we ought to be anxious at all times to give the "other fellow" - if I may use the expression - everything that is non-essential, if he is satisfied with that. In this instance, it appears that those with whom we might be embroiled are satisfied with what the Government propose to do, and we ought also to be satisfied because the law will be strong enough to achieve our object. </para>

                        <para>- However, all this does not affect my argument. We can get along very much better with individuals, or with aggregations of people, if we achieve our ends by the most pleasant and unobjectionable method; and that is what I think the Government are now doing. We know, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> pointed out, that the Government will not prescribe an Asiatic language, and there is no need, therefore, to have any specific clause in this connexion. So long as Parliament has the power to prescribe the language, that power should be left as wide as possible, if in leaving it so we avoid giving offence. I know that some honorable senators, who agree with the principle of the Bill, resent any outside interference with our legislation. ( Such interference arouses pugnacious people, and I regret to say that in many, respects I am pugnacious myself. We should always endeavour, however, to overcome that disposition, because, after all, there is a vast amount of wisdom and philosophy in a saying with which I was familiar in my boyhood : " You can catch more flies with treacle than you can with vinegar." We ought to put as little " vinegar " as possible into our negotiations and communications with other people. </para>

                        <para>- They were not satisfied, though for reasons of their own they remained passive. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> has given plenty of evidence that they were not satisfied. I recognise fully the intense earnestness which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> has exhibited on behalf of the Japanese people, and I therefore regret that I am unable to agree with the honorable senator that by voting 'with the Government in this matter I shall be doing what will satisfy the Japanese people. I believe that what they would desire us to do is what we should ourselves desire if we were in their place, and that is that we should pass straightforward legislation, which would in no sense indicate that we considered the Japanese to be in any way inferior to Western nations or to Australians. In a sense they recognise the wisdom of the course which we are taking, because they give no encouragement to Japanese to emigrate from their own country, and we may therefore take it that they do not favour their coming to Australia. But we know that what they do desire is that they shall be considered as on a par with Western ' nations. It is natural enough that, consulting the dignity of the position they have achieved, they should think it right that they should be placed on a parity with Western- nations in all legislation of this character. I believe that this Bill is no improvement on the existing Act. </para>

The fact remains that whatever is obnoxious to Eastern nations in the existing Act is perpetuated in this Bill, and I cannot believe that the Japanese will be satisfied that what1 they complain of in the existing Act ils remedied by this Bill. For the reasons I have given, I intend to support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart's</inline> amendment'. </para>

The admission by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford,</inline> and the public announcements which we have seen in print of the views entertained by most of the members of the Government, have justified honorable senators in believing that the Government deliberately propose to strike the word " European " out of the original Act, in order to appease somebody, and the Japanese, I assume. </para>

A few years ago. when there were only a small number of these people in Northern Queensland, we were always told that we need not be afraid of very many of them coming in. It was stated in the Queensland Parliament that the Japanese were not only coming in, but were bringing in their women, dressed as men, in order to be able to do with them practically what they chose. Within about eighteen months from the signing of the treaty between Japan and Great Britain we had a Japanese unemployed question at Thursday Island. There were 200 odd </para>

                <para class="block">Japanese, who had no means of getting employment, and who practically had to appeal to the Government to bring them down the coast to places where they would be able to find work. The Government did not respond to the appeal, but the sugar planters did. It was because of the Japanese unemployed question at Thursday Island that these men were spread over the greater portion of the coast-line of Queensland. During all this time the Japanese Government were protesting that they did not want their people to go to Australia, but, as a matter of fact, the Japanese were resorting to every possible device with the object of getting into Australia while this protest was being made. </para>

A copy of the treaty was sent to the Government of each Colony in the group, and it is very strange, indeed, that New South Wales never took advantage of its terms. Every Colony but Queensland declined to consider the treaty, and it was accepted by that Colony with the omission of two or three paragraphs, including article , 24, I think, to which its Parliament would not agree. There was a big feeling against accepting the treaty, because it was well known that wherever there was a possibility of Japanese evading its terms it would be taken advantage of to the fullest extent. </para>

I am only pointing out that, years, ago, the Japanese Government were continually protesting that they did not wish their people to go to Australia, but that as many of them as possible did enter our country simply because it was better than Japan. "I believe that the Japanese are a people who would resort to any device or subterfuge to gain their ends. I prefer our legislation to be worded as clearly as possible. I am quite prepared, if that be the wish of a majority, to draw the colour line very clearly, and to run the risk of the Royal Assent being refused to the Bill. Prior to Federation, it was only New South Wales which passed a measure of this kind, 1 believe. The Bill was reserved, and the Government of the Colony was invited by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain</inline> not to adopt the direct method, but to adopt the language test, which was contained in the Natal Act. </para>

                        <para>- As the result of its legislation, Natal is overrun by coloured aliens - the very people whom its Parliament wished to exclude. In legislating on this subject from time to time each State has, found it necessary to go one step further than it did previously. I believe that in Queensland a large- majority of the people favour the adoption of a colour test. The education test.., even, in this modified form, is described as a further subterfuge; but. as* the Minister has pointed Out, the value of this, kind of legislation depends solely upon its administration. So far, it has not been found necessary to placate any one by applying the test in an European language. Why should we go out of our way to legislate, not for the people of Australia, but practically for the people of Japan? In ' framing our legislation, we are not called upon to placate a people whom, I believe, 90 per cent, of the electors of Australia desire to exclude from our shores. We are told that we shall not be allowed to exclude Asiatics by a direct method. I submit that the indirect method which we adopted in 1901 has given satisfaction to a large majority of the people of the Commonwealth. I know that a number of persons, have said that it was disapproved of by the people of Japan, the people of China, and, I believe, the people of India. There is no reason why we should take particular notice of the people in London who have been crying out about our legislation, because, undoubtedly, it would be to their interest to see cheap, coloured labour brought into Australia. If it is satisfactory to a large majority of the people of the Commonwealth, let it stand upon the statute-book exactly as it is. I think there is no reason to resort to further subterfuge, and that we ought to let the world know exactly what we mean. If our legislation has been to some extent effective - and I believe that it has not been altogether effective in keeping out Asiatics, and that something else will have to be done in this, direction before very long - why should it be altered in this direction? </para>

                        <para>- I think not. Last night I said that I should like to see the Bill come into force, because, in my opinion, it would remedy certain defects in the Act which require to be remedied as soon as possible. If we are agreed that there are certain defects in the Act which require to be remedied, and that this Bill will remedy them, it remains to be determined whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart's</inline> amendment remedies any other defect. To my mind, it is quite clear that it does not. Why? The Bill gives the Minister power to prescribe a language under the regulations. Only European languages art. now prescribed. The language prescribed will not take the place of an European language. The Bill itself provides that no. regulation prescribing a language shall be enforced until it has been laid before both Houses of Parliament for thirty days, or if within that time a motion has been proposed in either House to disapprove of the regulation, until that motion has been disposed of. A slight alteration may be required in the wording of that clause to make it impossible for such a regulation to come into force until both Houses have approved of the motion. I am quite willing to support an amendment to make the clause read that, if any alteration in the language test is proposed by Ministers, we shall have the fullest opportunity of discussing it, and that it shall not be sufficient to lay a regulation on the table, and say nothing about it. Probably the Government would accept such an amendment. I do not see very much reason for the language test proposal of the Bill. But this is the position : We are probably within a fortnight of the close of the session. There are many good provisions in this Bill. If many alterations are made it is possible that there will not be sufficient time to dispose of them. It will be a pity to jeopardize the Bill by making amendments which are not of great importance. </para>

If there were the slightest intention to weaken the White Australia policy, I should not for a moment support the proposal of the Government. But if we can remove a cause of offence that Australia is said to have given to another nation without endangering our policy, why should we not do it ? The Government tells us that we can do it. I cannot see that we are doing a very wrong thing in giving the Government a chance, and letting it take the responsibility. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> is one of those who have strongly advocated the drawing of a colour line.

                        <para>- But there are some honorable senators associated politically with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> who, to-day, have said that they would like to draw a colour line, and who have used beautiful, high-sounding phrases on the subject, whose sincerity I very much doubt. One of them has said, "Let us be honest; do not let us be cowards. Let us do what we want to do openly. Let us be courageous, instead of branding ourselves as afraid to proclaim our intentions." But I would ask the honorable senator, who has tried to brand us as political cowards, what he and his Government, while they were in office, did to demonstrate their great courage in regard to drawing a colour line? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> was a member of a Government in whose counsels his voice must have had great weight. When that Government came into power, not only did it not bring before Parliament a proposal to substitute a colour line for the education test, but. the head of that Government went so far as to say publicly, at Hobart, in reply to a deputation, that he had no intention, during the existence of the present Parliament, to try to alter our immigration legislation. Yet we have <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> to-day using beautiful phrases about courage', and inferentially branding those who do not agree with him as political cowards. </para>

                        <para>- What chance did our Government have to do anything of the kind ? But it seems to me to be hypocritical of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> to get up and talk of the great courage which he possesses, and of the political cowardice of other people, when he made no attempt to institute a colour line instead of the education test when he had an opportunity. Believing, as I do, that it is. absolutely necessary, in pursuance of the White Australia policy, that certain defects in the existing legislation should be remedied, and that the remedy for those defects is contained in this amending measure, and knowing, as cannot be denied, that any alteration in the language test must be dis- cussed by Parliament before it has the force of law, I feel quite safe in voting for the Bill as it stands, and against <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart's</inline> amendment; at the same time indicating that I will support any proposal to make it absolutely clear that any suggested alteration of the language test must be distinctly brought under the notice of Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- On the contrary, I am going to prove my statement that it is not a mere assertion. I shall do that by quotations which have come into my hand during the last half-hour, upon opening files of the English newspapers. The correspondence with the Japanese Consul, and with Japanese people, part of which was quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford,</inline> shows clearly what the Japanese Government think of our law. It was said that in Japan there was a law which prevented emigration without the consent of the Government, and that, under the circumstances, Australia .need have no fear - that all that was wanted was that we should place Japan on a parity with European nations. I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> will bear me out that that was the contention in 1901, when this legislation was before the Commonwealth Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator is quite right, but that was the contention put forward. Iri the London <inline font-style="italic">Standard,</inline> of the 25th October last, there is an account, by the special correspondent of that newspaper, of a long interview with Viscount Hayashi, the Japanese representative in London. From that account, I take the following: - </para>

                    <para>He (Viscount Hayashi) suggested that Australia never had been in danger of an influx of Japanese immigrants. An Act was passed in Japan in 1896 and amended in 1901 for the regulation and control of Japanese emigration, and for the protection of Japanese emigrants. Under this Act it was provided that no Japanese might go abroad without first applying to the Government, in writing, for permission to do «o. His application had to be accompanied by a guarantee for the good conduct of the emigrant while abroad. So Australia really had nothing to fear, and Viscount Hayashi plainly indicated that she had nothing to fear now. </para>

                        <para>- Viscount Hayashi said most clearly that in return for legislation putting the Japanese on the same basis as European nations, the Japanese Government would legislate in such a way that no Japanese could come to Australia. That is what the Japanese wanted in 1901, and what they want now; and so far as we have evidence, the Japanese will be satisfied with nothing less. In the course of the interview, Viscount Hayashi went on to discuss the Australian Act, and the eduction test, and the report proceeded as follows: - </para>

                    <para>I asked Viscount Hayashi if he had had any reports concerning individual cases of attempts by Japanese emigrants to enter Australia o'n the basis of the present education test. The Viscount was not willing to discuss the point, but I gathered from a casual remark that Consular reports were to the effect that whether individual natives of Japan were able to pass the education test or not, the restrictions were enforced in such a way as effectively to prohibit the entrance of Japanese into Australia. </para>

                    SMITH (Western Australia). - I hope the amendment proposed by
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline>
                    will not be carried.- If I thought for a moment that the clause, as it stands, would not be quite as effective as the section in the original Act, I should not support it on any account. But, as has been pointed out, the sub-clause immediately following that under consideration clearly places it in the power of Parliament to prohibit any language test that both Houses do not approve ; and that leaves us in exactly our present position. Without the consent of both Houses, it is impossible for any Ministry to alter the present education test ; and I do not think that either House would agree to any change. In legislation of this kind, and in all legislation, I always place the interests of the Commonwealth first. But when an amendment is proposed, which I db not think in any way jeopardizes the interest of Australia, I deem it well to consider how far it meets with the wishes and desires of Great Britain. I am sure that 'it is not the wish of any honorable senator to unnecessarily embarrass the mother country in her world-wide responsibilities. We have been told by an honorable senator that unless we say directly what we want, we are cowards. I venture to think, however, that if we are unable to protect ourselves from the very Powers affected by our laws, but are content to leave our suzerain Power to bear the brunt of any dissatisfaction, there is no element of bravery or courage in our conduct; on the contrary-,, we show, in my opinion, a mean spirit if we create difficulties for the mother country, while obtaining no benefit whatever for ourselves. Great Britain has entered ' into an alliance with Japan; and although, as I elicited from the Government, there has been no direct communication expressing any desire on the part of Japan for an alteration in the present law, we know from official documents that Japan desires to be ranked amongst the' great Powers of the world. The proposal of the Government is to strike out the word "European," in order to meet the views of the Japanese people, and, though these regulations do not go forth to the world, our Statutes are published, and the Japanese people do not wish to see any distinction laid down in connexion with eligibility to enter the Commonwealth.

The Japanese Government has stated that they do not desire the people of that country to leave it, but we know that many of the Japanese do desire to leave Japan, and that they are to be found scattered throughout the Pacific and the Malay Peninsula. While the Japanese Government recognise our desire to keep out Japanese and other coloured races, and raise no objection to our determination, they ask us to give effect to it in an inoffensive manner, and not to class them generally with Asiatics and Africans.

                <para class="block">Japanese which we have heard this afternoon, but they are undoubtedly a powerful race, and we know that, so far as official acts are concerned, their desire is that they should not be- placed on a distinct plane from that on which we place the European Powers. We know that they are opposed to the existing Act, because it provides that the test shall be applied in a European language. If we delete the word "European," and' substitute for it the word "prescribed," no alteration in the existing system can bs made by regulation under the Bill, except by the consent of ' both Houses of the Parliament, and we shall attain exactly the same result as under the existing law, but in a manner which will not be offensive to the Japanese nation. If we could imagine the possibility of Great Britain ceasing to be a world Power, we should readily enough in such a case accept the amendment proposed in this Bill if we knew that Japan desired it. I do not agree with honorable senators who have said that we should be brave and fearless, and say exactly what we mean in this Bil), because we know that we should not be responsible for any ill-feeling or difficulty that might, as a consequence, be created between Japan and Great Britain, and should not have to suffer the consequences. That is not bravery, but a mere taking advantage of our position to carry legislation which we should not pass if we knew that we would be responsible for the consequences. Although I have had no conversation with Ministers on the subject, I believe that if this clause is altered in the way proposed - and though it is merely a sentimental clause, it is the vital clause of the measure - the Government will practically abandon the Bill. If that be the case, we shall lose the advantage of other provisions of the Bill, which it is desirable we should pass. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> pointed out last night what those advantages are. He showed that the responsibilities of owners of ships under this Bill will be so great that it will not pay them to bring coloured people to Australia. Under the existing law, the penalty imposed in such cases may be as low as £$, and if that were all they had to pay for each prohibited immigrant, it would actually pay shipping people to bring coloured immigrants to Australia. That is shown by the fact that under the capitation fees previously charged under the States Acts, these people were sometimes willing to pay as much as £100 to be allowed to come in. A decided advantage proposed by the Bill is to make the police capable of arresting individuals without a warrant. Another valuable provision is that under which the masters and owners of ships may be compelled to take coloured aliens back to the place from which they were brought. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> said this afternoon that a considerable number of coloured people are being introduced surreptitiously along our northern coast. From my own observations in the northern parts of Australia, I believe that many of these coloured people are being smuggled into the country by the owners of boats trading and fishing along our northern coast. </para>

Under this Bill, the regulation prescribing the language in which the test is to be imposed must receive the assent of both Houses of Parliament, and we shall, therefore, retain control of the form of the test, and the language in which it is to be applied. There is, therefore, no danger to our settled policy in passing this clause. If it is not carried, my personal opinion is that we shall lose the other valuable provisions of the Bill. </para>

The honorable senator has explained that it proposes to delete the word " European" from the principal Act, and substitute for it the ward " prescribed,." in order that we may have some regard to the susceptibilities of the Japanese. If that were so, I should be prepared to agree with the honorable senator, but I point out that the clause does nothing of the kind. In one part of the clause, it is proposed that the word "European" shall <inline font-style="italic">be</inline> deleted, and the word "prescribed" substituted for 'it in the principal Act, but in another part of the same clause the use of the word " European " is reaffirmed in these words - </para>

                        <para>- This is really an attempt on the part of this Parliament to emulate the ostrich. I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> is proposing a direct and straightforward method. I am going to support his amendment, because I prefer the di'rect and straightforward way to the indirect and misleading way. If the proposal were to delete " an European language," and substitute the Japanese, or any Asiatic language, I could understand it. But the object is, not to delete " an Euro- ( pean language," but, by a tortuous form of words, to do exactly what is now being clone. Believing, as I do, that the proper course is to say exactly what we mean, and to let Parliament next year prescribe anything it pleases, by regulation or resolu-» tion, it seems to me that the amendment should be adopted. </para>

                    (Tasmania). - I do not propose to vote for the amendment, because, although the Bill is absolutely insincere, and the Government appear to have changed their mind about it, it is one small step towards the position which some of us hope that the Government will eventually take up, and that is not to wound further than we can the susceptibilities of the Japanese nation. Suppose that we fell back upon European languages, we should leave in our law the very words of which the Japanese have complained. It is quis true, ais
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline>
                    says, that this clause, in one paragraph, takes the word " European " out of our law, and in another paragraph puts it back, but still it goes on to say that a language may be prescribed by a regulation which shall be laid upon the table of either House for a period of thirty days. I believe that if the Bill were passed in its present form the Japanese would be more irritated than ever. They would perceive that we had practically acceded to their arguments, and acknowledged that we had not been guided by the comity of nations.. And in view of recent events in the Far East, and the renewal of the Anglo-Japanese treaty, I believe that they would make representations to the British Government with regard to the Bill. It would then be for the Government of the Commonwealth to make up their minds as to what they would do.

                        <para>- Whether the Government would have the courage to prescribe the Japanese language, or to do anything, remains to be seen. But suppose that they had the courage to issue a regulation,; that would be one step towards the assumption of Ministerial responsibility. It would enable what some of us desire to be achieved with greater facility than would be the case if they had to frame a Bill for the Parliament to deal with practically as it pleased. On that ground alone I intend to oppose the amendment. I am not informed as to what might be done in another place if it were inserted ; but in view of the lateness of the session, it is very probable that the Bill would not be returned. I was rather struck by the remark of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> that, in his belief, the Japanese will be pleased with the measure. How he has come to that belief I do not know. If he had drafted the Bill, and had been conning over its provisions for months, I could have understood the remark, but, as a matter of fact, he has had little or nothing to do with its drafting. Practically it says to the Japanese in one provision, " We' admit all that you say, and we are going to alter the law," but in the next provision it says, "Although we admit all you say, and are pretending to alter the law, we intend to do nothing of the kind, but to keep the test exactly as it was for the present." Judging from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford's</inline> attitude when he spoke first, the term "for the present" means for all time, or as long as the Deakin Government are kept in office by the Labour Party. That is the kind of legislation which we are asked to pass to please the Japanese nation ! </para>

                        <para>- Here is more insincerity than ever ! The Bill was introduced with the idea of appeasing the Japanese nation ; but now the Minister has let the cat out of the bag, and admitted that its great object is to make the law more watertight than ever with regard to all those principles of which we approve. I believe that every senator approves of not allowing Japanese workers to come in and compete with our men, simply because they cannot assimilate with our race. I desire to carry out that object in a polite and proper way. I wish <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> to tell 'me if the Cabinet have considered whether they will include in the prescribed languages the Japanese language, because when the next paragraph is reached, I propose to test their sincerity on this point by moving the insertion of the words, " and the Japanese language." If that amendment be not carried, the Japanese will understand as plainly as possible whether the Government are sincere or insincere. In the Senate we have had a great many instances which stamp with insincerity every member of the Ministry in connexion with this matter. </para>

                <para class="block">The Acts Interpretation Act provides that, unless the contrary intention is shown, the singular shall be held to carry the meaning of the plural. In the preceding clause the words " fifty words in any prescribed language" are used. In this clause we speak of a regulation prescribing any language. It might be held that the intention was that one language only should be prescribed. In case there should be any doubt, it is as well to make it clear that the regulations may provide for more than one language. </para>

                    GOULD (New South Wales). - I wish to direct the attention of the Committee to the whole proviso relating to regulations prescribing the language. The regulations are required to be laid before both Houses of Parliament, in order that Parliament may say whether it approves of them or not. I put it to honorable senators that the whole question as to prescribing the language should be left to the Government, which is responsible to Parliament for its actions. Assume, for the sake of argument, that Ministers were to propose a regulation in which a certain language was prescribed, and that the object was to give certain people an opportunity to come into the country. It would be very inconvenient then to have a debate dealing with the particular question. In the case of treaties between two nations, the treaty is first entered into, and then the subject is reported to Parliament. If the Commonwealth Government were to prescribe the Japanese language, it would probably be after representations had' been made by the Japanese Government that it was desirable that such a thing should take place. Then there would be a debate in Parliament as to whether persons belonging to that nation should be allowed into the country or not. We should thus probably be getting ourselves into a worse 'position than would be the case if the whole matter were left to Ministers. Suppose Ministers prescribed a language that was not acceptable to Parliament. Parliament would then have an opportunity of ejecting the Government from office, and of thus bringing about an alteration. This is a matter in which the responsibility ought to be assumed by the Government, who ought not to try to shunt that responsibility on to Parliament.

                <para>The effect of this amendment would be that Parliament must approve of any regulation affecting the language. As the Bill stands, either House of Parliament has the power to disapprove. But no action might be taken in either House, through members not being aware that a regulation had been tabled. Very often regulations are not printed unless a specific motion is proposed to that effect. Naturally Ministers are not anxious that their regulations should be opposed. The result might be that honorable senators would not know that a regulation affecting the language test had been tabled. My amendment would make it absolutely certain that both Houses of the Parliament would give their imprimatur to a regulation, and that nothing would be done in a surreptitious manner. </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline>
                    asks us to do. If we are going to give the Government power to frame a regulation which will have the effect of law, what is the use of saying that that regulation shall not take effect until both Houses of Parliament ha.ve passed resolutions to say that it shall do so? I point out the inconsistency of such a course. We ought to make up our minds whether we are going to deal with this matter by regulation or not. If we are going to deal with it by regulation, what is the use of saying that Parliament alone can give a regulation the force of law? It is narrowing down the whole advantage which we are supposed to be giving to the Japanese nation by amending this Bill.

                            But the Minister must take care that we are not placed in the absurd position of passing a law in which there will be no language test whatever prescribed ; and that will be the result if we say that the language employed shall be that prescribed in a section of the Act which we have repealed. A short time ago we passed an Act providing that amending Acts and original Acts shall be embodied 'in one ; and, therefore, the section which we have repealed will not appear in the consolidated Act. I might have allowed this to pass, but I take it to be the duty of every honorable senator - even at the risk of being mistaken, to point out any dangers of the kind which he thinks exists.

The new clause provides that until some language has been prescribed under section 3 of the principal Act, as amended,,, any language authorized by section 3, before the commencement of this Act, shall be deemed to be a prescribed language. The danger to Which the honorable senator refers was foreseen by the draftsman, and is provided against.

                    would seem to be losing his sense of humour, in seeking to introduce a new clause of this kind. It amounts to much the same thing as if it were to provide that, until some language has been prescribed, " the language to be used is that which is spelled European." I have no objection to the omission of the remaining words of paragraph
                    <inline font-style="italic">a</inline>
                    as proposed, but between the passing of that amendment and the amendment to insert the new clause, I ask the Minister to consider whether it would not be much better, instead of using round-about phraseology, to simply provide that the language test shall be applied in an European language. The amendment proposed by
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline>
                    to make a direct provision of the kind was thrown out by a majority of six, and now we have submitted to us this long stream of words.

Is that not reducing parliamentary work to a farce ? A man must take up a repealed Act, which is no longer being printed, to find out what is meant, by a measure which we were told was introduced to make the law simple and capable of being clearly understood.

                    <para>Any persons under a contract or agreement to perform manual labour in the Commonwealth - are defined as prohibited immigrants unless they are exempted by the Minister for special skill, or to serve as part of the crew of a vessel engaged in the coasting trade in Australian waters under certain conditions. In a Bill which has been read a first time in the Senate, and which we will shortly discuss, provision is made for striking out paragraph <inline font-style="italic">g</inline> of section 3 of the principal Act altogether. If that is done there will be nothing in this Bill to make persons coming here under contract "prohibited immigrants." That, to my mind, is a very grave blot on the Bill. I explained on the second reading that I hold very strongly the opinion that no person of non-European races should be admitted into the Commonwealth under contract on any terms whatever. </para>

                        <para>- I propose to insert the amendment in this clause, with a view to deal with the question of the admission of non-European races. Later on, when we come to deal with the Contract Immigrants Hill, I shall propose an amendment in clause 2, adding after the words " Contract immigrant means an immigrant to Australia " the words " of European race or descent." If these amendments are carried, the effect will be that the Contract Immigrants Bill will be quoted in Europe, where I have no doubt it will be frequently alluded to as a Bill applying to European races only. That is my main point. I wish to avoid any allusion whatever in this Bill to non-European races. If non-European races are included in the Contract Immigrants Bill it will be just as much a fraud and a subterfuge as is the Bill with which we are now dealing, and the statement will be made in England that we have deliberately opened up Australia to contract labour of non-European races. We know that that is not our intention, and that the language test provided in this Bill will be used to prevent the entry of any persons of European race under contract. It will be impossible to explain that in Europe, and if the amendments I propose are not agreed to the Contract Immigrants Bill will be held up as a justification for the Transvaal Chinese Labour Bill. The statement will be made, and very properly made, that we in Australia have passed a Bill which authorizes the entry of Chinese, Japanese, and persons of other coloured races on more easy terms than those on which the Chinese are admitted into the Transvaal.

                        <para>- They are prohibited now under the language test; but the Minister has it in his power by neglecting to apply the language test, to exempt any contract labourers desiring to enter Australia. I admit that it is obvious that he would apply the language test under the subterfuge Act. If it is urged that my amendment will perpetuate the objection to racial distinction I claim that we have an extremely good precedent for making the distinction! in £His way. I have in my hand an Ordinance made law in the Transvaal on the nth February, 1904. It is the Act which the Conservative Government in England have taken very great credit for, and to which they gave their entire approbation and approval. I direct the attention of honorable senators to the definition of the term "labourer " in this Ordinance. It is - a male person belonging to a non-European race. These persons are admitted into the Transvaal only if they sign a certain agreement, which practically makes them slaves. I do not quote this as a justification for what they have done, but as a justification for our use of the term non-European races in a prohibitive sense in dealing with the question of contract labour. </para>

                        <para>- Ours is legislation not to admit them at all, even -under a slavery agreement. The distinction is that whilst a white labourer can be admitted into the Transvaal under any contract, a non-European labourer is denied admission to the Transvaal, unless he signs the slavery agreement. We propose to go further, and say that we shall not countenance the slavery, flogging, and other enormities perpetrated in the Transvaal, and sooner than do so, we shall not admit these people under contract at all. We are prepared to shut them out altogether rather than that they should be treated as they are in the Transvaal, where 36,000 or 40,000 of them are herded together in stockades. </para>

                    (South Australia Minister of Defence). - Is there any chance that any such enormities as those to which
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline>
                    has referred will ever be perpetrated in Australia? Honorable senators know that there is not. The first objection I take to the amendment is that paragraph
                    <inline font-style="italic">g</inline>
                    of section 3 of the principal Act read in conjunction with section 11 of that Act deals with contract labour. We have introduced a Bill dealing exclusively with contract labour, which repeals paragraph
                    <inline font-style="italic">g</inline>
                    of section 3 and section 11 of the principal Act, and substitutes contract labour provisions in their stead. If we are to make any provision in connexion with contract labour of the nature proposed by the honorable senator, the proper place in which to do it is not in this Bill, but in the Bill we have yet to consider dealing with the immigration of contract labour. I need' not argue the subject further.

                    (Western Australia). - The Minister begs the question. The principal Act deals with prohibited immigrants, and I propose that we should continue to have as a prohibited immigrant any person of a non-European race who comes in under contract. The Minister can then go on with his Bill dealing with contract labour, and it will provide for the terms upon which the Government propose that such people should be allowed to enter. That is well and good. But it does not deal, and never can deal, with the position of the man who is not going to lie allowed to come in on any terms. This provision is in the principal Act, and if it is amended as I suggest, it will be absolutely unnecessary in the other Bill to cut it out.

                    's amendment is worthy of discussion in the proper place, and at the proper time. But I am exceedingly sorry that in his second speech - no doubt nettled by the unfavorable attitude of the Minister - he should have spoiled his case by making what I think he will be sorry for, a rather unjustifiable attack on unnamed persons - I do not know who they are - who are desirous of getting a handle, or making use of something which is either in, or omitted from this Bill, to disfavour Australia in England. I do not say anything as to his remarks about

                    but I think it would have been very much wiser, if he wished to commend his amendment, not to make that kind of insinuation. I think it was unjust, as I believe he will admit. I quite agree with

                    The amendment is, as I have said, fairly worthy of consideration, but this is not the place or the time to consider it. I am not at all sure that it would not? come within the rule against making an amendment which is not relevant to the subject-matter of an amending Bill. We have on the file a Bill dealing with contract immigrants, and it is in relation to that Bill that this proposal should be discussed. I rather agree with what

                <para>It has been pointed out that in certain cases Chinamen who have been permitted to leave the Commonwealth have, upon their return, brought back their wives and families. The Minister has said th,t this permission has been abused, but at the same time he says that, in this paragraph, there is a provision which would enable the Government to suspend its operation. Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">n</inline> exempts - any person who satisfies an officer that he has formerly been domiciled in the Commonwealth, or in any colony which has become a State. </para>
                <para class="block">I am quite willing to see that paragraph repealed, because the law has been in force sufficiently long to afford to any persons who have been previously domiciled here an opportunity to return, if they wished. It is most undesirable, however, to have Chinese in the country if we are going to prevent them from having their wives and families with them. We all express a desire to keep our ra:e pure. The best plan to accomplish that object is to allow the Chinese to remain by themselves, and to bring in their wives and families, when they themselves have the right to enter. </para>

                    (Queensland).-! am opposed to the amendment, because, if it were carried, it might result in our allowing Chinese to come in wholesale. I know a case where a Chinaman who had lived in Australia for a number of years, and acquired a considerable amount of wealth C property, went back to China in order to bring out the wife and children whom he had left behind him there when he emigrated. On his return he brought back two wives and fifty-seven children, and the black-labour press of Northern Queensland gloried in the return of a Chinaman with his family capabilities, and said that all they wanted were a few men of that type to work their broad areas. I am sorry to have to express my belief that the women he brought out were his wives, and the fifty-seven children were his children.

I agree with Herbert Spencer that it is a crime against our race for an Englishman to go in for an admixture of that kind. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> would be the last man in the world to consent to a member of his family marrying a person of an inferior race. If the amendment were carried, it would enable these coloured aliens to go home and bring out women who were not their wives, and children who were not their children, and we should have no means of disproving their statement. I hope that the amendment will be rejected. </para>

Then, after the words " by this Act," I intend to propose that the words " shall come info force" be inserted. The object is to make the proposed new clause read as follows : - </para>

                        <para>- I shall be prepared to criticise the regulation when it is brought before the Senate. In the meantime, the original Act is to remain in force, so far as the use of an European language is concerned. The ultimate object and design of the Bill is to omit the provision with regard to the European language, and to permit a language to be prescribed by regulation. The European language has to remain only temporarily, for not longer, I should imagine, than six, seven, or nine months ; and under the circumstances, I submit that the clause is effective enough in its present form, and consistent with the general tenor of the Bill. </para>

                    because it is a plain, straightforward way of doing what we desire to do. In clause 3 as it stands we adopt a roundabout method and endeavour to hide with a mass of verbiage something which cannot be hidden. Every one knows that the language prescribed in the principal Act is an European language, and why not say so? There is more verbiage and useless redundancy about that clause than about any clause I ever saw, and it is absurd to place such a ridiculous proposal before sensible men. It will only serve to call attention to the fact that we are trying to humbug somebody, and probably humbug ourselves.

Everybody knows perfectly well that the education test is so administered that even the greatest scholar on earth could not gain admission to Australia if we desired to keep him out. The only objection I have heard to the proposal I now make is that some day there may be in Australia, not only a Minister, but a whole Government, who will fly in the face of the people of the Commonwealth and undo the White Australia policy. I cannot conceive public opinion so changing as to make such an event possible. If my amendment be carried the test will be so administered that an undesirable Japanese will be examined in an European language, and thus excluded. There is no reason why we should not do what the Japanese expect we shall do. and what the Prime Minister, I understand, commenced to do. </para>

                    <para>- The new clause which the Minister has moved has in it rather wide possibilities, in view of the fact that legislation that is desirable under this Bill is already, by the wording of the clauses, postponed and its operation delayed. It seems to me that under the proposed new clause there may be further and considerable delay in bringing the measure into operation. We have been told that it is desirable that the officers should have time to prepare for the administration of the Bill, but honorable senators must see that under this clause the Bill may be hung up for many months, and when it is at length proclaimed as in force the operation of clauses 3 and 6, the important clauses of the Bill, may from the nature of their wording be still further hung up for a considerable time, so that the promised legislation for which we have been looking may be delayed indefinitely. </para>

                    <para>. - As was pointed out by the Minister of Defence, in introducing the Bill, and by many other honorable senators on both sides, in speaking to the second reading, there are some very important provisions in this Bill, besides those contained in clauses 3 and 6. Provision is made for extending the liability of ship-owners for the maintenance of undesirable immigrants, and it is desirable that owners, agents, and charterers of ships should be informed of this alteration of the law. There are other provisions compelling ship-owners to take back to the ports from which they have brought them undesirable immigrants, in addition to those whom they are already liable to take back. In several ways the liability of ship-owners and charterers is extended, and agents of ship-owners resident outside the Commonwealth are brought under the operation of the law. Again, the police, as well as Customs officers, will be officers under this Bill, and it is desirable that they should be acquainted in the ordinary course with the nature of the duties which will devolve upon them. This cannot be done in a day, and the authorities of the Commonwealth cannot at present estimate what period of time must elapse before all concerned can become acquainted with their duties under this Bill. I can assure honorable senators that there is no intention on the part of the Government to delay the operation of this Bill. </para>

                    <para class="block">Immigration Restriction Act in any shape, but a measure dealing with immigrants who are under restriction; that is to say, men who come to Australia under contracts and restrictions of that sort. We do not by our laws exclude any desirable immigrant who comes to the Commonwealth free from any contract, unless he is a pauper, or diseased, or for some reason of that kind. We do, however, exclude certain people coming here under contract, and for certain reasons. So far as I know, no one has ever been excluded, or will be, in my opinion, for other than a justifiable cause. We may exclude a European who may be considered an undesirable immigrant, because he is a pauper, who would, if admitted, be an expense to the Commonwealth, or because he is diseased or suffers from some other disability of that kind. It may be said that very few people go to new countries under contract ; but in certain circumstances it is found that they do. Any honorable senator, who has read the history of the United States of America must know that at certain times, when there have been labour troubles in, that country, employers have introduced large numbers of persons in order to carry on their business, and to interfere with the labour in the country. To such an extent has that been carried on that the United States have had to pass laws To deal with the matter, and I believe I am correct in saying that at present no man can enter the United States under contract. I understand that they are now proposing to vary that legislation, in order to permit the entry of persons under conditions somewhat similar to those which we propose here. There are two provisions in the existing Immigration Restriction Act dealing with the entry of persons into the Commonwealth under contract. The first is to be found in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">g</inline> of section 3 of the Act under which it is provided that the term "prohibited immigrants " shall include - </para>

                    <para class="block">If men come out under contract, and are not approved by the Minister under paragraph <inline font-style="italic">g</inline> of clause 3, the contract is not enforceable. These are the only two provisions on the subject that we have in the principal Act. It will be recollected that soon after it came into operation we had some trouble. I was not in the Government when the case known as the "Six Hatters" occurred, but I know that a great deal more was made of it than was necessary or justifiable. The Government of the day were in no way responsible for what was then done. The six hatters could not have been allowed to enter under contract, unless the approval of the Minister had been obtained, and it could only be obtained in the case of workmen exempted by him for special skill required in Australia. All that he could do when the men admitted that they had come out under contract was to say, " You cannot land, because you are prohibited immigrants, and the man with whom you have contracted will have to supply information which will justify me in exempting you under the provisions of section 3." When the employer was able to give the information to the Minister - I have all the facts of the case here - of course, they were allowed to land, and there was no further trouble. It is now proposed to alter the Act in that regard. If honorable senators will refer to the Bill which has come from the other House, they will see in what directions it is proposed to vary its provisions. In the first place there is a definition of "contract immigrants," "employer." and " the Minister." It defines the Minister to mean - </para>

The Bill contains a provision to prevent their introduction at any time when the Minister may think fit. He has only to give notice, and he can stop the introduction of any persons under contract during a period of that sort. The Minister can only approve of a contract under certain conditions.

Of course he would have to obey the conditions imposed by the law, and the Minister could always put himself in instant communication with him by cablegram, so that no difficulty could arise. It would be absurd to suppose that a contract entered into in London with certain artisans would have to be sent out to Australia, to be approved, and returned to England. That is a kind of circumlocution which I do not think would work, or is intended. Of course I am speaking for myself, for I really do not know what the Minister intends to do in the circumstances. I should certainly think that some such course as I have suggested would be adopted. The second condition under which the Minister can approve of the terms of the contract is, if in his opinion - </para>

                    <para class="block">What paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> means is that if, in the opinion of the Minister, there is a difficulty in an employer obtaining in the Commonwealth a worker of at least equal skill and ability, then it shall not apply if the contract immigrant is a British subject. So far as British subjects are concerned, there will be no special difficulty in obtaining men under contract. This provision will not apply to continental people, but solely to our fellow-countrymen. It is one to which I think we might very well agree. Under ordinary circumstances, it will not interfere with any one. At a particular time there may be a dearth of employment, not very great, perhaps, and it will be possible for an employer who wants a few men to bring them out under contract. It may be taken for granted that he will not bring out men under contract if there is a plentiful supply of the labour which he requires available. It would be foolish for a man to go to the expense and trouble of entering into a contract with persons at the other end of the world, and bring them out, when he could obtain plenty of labour in his own immediate neighbourhood. It would only be done under special circumstances. Therefore, we say to people of our kith and kin, "You can come out to Australia under contract, even though in your own trade or calling there may be a number of men here who cannot find employment. We are not going to prevent you from coming out on that simple ground alone. But you cannot come out if a contract is made in contemplation of or with a view to affecting an industrial dispute. You must not come out when there is a strike or lock-out - when there is strife between employer and employed - for the purpose of possibly lowering wages." Again, they must not come out if, in the Minister's opinion - </para>

                    <para class="block">Our own countrymen cannot come out unless they come under conditions similar to those enjoyed by people of the same class in the Commonwealth. Then, subclause 3 says that the Minister shall approve the terms of the contract only - if, where the approval is sought after the contract is made, the contract contains a copy of this and the immediately preceding section and is expressed to be made subject thereto ; </para>
                    <para class="block">Before the man lands in the Commonwealth, a copy of the contract must be furnished to the Minister. This is done in order to make quite sure that contract immigrants shall not be allowed to come in, not merely when there is an industrial dispute, but even when there is the probability of an industrial dispute. We stop them from coming in, except in the case of British subjects, if there is a difficulty in the employers obtaining in the Commonwealth persons of at least equal skill and ability. We stop all from coming in if the remuneration and other terms and conditions of employment are not as advantageous to the contract immigrant as those current for similar workers here. Then it is provided that a copy of the contract must be submitted to the Minister for his approval. There are penalties attached to an infraction of the law. Clause 6 provides that if before the Minister - and that term includes any one authorized by him - approves the terms of the contract, the contract immigrant lands in Australia, it shall be absolutely void, and the contract immigrant shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding £5, and the employer to a penalty not exceeding £50.

Clause II provides that the measure is not to apply to domestic servants or personal attendants accompanying their employers to Australia. That is a necessary provision, because there has been trouble on one or two occasions simply through ordinary domestic servants coming into the Commonwealth with their employers, who have consequently been put to unnecessary expense; In one case trouble arose over a servant girl, and in one or two other cases men employed as personal servant's were affected. This, I think, is a very proper provision. I have" now explained the purpose of this Bill. It is, I think, an improvement upon our present Immigration Restriction Act. It' makes matters quite clear with regard to workmen whom it is desired to bring out under contract. It enables a person to bring out servants without any trouble, and it makes special provision in favour of our own countrymen, as against foreigners.
