                    <para class="block">I need hardly point out that party politics have no bearing on this matter at all. It is the initial step towards making one of the greatest, if not the greatest, deal ever made south of the equator. It is quite true that it may be some years before it comes about, but it is simply inevitable. The State owned railways of Australia, in which term, of course, I include Tasmania, are about 13,500 miles long, and cost£132,000,000. I mention that fact in passing in order to make it clear that it is a gigantic transaction which I am about to advocate. Prior to Federation, there was a good deal of talk upon this very subject. I, in common with a great many others, believed that the federation of the railways would follow closely upon the federation of the States. Nearly five years have elapsed since that event, but no step has been taken in that direction by any one of the five Governments of the Commonwealth, and it now rests with a private member of its Parliament to initiate the discussion on this great subject. </para>

                    <para class="block">That is perfectly, fair and right. That is all that was proposed by either of the Federal Conventions, and it is not quite clear to me that they could have gone , much further, notwithstanding the criticisms which have been levelled against their members by the press from time to time. I do not see how they could haw discussed all the details of such a transaction in an assemblage of the kind. This great subject seems to divide itself into four parts - first, whether we 'have the power to act ; secondly, will the transfer benefit the people of Australia; thirdly, in making the transfer what terms will be fair and just to the Commonwealth and the States alike ; and, fourthly, If the existing railways are transferred to the Commonwealth, who should construct future lines. I propose to point out a few of what appear to me to be the benefits which would arise from the transfer of the railways. Uniform methods would be introduced at once, that is to say, as speedily as they could be. In all matters relating to the traffic, locomotive, and maintenance branches, the practices are widely different, in the States- The minimum number of highly-paid officers would then be employed. I am sure that honorable members will agree with me that, although the traffic might expand, and employ thousands of additional workmen, still we might not require any more highly-paid officers. I think that that is a view any practical man would take. </para>

I am stating; my view as to what I think should be done in reference to railways. .The ne.xt point is that there would be a standardizing of the best type of engines and vehicles in Australia. The best types, selected not from one State, but from the various States, would be applied to the whole of our railways. There would also be uniform mileage rates under uniform conditions. The conditions themselves might vary, but under uniform conditions there would be uniform rates. That it not the case now. There ought to be no preferential rates as between States. </para>

Next, there would be no occasion for the appointment ofl an Inter-State Commission, in this connexion at all events. Generally speaking, the best points in railway management would be selected by the central board of management, or whatever other authority was appointed, and would be applied to all the States. Under present circumstances perhaps the managers of our railways look somewhat askance at improvements initiated in other States. Probably we should do the same ourselves if we occupied their positions. A man naturally seeks to magnify the service with which he is connected. Before I have done I shall be able to quote some strong authorities in favour of the course I am advocating. The Railways Commissioners of New South Wales, in a report issued as far back as 30th June, 1899, made reference to the value of Inter-State railway conferences. I am quoting; this to show that railway federation is coming of its own accord. The Commissioners said : - </para>

                        <para>The desirable arrangement of holding annual intercolonial railway conferences for the interchange of ideas on railway matters was brought into active operation by a meeting of the Railways Commissioners of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, and Queensland at Sydney on the 14th September, 1898. The result of the first meeting has demonstrated their value, and the advantage of holding them regularly will, it is anticipated, be appreciable. These conferences have already done much to bring about uniformity of practice, and vexed questions have been readily disposed of, and as the railway interests of the colonies become more united, the great advantage to be derived from this intercourse will be fully realized. The conferences are preceded by meetings of the principal officers, at which the details of approved subjects for discussion are thoroughly investigated, and subsequently dealt with at the Commissioners Conference. </para>

                            <para>- Of course, under what I am advocating, there would be a central authority, and therefore there would be no need for the railway officers of the States to go from place to place holding conferences. A conference of the kind was held in this very city only a month or so ago. I saw the traffic managers of New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia in the gallery one evening at the time. Under the system which I advocate, all the best brains in Australia would be selected by the head managers, and applied to the working of the railways of the Commonwealth. </para>

One important reform to which effect has been given in New South Wales, and from which that State has derived considerable benefit, has been the easing -of grades and the straightening of curves on railways. When we realize the benefits that have accrued from this reform we may wonder why it has not been pursued in other States. I shall Be able to show why. It is not so easy as it looks, when a proposal of the kind has to be brought before a State Parliament, to secure the expenditure of a considerable sum of money for the purpose. To make clear the value of such alterations I will read an extract from a letter showing what has been done in New South Wales. The same could, of course, be done in Victoria.

The letter which I have quoted was written to me by my respected friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fehon,</inline> in reply to a letter of mine at the beginning of 3900. At that time I had it in mind to collect such data as I thought would convince the Parliament of Victoria that it would be a good thing to spend one or two million pounds in easing grades and reducing curves. But, unfortunately, an election happened, and my constituents put me out of Parliament, so that I had no opportunity to proceed with the proposition. </para>

                            <para>- I think that is so, and I believe that money well spent in any other State in the same direction would secure similar results. It may appear to be a curious thing that I should maintain that a State could not do this work as well as a Federation. My reason is this : It would be necessary to state the grounds for such a proposal to a House of Parliament so that it could be understood, and for that purpose to have the chief railway officers- in the House, in order that they might enter, into figures and explain technical details. The mere reading of reports, without having some one in authority to back them up, would have very little effect. If a Government brought down a proposal to spend, say, ^1,000,000 in regrading and easing the curves of lines, they would at once be met with the criticism, "Oh, you want to spend a lot of money on railways that have already Len built, but we have no railway communication at all at Dead Horse Flat and Never Never Gully. . Why do you want to spend money on improving railways when we want new lines to bring our people nearer to civilization?" No matter if it could be shown by a practical man that this expenditure would return ^100,000 a year, or 10 per cent, on an outlay of 000,000, I have very grave doubts indeed whether any Government in Victoria could carry such a proposal through Parliament. But the same objection would not apply if a Federation were dealing with the matter, because the same local influences would not be brought to bear. </para>

                            <para>- That is so; but under Commonwealth control the Commissioners might have pushed the improvements much further than, they ventured to do under State control. I wish it to be distinctly understood that I am not in any degree reflecting upon the railway officers of Victoria. They thoroughly understand and are alive to the importance of grading. I happen to know, in fact, that they are well versed in these matters. But 1 am quite satisfied that the State Parliament would not look at such a proposal, though I am equally convinced that it would be a good thing for the country.. There would be an outcry raised against it, and people would not understand the question. In fact, it would be surrounded by such a mass of technicalities that the average lav-man could not be expected to understand it. The diversity of gauges in Australia has been referred to. Of course, that has been a great drawback to the working of the railways in this country. As honorable senators are aware, there are three gauges between Brisbane and Adelaide. In Queensland there is a 3 ft. 6 in. gauge ; and in New South Wales a 4 ft. 8£ in. gauge, which is known as the standard gauge, and is adopted on 80 per cent, of the- railways of the world. I may remark that that gauge was fixed by a working man, George Stephenson. Then in Victoria and South Australia we have a 5 ft. 3 in. gauge. Those differing gauges would be very awkward in time of war. It would be a wise thing from that point of view to have a uniform gauge throughout Australia. If troops had to be taken hurriedly from Adelaide to Brisbane, the horses and men would have to be transhipped twice before they reached their destination. It is quite' true that the operation would not take very long, but what would be a great deal worse would Le the difficulty of maintaining a regular train service under circumstances of excitement. But a still worse feature is that hundreds of vehicles, together with a large body of troops, might be unable to proceed further than Wallangarra, while the northern capital was in deadly peril. Supposing Sydney and Newcastle were Doth threatened at one time, the New South Wales Government would only have the engines and vehicles of that State to convey troops; and with the border in the north about 400 miles from Newcastle, and the border in the south about the same distance from Sydney, the chances are that the strain on the rolling-stock would cause a breakdown, or some other mishap, My object is now to show that in time of war it would be most desirable to have a uniform gauge. One of the strongest arguments used in favour of a uniform gauge throughout Great Britain was that it would facilitate the movements of troops and equipment from point to point in case of war. </para>

The obstacles to the quick movement of troops between Adelaide and Brisbane were not reckoned with when the railways in the eastern States were built. It was then thought that the railways would be useful for the purposes of defence, but each of the eastern States constructed its own lines, and did not ask assistance from any one ; and, of course, those railways are not as efficient as they would be with a uniform gauge. </para>

                            <para>- That may be so; but, generally speaking, the further north we get the sooner we find the wool clip and the grain ready for conveyance to port. With a uniform gauge throughout the Commonwealth, vehicles and engines could be sent where they were most required to cope with the rush, just as occurs now within the borders of each State ; and the time during which the produce of the mainland would have to be carried to port would, of course, be extended over a longer period than at the present time. Another point worth considering is that, with a uniform gauge and federated railways, the produce would' in all cases go to the nearest port, which, generally speaking, is the best for the producer. .There would be no difficulty about boundaries, and no question raised as to whether the produce ought to go by this or the other railway system, because the system would be one. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mathieson,</inline> late Railways Commissioner for Victoria, is regarded as an authority on railways ; and those people who have a habit of slandering Australia might just bear in mind that when the greatest railway company in the United Kingdom, which has a paid-up capital of £^182,000,000, required a manager, it did not select one in the United Kingdom but sent to Australia for the gentleman whom I have just mentioned. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mathieson</inline> now manages a railway system which cost £"50,000,000 more than the whole of the railway systems in Australia put together. </para>

                            <para>- It is taken from a report furnished bv <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mathieson</inline> in 1897, at the request of some member or members of the Federal Convention ; and what he said appears to me to te good common sense. This question of gauge is inseparably bound up, in my estimation, with the federalizing of the railways. Fifty-five years ago, before the first railways were begun in Australia, it was decided in Sydney - at that time Victoria, then known as Port Phillip, was part of New South Wales - that the railway gauge of Australia should be 5 feet 3 inches. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Eddy,</inline> the late very able Chief Railway Commissioner of New South Wales, revived the question about sixteen years ago, when he made a suggestion that the break of gauge should be transferred from Albury to Melbourne. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Eddy's</inline> proposal was that the 4ft. 8 1/2 in. gauge should be continued right on to Melbourne, and that all the branch lines in the north-eastern districts of Victoria should be converted to the same' gauge. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Eddy</inline> was kind enough to transfer the break' of gauge, with all its inconveniences, from his own Colony, and to suggest that the consequent alterations should be in Victoria.

                            <para>- I am not going into that question. I am merely pointing out now that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Eddy,</inline> one of our foremost railway men&gt; advocated this extension of a uniform gauge as a first step to the unification of gauges in Australia. I regard it as rather cool, however, that he should have made tha proposal he did, seeing that he represented the State which broke the agreement made at its own suggestion in 1850 - that was the agreement as to gauge between New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia. </para>

                            <para>- No; not at that time. Honorable senators need not think that T have the slightest feeling in this matter, because my only desire is to have the question discussed in the press and on the platform - discussed both in and out of Parliament. If the proposal is found to be hostile to the best interests of Australia, we need not go any further, but if it can be demonstrated to be for the benefit of the people, let us have the railways federated with a view to the adoption of a uniform gauge. I shall now quote from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coghlan,</inline> the free-trade statistician of New South Wales. </para>

                    <para>I may say that the engineer had then been changed - the company mentioned . . . altered their views on the gauge question, and applied to have the 4ft. -.Sim. gauge substituted for the 5ft. 3m. gauge, succeeded in repealing the Act, and in passing another, which made the narrower gauge imperative. This step was taken without the concurrence of the other States, and feeling ran very high in Victoria in consequence, as two of the railway companies in that State had already given large orders for rolling-stock on the 5ft. 3in. gauge. </para>
                    <para>I shall not go into these old matters further than to show that we in Victoria are quite aware who caused the break of gauge. I am not saying that on that account New South Wales should contribute any more than a fair proportion. I should like it to be understood that because they happen to have railways on the 4ft. 81/2in. gauge, the standard gauge of the world, they are not to receive any special advantage from that. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think that was the point at the time. I am not sure now that the 4ft. 81/2in. gauge, though it is the standard gauge of the world, is the best gauge to adopt. I admit that it answers very well, and that it is a little cheaper than the 5ft. 3in. gauge. It has been my desire to point out that New South Wales agreed upon a 5ft.3in. gauge by an Act passed by the Legislative Council of that State, and subsequently that Act was repealed without notice to other States interested. It is only right that I should point this out, so that when it is said that we want so much in Victoria, we may reply that we do not want anything on this ground. I admit that this is ancient history. In 1891, our <inline font-weight="bold">President, Sir Richard</inline> Baker, foresaw that it would be a good thing to have our railways on a uniform gauge, and he moved in the Convention, held in that year, that the Constitution should contain authority for - the altering of the gauge of any line of railway, and the establishing a uniform gauge in any State or State's. </para>

                    <para>It is fourteen years ago since the honorable and learned senator moved in that matter, and it is to be regretted that more notice was not then taken of the question, because about 2,600 miles of railways have since been laid on various gauges, and they will eventually have to be altered. </para>

If the motion moved in the Convention by our President had been carried, instead of being rejected, railway managers might have been induced to give more attention to the question. However, they did not take any action in the matter until seven or eight years later, when they met to discuss the question. </para>

The Senate represents the States, and we would see, if the States Governments did not - though I have no doubt they also would see it - that what <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton proposed was to take over from them their main trunk lines, which in nearly every case are their best paying lines - the king-posts, so to speak, of their railway systems. In order that produce from the interior of any of the States may reach the seaboard, generally speaking, it has to be taken some distance along one of the inter-State lines, and it is not at all likely that the States would hand over those lines to the </para>

                    <para>Commonwealth, and retain for themselves the lines which do not pay so well, and which in a great many cases do not pay at all. Even if there were no practical and technical difficulties in the way, it is not at all likely that any State would hand over its best-paying lines to the Commonwealth. We know perfectly well that if we had our inter-State lines on a 4 ft. 81/2 in. gauge at the present time, we should require to have a seventh Railway Department in Australia, where we already have six such Departments. There would be a Department required simply to manage and work the inter-State lines. That is ridiculous on the face of it. For the railway between here and Albury and between Albury and Sydney we should have to have two sets of offices, and two sets of running sheds. If the cross-country lines were built on the 5 ft. 3 in. gauge two sets of running sheds, repairing shops, and so on, would be required. Having said this, I shall show that some of the Engineers-in-Chief of our railways support the policy enunciated by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton. The members of the Engineers' Board who reported on the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta line, were very strong in support of that policy. In their report they say- </para>

I would, therefore, urge that, so far as the Victorian railways are concerned, there should not be any breaking up of the system which would involve this, and that the condition should be absolute that either the whole system, or no portion thereof, should be handed over by this State. </para>

                            <para>- I can assure the honorable senator that something is being done in this connexion with rolling-stock, though not with locomotives. In these two cases <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mathieson</inline> and the Railways Commissioners for New ' South Wales are managers and workers of railways open for traffic, while the gentlemen who reported on the construction or otherwise of the Western Australian railway were not managers or workers of railways open for traffic, but merely designers of railway works. Therefore, I prefer to take the opinion of the New South Wales Commissioners, supporting <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mathieson,</inline> rather than that of those who perhaps have never had anything to do with the working of traffic. They say, " Take the whole of the railways or none." It appears to me that any divided control would be a. mistake. The whole of the railways or none should be transferred to the Commonwealth, and the condition precedent to the undertaking of any construction, to the unification of the gauges, or to the working of even one line, should be the federalizing, of all State railways. </para>

                            <para>- Of course, we know that the States have the right to say no. I am only assuming that they are anxious and willing, like this Parliament, to do the best for the people of Australia. If it can be shown that it is the best thing to do, I do not know why the States Parliaments should not consent. But, of course, if that cannot be shown, we cannot expect them to give their consent. I desire t« make a few references to the financial aspect of the question. An attractive picture is painted by some amateur financial authorities. They say, "The railways cost £132,000,000.^ the interest on the capital is 3! per cent. ; go and buy up the debentures with the proceeds of Commonwealth debentures, bearing 3J per cent, interest, and save1/2 per cent. every year." That is easily talked about, but I do not know that it is very easily done, without the concurrence of the money-lender at home. I am not quite sure that he would agree under any circumstances, unless he was to come out on top. If any Australian financier entertains the idea of making a bargain of that kind, and coming out on top, the sooner he weans himself off the idea the better for his reputation as a financier, and for the pockets of the people of Australia, for I am quite sure that he would fail to realize his expectations. The railways have cost £1 32,000,000. Within the next twenty-one years that sum will have to be repaid. Of course, if the money-lender will lend us his money at1/2 per cent. cheaper, then, by the year 1926, but not before that year, we shall be saving£660,000 per annum. If the money-lender says, " I shall lend you the money at a much lower rate, because it will be secured upon the credit of six States, whereas if it were lent to one State there would be only that State to fall back upon," well and good. </para>

                            <para>- I have hardly come to that point yet. In 1844, when railways ware in their infancy, the British Parliament passed an Act, in which' it was provided that if a company were to be bought out, it should receive an amount equal to twenty-five years' purchase, to be calculated on the average of the annual divisible profits for the preceding three years, and if either party did not agree, it could resort to arbitration. Asimilar principle was adopted about twenty-five years ago by the Victorian Government, when it was buying out the railways from the Hobson's Bay Company ; but a twenty years' purchase was adopted, to be calculated on the average annual profit for the preceding three years. That method might be admissible in a case where the railway extension had reached its limits, or could be foreseen, as in the suburban radius here or in the old country, but it would not apply to the railway systems in Australia. Another method of dealing with the question may be described in this way - " We will fake 31/4 per cent. and capitalize it, and see what amount we should have to give for the railways in Australia." If we did that, we should be very far out on the last three years' divisible profits; that is to say, the amount left after working expenses had been paid. Under that method, the value of the railways would be only£7 5, 200.000 as against their cost of £132,000,000. </para>

                            <para>- Because the railways did not earn the money in that period. Any such method as that could not be recognised. Another method would be to have the lines valued by a board of experts. But that would be very cumbersome, tedious, and costly, causing a never-ending succession of disputes. I doubt whether we should ever reach finality in any such way, and I am quite certain that there is no one system of valuing which could be adopted. I cannot imagine any one plan which would apply to all the railway systems at the. one time, owing to the movements of population through the seasons, and even through railway extension. Do we not know that at any moment, in a partially developed country like this, rich mineral deposits may be discovered, as was the case in Western Australia, or that land previously believed to be valueless or nearly so, as in the case of the Mallee, in Victoria., might be found to be very fertile ? I recollect the time when it was said that the Darling Downs country in Queensland, would not grow anything but grass and sheep, but now for miles and miles we can see farms in every direction. Such local changes might convert a non-paying railway system into a good business concern in a very short time. No method that I can conceive of would be equally fair to all the States alike. So far as I am able to judge, the only method of valuing the railways would be to take them at cost price in all cases. </para>

                            <para>- I mean the cost price, as shown in the annual reports. Perhaps South Australia has a surplus, but with a bad season or two down will go the value of her railway assets at once. Let me show how awkward it would be to try to apply one plan. Suppose we said, " We will give you per cent, and capitalize that, South Australia would receive £86,000 less than the cost of her lines ; Victoria would receive £1,000,000 less than the cost of her lines; Tasmania would receive ,£2, 100,000 less than the cost of her lines ; New South Wales would receive £5,000,000 less than the cost of her lines; Queensland would get £[9,100,000 less than the cost of her lines; while Western Australia would get £1,100,000 more than the cost of her lines. Even if the States parted with their lines at cost price, they would not have very much cause to complain, because the values of private and public lands have been enhanced by the construction of railways to the extent of some hundreds of millions; that is their profit. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mathieson</inline> again went into the question.

                    <para class="block">I think that those who go into this question will agree wilh me that there is no way of dealing with the values. Apparently, some years ago the New South Wales railways were worth a great deal more than they are now. Last year they had a deficit of over £300, 000, but at one time they had a surplus. At one time Victoria had a deficit of half a million, but for the last two years, according to the annual reports, the accounts have balanced. There is another question to which I would direct attention, and that is : Who would construct railways in the future if the Commonwealth took over the existing lines? That is a very important question - one to which I heard a senator refer to-day. Of course, we know that we have power to accept the State-owned railways. A body which is working railways can construct lines at a cheaper rate than a body or corporation which has no railways at its command. The money could, I think, be got a little more cheaply by the Commonwealth than by a State. There would be no Customs duties to pay. </para>

                            <para>- My honorable friend is a little bit premature. I shall meet that point. The Commonwealth Government could not take over railways built by States for developmental purposes, except on special terms, because it is evident that, as the result of such construction, the people of a particular State would receive advantages in the form of enhanced value of property, public and private, whilst the other States would receive no advantage of the kind, and would have to pay the lion's share of the inevitable deficit. But it might be fairly argued by a member of a State Parliament, " Who is better able to judge whether a particular country railway should be constructed than the members of the Parliament of the State concerned?" </para>

                            <para>- And I am going to answer it. We in the Federal Parliament should no doubt say that the railways which we took over should be commercial lines; that is to say, that they should pay interest and working expenses. If the Federal Parliament decided to build a line it would be one from which a return would be expected almost from the commencement. This is, I admit, one of the most difficult aspects of the matter. But it appears to me that something of this kind might be done. To begin with, the Commonwealth Parliament, if it owned all the railways of the Commonwealth, would have the right to construct any line on its own initiative. But if a State Parliament said, " We want a line run to the Magpie and Stump, in the bush," the Commonwealth Parliament would say, " We cannot do that unless you transfer to the Commonwealth the whole of the land through which the line will pass." The State then would have to acquire the land and transfer it to the Commonwealth. In the next place, the Federal Parliament would have to be allowed to levy special rates upon the line if it so desired. That is the policy which has been pursued under the Railway Lands Acquisition Act in Victoria. </para>

                            <para>- Only the State Parliament should have the right to say whether a developmental line should be built. But the State Parliament would have to guarantee the Federal Government against any loss in the same way as a State Government guarantees the money-lender in London. Under the Victorian Act which I have mentioned, when an urban railway is constructed, if there is any doubt in the minds of the officers as to whether it will pay, the municipal councils through whose territory the line will run have to give a guarantee to the Government of 4 per cent, per annum for twenty years upon the money expended on land and compensation for severance. In the case of the Collingwood line, in Victoria, the guarantee came to £[70,000 or .£80,000. The Collingwood and other councils interested guaranteed 4 per cent, upon that sum for twenty years. In the case of Victorian country lines, all the land has to be handed over free of cost to the Government. </para>

                            <para>- I cannot say. I know that Collingwood tried to get out of it, as is always the case. But we should be in a different position from a State Parliament when it is dealing with a local council. I think it would be sufficient if a State were to guarantee us 3 1/4 per cent, of the 3 3/4  per cent., which is the average rate at which railway loans throughout Australia have been floated. The State would be amply repaid by the enhanced value of private and public land, and by the increased production that would follow from the construction of the railway. It would be just as free to order the building of any new lines, as it is now, by simply guaranteeing, the Commonwealth, instead of the British capitalist, a return for the outlay. The trend nowadays throughout the civilized world is in the direction of amalgamation. The London County Council, with its extended powers, is an example of that in England. In Victoria there is a Greater Melbourne scheme. In our President's State they are talking of a Greater Adelaide. The railway and tramway employes of Australia have amalgamated. In Great Britain railway companies have amalgamated. Small companies are being absorbed by large ones. I want to see the same process take place in Australia.

                            <para>- It is to be remembered that the railways in America are privately owned. President Roosevelt could h'ardly advocate the amalgamation of them. But the next best thing is the vesting of railways in a central 'authority, instead of placing them under the control of States. That is what I am contending for. My object is to focus control. By way of conclusion, I am going to outline what I conceive to be a true railway policy for Australia. I want to show what would follow from the federalizing of the railways.

                            <para>- I have it marked in red, which, to a railway man, means danger. But the real transcontinental railway, from Adelaide to Port Darwin, I have marked in blue, which means caution. In the first place, it appears to me that, if the railways are federated, the Northern Territory should be handed over to the Commonwealth Government at once, so that we, in the Federal Parliament, can control the people employed there. No doubt we shall be able to make good use of the Territory. Poor little South Australia, that I admire so much, is not able to spend money in development. The Commonwealth might. My suggestion is, in the first instance, that there should be a transcontinental line running from Adelaide to Port Darwin. There is a great deal to be said in favour of that proposition. I observe that that is about the only thing that I have said this afternoon which meets with the approbation of the Minister of Defence. He says " Hear, hear " vigorously, because the line would run through his State. He now thinks that I am a very sensible man, and know what I am talking about. Let .me point out the difference between the time that it would take correspondence to reach Great Britain by the route which I advocate as compared with the present route. By means of a line of steamers running from Port Darwin to Port Arthur, and touching at various ports <inline font-style="italic">en route,</inline> the whole of the eastern side of Asia would be tapped. We should be able to open up communication and develop new markets that would be enormously beneficial to Australia. Of course, this cannot be done in a day. A letter could easily be brought from London to Port Darwin in twenty days. I have set down twenty and a half days in my calculation. By means of this railway, which I have shown on the map, such a letter could be brought down to Adelaide, and it would reach there in twenty-five days "after it left London. At present the time is thirty-one days, so that there would be a gain of six days. I do not want to go into details unless honorable senators desire me to do so. From London to Perth at present occupies twenty-seven days, or about the same time that would be occupied, under the suggested scheme, in taking the Western Australian letters to Port Augusta and sending them over by ,the transcontinental line. . To Melbourne the gain would be almost exactly the same as in the case of Adelaide. Then as to Sydney, I suggest the construction of a line of 500 miles to connect Cobar with the transcontinental line at Beltana, and this would afford a saving in time of seven days fourteen hours. The Queensland mails would be conveyed by way of the Charleville line, and would reach! Brisbane in eight and a half days' less time than at present. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. I do not put these reasons forward as all that could be adduced in favour of the construction of these lines, but, at any rate, the matter is one which it is worth while to think over. The advantages which the land in that part of Australia offers, might afford some justification for the construction of the lines, and I do not see why the other States should not hand over territory to the Commonwealth if the railways were built. The whole 3,500 miles of railway would cost, roughly, £[20,000,000. We are accustomed to be very saving in these days, and when we talk about the expenditure of a few millions, we are apt to hold up our hands in horror. I can recollect the time, however, when £[20,000,000 for the construction of railways was spent in twelve and a half years in Victoria, where there were only 1,000,000 people to pay the interest. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator must have then had me "on a string." Then, strange to say, "the gap in the transcontinental line appears to be of exactly the same length as the proposed line to Western Australia, and as the map was prepared under the direction of the late C. Y. O'Connor, of Western Australia, I take it to be correct. I submit this rough, and perhaps crude, scheme, as showing in outline what may happen in future years if the railways are federalized. An expenditure of £[20,000,000 is not such a great amount for 3,500 miles of railway, if we take into account the large areas of land that would be transferred to the Commonwealth for the purposes of settlement. The day must come when railways will move in the direction shown on the map ; and all I desire to do now is to make out as good a case as possible for the federalizing of the railways. When the inevitable negotiations begin between the States and the Federal Parliament, they may be conducted much more smoothly if the central fact be borne in mind that the railways all belong to the people. </para>

                            <para>-- This is about the only time I have ever received any support or encouragement from my honorable colleague. The main question is whether it is best in the interests of the people that the railways of Australia should be managed by the officers of six different departments controlled by six Parliaments, or whether they should be controlled by one Railway Department subject to the people's servants in the Federal Parliament. Like other railway contractors, I am afraid that there is not much sentiment about me ; and  my only desire now is to ascertain what there is to be said against my proposal, so that I may have an opportunity, which I hope to have before the end of the session, to reply to objections. I know that in some quarters one objection raised will be that under Federal management the railways will cost a great deal more than, at present. It is true that Federation has in some instances not reached the ideal which was pictured ; but that happens in every walk of life when great changes are made. At any rate, it 'is rather premature for us to cry " stinking fish " - too early for us to say that the Commonwealth Parliament cannot do what is done by the States Parliaments - and, in my opinion, we could carry out this work much better than do the States Parliaments. The Commonwealth Parliament, like the States Parliaments, has made mistakes; but that is because we are all human. </para>

                            <para>- I do not regard members of the States Parliaments in the same light that the Minister of Defence apparently does. In my opinion there are amongst the members of the States Parliaments many who, if they believed that the federalizing of the railways would benefit the people as a whole, would consent to that step being taken to-morrow. The inference from- the interjection of the Minister of Defence is that the States Parliaments, who are in possession, would object to transfer the railways. </para>

                        <para>- I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles</inline> that this is a most important proposal. Before Federation was established, there were1 many who considered that the transfer of the railways to the central authority would be of advantage to the Commonwealth as a whole; and if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles</inline> had proved that to be the case, I am sure that we should have approved of the motion. But would the federalizing of the railways be to the benefit of the people? When Australia was divided into Colonies by the British Executive, it was done with the idea that a continent so large as this could be better developed by separate authorities than by one Government. </para>

                            <para>- Quite so; I am now speaking only of the principle on which the British Government .acted. I think that the division into Colonies was a very wise proceeding, recognising, as <inline font-style="italic">it</inline> did, the fact that each part of Australia has varying conditions, climatic and otherwise, which could be best taken advantage of bv people within a limited area. When we consider what the federalizing of the railways would mean, directly and indirectly, to the States who own them, we can see the wisdom of leaving these matters to the local powers. I shall speak of New) South Wales only, because I am best acquainted with that State, though my remarks, I have no doubt, will be applicable to each and all of the States. We recognise that railways are necessary to the proper development of the States, and that the local conditions vary. Tasmania, for instance, produces minerals and fruit </para>

                            <para>- It is only an admission that in certain circumstances, for purposes of defence, the use of the railways would be an advantage to the Commonwealth. The development of the territory of a State depends almost entirely on its railway system. If a new railway is advocated in any part of the State, it will be admitted that the State representatives of the district, who are acquainted with the nature of the country, and its mineral and agricultural resources, will be better able to decide whether or not such a railway should be constructed than would the Federal Parliament. The States representatives for the district would naturally also have a far better knowledge of its requirements than would members of this Parliament. That will apply in the case of all the States. I do not think, for instance, that representatives of Western Australia would consider it wise to hand over to the Federal Parliament, composed of representatives of the various States, the administration of the Western Australian railways, and the development of that State - because that is what it would amount to. If a railway were required in any particular district of the State, and a reduction of railway freights were suggested on any particular line for the advantage of local producers, I do not believe that representatives of Western Australia would be prepared to refer such questions to a central administration under the control of the Commonwealth Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- Western Australia is now asking for a railway which will connect that State with the other States of the Commonwealth, but she is doing that for a special purpose, and chiefly for the purpose of defence. I point out that under the Constitution, the Federal Executive has the power to use the railways of any of the States for that purpose without the passing of any motion of this kind. Western Australia has asked for a survey of the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway, but I venture to say that the representatives of that State will not assert that the people of Western Australia would agree to the Commonwealth taking over the railways of that State as a whole. </para>

                            <para>- I say that the people of New South Wales have, so far, seen no reason why they should give these extraordinary powers to the Commonwealth Parliament. Federation has not resulted as many of us thought it would, and 1 think every one will admit that, in the matter of administration, the government of the Commonwealth has been weak. Consider the reasons which actuated the Imperial Government in dividing this continent into Colonies? Have those reasons been effective, and has development of this continent taken place to such an extent that we are now in a position to go back to the original state of affairs when Australia was a continent under one Government? This proposal would practically have the lame effect as a proposal to bring all the railways in Europe, or all the railways in England, under one central control. I mav say that it is quite possible that in the' future the system of railway administration in vogue in America and in England mav be admitted to be of advantage here. There are many people who consider that freetrade in railways has done more than anything else to develop the United States. Granted that _ most of the early shareholders in United States railways have been ruined, and that the interest paid on those railways has not been satisfactory, no one who understands their working will deny that they have been, to a large extent, the means of the great development of that country. </para>

                            <para>- It was done, in the days gone by, to a very limited extent. I am endeavouring to show that, instead of centralizing the whole of our railway systems under the control of one administration, there are many railway experts who believe that the Australian railways will never be properly utilized for the development of the country until we have free-trade in railways here, as there is in America and England. It must not be supposed that private railway companies in these countries' have the power to do as they please. They are restricted by regulations and conditions affecting freights and running rights. The railways working to a centre from one direction are not permitted to injure those working to the same centre from other directions. They must obey regulations and conditions which prevent any action being taken by one company that would be inimical to the interests of another, or of the districts through which the railways of other companies run. I venture to say that no English railway expert would for a moment entertain the idea as a practical business proposal of working the whole of the railways of the Commonwealth from one centre. He would not agree that they could be so worked as advantageously as they are now worked by the States Governments, who recognise that the development of their States depends very largely on their railway administration. I believe that it will be a very long time before the people of New 'South Wales can be convinced that the administration of the railways of Australia by one central Federal authority would be of advantage to the people of the Commonwealth, as a whole. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles</inline> referred to the unification of gauge. I presume that we are all agreed that it would be advantageous if the railways in this country were built on a uniform gauge, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles</inline> has failed to convince me that the States Governments could not, if they pleased, adopt a uniform gauge at the present time just as easily as it could be adopted under Federal control. </para>

I cannot understand how my honorable friends opposite could possibly, entertain such an idea, because they have declared to all Australia that they do not intend on any consideration to raise further loans. How is this country to be developed by .railway construction if no more loans are to be raised? </para>

                            <para>- I am very pleased to hear that announcement. I think we can all pretty well agree to that policy, with certain limitations. I do not believe that the people of the States would consent for a moment to part with their railways. Take, for instance, the value which is attached to them. It is well known that "New South Wales could have sold her railways in the London market for an amount which would have covered her public debt. If the other States were in a. similar position the amount which would be required for the purchase of the State-owned railways would be an extraordinarily large one, and might for years to come prevent any interest being paid on the capital cost. </para>

If they were polled to-morrow, there would be an overwhelming vote against the Commonwealth taking over the railways. The States own the lands and the railways, and 'are not likely to give them up to the Commonwealth. The prosperity of the country depends upon production, which can be best assisted by the construction and good management of railways. There are still millions and millions of acres of land belonging to the States. The statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Outhwaite</inline> in England is absolutely untrue. In Queensland and in some of the other States there are untold millions of acres belonging to the Crown. </para>

                            <para>- I do not wish to weary the Senate. The land is developed by the use of the railways, and possibly its development will be assisted in the future by the utilization of the rivers, for there is ample water to serve our purposes. Assuming that the State-owned railways were taken over by the Commonwealth and paid for, probably they would be managed from a central department in Melbourne. It would be necessary to cross the sea to manage the Tasmanian railways. How could a huge central Department manage the several railways in Queensland which connect with the Government lines, the railways running north from Rockhampton for 400 or 600 miles, or the railways running north from Townsville for many miles? </para>

                            <para>- In saying that private lines are worked more economically than State railways, I do not reflect upon the State management. It is acknowledged throughout the world that any huge political Department cannot manage railways so well as private persons can. Private management will always be better than State management. In New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria, and, I think, South Australia, after a long experience of political management, the Parliaments were obliged, in order to secure economical and good management, to place the railways under semi-private management, namely, Commissioners. It is acknowledged by all men who are abreast with the times that the management of the lines by Commissioners is far and away better than was the political management. If the railways be not well managed it will take a lot of money to run them. In the first place, they are expected to cover the interest on the outlay and the working expenses. If the outlay is great, and the management is expensive, the producers cannot have cheap freights. The growers of wool, wheat, meat, and all other products, which are carried over the railways, have to pay freight, according to the cost of construction, as well as the cost of management. </para>

I can name a station in Victoria - the one at Maryborough - which has cost as much money as, perhaps, all the stations within a length of 500 miles in the United States or Canada. In those countries, for great distances, there are no stations. Passengers have to jump from the train to the ground. </para>

                            <para>- We have worked on the wrong principle in building our Australian railways. They should have been built on Canadian and United States lines. The English system is a very good one for England, and I have no doubt enables trains to run at a higher speed than the American system permits, but the bogie system, and other improvements adopted in America, would have suited our purpose better, lt would be impossible to develop this great country, with its enormous resources, if the whole of the railways were controlled by one authority. It often pays a State to build a line which is not expected to pay interest for years to come. The Commonwealth would not consider such facts. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles</inline> says that extensions could be made by the Commonwealth at the request of the States. But that would be a roundabout, rigmarole way of proceeding. How should we be able to deal with railway extension in the far west of Western Australia, or the far north of Queensland? No one Minister could master the whole of the details. Even in connexion with such public works as the Commonwealth now undertakes, we had the Minister of Defence admitting last evening that he knew nothing about some of the proposals. Of course, he could not be expected to know, and we do not blame him. The greater the area the greater the difficulty, and the less likely is a Minister to know the details. A further objection to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles'</inline> proposal is that the States are not inclined to extend greater powers to the Commonwealth. I vouch for that fact. There is a feeling of apprehension on the part of the people of all the States, so far as I know; I cannot speak for Western Australia. </para>

                            <para>- With reference to the question of gauges, the fault of the present system lies at the door of New South Wales. I admit that it would be a good thing to have a uniform gauge throughout Australia. But it would never pay. It would be cheaper to build the transcontinental line than to institute a uniform gauge. And there is no absolute necessity for it. </para>

                            <para>- Well, if there is to be a transcontinental line at all, that from Oodnadatta to Port Darwin is infinitely preferable to that from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie. But I hope that neither will be built for many a day. We 'cannot afford to saddle ourselves with millions of debt, from which we shall get no return. The difficulty with respect to gauges is often exaggerated. It has to be remembered that there is not much heavy traffic going across the border. The bulk of the heavy trade goes by boat between States, and wherever there is water communication inland, as there is upon some of the rivers, it will always successfully compete with railway traffic. Wool is being sent all the way from the north of New South Wales to Port Victor, at a great deal less than the cost of sending it by rail to be shipped at Port Melbourne or Williamstown. Wool from the Edward River can be taken by water to Port Victor, 1,200 miles for <inline font-style="italic">j£i</inline> or 25s. a ton. I could get it done for less, if I tried to cut things close; and the man who carries it makes a little fortune. One man who engaged in the trade. Captain Wilson, died worth thousands, though he started as a poor sailor boy on a Murray River boat. The States would not gain a penny from uniformity of gauge, and I am quite sure that they would not dream of consenting to such a proposition as that of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles.</inline></para>

                            <para>- In the first place, I think that the motion as worded is a very bald one. It is plain and unadorned. It lays down no conditions. In its present form, I could not support it. There is, however, one condition under which one could support the taking over of the railways of the States; and that is in connexion with the taking over of the debts of the States. It appears to me that it would be a business-like idea in taking over States debts to take over the assets which represent them. The greater part of the money owed bv Australia to foreign money-lenders has been borrowed to build railways. But a proposal to take over the railways of the States, irrespective of other considerations, is one to which I could be no party. I will give my reasons. Australia is a vast country, and the means of communication between State and State are at present so limited that I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> that it would be impossible for the Commonwealth Government to cater adequately for the wants of the people in respect of railway communication. </para>

                                <para>- There is a sense in which posts and telegraphs are different from the railways. Post and telegraph business is linked together all over the continent. But there is railway communication between only some States. It also has to be borne in mind that the railways are not only, nor are they chiefly, for the purpose of providing communication between States. Thm are chiefly for the purpose of opening up country, and providing facilities for commerce in every part of every State. Postal administration differs from that of railways in being in a very much larger sense, naturally a Federal service. The Post and Telegraph Department is not affected bv the artificial geographical boundaries, which, in consequence of the limitations imposed by the Constitution, have an effect on commerce and transport services. So many of the powers affecting business, production, and transport are retained to the States Parliaments, that to hand over the railways to the Commonwealth without, at the same time, extending the powers of the Commonwealth Parliament to deal with matters which have been specifically left to the States, would be like handing* over a shell, and keeping the kernel. Practically the power of the States is sovereign in connexion with land settlement, mining, and almost every other element of production. It would be an anomaly if the control of transport, which is one of the chief factors in production, were handed over to the central Government, while all the other powers affecting production remained with the States Governments. I am sure that the federalizing of the railways under such conditions would lead 10 considerable dissatisfaction. West tern Australia, for instance, possesses a railway system having its own centres, and separate organization, the object of which is to develop those portions of the State which present themselves as capable of development. The State Government have control of the lands, and open up areas which they consider suitable for settlement ; and to assist to that end railways are constructed in certain directions. Then, again, the State Government control mining, and with the object of developing the industry, railways are run through certain areas; they have also control of the Forestry Department, and cause railways to be diverted or constructed in certain districts in order to assist the forestry industry. That is what is done by a State which has control of these three great lines of production. </para>

                                <para>- I am casting no reflection on the Commonwealth Parliament, but simply recognising our limitations. It seems to me that the Parliament or Government which has the power to open up lands, and make certain conditions to induce settlement, ought to be best fitted to deal with the railway policy as affecting the development of a State. The same remark applies to the mining and the forestry industries. Let us look at the difficulty from another point of view. It has been determined, and, so far, the arrangement has not been disturbed that the expenditure of the Commonwealth shall be distributed on a <inline font-style="italic">-per</inline><inline font-style="italic">capita</inline> basis. Each of the States is at a different stage of development in regard to railway construction, and those States which are most backward, are naturally anxious, in the interests of land settlement, mining, and forestry, to carry out ai railway policy. If the control of the railways were handed over to the Commonwealth Parliament, the very fact that some of the States are in a backward state of railway development would have a tendency to hamper them, because the expenditure in those States would, as we saw in connexion with a Bill recently before us, be so disproportionate that honorable senators would feel impelled to oppose railway construction proposals, not on the ground that they were not legitimately needed to open up a particular district, but on the ground that more was being asked for in the case of one State than in the case of other States. </para>

                                <para>- I am making no complaint, but merely pointing out to honorable members the fact that disproportionate expenditure of the kind would cast into the scale a weight which might, perhaps, have the effect of determining whether or not a railway should be constructed. Instead, therefore, of the conclusion as to the construction of a railway being based on whether the line was necessary or not, the question would be determined largely by the fact that ai certain State's quota of <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> expenditure exceeded that of other States. </para>

                                <para>- If such conditions had been laid down in the case of the Post and Telegraph Department, Federation would not have been achieved. In my opinion the transfer of the railways at the present time would be a bar to development. The States Parliaments are best fitted to control the railways, simply because of the fact that they have control of the elements of production. The suggested alteration of gauges is of very serious import from a financial point of view, involving, as it does, an expenditure which is enough to stagger anybody. We must remember that an alteration of the gauge would not mean the carriage of a single additional ton of produce, or one more passenger. </para>

                                <para>- To make the alteration of gauges a condition of federalizing the railways is adding to the proposition a weight which could not be carried'. Engineers have dealt with this subject very gingerly, and there has not been the slightest disposition on the part of the States Governments to tackle the question in a practical manner. Many long years would be consumed in discussion before an arrangement was arrived at as to what should be the standard gauge, and who should pay the expense of the alterations. The Australian railways, as at present managed, compare more than favorably with railways in any other part of the world. It is necessary to say that, because some statements made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> might be held to infer that there is something in the administration of our railways of which' we need be ashamed. </para>

                                <para>- The history of the railways of America may be pleasant reading to the Vanderbilts and the Jay Goulds, but it is very unpleasant to the people who have been exploited and driven from their homes in the eastern States, and lately in the western States, by preferential rates, rebates, and other methods, which are familiar to all who have investigated this matter. With all their financial success, and the wonderful genius at the head of the concerns - and even with the additional advantages of a population of 80,000,000 people to cater for, as compared with 4,000,000 in Australia - the. American railways do not compare favorably in their financial returns with the Australian railways. </para>

                                <para>- Happily we need not contemplate those dangers in Australia, where the railways are the property of the people, and, I think, will remain so. There is no need to regard the Commonwealth and the States as opposing factors in the question, because the people, whether as a State or as a Commonwealth, already own the railways. It is not a question of change of ownership at all. If they are transferred to the Commonwealth, the same people will own them. </para>

                                <para>- It is a question of change of control. There is another matter to be borne in mind, and that is that the railway systems of some of the States of the Commonwealth ate paying a profit, whilst others are worked at a loss. The railway system of Victoria, for the first time for many years, paid a profit last year, and this year also they have paid. The railway system of New South Wales pays about interest and working expenditure. </para>

                                <para>- There can be no Strikes in Coolgardie, and the price of gold does not fluctuate as does the price of lead. The point I wish to make is that some of our railway systems are paying, whilst others are not paying. We might say to the people oT Western Australia, for instance, who have built a number of their railways out of revenue - "You are building railways out of revenue earned bv your existing railway system, and we wish you to- throw your railways into the pool;" but we should have to add - " We want you also to help to bear the loss on the Tasmanian railway system, and to remember that when you ask for a further development of your railway system, Tasmania being asked to share in the necessary expenditure, its representatives in Parliament and its people will probably be found fighting against you." </para>

                                <para>- I hope the honorable senator is a true prophet. I have stated the position, and I have referred to Western Australia only for the purpose of illustration. At the present time the people of that State are extending their railways, and are rapidly developing the resources of the State by that means. Their railways are returning a profit, and the proposed change would mean to them a handing over of the development of the State to people some of whom would be interested in keeping down expenditure on new railways, and would probably endeavour to block every attempt at further development. Knowing that their own State railways were not paying, they would object to be called upon to share in railway expenditure in other States. For these reasons, I feel that at the present juncture I cannot vote for such a motion. As I have said before, there is one contingency in which I could vote for it, and that is if it were proposed in connexion with the transfer of States debts, and the railways were taken over as assets to provide security to the Commonwealth for the States debts. </para>

                    <para>- Under the previous clause we have provided that where there are joint authors of a book the copyright shall be the property of those authors ; but under this clause it is proposed to provide that where a book is written in distinct parts by separate authors, each author shall be entitled to copyright in the portion written by him, as if it were a separate book. I should like the Minister in charge of the Bill to say what precedent there is for this clause, which proposes a very awkward form of copyright. In view of the amendment carried by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> on my amendment, fixing the period of copyright, honorable senators will see that this clause would give a different period of copyright for two parts of the same book. This is one of the disadvantages of not having a fixed period of copyright without any reference to a man's life, or to his life, plus seven years. Under this clause, we might have two or more copyrights in the same book expiring at different times. That would be very inconvenient, and it would destroy the value of the copyright. Perhaps <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> can show that there is some precedent for this provision. I intended to call attention to the difficulty arising also under clause 19, but that is not so obvious, nor is it very material. Clause 20, however, might cause a very great deal of trouble. </para>

                    <para>. - As the memorandum which has been circulated shows, this clause is taken from clause 9 of the British Copyright Bill. It is quite possible to have a book prepared in several parts, with distinct authors in respect of each part. There is something similar in the case of an encyclopaedia. There might be a work dealing with several branches of a particular subject, and one author might devote himself to the consideration of one of these branches, and another author to another. In such a case, copyright, in the portions of the work which would be separable, and might be published separately, could be vested in the persons particularly responsible for them, where the book clearly indicated that. Subsequently, it is proposed to make provision in the case of encyclopaedias, periodicals, and magazines for copyright to the authors of particular articles, and contributions of a literary character appearing in those publications. The criticism applied to this clause could be applied equally well to the proposal to give copyright in respect of articles contributed to magazines or periodicals. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir JOSIAH</inline>SYMON (South Australia). - When the honorable and learned senator says that the same criticism might be applied to the proposal to give copyright in respect of articles published in an encyclopaedia, he overlooks the fact that, in the case of an encyclopaedia, the proposal is to give the copyright to the proprietor or projector of the work, and not to the authors of articles contained in it. </para>

                        <para>- In that case, there is no copyright proposed in respect of individual articles, and for a very excellent reason. Clause 22 deals with the case of articles appearing in periodicals, which are on quite a different footing as compared with portions of the same book which are the work of different authors. The provision is safeguarded, as regards the publishers of a periodical, by a reservation to him, literally, of a two years' ownership of the right to publish an article. So that the difficulty does not arise there. This clause 20 is taken from a provision appearing in a draft Bill which, although it was considered some four or five years ago by the House of Lords,' was never dealt with by the House of Commons, and has had no legislative force given to it. This is, therefore, a purely experimental provision, and we should be very careful before we adopt a provision of this kind, under which we might have two or more different durations of copyright in respect of the same book. These new departures should be carefully scrutinized. Honorable senators must see that clause 20 will involve very great inconvenience, not merely to authors but to publishers, and also to those who may be charged with infringing the copyright in any portion of a book. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator PEARCE</inline>(Western Australia). - Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> of sub-clause 1 provides that copyright shall subsist for two years from the end of the year in which the article was first published. So that if, for valuable consideration, a person supplied an article to a periodical, the owner of that periodical would have an absolute copyright in the article for two years from the end of the year in which it was published. These articles are not in the same category as books. Although they would cease to have any value to the periodical, almost at the expiration of the year of publication, still they would have a value to the contributor if he could use them again in pamphlet or book form. What object can there be in giving copyright for such an extended term to the owner of the periodical, when in a short time it would practically cease to have any value? It will place a handicap on the contributor. I ask the Minister to consider whether the term could not be materially shortened with advantage without inflicting any hardship on the owner of the periodical. </para>

                        <para>- According to the English law, which operates unless it has been modified by Statute in any particular State, until the expiration of twenty-eight years, the author has no right to separately publish such an article. During that period the owner of the periodical can republish the article ; but, of course, his rights are circumscribed to this extent - that he cannot republish the article separately within the period except with the consent of the author. There is a period of twenty-eight years during which the rights of both parties are, to some extent, suspended. After the lapse of twenty-eight years, the author has the right to publish in a separate form ; the article reverts to him entirely for the balance of the term of copyright, and the owner of the periodical can in no way interfere with or derogate from that right. If the author reserves to himself- the right to publish the article separately, as he may do by an agreement at the time it was produced, he can exercise his right without prejudice to any rights which the owner of the periodical may, by agreement, have reserved to himself. Honorable senators will understand that this clause, like many others in the Bill, can only apply in the absence of an express agreement to the contrary. In other words, it will be competent for either the author, or the owner of the periodical, to vary this provision by an .express agreement. For valuable consideration, a man may contribute an article to a periodical, and the owner of the periodical may acquire the copyright therein for a certain period. That period may be a lengthy one, say twenty eight years, as in the case I referred to. Within that time, the author may have obtained some fame by reason of his works. In many instances, publishers have been known to republish the earlier works of men who had subsequently acquired fame. That has prejudiced very considerably the good name of such writers, and they are very anxious that their earlier efforts shall not appear when they are enjoying, perhaps, a well-deserved reputation. In many instances they think their reputation is liable to be besmirched by the republication of articles written by them many years before. We propose to limit the term, in the absence of any agreement to the contrary, to two years. Remembering that the provision is subject to any variation which may be determined upon by the author and the publisher, honorable senators will see that it is a very lib-.-rr:! advance upon the present' law, so far as authors are concerned. </para>

                    <para>- No doubt the Minister has given a very satisfactory explanation of the law as it is, and of the provision of the Bill which will enable an author and the proprietor of a magazine to come to an agreement, but he has not explained why the term should be two years rather than one year or twenty years. All he has said is that there is a law which compared to this measure is tyrannical. He has said nothing to justify the fixing of the period at two years. The mere fact that under the Bill it is competent for the author of an article to enter into an arrangement with its publisher does not affect the matter at all. Under the Bill, it will be quite competent for an author to sell either the right to publish the article once only, or the copyright in the article for the full term to which he is entitled. We should shape the Bill to meet the ordinary run of cases. If the period were reduced to one year, it would be much more likely to meet the ordinary requirements of those who write for the magazines than would a two-years' period. It seems to me that, after the lapse of some time, writers invariably desire to collect most of their articles for the purpose of republishing them in book form. Assuming that the period were fixed at twelve months, and that they wished to give the owner of the magazine a longer term, they could do so under the provisions of the measure. I believe that a period of one year would be much more workable, and would meet the convenience and requirements of writers and publishers much better than a period of two years. </para>

There has been no explanation given by the Minister as to why paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> should have been inserted. What the clause is dealing with is copyright in articles published in periodicals. If, for valuable consideration, a man writes an article for a periodical, he is given a COPYright. If that is so, why should we annex to that a disability preventing him from publishing next month his article in pamphlet form? I cannot understand why that limitation should ,be imposed, particularly as there is another copyright given to the publisher, who, however, is not entitled to publish the article in ' pamphlet form at all. This is the most misguided, topsy-turvy clause I ever saw. There are two copyrights given, one to the author of an article, with a disability attached, and' the other to the publisher of the article, with a- disability attached. I am not at all sure that there should be a copyright given to the paid author of an article in a periodical. </para>

There may be an exception, but, as a rule, there is no second edition of a periodical. The effect of the provision is ito bury the article for two years.

Sub-clause 2 deals with only the author of an article contributed for valuable consideration. Why should it not also apply to an author, who may present his article to the proprietor of a magazine, and receive no payment? Surely the latter is entitled to as much consideration as the former ! If any one is entitled to a preference it is the man who has not received any payment for his work. At any rate, he should be placed on absolutely the same footing as the other. It is well known that many prominent public men contribute to periodicals articles for which they are not paid, and do not expect to receive payment. They are entitled to have their rights safeguarded. I see no reason why we should discriminate between an author who is paid for his article and one who is not. Therefore, I suggest the omission of the words "for valuable consideration." </para>

                    <para>- I am inclined to think that the clause ought to stand, with a slight modification as to the term. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> has pointed out that the object of these clauses is to regulate the rights of parties where there is no agreement to the contrary. Take an article which has been contributed for valuable consideration. When a man has paid for an article which is to be published in his magazine, it would hardly do for the author, a few weeks after it had appeared, to republish it iri pamphlet form. The best plan is to lay down certain lines with regard to cases which are happening every day. I think that if a magazine proprietor has paid for an' article he should have the exclusive right to it for a few months. I suggest that it would be better to retain the clause, substituting six months for two years. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> that two years is too long. If a man contributes articles to various magazines in England and America, he may desire to republish them as a volume of essays, and it would be rather unfair to make him wait two years. Six months would be a fair period, and would give proper protection to the publisher. </para>

This matter of valuable consideration is the crux of the whole clause. In the first instance, an author is a person who is, <inline font-style="italic">prima facie,</inline> entitled to copyright in his work. As far back as 1824, in a case that came before the Courts in England, this question of valuable consideration was considered in connexion with a copyright case.

                        <para>- Yes ; and where a person designs and prepares a certain scheme of publication and other people are commissioned for valuable consideration to assist him with the product of their thought and research, it is obvious that the man who has commissioned the work is to some extent entitled to the material benefits of copyright in it. That is the principle upon which the law stands, and upon which this clause has been framed. The position at present is that an author in that case could not publish separately for a period of twenty-eight years. I am  reminded by a remark from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> that the author's remedy during the twenty-eight years is only against the proprietor of the periodical. So that if another person published the article separately during those twenty-eight years, the author would have no right of redress against that individual. The existing law is based upon this consideration - that where one commissions another to do work for money, and provides the particular means by which the work of the person who is so paid shall be submitted to the public, that proprietor of the publication is entitled to some of the material benefits of the copyright. Hitherto the period has been twenty-eight years. Now we propose to limit the proprietor's right of republishing to two years, and to say that he cannot republish in a separate form, but only in his magazine and in the form in which the article originally appeared. We are limiting the publisher's right to two years. </para>

                        <para>- We are not differentiating. We are making provision for the benefits of copyright to be distributed between the person who commissions an author to write an article and the person who writes it. The question of protecting a man who contributes an article gratis is a separate one, and I suggest that it should be provided for in a separate clause, to the effect that where an article is contributed gratuitously the author shall have an absolute copyright in it. But I do' think that in these cases of mixed rights, as I may call them, we ought to be careful to make proper provision for distributing the benefits between the owner of the periodical and the person who contributes an article for valuable consideration. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir JOSIAH</inline>SYMON (South Australia). - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> seems to think that opinions, like wine, improve with age. The recommendations of the British Royal Commission have Iain dormant for thirty years, and that fact shows that the proposals have not recommended themselves to the British Legislature, because, had a change been regarded as important, it would have been made long ago. I shall not press the amendment I suggested to eliminate this paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> of sub-clause 1. There may be a contract between the proprietor of a periodical and the author to publish the article in pamphlet form immediately after the periodical has appeared, and the striking out of the paragraph would have precisely the same effect. If it were not intended to preserve from republication the article for a certain time, that would also be the subject of an agreement between the proprietor and the author; so that it is really a case of six of one and half-a-dozen of the other. I hold, however, that six months is quite long enough to keep an article from republication in the absence of an agreement. </para>

                        <para>- Of course, the Commission did consider the evidence, but their recommendations have remained dormant for thirty years, and I do not see how any weight or value can be attached to them, seeing that they have never been acted upon by the Legislature. The period of twenty-eight years was the law for a. very long time, and I dare say that the valuable consideration for the article was, in fact, the purchase of the copyright. We now, like the British Royal Commission, do not desire to prescribe that length of time, but suggest that the price of the article shall merely be the reward for the publication in the magazine. It is almost, if not absolutely, unheard of for a magazine to be re-published. </para>

We shall thus afford an opportunity to the reading public to get acquainted with the article, and also an opportunity to the author to arrange with the proprietor that when the six months' period, or whatever is left of it, shall end, there shall be a re-publication in pamphlet form. The reading public have to be considered, and in the absence of an agreement an automatic period of six months is long enough. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator MILLEN</inline>(New South Wales).Senator Dobson seems to overlook one factor when he pins his faith to the recommendations of the British Royal Commission ; and that factor is the different conditions which prevailed then as compared with the conditions which prevail to-day. I assume that the object of giving the proprietor of a magazine a term of copyright in an article is to enable the magazine to reach its ordinary reader. I can conceive of no other reason, and I say that six months, with the improved facilities of steam-ship and rail-road communication, will be more effective to-day than was the period of two years when the British Royal Commission made their recommendations. Even in my own time I can remember, in the rural districts of England, magazines many months old going their round, whereas to-day a publication a month old is discarded. </para>

                    <para class="block">That the following new clause be inserted : - " 22A. The author of any article contributed without valuable consideration to and first published in a periodical, shall be entitled to copyright in the article as a separate work." </para>
                </quote>
                <para> <inline font-weight="bold">Senator DOBSON</inline> (Tasmania).- The objections which I am inclined to think might be raised to this clause are these. A well-known writer&gt; offering an article to the publisher of a periodical, would probably ask valuable consideration for it, but a comparatively unknown writer might regard the acceptance of an article by a publisher as an honour done him, and to some extent as a valuable consideration. So far from adding this clause to the Bill, I should be inclined to say that any reference to valuable consideration to an author of an article should find a place in the previous clause. The publisher of a periodical, by giving publicity to the writings of. an unknown man, might bring him into notoriety, and yet he would have no copyright in the article even for a week. I do not think the new clause should be accepted. </para>
                <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator KEATING</inline>(Tasmania- Honorary Minister). - As I previously indicated, I see no objection to the insertion of such a clause as that proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen.</inline> There is always some little trouble in connexion with copyright in articles contributed to periodicals and newspapers, for which valuable consideration is not given. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> is inclined to think that in some instances the publication itself of an article by an obscure person might be valuable consideration. There might be instances in which the writer of an article would look upon its publication as valuable consideration, but there is nothing in this clause to prevent him allowing the person publishing his article to acquire full copyright in it. The uncertainty which exists in the minds of some people as to the present law on this subject leads to what is considered in some quarters as a large measure of abuse. The proprietors of newspapers and periodicals often invite contributions, offering a certain award or prize for the best, and they reserve to themselves the right to publish even those which are unsuccessful. In that way, they obtain the product of the brains of other people without any adequate consideration, beyond the hope of reward, if they are successful in obtaining the promised prize. I do not think the clause will do any harm, and it will insure to those who do work of a valuable character the right to copyright in it unless they choose to part with that right. If there is to be any inclination to either side, it is desirable, I think, that we should incline more to the author than to the publisher. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator STANIFORTH</inline>SMITH.This motion gives the widest possible range for discussion, but it absolutely precludes us from giving expression to the general will of the Senate in concrete form. We have been compelled to discuss the question on a motion for adjournment, but I think it would have been better had the Government laid the scheme upon the table and initiated a discussion, as I think is usual, which would have enabled us to discuss the matter as we would discuss other questions, and would not have precluded us from carrying a motion. Because, while speakers may express diverse views, unless we carry a motion, it will be impossible for the Commissioner to know what opinion is held by the majority with regard to matters generally affecting his scheme. We must all admit - and I think that every speaker has so far admitted - that the task which confronted that officer was one of the very greatest difficulty. He was called upon to create absolute uniformity throughout the Public Service - a service previously governed by six different Acts, and an almost countless number of amending Acts. These Acts revealed varying practices, differing scales of remuneration, diverse district allowances, and a different system of bestowing increments. The difficulties I have enumerated were accentuated and complicated by the fact that the Constitution, in section 84, provides that public servants transferred from the States to the Commonwealth shall retain their existing rights. Undoubtedly this was a' stupendous task to perform, and we are not surprised to find that there are in the classification scheme certain anomalies and inconsistencies. It is the duty of honorable senators to point them out, and to a certain extent direct the Commissioner in connexion with anything which is operating unfairly towards the Public Service. While it was hoped and intended that his appointment" would do away with political influence, and allow promotion to a certain extent, at any rate, by juster methods than seniority, and introduce if possible a system of preferment by merit, it was not Intended in the slightest degree that the </para>
                    <para class="block">Commissioner should be beyond or above parliamentary control. In the debate on the Public Service Bill, speaker after speaker insisted that, while it was our desire to do away with political influence, there was no shadow of a suggestion that we should do away with parliamentary control. The Act states clearly the procedure. The Commissioner has to report to the Government, who are responsible to Parliament, and1 who have submitted to the Senate his classification scheme before they have come to a decision as to whether it shall be accepted or referred back to him. It has been said that the scheme has resulted in greater expense to the Commonwealth, and in higher salaries to public servants. A very superficial investigation of the scheme might lead one to suppose that that was correct. According to a return which, at my request, was prepared on ' the 3rd August last the total remuneration prior to the classification was £1,602,576, and the total increase as the result of the classification was ,£54,564. When the Minister of Home Affairs initiated the discussion 011 the scheme in another place, he stated that at the inauguration of the Federation there were 11,191 employes receiving a remuneration of 439,938; that on the 1st January, 1904, there were 11,661 employes receiving a remuneration of ,£1,578,861, or an increase of .£138,923, and that as a result of the appeals, the remuneration was increased by ,£4,215, and the district allowance bv .£1,555, making a further increase of ,£5,770. I have always held that the Public Service should be well remunerated. When I stood for election I promised my constituents that I would vote for a well-paid Public Service. I said it was the duty of the Federal Government, as perhaps the largest employer of labour in the Commonwealth, to set a good example in this regard, and that we should not set a bad example to State and private employers. From the figures I have quoted, it might be concluded that the Public Service has done very well out of the classification scheme, and that to make any alteration would be unfair to the great Australian public, who have to pay the salaries. My complaint is not so much with regard to the present salaries, because in that respect public servants have little to complain about. What I have to complain about is that the future opportunities for obtaining any increase of salary have been almost entirely destroyed by this scheme. Under the old system we had differential salaries, and, at any rate in Western Australia, a uniform allowance, irrespective of the nature of the work. Under the new system the Commissioner is providing for uniform salaries, with a differential allowance, calculated according to the salaries of the clerks and the geographical position in which they are employed. Therefore we must not let this increase blind us to the fact that the public servant is in an absolutely worse position as the result of the classification than he was in before Federation by reason of these increments being curtailed and the opportunities for advancement being so much smaller under our Public Service Act than under the States Acts. The whole position might be put in this way : It was necessary in the Act to level up the Public Service; therefore public servants in each State receive in the aggregate higher remuneration than they did before. It was like giving to the public servants a bonus and stopping all future dividends. We have given public servants an increase in salary, but we have virtually said, "You shall have very much smaller opportunities of increase than you previously had." So that really the position of a public servant is worse now than it was prior to Federation. Another point we must never forget in comparing the Public Service of the Commonwealth with that of the States is that its public officers have no pensions paid by the Commonwealth. They are forced by the Public Service Act to contribute so much to a fund in order to provide for themselves a pension when they attain a certain age. or an allowance if they become incapacitated. This has to be paid out of their salaries, and as it is not done in any of the States it imposes an obligation upon our public servants, which' must be taken into consideration when we are instituting any comparison. In the Public Service Act we decided that in the general division we would create a minimum wage of £110 per annum, practically <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> 2s. per week. We made no limitation as to <inline font-style="italic">thi</inline> maximum, but the Commissioner has stepped in and created one of practically <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> 12s. 6d. per week. It is only with extreme difficulty that a letter-carrier in the general division can attain to a salary of £138 a year, and therefore the Commissioner his established a maximum of practically <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> 12s. 6d. per week. It is almost impossible for the great majority of letter-carriers, or persons in a similar occupation, ever to attain to that salary. I think we should fix the maximum at <inline font-style="italic">£3</inline> per week - at least at £I 50 a year. The officers in the general division have great responsibilities. Often they have very difficult tasks to perform. In the proper sense of the term, theirs is skilled labour for which they should receive a fair remuneration. I would suggest that we should do away with the three grades of the general division, and allow the letter-carriers and others in that division to rise by annual increments to a maximum of <inline font-style="italic">r</inline> '50. In the clerical division we allow the officers to rise to _£i6o without grades; we should at least allow those in the general division to rise by increments to £[150, and do away with the three grades that are provided for in section 80. Whilst there are apparent opportunities for those in the clerical division to rise to the highest position, they are blocked by the classification. It insists upon the great majority of the telegraphists being relegated to the lowest division, and practically they have no opportunity to rise. At present two-thirds of the telegraph operators are in the fifth class. It would be, a fair thing to remove that congestion around the lowest rung of the ladder by providing that at least one-half should be in the fifth division, and one-half in the fourth, instead of the present proportions of two-thirds and one-third. Otherwise, the officers will have less opportunities of advancement than they had prior to Federation. I have, I think, shown that the public servants are worse off than they were before Federation, although they have received what I may call a bonus as the result of the levelling-up process, which has blinded members of Parliament to the fact that the future prospects of the officers are irreparably injured by this classifi-cation scheme. The female officers of the service have been treated bv the Commissioner in a manner totally opposed to the intentions of Parliament. The Acf: clearly lays down the broad principle of sex equality. The public servants, male and female, were to receive the same salary if they were doing similar work, and were possessed of equal capacity. But the whole intention of Parliament has been, reversed by the Commissioner in practically preventing any female officer from being employed in the clerical division. Whether they have passed the examination or not, they are all thrust into the general division, though they may be doing similar work to, and are equally competent with, men in the clerical division who are receiving higher remuneration. The promotion of female public servants has been absolutely blocked. Positions in the fifth class have been advertised, female clerks qualified by examination) have applied and the vacancies have been filled exclusively by males. Female officers who have passed the clerical - entrance - examination, and the minimum wage examination, entitling them to be placed in the clerical division, have without exception been placed in the general division. That is an invidious distinction that was not intended by the Act, but has been initiated by the Commissioner. Now, I wish to say a word with regard to the appeal board. I was instrumental in having those boards provided for in the Public Service Act. There can be no doubt that they have not created that degree of satisfaction, and conferred such benefits as it was hoped they would. They have not been as effective as Parliament intended. But it must be remembered that the Senate had a big fight to secure appeal boards at all. On two occasions, I think, the proposal of the Senate carried at my instance was rejected by the House of Representatives, and only in a modified form was it restored and ultimately retained in the Act. The nature of the appeal boards has undoubtedly militated against their successful operation. Practically, an appeal board as at present constituted is a body that sits in judgment on itself. It consists of the inspector, the permanent head, and, some one elected by the officers of the service. The two former officers were, of course, largely instrumental in fixing the salaries and conditions against which appeals are made. They themselves are therefore called upon to adjudicate on their own work. It would be better if we had an appeal board composed of a representative of the Government and a representative of the employes, presided over by a stipendiary magistrate. </para>

                    <para>It might not be possible for a Judge to give sufficient time to the work. But either a stipendiary magistrate, a Judge, or some person in a judicial capacity, who is free from bias and has a capacity to weigh evidence, should sit on the board. The recommendations of the board are subject to the decision of the Commissioner, which is final. Such a tribunal as at present constituted is not likely to have made many alterations in the classification scheme that was formulated largely at the instigation of its members. But, in any case, the provision with regard to appeal boards had this advantage - that it insured that a public servant with a grievance had a right to appeal to Caesar. Not only that, but it enabled an aggrieved officer to give and call evidence, which had to be taken down and sent to the Commissioner, so that he might be able to know both sides of a case before he came to a decision. The object was to do away with social influence, which I insisted, when I proposed my amendment in the Public Service Bill, was almost, if not quite, as bad as political influence. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator STANIFORTH</inline>SMITH.It is quite impossible to do that, unless we secure the services of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy.</inline> We can, however, point out abuses that occur. While it is impossible for us to secure perfection, we can at least attempt to minimize evils that tend to spread to such an alarming extent in the service. It was unfortunate that the first test of the efficiency of the appeal boards was in relation to the myriad appeals against the classification scheme. It was almost physically impossible for the Commissioner to give individual attention to each case, to read the evidence, and to come to a decision. I know nothing about the matter personally, but he must have delegated the decisions to some of his clerks, or must have acted upon the recommendations made by the appeal boards. Consequently, the very factor that we hoped would be useful in doing away with unfairness in the working of departments has not been availed of to the extent we had hoped. There were 2,217 appeals lodged, of which 443 were allowed, and 1,774 were disallowed. It is also unfortunate that, as reported in the press, the Commissioner showed hostility to the creation of the appeal boards. It is reported that he said that the system was unworkable, and also that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne, then Minister of Home Affairs, said that he would have the appeal board section repealed. For these reasons the career of the board has been of a somewhat chequered nature. It has had a very severe trial. We can only hope that in future the system will be more effective. I am pleased to say that at least some good has been accomplished. In Western Australia, in the Department of Trade and Customs, four officers, and in the Post and Telegraph Department sixty-three, were benefited as the result of the system. In the matter of district allowances, one centre was raised from scale 2 to scale 3 ; twenty-three centres were raised from scale 3 to scale 4; fifteen were raised from scale 4 to scale5 ; four were raised from scale 5 to scale 6 ; three received a special allowance of <inline font-style="italic">£60</inline> each ; and in something like the same proportion officers in the other States were benefited. We can, therefore, rightly assume that if there had been no appeal boards there would have been hundreds of cases of injustice which would never have come before the Department, and would have remained until the present day. Indeed, I believe that many injustices remain now, which should have been rectified by the appeal boards ; but we, at least, can congratulate ourselves on the fact that some have been adjusted, which otherwise would never have received consideration. In the salaries established under the Public Service Act, absolute equality throughout the Commonwealth was rendered necessary by reason of the Constitution, in order to enable public servants to be transferred from one part of a State to another, and from State to State. This absolute equality was inaugurated irrespective of climatic conditions, of the isolation of some places, and of the discomforts inseparable from certain positions. As I have stated, this uniformity was obligatory under the Constitution, but it would undoubtedly be a cruel injustice if disabilities were not corrected by allowances attached to the districts in order to compensate officers for the disabilities I have mentioned. I venture to think that in the system of allowances a grave mistake has been made by the Commissioner. Instead of adopting fixed allowances, according to locality, the Commissioner has adopted percentage allowances, modified by locality. He has computed the allowances partly from the geographical position in which the public servant is placed, and partly on the amount of the salary ; and I say that that is wrong in principle. We grade salaries according to the ability of the individual and the importance of the position and the responsibilities; and in that, I think, we have adopted a right policy. But these factors in no way exist when we consider the question of allowances. Isolation, discomfort, and increased cost of living press as heavily on the official drawing <inline font-style="italic">£100</inline> a year, as on the official receiving £500 a year. There is only one method which can be adopted in a spirit of absolute fairness, and that is to say that locality alone shall determine the amount of compensation. If a man, in receipt of <inline font-style="italic">£100</inline> a year is stationed at a place like Belladonia, Eucla, Wyndham, or Derby, in Western Australia, he ought, on the grounds I have stated, to receive the same allowance as a man who is paid a much higher salary. This is not a question of merit but of discomfort and expense ; and, therefore, the Commissioner, in my opinion, was wrong in making a compromise, and holding that locality should have a certain weight, and salary a certain weight. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator STANIFORTH</inline>SMITH.That is so. There is only one system of differentiation, irrespective of locality, which can be allowed with equity, and that is the differentiation between married and unmarried men. In the Western Australian Railway Department, married men receive an allowance of £50, and single men an allowance of £30 a year in inland towns. With that one exception, which may or may not be advisable, there should be no differentiation at all - locality should absolutely decide the amount of compensation. In bringing about uniformity of salaries, there was a general levelling up, and on account of the accrued rights of the public servants it would have been impossible to adopt any Other process. The public servants of Tasmania had their salaries increased to the extent of 18 per cent. ; in South Australia, 17 percent. ; in New South Wales, 11 per cent. ; in Victoria, 10 per cent. ; in Western Australia, 5 per cent. ; and Queensland, 4 per cent. It will be seen that the public servants of Western Australia and Queensland received the smallest increases, and if we ask ourselves why, in those States, the public servants previously received the higher salaries, we must come to the conclusion that the conditions of living were recognised by the States Governments. In other words, the higher salaries show that the conditions are worse, as, indeed, is admitted, in Western Australia and Queensland than in the other States. Now that the salaries are absolutely equalized, a much greater obligation is imposed on us to increase the allowances in those States. But the fact is that the allowances in Queensland and Western Australia have been in a great many cases largely reduced-, while in few, if any, instances has there been any increase. I contend that the allowances should be increased instead of reduced, if any semblance of fairness is to be meted out to those public servants who, under the Constitution, are entitled to retain all their rights and privileges. At an inter-State conference of letter-carriers, attended by representatives from all the States, the following resolution was passed : - </para>

                    <para class="block">Those resolutions are undoubtedly justified by the increased cost of living, which can be verified by a reference to newspaper advertisements in Western Australia, and to the price lists of commodities in the various States. I have here an extract from a newspaper, giving a comparison between the prices of goods in Adelaide and in Perth, based on what is required for a man and his wife for a week. The comparison is as follows : - Rent in Adelaide, 8s., as compared with 17s. 6d. in. Western Australia; meat, 7s., as compared with 13s. ; groceries, 8s., as compared with 11s. 6d. </para>

Poor public servants cannot afford to buy the choicest of the fruits of the earth, as doubtless the honorable senator does. Instead of this difference in the cost of living being recognised, the- allowances in Western Australia, and, I believe, in Queensland, have been actually reduced. I admit that there are places in Queensland where the disabilities are just as great as those experienced in Western Australia. The climate in the north of Western Australia and in the north of Queensland, with the accompanying discomforts, is about equal, and any claims I have made on behalf of the public servants in the western State, may be made with equal force for the public servants in the northern State. There is no doubt that Western Australia has benefited least by the classification scheme, or, to put it another way. has been injured most. The unfortunate public servants have been punished both ways. As I pointed out before, the public servants in Tasmania have had their salaries increased by 18 per cent. </para>

What I am pointing out is that Federation has benefited the public servants of every State more than it has the public servants of Western Australia, where the increase in the salaries amounts to only 5 per cent. In the latter State the public servants are also injured in the matter of allowances, which are lower than they were prior to Federation, so that, as I said, injury has been inflicted in both directions. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator confirms what I have said. Public servants in Western Australia have received less benefits under the classification, and they have been seriously injured by the reductions made in the allowances which they previously enjoyed. In the reclassification scheme as compared with the original classification scheme, of seventy towns in Western Australia, forty have been placed in a higher scale with respect to allowances, and thirty have been left as they were before. Civil servants employed in the towns which have been placed in the higher scale of allowances are now in receipt of allowances barely equal to those which they received prior to Federation, whilst those employed in the thirty towns which have been retained in the same scale as before, receive little more than half the amount in allowances that they received prior to Federation. These latter towns include inland centres like Kalgoorlie and Coolgardie, in which large staffs of public servants are employed. I say that in this Public Service Classification we are not carrying out the spirit and letter of section 84- of the Constitution, under which it was intended that all existing rights of civil servants should be maintained'. Whilst the level ling-up process, to . which I have referred, has practically resulted in bonuses to numbers of civil servants, so far as increments are concerned they are in an infinitely worse position than they were in before Federa-tion. When we come to consider allowances, we find that they are receiving very much less than they received prior to Federation.' The postal officials employed, at Brownhill, Boulder, Bulla Bulling, Coolgardie, Kalgoorlie, and Trafalgar (now Lake View) received ,£30 a year as allowances in addition to salary prior to Federation.. They are now receiving allowances according to the following scale : Those in receipt of a salary of £140 receive an allowance of £~i8 a year, or a little more than, half the allowance paid prior to Federation. Those receiving salaries up to £150 receive an allowance of £19 1 os., and there are very few in receipt of a higher salary. Those receiving salary up to £185 receive an allowance of <inline font-style="italic">£21</inline> 7s. 6d., and up to £210 an allowance of £23. In these towns, in which there are employed a large number of public servants, the allowances , paid have been reduced in some instances by nearly 50 per cent. Civil servants employed at Bardoc; Bonnievale, Broadarrow, Bulong, and Burbanks received an allowance of £30 a year prior to Federation. They are now in receipt of allowances computed as follows : - -Salary up to . £140, allowance £24 ; upto£160, allowance <inline font-style="italic">£26 ;</inline> up to <inline font-style="italic">£185,</inline> allowance £28 10s. ; and up to £210, allowance £3010s. In the case of Carnarvon, where public servants prior to Federation received an allowance of <inline font-style="italic">£40</inline> a year, they are now in receipt of allowances on the scale which I. have just referred to. </para>

                            <para>- To allowances to meet extra cost of living, and in consideration of isolation, and adverse conditions of employment. I am contending that these allowances should be computed simply according to locality, and that no other factor should be allowed to enter into the computation. I say that a clerk at Carnarvon receiving £100 a year should get exactly the same allowances as an offer in receipt of £500 a year at the same place, because the adverse conditions must be equally oppressive to each. There can be no question in this matter as in the case of fixing salaries, of payment according to the value of services rendered. In dealing with allowances a lump sum should be given, as in the State service of Western Australia, and also in the case of private employers, as I shall be able to show. The principle adopted by the Public Service Commissioner has been to give the man in receipt of the higher salary a higher allowance. He would appear to have followed the Scriptural injunction, " To whomsoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have abundance, but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away, even that which he hath." I propose to refer to the allowances paid to civil servants in the employ of the State Government of Western Australia in similar conditions. In the Education Department, each civil servant employed in the inland towns of the State receives an allowance of£30 per annum, irrespective of salary. In the Railway Department, married men receive an allowance of £50 per annum, and single men an allowance of <inline font-style="italic">£30.</inline> in the </para>

                            <para>- I do not approve of the principle, but under that regulation a man in receipt of <inline font-style="italic">£150a</inline> year salary would receive £30 a year as allowance. While I object to the principle adopted in the case of those departments, I admit that the allowance granted is on an exceedingly generous scale. In dealing with the allowances paid by private firms, I quote the associated banks, because they are large employers of clerical servants, and in the inland towns of Western Australia they pay each clerk an allowance of £50 per annum in addition to salary. I say that the Commonwealth Government has no right to so seriously reduce the allowances heretofore paid to civil servants in Western Australia or in any other Stale. The course adopted is an injustice to those who are immediately concerned ; but it is also an injustice to every wage-earner employed where these adverse conditions of employment obtain. The Commonwealth Government is, if not the largest, one of the largest employers of labour in Australia, and when they have taken this step the tendency will be for the States Governments to do the same thing. We know that the rate of wages is almost invariably fixed by those employing the largest number of hands. If a great mine in a certain locality pays a certain rate of wages it practically fixes the wages for the smaller mines around it. This applies to various other avocations. If the Commonwealth Government sets the example of altering the existing conditions obtaining on the Western Australian gold-fields, and of. reducing allowances fixed by officials who had an infinitely better knowledge of the conditions of employment in those places than any Commonwealth Public Service Commissioner could possibly have, there is great danger that private firms and employers will also reduce the allowances which they are now ' paying. What has been done under this classification scheme may have the effect of decreasing the difference between wages paid on the gold-fields of Western Australia and those paid in the Eastern States. If it is to be decided that the difference in cost of living, the disadvantage of isolation, and the other disabilities which have to be endured in remote parts of Western Australia, are to be estimated by an allowance pf 7s. 6d. a week - because that is what this proposal practically amounts to - we shall be creating a standard for private employers on the Western Australian gold-fields. At the present time clerical and manual labour is receiving in the inland towns of Western Australia practically 50 per cent, more than similar labour is paid in the Eastern States. We are under this classification scheme, saying that the difference should only be 7s. 6d. per week. By adopting such a course we shall be doing a very great injustice not only to our own public servants in outside districts, but to the employes of the State Government 'and of private firms in those districts. There is one other matter to which I should like to refer, and that is the transfer of civil servants. Great injustice has been done in the past by the fact that civil servants who have been able to exercise no influence, who have not had the benefit of a relation in a Department, or some powerful friend in the community, have been practically banished to some " Siberia " in the centre of Western Australia or on the northern coast. They have been left there until* they halve resigned or until their health has broken down, owing to the rigour of the climate. Cases have occurred in (which men who have been told that they must go to some of these places, have stated that they would resign rather than go into perpetual exile,, because they know what the conditions would be. When an officer has applied for a transfer the head qf the Department has said, "'I want you to go up to Broome, Derby. Wyndham, Eucla, or Balladonia to relieve so-and-so, who has been there for three or four years." The clerk refuses to go, and says that he prefers to resign, with the result that the unfortunate wretches already banished to those places are "kept there until their health is injured. In this way the greatest injustice has been done to many civil servants. As an illustration of many hundreds of cases, I can mention that of the postmaster of the town of Lawlers, which is almost in the centre of Western Australia: He went up there wilh his1 wife, eight, if not nine, years ago. He has several young children who have never seen the sea, who practically have never seen civilization. The doctor has told him that it is absolutely necessary for the health of his wife and children that he should have an extended holiday near the sea, or in some place where the conditions are better. Although I have been, I think, to every Minister up to the time when the Commissioner was appointed, and urged that the man should be transferred, still they have been unable to transfer him, because they said they could not get any one to take his place. If the Commissioner would lay it down as an absolute rule that in those places where the discomforts are great, no public servant should be compelled to stay more than three years, the whole difficulty would be got over, because a man would say, " I shall get a certain allowance a to ve my salary. I shall have to put in my three years, and take my turn with the others." That is a very different thing from saying *.n a man, " You shall go to this out of the way place, and we shall not say when you will be relieved, whether you will be there till you die, or until you resign." Unless such a rule as that be established, the greatest hardship will exist in the future, and the greatest injustice will be carried on in Western Australia. If a return were prepared to show the length of service that some of these men have done in tropical parts of Western Australia, and in parts where the discomforts are very great, where they see hardly a white face from one month's end to another, I think honorable senators would say that some provision should be made that public servants should not be compelled to stay more than three years in these out-of-the-way places. To sum up what I have said, I would say that female employes in the Civil Service possessing equal qualifications and aptitude, should be placed ki the same class and receive equal remuneration as male civil servants doing similar work ; that at least one-half of the total number of telegraphists should be in the fourth class; that the three grades in the general division should be abolished, and annual increments substituted up to at least <inline font-style="italic">£i$o</inline> ; that district allowances should be more in conformity with those previously allowed by the States, and should constitute a more equitable compensation for increased cost of living, isolation, and climatic conditions ; and that the appeal board provision should be amended so that there should be on each board one representative of the Government, and one of the civil servants, presided over by a stipendiary magistrate or Judge. It is impossible for me to move these propositions under the restricted conditions in which I am placed. I do not wish in any way to prevent discussion, but when the debate on this scheme is completed I shall embody the propositions in a notice of motion, which I shall move at a later date. </para>

                        <para>- On a previous occasion I spoke on the classification scheme generally ; but there is one phase in connexion with the Public Service which would have been raised tonight by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> if he had been well enough to attend. When he was last here he asked me, if he were absent when the scheme was discussed, to bring forward the question of the isolation of a small number of public servants in the Military Department. In that Department there are a number of clerks who have been practically cut off from the rest of the public servants and placed in a most invidious position as compared with other public officers. </para>

                            <para>- Whatever the reason for this isolation may be, I think there are sufficient grounds for altering the law. For instance, they are not considered eligible for transfer to other Departments under the Commonwealth when vacancies occur which they are competent to fill, although clerks in the Pay and Ordnance branches of the Military Department, and also clerks in the Rifle Club and Naval Offices, are so eligible for transfer and promotion. </para>

                            <para>- The clerical positions in the military service are restricted. No regulations exist as to when promotions or increments may be expected, if clerks perform their services satisfactorily. There is no board of appeal or feeling of security of position. Again, military clerks cannot aspire to the higher positions to which public officers in the clerical division of the Public Service naturally hope to aspire, as a reward for years of meritorious service. Moreover, through want of opportunity, they are prevented from rising in the military branch. They are not in the active forces, arid therefore have no opportunity of rising in the military branch of the Defence Department, or in the clerical branch of the Public Service. </para>

                            <para>- Yes; but, in view of their small number, it is manifest that the chances of promotion are practically nil. Under the present regulations, military clerks are subjected to periodical medical examinations, which are not required of the men in other branches of the Public Service. They are compulsorily retired at the age of fifty -five years, without a pension or superannuation allowance, whilst clerks in the other Departments serve on until they attain the age of sixty years, and in some cases sixty-five years. That seems to be very harsh treatment. </para>

                            <para>- That is so; but still, to retire a man at the age of fifty-five years, when practically he should be in his prime, seems a great hardship, because it is utterly impossible for him then to commence life afresh. If it is decided that the military clerks do not come under the provisions of section 33 of the Public Service Act, the Government should pass a short Bill to amend section 3 of the Defence Act, so as to bring them into the Public Service. I cannot understand any reasons being given for their present treatment. I believe that the reason given by Major-General Hutton was that there was some necessity for keeping military clerks under the control of military officers, because it might be necessary to court-martial them. Surely it could be laid down that if the military clerks broke any of the Public Service Regulations, the Commissioner should deal with them, and that if they broke any military regulations, they should be dealt with by court-martial, like the clerks in the Ordinance Department. I trust that the Minister will see if a remedy cannot be found for the position in which military clerks find themselves. </para>

                            <para>- I would suggest that the salaries of the Victorian officers be raised to the standard of the Western Australian officers. I do not see why a letter carrier should not be allowed to rise to at least £150 a year, which is only a fair and reasonable remuneration. I believe that the present limit is £138 a year, but I do not see why any deserving men should not have the opportunity to rise to a maximum of £150 or £156 per year. That is not a very large amount ; and a man is encouraged to do his duty when he knows that he is fairly paid. That was my experience as a large employer of men. I should be glad if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> will look into the matters I have mentioned. </para>

                            <para>- With a view to ascertaining the cost of living for the information of the Arbitration Court, we obtained! tradesmen's bills paid by small families, and sworn to as correct, which showed that, although in some seasons certain articles might be a little dearer, yet, taking the whole year round, the cost of living generally averaged from 18 to 33 per cent. more in Western Australia than in South Australia. The cost of living in Adelaide is higher than the cost of living in Sydney in a good season. Heaven knows that banks do not pay very liberal salaries at any time but we find that these institutions have so far recognised the necessity of paying their employes increased wages on the gold-fields that they will not allow a clerk to work there for less than £200 - a salary which would make some of the bank clerks in Melbourne envious, I should think - and they give a gold-field allowance of£50per annum. I hold in my hand records of the Arbitration Court, which disclose the cost of living and the disabilities under which the various descriptions of workers were employed and had to live. Let me quote some of the wages paid, for instance, at Gwalia,. a very thickly-populated place, which is connected by railway with Perth. I find" that surface labourers - pick and shovel men - get11s. 8d. per day; boiler cleaners and tool sharpeners, 15s. per day; tradesmen, mechanics, engine-drivers, amalgamators, mechanics' labourers, greasers, oilers, and cleaners, from 16s. to 16s. 8d. per day. </para>

                        <para>- Although we have the assurance of the Minister that any complaints and suggestions made by honorable senators will receive consideration at the hands of the Commissioner, it seems to me that he and his officers cannot, unless they plead guilty to incompetence, interfere with the classification scheme as amended. The Commissioner was appointed to classify the Public Service of the Commonwealth. He had "the assistance of inspectors and other officers. They completed their work. Due provision was made in the Act that public servants who were dissatisfied with the classification should have the right of appeal. A large number of them availed themselves of that right. Some appeals were allowed;- others were disallowed. Granting that in the first instance the Commissioner may have been mistaken in some particulars, he has now rectified his scheme, and he must insist that it is as near perfect as he can make it, and that to make further alterations, in deference to expressions of opinion by Parliament, would cause it to appear that he and his staff were not fit for the positions they occupy. For that reason, I think, it now remains for the Government to adopt the scheme, especially in justice to those who have successfully appealed. There is a considerable number of public servants in that position, and a large amount of back pay is due to them, in many cases covering periods of eighteen months. They cannot get that money until the classification scheme has been finally adopted, arid therefore injustice is done to them. The case of the letter-carriers has been referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> but as the Minister has promised that the <inline font-style="italic">Commissioner</inline> will consider their grievances, I need not refer to that branch of the service. I agree most heartily with those who hav? pointed out that the clerical division seems to have been treated very much' more generously than the general division. In The general division are men who have quite as much clerical ability as those in the clerical division, in addition to which they possess mechanical skill and general knowledge. But simply because they are engaged in work which is, in many instances, of f ar greater importance, and much more disagreeable, and involves greater integrity on the part of the officers than that performed by clerical officers, they have no chance of rising above a miserable £150 per annum. I indorse the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> as to the fact that in the classification scheme the Commissioner has absolutely ignored the principle laid down by the Federal Parliament, that women employed in the Public Service, provided they are doing the same kind of work, and are equal in capacity to men, should receive the same pay. There are postmistresses and women occupying other positions which are important and responsible, and which compare with positions held by men of a like character. But simply because they are women, their promotion is barred. Certainly they have good ground to complain cf their treatment. Some of them have unsuccessfully appealed against their classification. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith,</inline> however, made it appear that South Australian public servants have been generously treated in comparison with those of Western Australia. But there is a class of public servants in South Australia that has been very badly treated. I refer to postmasters. In the classification scheme a large number of very important post-offices are graded at ,£140 per annum. Many of them are at important places. Under State management they carried a very much higher salary, and officers of the service looked forward to secure these positions as promotion for good service. To illustrate what I say, I have taken half-a-dozen post-offices in the State of South Australia, and propose to mention the salaries paid by the State before Federation, the salaries suggested by a Classification Board appointed by the State some years ago to grade these offices, and the salaries proposed under the Commonwealth classification scheme. The half-a-dozen offices which I shall take are a fair example of the whole classification in South Australia. First of all, at Strathalbyn, an important town south of Adelaide, the salary and allowances paid by the State amounted to £340 ; the State .Classification Board fixed the salary at- .£291 ; the Commonwealth classification makes it £'240. The present occupant of the office receives .£210. At Renmark the salary under the State <inline font-style="italic">regime</inline> was ,£245 ; the State Classification Board proposed to make it ^260; the salary under the Commonwealth classification is ^144. At Petersburg under the State the salary of the postmaster was .£42° ; the State Classification Board proposed to leave it at that amount ; the Commonwealth classification proposes to cut it down to ,£257. At Kadina the State salary, with allowances, was ^370 ; the State Classification Board proposed .£355 ; the Commonwealth classification cuts the amount down to £234. At Mount Barker the State salary was .£340; the State Classification Board proposed to make it ,£350 ; the Commonwealth classification scheme makes it ^'89. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">There are similar instances throughout the classification scheme, the Commissioner having been most parsimonious in fixing the salaries of postmasters. In fact, they have been fixed so low that officers in the General Post Office in Adelaide, who at one time were anxious to secure country post-offices, and regarded the transfer as promotion, now prefer to remain in the General Post Office as subordinates rather than forfeit some amount of salary by taking country offices. For purposes of comparing payments at present made by private employers and even by the State, 1 will take Mount Barker, a town of which I know something, and which is a fair type. There are two branch banks there. The manager of one gets £320, with allowances, and the manager of the second receives £300. The inspector of stock, who is a State officer, receives £320 per annum; civ; schoolmaster £270; the" railway stationmaster <inline font-style="italic">£240;</inline> and the postmaster only <inline font-style="italic">£210,</inline> less <inline font-style="italic">£21</inline> rent. In a town which is large enough to pay the salaries of two bank managers and several officials, the postmaster receives a beggarly pittance of <inline font-style="italic">£i%9</inline> per annum. </para>

                            <para>- I quote those figures in order to compare payments in private employment with salaries paid by the Commonwealth. No encouragement whatever is given to good men to join the service. It should be the object of the Commonwealth to attract the very best men to do its work, and the only way to secure that end is to make something like a fair reward for services rendered. ' Looking through the figures prepared by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner, I notice that the Post and Telegraph Department of the Commonwealth, shows a very fair profit. In New South Wales and Victoria the profit is, I think, 10 per cent. ; in South) Australia it is over jo per cent. Surely a Department that can show such a profit can afford to pay its officers fair salaries. The Commonwealth has the services of well-tried and experienced men from the States' Public Services, to some of whom the transfer certainly did not mean promotion. In some cases, in order to obtain the same salary under Federal control, as was paid to them when in the employ of the State Government, they have been compelled to remove from the agreeable climate of the south to the much warmer and objectionable climate of the northern part of South Australia. To an officer of some years' standing, who has a family growing up, and has formed social and other connexions in a certain locality, it is a great hardship to be compelled to make such a move, in order to obtain the salary to which he is entitled by his length of service. I do not think that it is of any use prolonging this discussion. In justice to members of the Public Service to whom a large amount of back pay is due, this scheme should "Be finally dealt* with as early as possible. No doubt, cases of individual hardship will occur, but these may, later on, be disposed of by the Commissioner, or the appeal boards, and, although the scheme, generally speaking, is unsatisfactory, to alter it now, even if we had the power, would give rise to a great deal of trouble and difficulty. </para>

                            <para>- Whether the High Commissioner be elected by Parliament, or appointed by the Government, does not matter for the purpose of my argument. My contention is that it would be more satisfactory if the High Commissioner had some voice in the furtherance of any scheme that may be proposed, and in the selection of intending immigrants. That was my object in framing what I submit was a fair question, to which a clear answer might have been given. As I said before, Ido not charge the Minister of External Affairs with having intentionally made the answer obscure, but I think we ought to have some definite information on a matter which is of considerable importance to the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator might have read between the lines and realized the position. I am now telling the honorable senator exactly the view which I suppose the Prime Minister took. I may say that I have not conversed with the Prime Minister on the subject, and that I never saw the reply to the question until a few minutes before the Senate met. As I say, I read the answer as it was given to me, but I gathered what the situation was. The Government were asked, to say "yes" or "no" to a suggestion that we should stop all consideration of the immigration problem until a High Commissioner had been appointed, and had arrived in London. Had the answer been in the affirmative, and no Commissioner appointed, the Government would not have been able to utilize the services of the present Agents-General for the States in the promotion' of immigration. Therefore, the honorable senator received, I shall not say an evasive answer, but a sympathetic answer. </para>

We shall then be able to register our opinion by a vote, a course which' cannot be adopted under the present mode of discussion. </para>
