                    <para>- I rise_, sir, to ask your ruling as to whether it is constitutional for the Committee to consider Parts VH. and VIIA. in the schedule of amendments. The grounds, sir, on which I ask your ruling are, first, that all these new clauses are unconstitutional - that we have no power to enact them ; and, secondly, that none of the clauses come within the purview or the title of the Bill. The evidence which <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> shall adduce in support of my contention is of both an external and an internal character. The external evidence, of course, is as to the meaning of the phrase &#34; trade marks &#34; in the Constitution as understood throughout the British dominions for the last -half century. But the internal evidence is, I think, stronger, because it consists of the clauses themselves, which, I submit, do not deal with trade marks, or come within the scope of the Bill, and which, therefore, ought not to be considered. Our only possible authority  to legislate on this subject is contained in the Constitution. We are thrown back upon the definition and meaning of the phrase &#34;trade marks.&#34; We have no right to go outside the ordinary legal meaning of the term, and the moment we do, we most grossly infringe upon the rights of the States. I hold in my hand n. copy of the opinion of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cussen.</inline> who. after dealing with the principles on which the Constitution should be construed, says: - </para>

                <para>For the present purpose, and with reference to such an expression as &#34;Trade Marks,&#34; the true rule seems to be that you have to see what is the essence of the expression, and impose only such limitations as are necessary to preserve such essence. For example, in dealing with &#34; Marriage &#34; it would probably be held that the Parliament could not affect the principle that &#34; Marriage is the voluntary union of one man and one woman,&#34; though with regard to the forms and ceremonies of Marriage and the legal consequences of such union they would have practically unlimited discretion. </para>

                <para>The distinguishing character above referred to indicating ownership or origin or trade source may be the result either of a direct statement or representation, or by association of a mark with the article ; but it must be present or there is no trade mark. </para>
                <para>Such a mark has been aptly described as one&#39;s commercial signature, and the authorities seem to show that a trade mark really means a trader&#39;s mark. </para>
                <para>Another marked feature of a trade mark, as we understand it, is that it cannot exist apart from a business or the good-will thereof ; but it may be that this characteristic is not of the essence. </para>
                <para>Applying the above meaning it would seem to follow that a union label is not, and would not, be a trade mark, and therefore, that the Commonwealth Parliament has no power to deal with such a subject. I need hardly point out that the matter is not affected by the Bill using the expression &#34;Union Trade Mark&#34; instead of &#34; Trade Union Mark,&#34; as it does not matter what the Parliament calls a thing if it has no power to deal with it. </para>
                <para>A great many cases have been decided in the United States dealing with the question whether union labels are trade marks, and whether they are entitled to any protection. As these authorities may not be available, I have had extracts from them copied, and forwarded them as an appendix to this opinion. The result seems to be that union labels are not, and cannot be trade marks, but that just as a man&#39;s good-will, trade name, or trade mark will be protected, so the Courts will protect organized labour from any interference with their proprietary or quasi-proprietary right in their union label as affixed to goods. Such labels are held not to be trade marks for several reasons - </para>

            <para>I take it that the requirements mentioned in those paragraphs are not carried out by the union label clause now before the Committee. Every one of those paragraphs is taken from the decisions of Courts in America and England. Plain, authoritative decisions of that sort cannot be misunderstood, and the Senate ought to take notice of them. </para>
            <para>It should be remembered in reading these American cases that they, perhaps, go further than the English and Australian authorities in attributing a proprietary character to the rights arising from trade marks and analogous rights; but whether this be so or not, all the above-mentioned cases seem to agree in holding that these labels are not, and cannot be, trade marks, and that being so it does not seem to me of importance that the expansion of their law has provided in an analogous manner for the protection of rights which do not arise from trade marks. It could not be argued That under the head of Trade Marks the Commonwealth Parliament was given power to deal with good-will or trade names, and yet these also are protected in a similar manner. Besides, in England and Australia there has been no such expansion, and in neither place (and it must be remembered this is an Imperial Act) would any one in 1900 have thought of calling such labels trade marks. </para>

                        <para>- The Parliament of the Dominion of Canada has left the matter to the States. A grosser wrong to the States of this Commonwealth will never be committed than by the passing of this Bill. It will probably be a dead letter when it is passed, because I can see certain directions in which it will be unworkable. But to pass it at all will be to perpetrate a gross wrong. A few sessions ago it was in the mouth of every member of the Labour Party that it would be a good thing to induce the States to hand over to the Federal Parliament the management of the industrial life of this country. Do honorable senators think it likely that the States would agree to that? Now the Government and the Labour Party are making use of the term &#34;trade mark&#34; to inflict upon the States an industrial law which the Federal Parliament has no right whatever to pass. It would be logical to insert trade union label provisions in such a law as the Victorian Factories Act. But it finds no proper place in a Trade Marks Bill. Nothing could be more improper than to include these clauses in a Federal Act having no reference whatever to the regulation of the industrial life, in its general aspects, of any State. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cussen</inline> goes on to point out - </para>

                <para>In England, Australia, and America, statutes have been passed in which the expression &#34; trade mark &#34; occurs without any definition, and in these statutes the expression undoubtedly had the meaning I have given to it. There is not sufficient reason, to my mind, why it should not have the same meaning in the Constitution Act. </para>
                <para class="block">It is a matter of public knowledge that another place declined to insert a definition of &#34; trade marks &#34; in this Bill. Is it not plain that the other House declined to commit itself to a definition because there are parts of the Bill dealing with union labels that are not trade marks? </para>

                    has said1 that it is not right for the President or Chairman to say that these matters have nothing to do with the Senate or the Committee. 1&#39;he President or Chairman does not say that. The question whether a law is or is not constitutional has everything to do with the members of the Senate or the Committee, but the opinion of the .Chairman on such a matter is merely his own opinion, and, as stated in

                    <para>I conclude that the Cigarmakers&#39; International Union of America is neither a trader within the meaning of the common &#39;law nor within the purview of the Act of Congress. Not being a trader in any sense it can have no distinctive trade mark. Registration under such circumstances is not authorized by the Act of Congress, and, if made, confers no title, and gives no standing ground in a court of law or equity. </para>

                <para class="block">All these authorities are strictly to the point, and show that these clauses are not within the scope of the Bill. I come now to the internal evidence in the Bill itself. In Part VII. we have already altered the heading, &#34; Trade Union Marks &#34; to Workers&#39; Trade Marks &#34; - and I think that, perhaps, it would have been better to have taken this discussion then. But, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cussen</inline> points out, it does not matter what we call these provisions. The question is, have we the power to pass them, and, if we have, should they be included in this Bill? A union label placed on goods to inform purchasers that they have been made by workers under fair conditions - Australian labour conditions - cannot possibly be a trade mark. I point out that there is no occasion whatever to discriminate between workers&#39; trade marks and any other trade mark. Every person in the Commonwealth is entitled to have a trade mark if he pleases, and the word &#34; worker &#34; is used here merely &#34;to disguise the real object of this part of the Bill. I pass on to consider the word &#34;association,&#34; and the provision for associations working together. </para>

                        <para>- It has reference to the grossly inaccurate, unfair, and irrelevant interjections of honorable senators opposite. I cannot permit &#39;honorable senators of the Labour Party to pose before the Commonwealth as the only persons who desire what is just and fair. It is proposed that associations working together shall have the right to use the workers&#39; trade mark. That, in itself, is quite sufficient to show that it is not a trade mark, and that these clauses do not come within the scope of the Bill. Then it is provided1 that a workers&#39; trade mark shall not be capable of assignment. That also, is sufficient to show that it is not a trade mark. People have held property in trade marks for hundreds of years, and they have been sold over and over again for thousands of pounds, and yet what is styled a trade mark in this Bill is not to be assigned. We are not sent here to restrict the privileges of the people. These provisions profess to give persons the right to a workers&#39; trade mark, and they then take away the right of assignment, which is an essential characteristic of a trade mark. </para>

                        <para>- The provisions forbidding the assignment of the workers&#39; trade mark proves absolutely that it is not a trade mark, and is merely a union label. We are told that Parts III., IV., V., and VI. are not to apply in relation to workers&#39; trade marks. This means that the provisions of all the clauses in this Bill, from clause 15 to clause 72&#39;, inclusive, are not to apply in relation to these workers&#39; trade marks. I ask whether any person residing out of Australia, and taking up our Constitution and this Bill, could ever conceive that such clauses as these could find their way into a Trade Marks Bill. They are a series of contradictions of the essential character of a trade mark. They provide really for a union label, and not for a trade mark, with which alone we can deal in this measure. I should like to refer, for a moment, to Part VIIa., dealing with &#34; the Commonwealth Trade Mark.&#34; This is a most extraordinary piece of legislation. I ask honorable senators to imagine the merchants of Great Britain, the foremost men of their time, being told that there was to be &#34;a Great Britain Trade Mark.&#34; Imagine such a thing as a &#34; Great Britain Trade Mark &#34; ! That is the sort of legislation to which we are asked to consent, but which we ask you, sir, to decide does not come within the scope of the Bill. It is a gross interference with the industrial life of all the States. </para>

                        <para>- This ought to be part of the industrial law, the intention being to show that goods1 are made under fair conditions. The most extraordinary feature of the proposal is that the Commonwealth is to be made the owner of the trade mark, and that the permission of the Minister must be obtained before it can be used. How can such a mark be a trade mark within the meaning of the Constitution ? </para>

                        <para>- Quite so. The Minister is to be the judge as to whether a person shall have the use of the trade mark, and resolutions have to be passed as to whether the remuneration of the labour is fair. If, for instance, the Tasmanian Government were to institute Wages Boards, and, not being a wealthy State, fixed wages a little lower than the rates that prevail elsewhere in the Commonwealth, the Labour Party on the mainland might object, and as to the use of the trade mark, Tasmania would be in the hands of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne, or some other noble democratic Minister. The Minister will only have to say that in his opinion the remuneration of the labour is not fair, and then he may refuse the use of the Commonwealth trade mark. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> must see the gross wrong that may be done. </para>

                        <para>- Good gracious, sir, what is a trade mark? I have taken some trouble to point out what a trade mark and its essentials are. Judge after Judge has said that a trade union label is wanting in those essentials; and while part 7 is bad enough, part7a is a perfect farce. It is provided that parts 3, 4, 5, and 6 shall not apply; but how could they apply, this not being a trade mark, but a kind of Commonwealth label? Internal evidence shows most distinctly that my point of order is a good one, and I think you will have some difficulty in saying that these provisions come within the scope of the Bill. There is a great deal more that I should have liked to say, but I shall not take up further time, knowing that it is the desire of honorable senators to complete the consideration of the Bill to-day. </para>

                    <para>The subject-matter of the Bill is the registration of trade marks. If these trade union marks are trade marks, the suggested amendments are undoubtedly relevant to the subject-matter of the Bill. That brings us back to the first point, which is : What is the meaning of the Constitution ; and what do the words &#34; trade marks &#34; mean as used in the Constitution? The two points raised, as I have said, resolve themselves into one, which is a point of constitutional law, and not a point of order. I agree with the ruling of the Chairman of Committees, and I am of opinion that if the Committee thinks fit these amendments may be inserted in the Bill. </para>

                        <para>- I am merely repeating a ruling which has already been given half-a-dozen times. From the very initiation of the Senate, I have always refused to interpret the Constitution except so far as is actually necessary to carry on the business of the Senate. Therefore, all argument as to whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> is right or wrong in his interpretation of the Constitution seems to me to have nothing to do with the issue. </para>

                        <para>- May I say that, if the President takes that attitude, he has nothing on which to rule, there having been no opportunity for honorable senators to speak. If you intend now to deliver a ruling, I consider that you would be abridging the rights of every senator if you were to insist upon delivering it without having heard reasons for or against it. If you take up the attitude that there is nothing upon which to rule, you will compel me to resume my seat. But if you admit the position that you are going to give a ruling I intend to insist upon my right to speak, subject, of course, to your decision. </para>

                        <para>- Well, I reserve to myself the right to make that assumption. I do not wish to speak at any length. I have only risen to as,k your attention to this fact, that in. giving his ruling the Chairman of Committees emphasized the point - and this is the salient point in issue - that the question of a workers&#39; trade mark, formerly known as a trade union label, was clearly comprised in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c</inline> of clause 16. The  Chairman  took up Part III. of the Bill and read clause 16, which practically operates, as a definition of a trade mark. That is the root of the whole matter. If we had in the Bill a clear definition of a trade mark, and if a workers&#39; trade mark came under that definition, I admit at once that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> &#39;s contention would fall to the ground. But seeing that Part III., which does give a definition of a trade mark, is; expressly excluded from applying to the clauses which we are now discussing, it means that there is no definition which covers the question of a workers&#39; trade mark. </para>

                        <para>- I submit, sir, that what you have to consider is whether the ruling of the Chairman-of Committees was right or wrong,, and not whether the reasons which he assigned therefor were correct or incorrect. It is now suggested that there is no definition of trade mark which will coveT this particular division of the Bill. When the Bill was previously before the Senate, it contained no definition of the phrase &#34; trade marks,&#34; and in relying upon any definition to support his argument, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> must invariably fall back upon a definition which is not in itself absolute and unalterable. A statutory definition, as he knows, is one which is always made in and for the purposes of the Statute in which it appears. The common law definition of a trade mark, as he must know, has never been the same during a succession of years. </para>

                        <para>- Undoubtedly not. If I were to take the honorable senator through the history of the development of the legal conception of a trade mark, he would find&#39; that it has varied from generation to generation. </para>

                        <para>- I did not expect that the point of order would be raised, seeing that it was raised and determined last year, as, I supposed&#39;, for all time. -The term &#34;trade marks&#34; occurs in the Constitution, and, in the absence of a definition, are we to be guided by a statutory definition? I submit not, because a statutory definition is one which is intended for a specific purpose, and is not intended to be absolute and unalterable in all circumstances. In the last English Act, the definition of &#34; trade mark &#34; is expressly stated to be one in and for the purposes of the Act. </para>

                        <para>- It does not make it any worse. It was considered by those who were responsible for the drafting and introduction of the Bill that it was then better without a definition, and I think, that under- any circumstances, it is better without a definition, because it would not allow the measure to take cognizance, so to speak, of the varying conditions in the development of trade. </para>

                        <para>- Last year, when we were dealing with this point of order, I gave reasons for my opinion that the proposed amendments came within the scope and purview of the Bill. I have heard no reason why I should alter that opinion ; in fact,,, what the honorable senator read this morning only goes to emphasize what I then urged. It will be remembered that I then pointed out that if it were to be limited to the conception of the term, as it might have existed in certain quarters when the Constitution was passed, we should necessarily require, from time to time, an amendment thereof. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly; that is the whole point of my argument. If the custom of the country does not give the meaning of -the term,&#39; if we have to be limited to the concept, which was entertained when the Constitution was passed, then, no matter what the custom of the country may be, no matter what development of trade may have taken place, we shall have to go to the people from time to time, and ask them to amend the Constitution. </para>

When it was passed such a thing as wireless telegraphy was not known. Do we have to go to the people and ask them to amend the Constitution in order to give the Parliament power to deal with wireless telegraphy ? </para>

                        <para>- The effect of the argument is that union marks are dealt wilh differently from other trade marks, and that that is a reason why union marks are not trade marks within the Bill. I wish to draw attention to one piece of legislation which we have passed lately. We have power under the Constitution to deal with copyright. When the Imperial Parliament passed our Constitution, there was no such&#39; thing known to the English law as copyright in news or cable messages. </para>

                        <para>- I shall be brief. There was at that time no such thing as copyright in news, either at common law or by Statute. When we started to legislate on copyright, we made provision, for copyright in cable messages ; but we did not make that copyright similar to the general copyright given in literary productions and works of art. We made it apply for a definite limited period of twenty -four hours, and attached to it certain conditions and remedies that did not apply to any other system of copyright. Would any one contend that those provisions did not come within the scope of a Copyright Bill? </para>

                        <para>- With all due deference to honorable senators, I think that the point of order has rather been obscured by argument concerning other matters. I will direct the attention of the Senate to the fact that the first time in the history of the Senate, when a question arose concerning the construction of the Constitution, I gave the following ruling : - </para>

                    <para>It does not seem to me that I should, from the Chair, undertake the responsibility of interpreting all the provisions of the Constitution. The Constitution itself has provided for a tribunal, the High Court, which, after argument and consideration such as would be impossible and undesirable in this Senate, is empowered to finally determine its meaning in most of the cases which will arise. It is my duty to interpret and determine the Standing Orders, and to regulate the procedure of the Senate; and perhaps to interpret the Constitution so far as the conduct of the business of the Senate is concerned. But the difference is great between the two cases. The Senate is the final and sole judge of the meaning of its own Standing Orders, whilst a law made in derogation of the provisions of the Constitution may in some cases be declared invalid at the instance of any citizen. </para>
                </quote>
                <para>That ruling has been adopted by the Senate, and has been in force ever since. As an illustration of the case mentioned in (hat ruling - where it is perhaps necessary that the President should give a .ruling interpreting a provision of the Constitution- </para>

                        <para>- I have nothing to do with the 39 articles. I am not going to interpret the 39 articles, or to say under which of them this Bill has been introduced. As an instance showing where it was necessary to give a ruling affecting the Constitution, in order that the business of the _ Senate might be carried on, I may mention the case of a vote given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Saunders,</inline> whose right to sit as a senator for Western Australia was challenged. From the very necessity of that case a ruling had to be given interpreting the Constitution. But, excepting cases of that sort, I have always decided that it is not my business to interpret the provisions of the Constitution. That is the point here, and it seems to me to be the only point. </para>

                        <para>- As I was saying when interrupted, this union trade mark, or workers&#39; label,&#187;or whatever you like to call it - I do not think the name makes any difference - is either a trade mark within the meaning of the Constitution, or it is not. If it is a trade mark within the meaning of the Constitution, it is properly in the Bill. If it is not, it ought not to be in the Bill. But to say now whether it ought or ought not to be in the Bill involves an interpretation of the Constitution. That is not my duty,, and I decline to do it. I therefore agree with the ruling of the Chairman of Committees that it is not within his province to interpret the Constitution. Then I come to the other point. It is this : This is a Bill which was introduced in the Senate. We sent it down to the House of Representatives containing clauses concerning trade union marks. Those clauses have been struck out, and other clauses inserted dealing with the same subject-matter under a different name. Whether those new clauses have been properly inserted or not is a question which involves the interpretation of the Standing Orders of the other House. I do not know what the </para>

                </continue>
                <para>Standing Orders of the House of Representatives on that question are ; and, if I did know, it would be altogether improper for me to try to interpret them. That House has its own Speaker, whose duty it is to interpret its Standing Orders ; and, if it were permitted for the President of the Senate, or the Speaker of the House of Representatives, to challenge proceedings in the other House, we should simply get into the most inextricable confusion, and quarrels would arise between the two Houses at once. I have been referred to standing order 179. </para>

The other House has inserted some clauses in it in lieu of the clauses inserted by the Senate. It is asserted that those clauses are foreign to the title of the Bill.

                    <para>- Now we come back to the discussion of the particular amendment under consideration. I am just as strongly opposed to the inclusion in, this Bill of the principle of trade union marks as honorable senators opposite are. When the question was first proposed in the Senate, I voted against the trade union mark clauses. I gave my reasons for so doing, and need not reiterate them. .1 simply mention the point now, because I take it that we are trespassing upon the region of disorder in discussing anything except the amendment actually before us. We are not really concerned at this stage with the principle of trade union marks introduced in the Bill and which the Senate has already affirmed by a majority. The question of the constitutional right of the Federal Parliament to pass these clauses is one upon which I thoroughly agree with those who are opposed to this part of the measure. I think we are trespassing upon State rights. We are inserting provisions which have no right to be in a Trade Marks Bill at all. We are adopting legislation of an industrial character, and are forcing it upon States which, in their wisdom. ha.ve not chosen to enact that particular kind of legislation. </para>

The House of Representatives, while accepting the principle, has amended the details.

                        <para>- We cannot drop the Bill, if the majority of honorable senators are against us. The common-sense thing to do is to try to improve these provisions. I do not approve of the principle involved in these clauses, but they are an improvement on the union label provisions contained in the Bill when it left the Senate. I think it is a pity that we have not included in the measure a definition of what a trade mark is, because if we had done so. the work of the High Court, which will sooner or later be called upon to decide this constitutional question, would have been simplified. If by voting against these amendments the result must be a return to the union label provisions as they appeared in the Bill when it left the Senate, my course is clear. </para>

                        <para>- If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> claims to know what will happen, he must profess to be a prophet. We shall be simply wasting time if we discuss what might happen in another place when we know that there is no prospect of altering these provisions, in anY way. I think it would be better to deal with these amendments in groups. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> made some reference to the Commonwealth trade mark, and I should like to have a word to say on that subject when we come to it. I wish to deal now particularly with clause <inline font-style="italic">&#34;&#93;6a,</inline> and to intimate that I intend to propose an amendment on it. The Bill has been returned to us with certain limitations and exemptions, certain industries being specifically excluded from the operation of this part of the measure. Clause 76a provides that - &#39; </para>

                <para>This Part shall not apply to any primary product of the agricultural, viticultural (including wine-making), horticultural, dairying (including butter-making and cheese-making), or pastoral industries. </para>
                <para>I do not propose to say whether that is consistent with the other provisions of the Bill. I do not think there is very much consistency in tHis measure, since it is really made applicable not only to a section of the community, but to a small section of that section. If there are to be limitations on the operation of these provisions, and some industries are to be excluded, we are justified in suggesting thai other industries exactly similar to those mentioned should also be excluded, and I propose later on to move an amendment on clause 76a for the insertion after the word &#34;horticultural &#34; of the words &#34; including fruit preserving and jam making.&#34; I cannot see why these industries should not be included as well as the products of the butter-making and cheese-making industries. If the products, of the butter-making and cheese-making industries are to be excluded from the operation of this part of the Bill, we should hear on what grounds the proposal is made. There is certainly full justification for ex-&#187; eluding the products of industries in which Tasmania is so largely interested. </para>

I hope that the Minister in charge of the Bill, apart from the fact that he is a representative of Tasmania, will admit that the amendment I have suggested is logical, and consistent with clause 76a, and will have no objection to the inclusion of the products of secondary industries as important to Tasmania, as the butter-making, cheese-making, and wine industries are to other States. </para>

                    <para>- The process of political asphyxiation has proceeded so far as to make one leng very much for freedom and the fresh air of a political atmosphere in which free men might feel that they can breathe. It strikes me that the most remarkable provision! in the amendments before the Committee is contained in clause 76a, providing for certain exemptions from the operation of this part of the Bill. I do not think that honorable senators can have any idea of the far-reaching effect of this clause. I have here a statement taken from Coghlan&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Seven Colonics</inline> as to the production in Australia, and I find that under agriculture the value of the production is set down as ,&#163;26,800,000. All that will be excluded from the operation of this part of the Bill by clause 76a. The production of the pastoral industry is &#163;25,600,000. All that is excluded. The dairying industry the production is &#163;9,700,000.. and that also is excluded. The mining industry is not excluded under this clause, but every honorable senator is aware that gold and silver cannot be brought under these provisions, and cannot be affected&#39;1 by this union label business. Then we have forestry and fishery, which represent about &#163;3,000,000. We cannot bring these clauses into operation in regard to the timber we export, and therefore of the production !in this industry only &#39;about &#163;1,000,000 can be brought under the operation of this part of the Bill. Then the production of manufactures totals &#163;28,000,000. This includes all sorts ot items, some of which cannot possibly be affected by these provisions. I do not think, for instance, that we can put union labels on gas or on electric light. Out of the &#163;28,000,000, however, I take only &#163;3,000,000, leaving a production valued at ;&#163;25&#62;000jo&#176;&#176; to come under the operation of the union label business. The result, when I reckon it up, is that out of a total production of goods in the Commonwealth stated bv <inline font-style="italic">Coghlan</inline> at &#163;117,600,000, clause 760 will exempt no less than &#163;85,000,000. </para>

I said that mining was not included, but I gave the values according to <inline font-style="italic">Coghlan,</inline> and I pointed out that we cannot put labels on gold and silver. It does not matter bv what labour our gold is produced, because its price is fixed. It is important to note that,- of the whole of Australia&#39;s production, only 28 per cent, can be brought under union label conditions. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator is confusing things which differ. A gold watch-chain comes under the head of manufactures, and, therefore, may bear a trade mark, but the primary gold-mining industry, which produces about &#163;1:8,000,000 worth of gold each year, is debarred. Out of the -&#163;117,000,000 worth of production in Australia, &#163;85,000,000 worth at least is excluded from the operation of the union label. In other words, only 28 per cent, can be brought under the provisions, 72 per cent, remaining unaffected. That proves what has been stated over and over again, namely, that the great majority of the workers of Australia are outside the operation of the union label. That is a point which honorable senators should consider ; and it might be desirable to improve the Bill by extending the exemptions a little further. I observe that the exemption clause very largely follows on the lines of the Arbitration Act. In that Act, however, the pastoral industry is not excluded, whereas it is excluded by the clause now presented to us. This indicates that the process&#62; of education of the public is going on. In my judgment it is quite clear that in another place the position was recognised as difficult and dangerous - it was recognised that the people do not approve of these proposals. In order to get a majority, the supporters of the Bill have had to exempt from its operation the main products of Australia. Could there be a more severe condemnation of the whole scheme? We have been told on various occasions that trade marks date from very ancient times. That, to a large extent, is true, but the trade mark of centuries ago - the trade marks of the ancient guilds of Great Britain - were used simply for the purpose of denoting quality and excellence of workmanship. This union label, however, may be used, and if agreed to undoubtedly will be used, in scores, hundreds, and thousands of cases to palm off rubbish, which the public would otherwise not purchase. I should like to emphasize the fact that &#34; trade marks &#34; are always associated with ownership of goods; and that in adopting these proposals we are acting beyond the ordinary and legal interpretation of the words. Further, we are, I believe, encroaching on States rights; and I, for one, hope that ultimately, if the clauses be passed, the High Court will put them in the waste-paper basket. We have heard a great deal of the approval which the union label is said to have received in the United States. It is a recognised fact, however, that the position of trade unions in America is nothing like so good, substantial, sound, and respectable, as it is in the United Kingdom, and that in the United Kingdom the union label, if existent, is only in its infancy. </para>

                        <para>- It is still in its infancy in regard to extent. Canada has been instanced several times; but there are several facts in this connexion which ought to be taken into consideration. It is true that legislation of this kind has several times been passed by one House of the Canadian Parliament; but it has never been taken up by the Government, always having been, introduced at the instance of private members. Experienced parliamentarians know very well that proposals carried on private members&#39; day carry far less weight than proposals which are accepted on other days. Election after election has taken place in Canada, and no mandate has ever been given to the Government to promote measures of the kind. </para>

                        <para>- The outcries are pretty loud and continuous where they exist. These union label proposals are really an attack on non-unionists ; and I have shown how few people, relatively, are favorably affected by the measure. The great mass of the people of Australia stand to lose,, and not to gain, by these proposals. The people are open to have rubbish palmed on to them as goods of quality, and they may be thrown out of employment simply because they are non-unionists. In various ways, the position of citizens may be lowered under this measure. I recognise that what has taken place in the House of Representatives improves the position, from my point of view. The clauses that we passed here, unfortunately, with so little consideration, are rejected by another place, and the substituted provisions are less drastic than those originally agreed to, with the additional advantage that a great number of exemptions have been made. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> seems to be under the impression that if we simply reject these amendments, our original clauses will stand ; but I point out that if we simply adopt that portion of the House of Representatives&#39; amendments, which omits clauses 73 to 78, we shall reject not only the amended clause, but the original clause.

I suppose the Chairman will agree that it is quite relevant to touch for a few moments on the question of the alteration of title, although, from one point of view, that has already been passed.

                        <para>- I venture to say that the business is precisely the same; it is merely an alteration in words, and not an alteration in matter or spirit. I have no hesitation in saying that between workers&#39; trade marks and trade union marks there is not a scintilla of difference. When the distinguished imitator of American methods, who, fortunately, or unfortunately, is in this Senate, first introduced the provisions for a. trade union label, he made the meaning perfectly clear. Since then the matter has gone into what I think I may safely describe as more skilful hands. To use a humble analogy, there is no doubt under which thimble the pea was originally, and it will be agreed that in spite of the great dexterity of the operator retained in another place, there is not the slightest doubt that the pea is still under the same thimble. The verbiage of clause 73a means neither more nor less than the simple provision originally inserted under the name of a trade union label. It is involved in a tremendously long sentence. Every effort has been made, if possible, to mollify the public, to deceive the unwary, and make them imagine that this is a modified version of the original trade union label - that, if there was anything injurious, harmful, or unjust in the original crude proposal, it has been removed. Everything which, from my point of view, was bad in the original proposal is contained in this proposal. If that were not so, I am quite certain that those who are going to support all these amendments would, if they thought that their value, or strength, or adaptability to the purposes intended, had been in any way impaired or weakened, refuse to accept them. But we know perfectly well that they are going to accept the amendments with absolute satisfaction. I wish to refer briefly to another matter which was introduced bv <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> last night. In what I might almost call a furious storm of bombast, he referred to Canada and its Upper House. There was much bandying of the word &#34; Tory,&#34; which I contend is generally meant to denote class legislation. If the comparison is to be limited in that way. I venture to Say deliberately that the nominee Senate of Canada, in that respect, differs very little from the elected Senate of Australia. </para>

                        <para>- Precisely. I never expected the day to come when, in one very material respect, I could wish that I were in a nominee. House. It is a surprising thing to me that in this debate we should have been reminded that a nominee House, elected under conditions from which I dissent just as much as my honorable friends&#39; opposite, should be singled out as an instance of a House which had the courage of its convictions. For four years we have sat in a Senate elected on the widest possible franchise, and not once have I seen the Senate assert itself in the manner which the nominee Senate of Canada - with an accent of contempt on the word &#34; nominee &#34; - ventured to do in respect of measures relating to the trade union label. </para>

                        <para>- I think that I am now sitting in an ordinary registry office. I consider that for years the function of the Senate has been to register the decisions of another place; and in that respect this session has been in no way different from the previous session. A very solid body of honorable senators opposite are absolutely determined to give effect to everything which is enforced below under present circumstances. They are reinforced here by a sufficient number of senators to command an absolute majority - senators, for instance, like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> who, whether from shame, or from expediency, declines to join their party, but is absolutely afraid to vote against them. </para>

                        <para>- That may be so, but I state, advisedly, that for one reason or another, which is his concern, and not mine, he is either ashamed of the party or considers it inexpedient, openly to join them, and yet always votes with them, and is afraid to vote against them. The difference between myself and many honorable senators is that I am neither afraid to vote with the Labour Party, nor afraid to vote against them. </para>

                        <para>- I know the division lists in the Senate for the last four years just as well as does my honorable friend. But, reverting to the question before the Committee, I suppose it is not denied that whatever may happen from the enactment of these amendments, they cannot in any way improve the conditions of labour. I have never heard it contended by any advocate of the union label that the measure with these provisions could produce that result. We know that in the majority of the States there is direct legislation for that purpose, and I have not heard it contended that the enactment of these amendments would in any way improve the conditions of labour. If that result will not be achieved, what is the object of these provisions? To that question half-a-dozen different answers have been given. We have had the admission that the direct object of the provisions is to bring more men into the trade unions. </para>

                        <para>- I attach great importance to the use of the word &#34; incidentally,&#34; because it is just as important as the postscript to a woman&#39;s letter. Men could only be brought into the trade unions by means of threats or unfair inducements, or pressure. To sum up my view of this legislation, the most that I have to hope is that it will be of no effect. That, I take it, is the minimum of my honorable friends opposite ; it is the worst which they hope to come from this legislation. It is quite possible that for a considerable time it will lie dormant to all intents and purposes, that there will be no one who will be able to trace its operation, and it was for that reason that I ventured incidentally to draw attention to the question that the Bill should not come into force for, at any rate, four months. This may not quite please my honorable friends opposite, but I recognise that if the measure can be so used as to produce no possible disturbance on the political horizon for twelve months, it will suit them excellently. </para>

                        <para>- I hope that the operation of these provisions in the coming year will not differ from their operation after the next general election. I am inclined to hope that no effect will be produced, but I recognise that if my hope is going to be disappointed, the measure is calculated to produce a state of things which even my honorable friends on the other side will one day regret. If, however, it is going to be used as a weapon of intimidation, or boycotting, there will be great anxiety as to who will emerge triumphant from the trouble. We all know the number of unionists and non-unionists in Australia. I can quite imagine that when a struggle does arise the majority will rule, and that instead of these provisions being good for trade unionists they will be very bad. </para>

                        <para>- It would. Up to a certain point I am entirely with the trade unions. Let me remind the honorable senator that the fight for the liberty to have trade unions extended over forty years. But the fight for freedom to go into trade unions is quite different from that with which Australia is now threatened, and that is a fight for freedom to keep out of trade unions. There is an enormous difference between the position of forty years ago and the present position. What I wish to emphasize is that the coming fight will be a fight for freedom to keep out of trade unions. </para>

                        <para>- Clause 75a, which is intended to stop boycotting, can have no effect whatever upon it. It does not touch the question. First of all, the Federal Parliament has no power whatever to interfere with boycotting. That is left to the States entirely. If there is boycotting anywhere in the Commonwealth, the State in which it arises will have to suppress it. The Federal Parliament cannot. To insert this clause is merely a piece of hyprocrisy. It is more or less of a sop. Let me institute a comparison between the proviso applying to what are called workers&#39; trade marks, and the proviso with regard to Commonwealth trade marks. First of all, if I understand it rightly, any association which uses a workers&#39; trade mark may also use the Commonwealth trade mark. But only a limited number can use the workers&#39; trade mark. So that in this case, to put it broadly, the rule is &#34;What is yours is mine, and what is mine is my own.&#34; This thing, which is called a Commonwealth trade mark, and which an ingenious lawyer in the other House has introduced, is an attempt - wholly unsuccessful, I believe - to placate the workers outside the unions. </para>

                        <para>- I admit at once that the men can form an. association, and register a trade mark. But when you come to the Commonwealth trade mark, the difference arises. A resolution has to be passed by both Houses of this Parliament that the conditions of labour are fair before the Commonwealth trade mark can be applied. In other words, the use of the Commonwealth mark can only be secured* by bringing forward evidence to show that the conditions under which the business is carried on are fair, and awaiting the approval of such evidence by both Houses of Parliament. See what it means. Suppose the case of a manufacturer employing 100 men. Suppose that each individual man of the hundred receives wages which are higher than those paid to trade unionists following the same occupation, that the hours of labour are less, and that the conditions of employment are all fair and reasonable. Even then the use of the Commonwealth label or mark cannot be secured. </para>

                        <para>- That interjection merely confirms me in the opinion that the object of these provisions is to drive men into the unions. How can a man who is employing fifty men, or the fifty men themselves, succeed in having a resolution passed through both Houses of this Parliament affirming that their conditions of labour are fair and reasonable? On the very face of it, the proposal is utterly hypocritical. It has for its object conditions which are onerous, unfair, and unjust, and which expose that element of preference which is an under-current to all this legislation. But look at another aspect, of it : Suppose these men have gone to the trouble and expense of having a resolution carried through both Houses of this Parliament, and have acquired the use of the Commonwealth label. What is going to happen then? If their rights are infringed, how are they to defend them in a Court of law ? I have never seen such a travesty of justice as an attempt in a serious piece of legislation to deny the rights of individuals as this proviso does. Under it, if their rights are &#39; infringed, they actually have to apply to the Minister to sue. I call attention to the state of the Committee. <inline font-style="italic">&#91;Quorum formed.&#39;&#93;</inline> I cannot help saying that, in view of the promise given by honorable senators in Opposition to agree to take a division not later than 4 o&#39;clock, it is an extraordinary thing that after the lunch adjournment there should have been great danger of the Senate being adjourned for want of a quorum. If we had not been able to obtain a quorum at the last moment, the whole thing would would have collapsed, and the fault would have rested with Ministers more than with any one else, because neither of them was present in the Chamber. As I have been partially responsible for the arrangement entered into with, the leader of the Senate to conclude the debate not later than 4 o&#39;clock - an arrangement for which I am&#34; personally grateful - it would be&#39; unfair for me to offer any more comment on these provisions. I shall close with the observation that I am perfectly confident that if we were to succeed in rejecting these clauses, we should kill this Bill, and the union label proposals for this session. In the circumstances, I think it is a very great pity if any honorable senator is under a misapprehension that he would not be justified in using this as an excuse for voting against the clauses, which a very important minority in the Senate believe to be repugnant to the best interests of Australia. </para>

                    (Tasmania).I should like to say a few words on these provisions, and, as usual, I shall be very brief. A good deal has been said about the iniquity of these clauses. I feel that they, are entirely unnecessary, and if there were any prospect whatever that we should be able to reject them, I should gladly assist in doing so. I cannot understand why, when provision has been made in Part VII. a, for a Commonwealth Trade Mark covering Australian labour conditions, provision should also be made for workers&#39; trade marks. I should like to say with respect to clause 76A that I should prefer to see it amended by the omission of the word &#34; primary &#34; so that it would read -

There really must be some great influence exerted by the &#34; Caucus Party &#34; to cause these members of the Ministry to be disloyal to their own consciences, and to force them to give their support to measures which they believe to be inimical to the best interests of the Commonwealth. I can conceive of no greater danger to the interests of Australia than the &#34;engineering&#34; exerted to secure the adoption of these provisions, because it has had the effect of materially deteriorating the standard of morality in the political life of the Commonwealth. It must be patent to everybody that the Government are prepared to carry into effect provisions which they believe to be against the best interests of Australia, simply in order to retain office. </para>

                        <para>- It is because they believe that the union label provisions can be used as a powerful organizing machine to bring into the union fold for the support of the party, all the non-unionist workers of the Commonwealth. I contend that these provisions are absolutely unfair. Trade marks have hitherto had attached to them a certain value which has been recognised as the personal property of the owners. They have had also, to some extent, a personal value, since a man&#39;s trade mark is not merely a sign or symbol attached to his goods to identify them,, but it is his hall mark and credit mark, which indicates the quality of the goods he manufactures. These union label provisions involve a complete departure from the principle underlying trade marks&#39; legislation, because the essential characteristics of a trade mark do not attach to the proposed workers&#39; trade mark. Unionists may. under these provisions, register a mark which will show that the goods to which it is applied have 6een manufactured under union conditions, but it will in no way indicate that the goods are of a certain quality. These provisions will not prevent the application of a union label to inferior goods which will thus be put on the market, with any kudos to be gained from the intimation that they have been made under union conditions. </para>

                    give honorable senators opposite credit for being sincere in the belief that the Bill, if passed, will be in the best interests of the workers, and they must give me credit for my sincerity in the belief that the Bill will not prove equal&#34; to their desires. No one would be better pleased than myself if the Bill did realize the anticipations formed by my honorable friends opposite; but I think they will ultimately be disappointed. In the protest I have uttered, I represent a large&#39; majority of the people of New South Wales, including the Chambers of Commerce, the Manufacturers&#39; Associations, and the Storekeepers&#39; Association, the latter of which consists of more than 900 members. On behalf of these people. I oppose this measure, although I know that no protest will be of any avail in changing the result.

The best thing that could happen for those who champion these clauses is that they should be put in. operation as soon as possible, so that the people may have experience of them before the next election. I admit that, after the lies which have been so sedulously spread, and, after the suppression of the truth regarding the clauses, there is in the country a mistaken idea as to what they are, and what they mean. Only recently&#34; I heard a man, who is in the front rank of his profession in one of the States - I shall not give his name, because I am certain that to do so would damage him in his profession - say, in condemnation of the clauses, that they meant that every article sold in a shop would have to be branded either union or non-union. </para>

                <para>Dear <inline font-weight="bold">Sir,</inline></para>
                <para>I am directed by the executive committee of this federation to notify you that at the last meeting of the executive a report was received from Messrs. Hoadley and Co., in connexion with the strike taking place in their factory. </para>
                <para class="block">Subsequent to this, I received a letter from Messrs. Hoadley, setting forth the <inline font-style="italic">-pros</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">cons</inline> of the whole case, in which he states - &#34; That having found it necessary, owing to the adjustment of the inside work of our factory, we considered it necessary to dispense with one of our employes. As we did not require him to work after notice, we gave him a cheque in lieu of same. On this being notified to the other men some left at once, and others who had commenced work left it partly finished. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hoadley</inline> took the trouble to fully explain the position to the men on Friday evening, when paying them off. While they agreed that we had treated them very well, they decided to stand by the trade union. On Monday, some of the men returned to work, also some yesterday, but the majority are still out. We should like to have the co-operation of other employers in our trade, as we consider the right we are seeking is a very vital one, viz., the power to put on or dispense with the services of any of our employes, and as we do not wish to take any men from the other firms we should like to have their sympathy and assistance in not employing any of those who have left us during the present strike.&#34; </para>
                <para>This explanation appears to me entirely satisfactory. The principle that a man should be allowed to be master in his own business is one which this federation keenly supports, and I am directed by my committee to ask you, as members of this federation, through the affiliation of the Manufacturing Confectioners&#39; Association, to assist Messrs. Hoadley and Co., both in the direction of not taking on those men who have struck, and in such other ways as may be possible, so as to render the inconvenience they are subject to as slight as possible. My committee feel that they have no hesitation In asking you to comply with this request, as any member may be in the same position to-morrow as Messrs. Hoadley and Co. are to-day. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. A great point was made about the misuse of the union label in America. It was urged that the trade unionists boycotted the manufacturers, and all that kind of thing. But the <inline font-style="italic">Meatcutters&#39;</inline><inline font-style="italic">Journal,</inline> published in Syracuse, New York, on the 8th April, 1905, contains the following report : - </para>

                    <para>At a- meeting of the American Economic Association, held in February of this year, reference was made to Robbins Lumber Company, of Wilksbarre, Pa. This company has withdrawn from the Citizens Alliance, in order to do so they have forfeited $1,000. In the future union men, with their &#34; buttons,&#34; will take the place of non-unionists. They say &#34;we withdraw from the Alliance, because we believe it to be unlawful, unjust, and against the best interest of the community, because it believes in a systematic boycott against employes, who are to be at the will of the employer, black-listed, boycotted, and starved into submission; that a member of the association may brand an employé as unworthy; and that he will not be given employment by any other member. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator does not like tq hear this information associated with trade marks, but he has no objection to associate boycotting with trade marks, when he desires to make a charge against trade unions. I wish to draw the attention of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> to the fact that the firm of Hoadley and Company are engaged in the manufacture of jams and preserves, and that he proposes to exempt a firm who have used the boycott to starve their employes into submission, to save them from the much less unfair boycott of an appeal to the public not to buy their goods unless their operatives are worked under fair conditions. </para>

                        <para>- I am in .favour of making exceptions to this extent, that in an industry such as the jam industry, in which the operatives are generally girls and youths, with very little unionism amongst them, unless, they be given an opportunity to appeal to the public to support only those factories which are worked under fair conditions, they will be sweated as they have been. I was very much interested in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen&#39;s</inline> explanation, but when the logic of events compelled those of us who pressed this proposal in the first instance to accept a modification in the direction asked for by that honorable senator, we had a right to expect that he would meet us, at any rate, half way. Apparently he has no spirit of compromise in his composition. He wants the whole loaf or none; he demands the whole pound of flesh ; and no matter what concessions we may make to him, he is against us, lock, stock, and barrel. Although he did not say so in an uncompromising way at the time, still he led us to believe that if it had not been for that particular provision he would have had very little opposition to offer. </para>

                        <para>- I am not very hopeful, in that regard, because the nomadic character of the employment is against the establishment of a trade union. I do not believe that in twenty-five years, if the industries exempted by new clause 7 6a were placed under the Bill, there would be a trade union mark registered to affect anyone of them. The question whether those industries are under the Bill or not does not matter very much. But the jam-making and fruit industries would be affected. In these industries, factory conditions are of no avail unless there is a strong trade union to see that they are policed. Trade unions are the police of the factories and the Arbitration Acts. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> ought to know that trade unionists can see that the law is carried out without the danger of being boycotted. If an individual worker were to call attention to insanitary conditions in his &#39;factory, he would be sacked &#34; quick and lively &#34; ; therefore, the only men who could make a report without risk of incurring a penalty are trade unionists. </para>

                        <para>- Yes; but as I pointed out, the factory would also be encouraged to use the trade union mark, because their &#39;jams are used in the homes, of working men. If we could get a trade union established in this factory, the Factories Acts would be carried out. But while we have to depend upon the inspector alone, the law will never be carried out. What happened in the case which I have just cited ? The managing director, who, I suppose, enters the factory occasionally, and the director, who enters it seldom, went into the witness-box and swore that the factory was not dirty, thus contradicting the statements of the two officials, and the Bench, composed of honorary justices, with one stipendiary magistrate, dismissed the complaint. This case is not isolated. Those who have had any experience of factory life are aware that no operative dare call attention to the insanitary conditions of his factory for fear of the boycott. The only protection the workers can have is a strong trade union. I intend to support the Bill as it has been returned to us. and I trust that no further amendments will be carried that will have the effect of weakening it. </para>

                    <para>- In common with other honorable senators, I rise to state my objection to this proposed legislation. I do not intend to enter into the matter at length, because pretty, well all that can be said has been said, except in regard to one or two minor points. I was rather surprised to read new clause 76A, under which wine-making is excluded from the operation of the workers&#39; label clause. I am still more surprised that brewing is included. Surely brewing, just as much as wine-making, is entitled to exemption. However, the figures quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> are rather reassuring, from my point of view, as they show that only about 28 per cent, of the production of Australia will be affected by the union label. I trust that even though the Bill be passed, boycotting in Australia will be conspicuous by its absence. </para>

                        <para>- Another objection which I have to these clauses is that they afford no guarantee of quality in respect of the goods to which the union label is applied. Surely it will be admitted that non-unionists are often as good trade people as are those who belong to unions. I believe in the policy of the old trade unionists, because they had no objection to working side by side with those who did not belong to unions. </para>

                        <para>- I dare say that if the honorable senator will look at it he will either laugh or cry at what he sees. It shows what the tendency will be. If no boycotting occurs under the union label between now and the end of next year, I shall be one of those who are uncharitable enough to think that it has not taken place for fear of the consequences at the next general election. </para>

                    <para>- I should like tq say briefly that my opinion on this subject has not changed since I voted against the trade union label clauses last July twelve months. They have undergone a good deal of change since then, and some matter has been added which may have a beneficial effect. I remind the Committee that when, I spoke on this subject before I expressed the opinion that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> to whom I gave credit for good intentions, had endeavoured to make sure that goods should be marked in such a way as to indicate the conditions under which they were made. I referred to the marking of Chinese-made furniture, a matter in regard to which I took action as far back as seventeen or eighteen years ago. I have always held the opinion that they should be marked, and shall be glad to co-operate with any one in an endeavour to insure that goods placed on the market have been manufactured under fair conditions. It is intended that that object shall be attained by means of what is called the union label or mark; that is to say, that there shall be power given to some recognised official to mark goods, so as to indicate the conditions under which they have been made. But the thing that I objected to in connexion with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce&#39;s</inline> original proposal is still present in these clauses. Though I emphasized the constitutional objection on the last occasion, I should like it to be clearly understood that my opposition, to the provisions were not solely that they were unconstitutional. My objections went further. I pointed out, first of all, that they were unconstitutional; but I also said that, whether constitutional or not, they were likely to lead to bad results, and therefore ought not to be passed by Parliament. The particular thing that I objected ro was that the clause recognised proprietorship in a trade mark, which might be given, or withheld, in respect of the goods of some other person. That, I think, constitutes the great difference between the union label and a true trade mark, within the meaning of the British Trade Marks Acf. My contention was, and still is, that the only power which we have of dealing with this matter is derived from that paragraph of section 51 of the Constitution which mentions trade marks. And when we inquire what the term &#34; trade mark&#34; means, we must turn, not to any legislation passed in Australia, but to what a trade mark meant under British law at the time our Constitution was assented to. If we do that, we must go back to the interpretation of &#34;trade mark&#34; in the British Trade Marks Act; and we find that under that interpretation the particular thing that I am objecting to now would clearly be excluded. I think, therefore, that under the Constitution we have not the powder to recognise the proprietorship in a mark which may be affixed to other people&#39;s goods or may be withheld from them. But, apart from the constitutional point, I think that such a provision is likely to lead to ill, because it gives an opportunity., at all events, for a boycott. There will be a mark which will belong to certain individuals or to an association. They will have the power, at their caprice, of either giving or withholding their mark. They will be in a position, therefore, if the members of the association are sufficiently numerous, to compel a tradesman to sell certain goods, or not to sell them. I think that is wrong in principle. </para>

                        <para>- I am supposing a case where a manufacturer has a trade mark of his own, under which his goods have acquired a certain reputation for quality, but wishes to place some inferior goods upon the market. By employing union labour he will be entitled to put the union mark on his goods, and so will be at an advantage in selling them. When I made that statement in the Senate previously, I was met with the reply that the union would not allow such a man to use its mark. If that be so, it is perfectly clear that the mark is one that the proprietors of it claim they can give or withhold at their caprice. </para>

                        <para>- I fail to see how the union label is going to secure the object desired of it if the proprietor of the label has not the power of withholding &#34;its use from a particular manufacturer. And, if that is so, the unions will certainly have an enormous power over local tradesmen, especially in country districts like the far west of Queensland. They can say to them, &#34; Unless you buy and sell goods with certain brands on them, or refrain from, buying and selling goods which are otherwise branded, we will not deal with you.&#34; If that takes place, certainly the Bill will have very undesirable results. It will have the effect of setting class against class, and will lead to a condition of affairs in parts of the country such as that of which I am speaking that I am sure many honorable senators would regret. It may have the result of increasing the sale of goods made by union labour, but it will correspondingly depress the sale of goods which are not made by union labour. Honorable senators may be animated by the best intentions, but I think that this is not a fair and legitimate way of obtaining their end. I do not believe that good ever follows the use of indirect means of attaining legislative ends. If we are going to act in a democratic manner - and most of us claim to be democrats - we should consider how the whole people will be affected bv the Bill. </para>

I recognise that every effort which is made to increase the wages and improve the conditions of labour for the man who is not a member of a union, and must work for his living, is praiseworthy; but he would not thank unionists for depriving him of his work altogether in the process. </para>

Persons will be required to sell goods made exclusively by union labour, and not to sell goods made by non-union labour, and the natural consequence must be that the non-unionist will be compelled to lose his means of living, or else join a union. </para>

                        <para>- Is it not a fact that the consequence of the operation of the workers&#39; trade mark in the way I have described must be to compel men to lose their means of living or become members of unions, and subject themselves to conditions which they may be disinclined to accept? Even though the intention should be to improve the position of those who are not unionists, I do not think that the method1 proposed is a legitimate way of attaining the object. Whatever good unions may have clone in the past, or may do in the future. I do not think that it is legitimate by such means to compel workmen to joint them. </para>

                        <para>- If that be so, the Factories Act in force in Victoria is very different from those in force in other States of the Commonwealth. The factories laws in most countries were passed for the benefit, not of trade unionists alone, but of all classes of workers, in factories. All the regulations made under them with regard to the conditions in which the work is done are intended to benefit all- employed in the factories, whether they are trade unionists or not. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator&#39;s interjections bring me to another point, and that is that the Factories Acts are purely matters within the jurisdiction of the States. If these evils exist, and I know that they do exist to a very great extent, they should be dealt with by the States. I think that some honorable senators, anticipating difficulty in securing State legislation of this kind, believe that it is better that they should secure direct Commonwealth legislation of the character now proposed. There is nothing to prevent the States, undertaking legislation to provide for union labels, and if that be so, I say that honorable senators in endeavouring to carry these provisions are trying to do a right thing in a wrong way. </para>

                        <para>- I told the honorable senator that I hold that these provisions are unconstitutional. Apart from whether they are constitutional or unconstitutional, the object is to &#39;force upon the Commonwealth Parliament legislation to take the place of legislation that can constitutionally be passed by the States, and not by the Commonwealth. In the circumstances, I repeat that those who are supporting these provisions are endeavouring to do what may be a right thing, but certainly in an entirely wrong way. . I believe we shall get better results eventually if the Commonwealth Parliament recognises the exact line of demarcation between its own duties and powers, .and the duties and powers of the States, than we shall by any effort to use the legislation of the Commonwealth to do what should be done by the States, and what is within the constitutional powers of the States, and not of the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>- Before we go to a vote, I have a word to say in support of the amendments now before the Committee. We have listened to many speeches from honorable senators opposite against these provisions, and it is only fair that a word or two should be said by honorable senators on this side in favour of them. I support these provisions as I supported provisions to give manufacturers and employers the right to register, and have the exclusive use of trade marks. When the Bill was before the Senate last year not a single word was said by those supporting these provisions against giving employers and manufacturers the fullest possible right to the exclusive use of trade marks. We were in favour of giving them the fullest possible measure of justice and protection, but what is the attitude of honorable senators opposite when we claim the same fair deal for the workers of the Commonwealth? They are all up in arms against the proposal. They are all the time, and to the fullest possible extent, the advocates of the employers and of the manufacturers, who are prepared to rob and fleece their employes and the public. </para>

Unions, in the present state of the law in the Commonwealth and in the States, can adopt a trade mark at any time they choose, and use&#39; it ; but there is nothing to prevent any unscrupulous individual coming along and pirating their trade mark. If under the present state of the law they adopted a trade mark, and it became popular bv reason of the fact that the goods to which it was applied were in demand from one end of the Commonwealth to the other, a real value would be given to it, and yet any unscrupulous individual might come along and pirate it. </para>

                        <para>- That action has no reference to a -workers&#39; trade mark, and the honorable senator does not know what he is talking about. T say that any workers&#39; association in Australia can now adopt a trade mark, and with the consent of the owner apply it to any goods. It may become! a very valuable mark indeed, but there is nothing in the present law, either of the Commonwealth or of the States, to prevent any unscrupulous individual pirating that trade mark and robbing the real owners of the benefit which they might derive from it. I know that some trade unions as a matter of fact have adopted union marks. A firm of co-operative bootmakers in Brisbane have adopted a design of clasped hands as a trade mark which they apply to their goods, but there is nothing to prevent any bootmaker in Brisbane putting the same mark on boots of his own manufacture. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator is seeking to prevent them from registering, it. That is just what we are asking the Committee to agree to - to give the unions power to register trade marks, and to protect them from piracy. This is only a provision to provide for common honesty, and it should have the support of all who favour fair dealing. This part of the Bill will be exceedingly valuable in the fostering of Australian industries. The trade mark can be applied only to goods made in Australia under fair conditions ; and, in my opinion, the result will be to popularize locally-manufactured good&#39;s, and thus render great assistance to those engaged in our industrial life. I should like to read the following cable message, which appears in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> of this day : - </para>

                        <para>- The trade mark will be a guarantee to the people of Australia that goods are manufactured under fair conditions. It-is well known that unionists usually demand, and are paid, the highest wages, and no manufacturer would employ such labour in order to work up rubbish. On the contrary, a manufacturer will be careful to use the best article, in order that he may demand a price which will recompense him for his outlay. In addition to fair wages, and so forth, this trade mark will insure good sanitary conditions, which are most important from a health point of view, in the manufacture of food products, so that, from every aspect, these provisions will have beneficial effects. We have been told that the main object of the provisions is to force men into trade unions. There is not a single word or clause in this part of the Bill to justify any such allegation. I might as well say that, if a. limited liability company, with a registered trade mark, achieved such success as to drive out all their competitors, the shareholders in the other companies would be compelled to buy shares in the successful enterprise. As a matter of fact, there is no such compulsion. If I am a miner, and get the idea that harvesting is more profitable, I simply go harvesting ; .and people &#34;will join unions, or remain outside, at their own sweet will, just as before. </para>

                        <para>- I am only asking for fair conditions, and protection for both sides. The very people who charge us with desiring to devise a means to boycott have been the chief sinners in that respect themselves. The records of the law Courts, and evidence taken before Royal Commissions in every State, prove the truth of that allegation. Employers have been callous to the sufferings of innocent women and children,; they have deprived men of work knowing that these men could not resist the cries of those dependent upon them for support. After the election of 1893, in Queensland, 800 men were so victimized and boycotted at Char,ters Towers that they could not get a day&#39;s work simply because they had dared to vote in accordance with their political convictions. Of course, the employers always maintain that, in such cases, men are discharged for other reasons in the ordinary course of business, and there is no difficulty in finding the other reasons. In one case, however, the employers were &#34;bowled over,&#34; and had themselves to recite the facts on oath&#39; in a Court of justice. In this case a certain individual owned about 800 shares in a mine, and had worked in it for some time without one angry word between himself and the manager or anybody connected with the place. After the election, however, one of the directors happened to see Ellis man&#39;s name on the pay-sheet, and directed the manager to discharge him on the ground that he was a political agitator, who was mixed up with the Labour Party. To his eternal credit, the manager refused to obey* the order, whereupon the directors took the bull by the horns, and, by resolution, discharged the man themselves. </para>

                        <para>- This morning <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> wasted two hours over a technical point that was thrashed out two years ago. What I wish to point out is that only the general public can make this part of the Bill operative. If the public desire to exercise a preference, they will purchase&#34; goods bearing the workers&#39; trade mark. If they are not in sympathy with unions, but desire to see sweating carried on in all its naked and hideou&#39;s forms, they Wil 1 discard the goods manufactured under fair conditions. There is no justification for denying the public the right to exercise a preference of the kind. If trade unions are_ unpopular, then a union trade mark would be the worst possible thing from our point of view. Will honorable senators maintain, as has been maintained here and in another place, that trade unions are unpopular throughout Australia, and, at the same time ,,object to permitting a workers&#39; trade mark? I hope that the Committee will extend to the workers the same justice and protection that have been extended to the manufacturer and employer. </para>

                <para>This amendment will give the Committee a unique opportunity for carrying out with simplicity and ease a very valuable reform. I have already pointed out that these clauses, which I propose to omit, practically exclude 72 per cent, of the producers of the community from any benefit which may be conferred by a workers&#39; trade union, and the amendment will simply exclude the other 28 per cent. At the same time, the Committee will be enabled to rescind the clauses which were adopted last year. </para>

                        <para>- I wish to ask the Minister to explain whether it will not be quite sufficient to adopt Part VIIa. If the presence of one non-unionist in a factory will prevent the goods from being the exclusive production of the unionists, what is the use of Part VII. at all ? Sometimes it might be of use, but very often it could not be. This appears to me to be one of those cases in which every effort will be made by unionists to insist upon the other men entering the union. Under the clause the employer would not be able to use the union label unless every single employe belonged to the union. That is the most effective way of boycotting which could be conceived of. As the Labour Party have stated that their object is only to secure a fair chance for the employe to have his label, I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> to state with what arguments he can justify the retention of Part VII. </para>

                        <para>- I am not arguing whether she should or should not do so. Probably if industrial legislation had been proposed while I was a member of the Tasmanian Parliament it would have had my assistance. But Tasmania is a sovereign State, and has not given the right to this Commonwealth to force her into the position of either enacting, industrial legislation, or submitting to having her products boycotted. In Victoria there is legislation of an industrial character for the purpose of fixing wages in certain trades. I think that the general effect of that legislation has been beneficial. But Tasmania has not seen fit to adopt it. It applies, amongst other trades, to jam-making. The jam-maker in Victoria has to pay certain prescribed wages. Under the latter portion of the new clause under consideration, the jam-maker of Tasmania, who will be debarred from using the Commonwealth label, may practically be forced to use a union label, or have his goods boycotted. </para>

                    amendment was regarded as a test.
