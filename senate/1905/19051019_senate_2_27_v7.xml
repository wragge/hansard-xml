                    <para>- The motion practically calls upon us to interfere in a matter with which we are not immediately concerned. I desire to ask whether, under similar circumstances, an Australian Legislature would care to be interfered with in this way ? I think not. I also observe that the motion suggests, as a possible result of this interference, that the Empire would be cemented into one harmonious whole. I venture to disagree with that view. I think that the introduction of any element of irritation between the various parts of the Empire is not likely to assist in that process. I further observe that we are called upon to express an opinion in favour of a matter of which we know very little. The motion speaks of &#34; Home Rule,&#34; but it does not define the term. It does not indicate whether it means a simple measure of local government or something which was indicated by the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Parnell&#39;</inline> in his famous &#34; last link speech.&#34; The remark which he made in Cincinnati in 1880 was as follows : - </para>

                        <para>- Yes, but I also know that to-day there is a crowd of Home Rule advocates who go to the full extreme from which it is highly probable that the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Parnell</inline> receded. This motion does not repudiate the construction put upon the term &#34; Home Rule,&#34; by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Parnell</inline> in 1880.

                        <para>- I myself love Ireland and I love the Irish people. As an Englishman I regret that there is so much in past history that is not pleasant to look back upon. I recognise that fully. I also recognise that the Irish as component parts of the Empire have done possibly more than their share in its preservation a-nd perpetuation, and in winning for it those glorious victories which we look back upon with pride. Wherever our history has turned <inline font-style="italic">on</inline> great victories, Irish blood has been shed in plenty. Wherever skill has been needed to carry forward1, the arms of Great Britain, the Irish have come to the front. Irish blood, Irish skill, and Irish loyalty have done a great deal for the British Empire. I recognise all that, and my love and gratitude always go forth to the people of Ireland. I never allow myself to forget what we owe to them. But I am not to be led aside from what seems to me to be the clear path of. duty on this occasion by those considerations. I think that I may also ask the Senate to remember that there is such a thing as British justice. Whether it was more or less under a cloud in the past I do not say; but to-day I am convinced there is an honest desire on the part of the people of England, of Scotland, and of Wales, to do all that is just, fair and right to remove everything of an irritative character that lies between them and the people of Ireland, so that the people of all parts of the Empire may live together in happiness, and the Empire continue its career of justice and glory. </para>

                    <para>- The motion before the Senate is one of a deeply important character. A motion similar to this has already been adopted in the Parliament of another Federation. The question now being dealt with in the Australian Parliament is awakening interest not only amongst people who believe in Home Rule, but amongst those who are opponents of that principle. It is particularly a subject of interest for many millions of .people of the Irish race in the old country, and for an even greater number who are kith&#39; and kin of the Irish race, but who are no longer subjects of Great Britain. It is a subject upon which there are strong &#39;differences of opinion. Contrary views are honestly hel&#39;d on each side. We can respect those differences. For myself, I go further and say frankly that I respect honest prejudices on this subject, where the holder of them has not had opportunities, perhaps, to acquire a full knowledge of the subject so as to enable him to hold more impartial views. In the Australian Parliament the subject ought to be discussed dispassionately. We should, as far as possible, put aside traditional animosities, and should especially, refrain from raising that particularly objectionable evil sectarian feeling. It may be necessary for me to make some references that &#34;might, except for this explanation, be construed as indicating a desire on my part to arouse those old world feelings. But I have no wish to do that. I assure the </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">Senate that I shall try to deal with the subject without .wounding susceptibilities, whether national or religious, in the slightest degree. I shall have to answer some charges that have been made, but I shall do so if I can without giving offence. On the face of it the motion appears to involve merely an expression of opinion. </para>

                        <para>- I do not quite agree with the honorable senator. Though on the face of it the motion will, if carried, be an affirmation that the Senate believes that Home Rule should be granted to Ireland, it would not be ingenuous if I were not to say that we give a more extended meaning to it. Our sole object is not merely to affirm a principle. We have something beyond that in view. We desire that that affirmation shall be made for what purpose? In the hope that it will have a moral effect upon the people in whose hands the granting or refusal of Home Rule to Ireland remains - that is, the British Parliament and the British Government. </para>

                        <para>- In the other branch of the Legislature, something&#34; more has been done. I regret that the same terms were not adopted for the motion in both Houses. The honorable senator who has introduced- the question in the Senate may consider me ungracious - though I am thankful to him for bringing it forward - but nevertheless, I must say that the Senate had a right to expect from him some reasons why Home Rule for Ireland was, in his opinion, desirable, and why we in Australia should express an opinion concerning it. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator had no ; reason to expect that the Senate would affirm such a motion without discussion. I should very much prefer the Senate to come to a vote after deliberation, than to see it pass the motion with the prospect of it being afterwards asserted that it was carried accidentally by a snatch vote. There are two sets of arguments in favour of the motion. First of all, it approves of the principle of granting Home Rule to Ireland. Next, it affirms that it is expedient for the Parliament of Australia to express an opinion to that effect. I trust that I shall not be considered to be going out of my way in dividing the motion in that manner so that it may be more clearly dealt with. Before proceeding further with the question, I should like to refer to the speeches of some honorable senators who have already spoken, and declared themselves as not in favour of the motion. Senators Walker and Fraser represent two distinct types of the opponents of Home Rule. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> did not expect to be called upon to speak so early, and I think I may say, without being uncomplimentary, that &#39;he was not quite prepared to deal with the question. Although a Scotchman, he represents a type of Englishmen who have strong prejudices against the claims of Ireland, and who, I am sorry to say, are not so well informed on Irish history and Irish affairs as they ought to be when they take part in a discussion of the kind. The honorable senator seems to imagine that a great many  concessions have already been made to Ireland, and, in effect, he asks - What more does Ireland want ? Exactly the same, question was asked no years ago by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pitt</inline> of Henry Grattan, the Irish patriot - &#34; What does Ireland want?&#34; What has since been given to Ireland and that Ireland did not then possess? How many measures of freedom have been given to her - measures which ought not to be called concessions, because, in reality, they meant only the restorations of rights? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> did not, to -my mind, make an effective speech against Home Rule, although he tried to express, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> did just now, his great love for the Irish, a love which seems to have actually led him to marry an Irish lady. I should like to say something nice about the honorable senator&#39;s speech if I could ; but I am afraid I can only do so in a somewhat indirect way. I am reminded of rather a witty saying, by, I believe, an Englishman, that it is rather respectable to go to gaol for debt, because it shows that a man has once possessed credit. And so, whatever I might deduce from the honorable senator&#39;s observations, I am satisfied that he, at one time, at any rate, possessed not only good sense, but good taste, in that he married an Irish lady. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser,</inline> who followed <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker,</inline> is altogether of another type. He is a man who does know something of Irish history and Irish affairs. I should here like to say that I am sorry <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> is not in his place, and my sorrow iS not purely selfish, arising from the hope that I might convert him, but is owing tq. the fact that he is absent on account of severe illness. Although it may surprise some of those Christian gentlemen, who are prone to associate the message of peace and good-will to man with a drawn sword, I may say that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> and myself sat side by side during the whole of last session, and the earlier portion of this, and that nothing very serious happened between us. And I hope that at the end of my speech nothing I shall say will be regarded as a reflection on the honorable senator, although I wish he were present to hear the reply to some charges which certainly wounded my feelings. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> has taken an interest in Irish politics, and he is so extremely loyal to the British Constitution and Throne, and everything British - to the flag particularly - that, in his opinion, any one who criticises adversely any action of Great Britain is disloyal. The honorable senator seems to think that Home Rulers are a particularly disloyal set of men ; and I am sorry that he gave utterance to such an opinion, which I will deal with later on. I ask the honorable senator and others who have made themselves familiar with the history of Ireland, especially since the time of the Union - who have traced the various Coercion Acts, and know the circumstances attending Catholic emancipation, the removal of the penal laws, Church disestablishment, and the liberalizing of the land laws from time to time - at what particular time has it ever been recognised that Ireland had a real grievance ? At &#39;what time, in the estimation of those who think with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser,</inline> were all the grievances of Ireland removed? Had <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> lived in 1829, and in addition to being a member of Parliament had been associated with the organization of which he is a prominent member, I wonder what action he would have taken in regard to Catholic emancipation. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator may answer for himself ; I am now dealing with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser.</inline> I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> and others who oppose Home Rule, whether they regard the disaffections and upheavals which have occurred in Ireland from time to time, as the result of &#34; pure cussedness &#34; on the part of the Irish people? Have those gentlemen ever thought that there was any other better and higher motive than simply a desire to prevent the proper establishment of law and order? Have they ever thought that the various upheavals were the promptings of an ancient race, a liberty-loving people, who assert the God-given right, which every nation on earth has, to manage its own institutions in its own way? No; that is the last motive for which Ireland is given credit. Ireland is always regarded as anti-English. She was regarded as anti-English when she demanded Catholic emancipation, and also when she desired to have her land laws liberalized. Ireland has ever been anti-English and disloyal, in the minds of some people ; and simply because England has failed to govern her properly. In dealing with this question, I have necessarily to make some historic references, and to speak at some little length. My desire is to prove that even in the Australian Parliament we may set aside our prejudices, and discuss this question impartially, from the proper point of view. I first ask, is Ireland entitled to Home Rule? </para>

Because - and I say this in plain, frank language - the government of Ireland by England has been an absolute failure ; because England does not understand the Irish people, and her policy in Ireland throughout has, unfortunately, been a policy of absolute distrust.

                    <para>I do not believe that the great .majority of Englishmen have the slightest conception of the system under which this free nation attempts to rule the sister country. It is a system which is founded on the bayonets of 30,000 soldiers encamped permanently as in a hostile country. It is a system as completely centralized and bureaucratic as that with which Russia governs Poland, or as that which prevailed in Venice under the Austrian rule. An Irishman at this moment cannot move a step - he cannot lift a finger in any parochial, municipal, or educational work without being confronted wilh, interfered with, controlled by an English official appointed by a foreign Government. </para>

                <quote>
                    <para>If you fail to win the hearts of the people, how is such a system to be reconciled with the democratic institutions, which you are not prepared to give up even in Ireland ? With a free press, with a full, nay, an excessive representation in Parliament, and household suffrage, how can .you reasonably hope to maintain through % long period of years a mode of government which finds no support in the local opinion and sentiment, to which you allow full and unchecked liberty of expression? It is not consistent to give Ireland representative institutions, and yet to act in total disregard of the wishes of the people constitutionally expressed. We may wish that the Irish had been content to govern themselves through the Imperial Parliament j but there is wisdom in the saying of Marcus Aurelius : &#34; A prudent ruler will not offend the prejudices of his people. He may wish that they were wiser.&#34; </para>

                <para>I dare say that a good many of our well-meaning friends, standing on their very high pedestal, often do wish that we Irish were a little wiser. Lord Brassey went on to say - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>There have been occasions when this saying might have found its application near at hand. The main objection to any scheme of home rule lies in a deep-rooted distrust of the political capacity of the Irish people. </para>

                <para class="block">I suppose it will not be questioned as a matter of history that nearly every reform granted in Ireland has been wrung from England under very extreme pressure. I have authorities to quote in support of that statement, although, perhaps, it is only too well known to be true. I referred a little time ago to the fact- that Grattan&#39;s Parliament was the result of the arming of 60, 000 volunteers in Ireland, who took up arms in the cause, not of Ireland, but of Great Britain. When those men turned round and demanded it, Grattan&#39;s Parliament was granted readily enough. It is a well-known historical fact that Catholic </para>
                <para class="block">Emancipation was promised to the people of Ireland at the time of the Union. The promise was most shamefully broken, and it was twenty-nine years later before Catholic Emancipation was brought into force by the energy of Daniel O&#39;Connell and the agitation of the Irish people. So far as public agitation was concerned, this reform again may be said to have been achieved at the point of the bayonet. I should like here to refer to some of the forebodings to which expression was given in connexion with Catholic Emancipation - </para>
                <para>Men sagely pointed out that emancipation was inconsistent with the Coronation oath, was incompatible with the British Constitution, that it involved the severance of the countries, the dismemberment of the Empire, and that England would spend her last shilling and her last man rather than grant it. </para>
                <para class="block">That is Catholic Emancipation, which all of us would now be so eager to vote for - </para>
                <para>Others equally profound declared that in a week after emancipation Irish Catholics and Protestants would be cutting each other&#39;s throats, that there would be a massacre of Protestants all over the island, and that it was England&#39;s duty, in the interests of good order, civilization, and humanity, not to afford an opportunity for such anarchy. </para>
                <para class="block">Three-quarters of a century later one occasionally hears some hints of this kind of thing, even with regard to Home Rule. The disestablishment of the Church in Ireland was brought about by Fenianism. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gladstone,</inline> quoting a question to which he replies, said - </para>
                <para>The right honorable gentleman says : &#34; Why did you not deal with the Irish Church in 1866, when you asked for the suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act?&#34; My answer is, for a perfectly plain and simple reason. In the first place, circumstances were not ripe then as they are now. Circumstances, I repeat, were not ripe, in so far as we did not then know so much as we know now with respect to the intensity of Fenianism </para>
                <para class="block">Lord Dufferin said - </para>
                <para>I entirely agree with the noble earl (Earl Granville), and with the late Lord Lieutenant of Ireland (Lord Kimberley) that the attention of this country, and the conscience of England with respect to this question (the Church) were much stimulated, if not altogether awakened, by the fact of Fenianism. &#39; </para>
                <para>Lord Derby, writing in the <inline font-style="italic">Nineteenth Century,</inline> in 1881, expressed these views - </para>
                <para>A few desperate men, applauded by the whole body of the Irish people for their daring, showed England what Irish feeling really was, made plain to us the depth of a discontent whose existence we had scarcely suspected, and the rest followed of course. </para>
                <para class="block">I am dealing now with the way in which reforms have from time to time been won from the British Government. In respect to land reform, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gladstone</inline> said - &#34; I must make one admission, and that is that without the Land League the Act of 1881 would not at this moment be on the statute-book.&#34; </para>
                <para class="block">On that point I have another authority which is of very considerable interest at this time, and which makes me regret more &#39; than ever that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> is not here. Some quotations have been made from a remarkable Orange manifesto - I think by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie - which was issued recently in Ireland by the Independent Order of Orangemen. Under the heading of &#34;Land and Labour,&#34; I find this statement, showing how reform was thrust upon England - </para>
                <para>It is one of the cruel ironies of the Irish agitation that a Unionist Government has been compelled to swallow the original programme of the Land League. Our country might have been saved the horrors of the land war had our rulers understood the wants of the Irish people, and been able to discriminate between the true and the false - between the real Irish grievances and the spurious demands of the blatant politicians. The responsibility for this lies at the door of the Irish landlords and their representatives in Parliament. The landlords have used Protestant Ulster for generations for their own selfish ends, and have made the Orange institution a stepping-stone to place an emolument for themselves and their families. </para>
                <para class="block">I have already referred to the general misgovernment of Ireland. A description of Ireland by one of her greatest orators, Richard Lalor Sheil, who, I may mention, was not a Roman Catholic, shows the effect of it on his view. He speaks of Ireland as - </para>
                <para>A country indented with havens, watered by deep and numerous rivers, with a fortunate climate, and a soil teeming with easy fertility, and inhabited by a bold, intrepid, and (with all their faults) a generous and enthusiastic people. . . . Such is natural Ireland; what is artificial Ireland? Such is Ireland as God made her ; what is Ireland as England made her? This fine country is laden with a population the most miserable in Europe. Your domestic swine are housed better than the people. Harvests the most abundant are reaped by men with starvation in their faces; famine covers a fruitful soil, and disease inhales a pure atmosphere ; all the great commercial facilities of the country are lost; the deep rivers that should circulate opulence, and turn the machinery of a thousand manufactures, flow to the ocean without wafting a boat or turning a wheel, and the wave breaks in solitude in the silent magnificence of deserted and shipless harbors. I do not wish to prolong my speech by referring at too great length to acts of mis- government, and to treatment of Ireland, which indicated very great incapacity. The treatment of the Irish people during the famine of 1848 was a wretched example of most gross incapacity. While I would not for a moment accuse the English people of being heartless, there is no doubt that the greatest heartlessness which was ever witnessed was shown in Ireland during that time. Ships leaving Ireland with food, products -were met by ships sent with food from America by Irish people to feed their starving relatives. But even this succour, owing to the wretched mode of distribution, could not be conveyed to the starving people. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. In 1848 Ireland possessed ,&#163;23,000,000 worth of stock and exported 2,000,000 quarters - that is, over 500,000 tons - of food products. I have now to refer to the somewhat delicate question of religious inequality and the maintenance of the Protestant ascendency. I hold that the Irish question is not a religious question, but, unfortunately, it has been made one - I do not mean in this debate - through the minority in Ireland being practically the dominant class. Impartial historians like Lecky and others say that it is through the upholding of Protestant ascendency that a great deal of trouble has been brought to Ireland. I wonder what the Rev. Woolls Rutledge would have thought, had he lived in the time of O&#39;Connell. </para>

                    <para>In 1833 - four years after Catholic emancipation - there was not in Ireland a single Catholic Judge or stipendiary magistrate. All the high sheriffs; with one exception, the over- whelming majority of the unpaid magistrates, and of the grand jurors, the four inspectors-general, and the thirty-two sub-inspectors of police, were Protestant. The chief towns were in the hands of narrow, corrupt, and, for the most part, intensely bigoted corporations. Even in a Whig Government not a single Irishman had a seat in the Cabinet. For many years promotion had been steadily withheld from those who advocated Catholic emancipation, and the majority of the people thus found their bitterest enemies in the foremost places. </para>

I have here a return, published no later than  the nth July last, showing the religious denominations, professions, and occupations of persons holding the commission of the peace in Ireland - a country in which three-fourths of the people belong to the Roman Catholic Church. The justices of the peace are divided as follows : - Episcopalians, 332 ; Presbyterians, 44 ; Methodists, 6 ; Society of Friends, 5 ; and. Unitarians, 4. Out of 413 justices of the peace, there are 291 Protestants, as against 121 Roman Catholics. </para>

                        <para>- It must refer to paid magistrates, because there are far more than. 413 justices of the peace in Ireland. I really do not wish to deal more fully with this question, because I think that every fair-minded man must know that there is a very great disparity in Ireland in that particular relationship. It is not a mere matter of assertion, but a matter of actual figures, which can be easily verified. The next question I wish to put is : Will Home Rule be what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> implied, although he did not use the words - Rome Rule? It is very nearly time that we heard the last of that suggestion. I suppose that honorable senators know that the Roman Catholic Church contains in its ranks some of the most staunch anti-Home Rulers. If you want a specimen of a very extreme anti-Home Ruler, you must go to a member of the Roman Catholic Church in England ; the chance is that he will be quickly found. Speaking in a political sense, English Roman Catholics are the most bigoted anti-Home Rulers. It is a curious fact that, although this statement is made: over and over again, it is not borne out by past history. It is a matter of record that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy of Ireland were not strongly in support of Roman Catholic emancipation. Says <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. A.</inline> M.

                <para class="block">That is an Orange pronouncement. I remember the time when Monsignor Persico was sent to Ireland to inquire into Irish grievances. He was one of the most unpopular men there, because it was known that he was going to take back to Rome a report unfavorable to Ireland&#39;s aspiration for self-government. In this connexion, I may fittingly refer to the number of Protestants who have taken the part of Ireland and have given up their liberty or shed their blood for her sake. Robert Emmett died upon the gallows, while Lord Edward Fitzgerald was practically assassinated. T may also mention the name of Wolfe Tone, who died for Ireland, and the names of Mitchel, John Martin, Smith O&#39;Brien, Thomas Davis, and others of the Protestant faith, who suffered imprisonment and cruel exile for their devotion to their country. In more recent times, such men as Butt, Parnell, Biggar, Webb, and a host of other illustrious Protestants are found advocating Home Rule. But is Ireland fit to govern herself ? Here I should like to make a few remarks in connexion with the opinion which I have heard expressed toy many liberal-minded men, who, while not entertaining any positive prejudice, have shown a misunderstanding of the Irish character.

                        <para>- It has been said that some of the events that I have related are matters of long past history. But it is unreasonable to expect a nation to forget such history. The Irish have suffered from a series of bad laws for over a century. It is impossible for them to forget, though it may be easy and convenient for Englishmen to do so. But I venture to say that the Irish would be ready to forget if allowed to do so by the remedy of their grievances and the giving of their government into their own hands. They are not so revolutionary a people as is sometimes imagined. Indeed, the Irish are one of the most conservative races under heaven. Their devotion to their church in all its vicissitudes is sufficient evidence of &#39;how they cling to whatever is good. It cannot be said that they have never given satisfactory evidence that they know how to govern themselves, because the country was never more prosperous than under the <inline font-style="italic">regime&#39;</inline> &#39;of the Irish Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly, Ireland has more than her proportionate share of representation at present. But what is the reason for that? Because her people have been driven away. Does the history of any other country contain the record of such an exodus as has1 taken place from Ireland? It was not because there was not room for the people at home. There was plenty of land to feed them, and the Irish are the most country-loving people in the whole world. They leave their native land with the keenest regret, and maintain the greatest affection for it while they are away. </para>

                        <para>- They are. There is a general idea that Ireland would claim separation from Great Britain if she had an opportunity. No true friend of Ireland would support that opinion. Of course, there are extremists in every party. There are national extremists as well as labour extremists and religious extremists. But we should not take the utterances of extremists as the expression of the opinion of a whole people. There are men in Ireland who are actuated by deep animosities. They may be pardoned for that, though they are really about the worst enemies of Ireland&#39;s cause. The geographical relationship of Ireland to Great Britain must associate the two countries together for, all time. Their true interests must bring them together. They will be far stronger as a united nation than divided in sympathies, as at present. But no true friend of Ireland would argue that she should be absolutely separated from Great Britain. </para>

                        <para>- The English and the Irish are not one people, and it is not possible to make them one nation in the sense in which we usually understand the word. Why should not Ireland enjoy in the British Federation the same privileges as little Tasmania enjoys in the Commonwealth? It has to be admitted, however, that there are serious difficulties in connexion with the granting of Home Rule. The question of representation at Westminster is one of them. But they are not insurmountable difficulties. The formation of this Federation of British-speaking communities seems to me to have paved the way for recognising Ireland&#39;s true relationship to Great Britain. In reference to her present disproportionate representation in the Imperial Parliament, I would say that, if Ireland had equality of representation in the House of Lords, as Tasmania has equality of representation in the Senate of Australia, there might be good grounds for reducing her number of members in the House of Commons. </para>

                    <para>When this question of local self-government is settled in 1 1 eland, you would find emerging from places where you know them not now, men who, by their education and ability, would be looked to in a normal condition of society as natural leaders of the community. It is a great principle of statesmanship, that if you wish to make men worthy to bear responsibility you must put responsibility upon them. The degradation of Irish politics is largely due to English distrust. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Parkin,</inline> ar&#187; Imperial federationist, who was in Australia, was challenged on the platform on this particular issue, and he, with all the prejudice of many of his class against Home Rule, was obliged, by the stern logic of facts, to admit that, under any scheme of Imperial Federation, Ireland could not be denied the right to govern herself. I cannot understand why ardent Imperial federationists cannot see the inconsistency of&#34; advocating a scheme of the kind, while they deny to Ireland that principle of Home Rule enjoyed by Australia and Canada. There have been some references to the disloyalty of Home Rulers which I wish had never been uttered, and which I feel very keenly. I give way to no one in my admiration of all that is good in the British Government and British institutions. Any Australian who finds fault with the rights we enjoy under the British Crown, is not able to appreciate the best form of government that any country in the world has ever possessed. I resent the imputation made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> that 95 per cent, of Home Rulers are absolutely disloyal. That honorable senator asserted that he could prove his statement, but we know that he could not - that he was only employing a figure of speech. I should like to know what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> means by &#34; disloyalty &#34; ? Disloyalty to whom? Does he mean that the Irish people, or Home Rulers, are disloyal to the person of His Majesty the King? If so, I tell him, and other honorable senators who venture such an assertion, that they know very little of the Irish people. King Edward, to-day, could go through the most lonesome part of Ireland alone, with much greater safety than he could traverse a street in London. In Ireland, His Majesty would not need <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> be attended by a body of Life Guards. If the King were in Ireland, and there was the slightest idea that a hair of his head would be touched, &#39;he would have no more devoted protectors than his Irish subjects, who have something more than respect for him. Does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> mean disloyalty to the free institutions that we enjoy? If so, the idea is absurd. What the Irish want is an extension of those free institutions to Ireland. What is meant by &#34;disloyalty&#34;? I should like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser,</inline> or any other honorable senator who thinks with, him, to give a definition of the word. In my mind, true loyalty is akin to true patriotism - a proper pride in everything good in our country and our nation. Loyalty should arise from a proper love and veneration for all that is good and great in our country. Some time ago, when there were mad freaks here in connexion with the South African war, we had some curious definitions of loyalty. If a man did not take off his hat, cheer, and drink plenty of whisky he was for the time regarded as disloyal. One of the greatest privileges in the British Empire is the absolute freedom to criticise adversely even the institutions of our country. According to some people, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> CampbellBannerman and John Redmond were disloyal in connexion with the South African war ; yet I venture to say that if the Government of Great Britain had then fallen into the hands of either of those gentlemen as Prime Minister, that war would have been carried out with just as much honour to the Empire -as it was under <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Balfour.</inline></para>

                        <para>- In conclusion, I should like to say why I think we in Australia are justified in expressing an opinion on this question, though my remarks on this aspect of the matter have been anticipated largely by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator De</inline> Largie. If we are asked why we should affirm that Home Rule should be granted to Ireland, and that Home Rule is consistent with the best traditions of Great Britain, I, in return, ask why not make the affirmation? Are we not part and parcel <inline font-style="italic">of\</inline> the British Empire ? Are we not, every one of us, proud to belong to that Empire, and deeply interested in its welfare? Are not many of us looking forward to a greater and even more extended Federation - the federation of the Empire, and, possibly, the federation of the British- speaking race? Shall we not take an interest, &#39;to the small extent of expressing an opinion, in the mode of government of one particular portion of the Empire, which, be it said to the credit and the discredit, at the same time, of the. Empire, is the only portion which is dissatisfied, and has reason to be dissatisfied, with its government? What effect would such an expression of opinion have? If there is any. question as to the ability of the Irish people to govern themselves, we may point to every one of the British Possessions, where, when there has been no bar of creed or country, the Irish people, in proportion&#39; to their numbers, have been able to take a place equal to the highest in the political world. What possible harm can there be in the people of Australia, who enjoy the greatest plenitude of freedom, recording through their Parliament their appreciation of their institutions, and endeavouring to have them adopted in a portion of the Empire, for which&#39; many of us have sincere affection? I trust that the majority of honorable senators will see their- way to approve of this motion,  and  that the moral effect will be such that the granting of Home Rule to Ireland may be hastened. </para>

                    to whose address I have listened with considerable interest, I regret that the honorable senator who introduced the motion did not consider it an obligation on him to justify either its introduction or the proposal itself.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dawson,</inline>
                    having omitted to afford us that justification, can hardly take exception to the attitude of those who, like myself, intend to oppose the motion, and are left, as it were, to their own resources in summing up what they deem to be the underlying arguments. I propose to approach the question from two stand-points. I am not prepared to discuss the merits or demerits of Home Rule, for the very reason that my first objection to the motion would seem to disqualify me from undertaking such a task. The first stand-point is as to the propriety of our discussing a matter which purely concerns the internal affairs of another self-governing portion of the Empire, and the second is found in the arguments which, judging from their frequent use in Australia, are chiefly relied upon to support the claims of Home Rule. In considering the propriety of introducing the motion, 1 turn to its terms, and there read that, &#34; in accordance with the most treasured traditions of British Governments,&#34; and so forth. What are those traditions.

                        <para>- I think that I now have the honorable senator on the horns of a dilemma. I am endeavouring to show that it is one of the traditions of&#39; the British Empire that every independent unit of that great Empire possessing the machinery of government shall be allowed to govern itself, and that carries with it, as a natural consequence, the obligation to mind its own business. That being so, I naturally ask, have we the right - and I use the word, not in its legislative sense, because we can, if we please, pass a motion expressing an opinion on the conduct of government in any country - I might ask should we, as a matter of propriety, deal with a . question of this &#39; kind, affecting a matter so absolutely, within the functions of another sovereign Parliament? This can be tested in a way which it seems to me is extremely simple. Those who support the motion take us the position that we have a right to express opinions on matters which are within the province of the Imperial Parliament. If that is so, the Imperial Parliament must have a corresponding right to pass motions dealing with affairs here. I wonder what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> would have said, if, during the passage of the Alien Immigration Restriction Bill through this Chamber, the Imperial Parliament had passed a motion expressing its opinion as to the way in which we should conduct ourselves. The honorable senator, and those who support this motion, would justly and rightly have denounced the impropriety of the Imperial Parliament attempting to interfere with a matter, the settlement of which belongs to us. </para>

                        <para>- Surely the honorable senator can see that, whether the question is Home Rule, or anything else, there is a principle involved as to the right of a self-governing unit of the Empire and a sovereign Parliament to deal with its own affairs ? I say that we have a right to deal with the question of alien immigration, but I claim that if we have the right to pass a motion dealing with a matter of Imperial affairs, the Imperial Parliament has a corresponding right to pass motions dealing with our affairs. I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> again, whether he would not have resented, as I should have done, any attempt on the part of the Imperial Parliament to take such action with a view to influence the course of legislation here? I instance the matter involved in the Tariff, a question on which Australians are very widely divided. Would it be thought a proper thing for the Imperial Parliament to pass a motion intended to influence our action in dealing with that matter ? If we can interfere in the matter of Home Rule, which divides opinion in Great Britain, as the Tariff divides Australian opinion, the Imperial Parliament would be equally within its rights in passing a motion in the terms here adopted that, in accordance with the most treasured traditions of the British Empire, the Australian people ought to adopt a free-trade policy. If it is a proper thing for us to thus deal with any matter of Imperial concern, it is equally right for the Imperial Parliament to so deal with any matter of Colonial concern. I lay down that principle. I say that, if the Imperial Parliament attempted to do what we are now asked to do, there would be at once, from one end of Australia to the other, a protest so loud and indignant that it would not be twenty-four hours before such action would be stopped in the Imperial Parliament. Take another matter, which, though it does not differ in any way in principle, to my mind comes a little closer in detail to the motion now before us. I refer to the movement for Federation. That was a movement to distinctly alter the form of government prevailing in Australia. The motion we are asked to adopt h&#39;ere proposes a radical alteration in the form of government that prevails in Ireland. </para>

                        <para>- Even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> agrees that there is a parallel between these two cases. Suppose the Imperial Parliament had passed a motion urging us to adopt the Commonwealth Bill, what would have been said by a large section of the Labour Party opposed to that Bill in the various States? They would have been justly indignant. They would have felt that all their rights as citizens of Australia were being absolutely outraged, and they would have had no stronger argument in urging the electors to reject the Bill than the fact that the Imperial Parliament had so interfered. Still dealing with Federation, though I do not know whether we ought to take it seriously or not, we have heard some rather war-like utterances from Western Australia, in which the term secession has been used with some freedom. </para>

                        <para>- That is so; and in that case, as no doubt <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> will recognise, with a great measure of justice. I am not dealing now with the wisdom or otherwise of the talk about secession, or of the measure of real or imaginary injustice which may underlie it. Suppose some one of those who, in the name of democracy, speak in the Imperial Parliament, proposed a motion couched in similar terms to this, to the effect that the Federal Constitution ought to provide machinery to enable the dissatisfied States to withdraw from the Union. What would happen then ? Would we pay any attention to it in the first place? The only attention we should pay would be to express our strong disapprobation of any attempt on the part of the Imperial Government to interfere with affairs which are peculiarly our own. That brings me back to my starting point, that the right of any individual unit of the Empire to manage its own affairs must necessarily carry with it a corresponding obligation not to interfere with any other similarly constituted unit. It appears to me that in this motion we are departing from the principle which I have sought to lay down. It may be said that there are matters in connexion with which, as in the case of the South African war, Australia has expressed an opinion, not only by resolutions in various forms, but by practical action. But I draw a very marked distinction between a portion of the Empire expressing an opinion when the whole of the Empire is beset by some foreign enemy, and a case in which there happens to Le an internal dispute in connexion with the management of the affairs of a particular portion of the Empire. There is a very big difference between the two cases. While I think it is an entirely proper, and absolutely natural thing, that when the Empire as a whole is faced with a crisis, every portion of it should be at liberty to express an opinion on the matter, the position is very different when only the local affairs of a section of the great Empire are involved. I have endeavoured to deal with the question from the point of view of whether it is right for an Australian Parliament to deal with this matter, and I come row to our individual right to express ourselves on it in our representative capacity. This motion is brought forward in order that we may register in respect of it something more than the opinions of the thirty-six persons who constitute the Senate. It is not merely a proposal that thirty -six citizens of Australia shall express a certain opinion, but that the passing of this motion shall have behind it the fact that a body of honorable senators representing the constituencies of Australia have voiced the opinion it expresses. I ask what right have we to affirm that our constituents are either in favour of or against this motion? In common with every other member of the Senate, I represent the State from which I come in its entirety, but I am not prepared to say what are the views of the people of New South Wales on this matter. I have had no mandate from them and no intimation as to what their wishes are, though I may reasonably assume that they are divided on this question. It is entirely unreasonable, therefore, to ask me to affirm, as a representative of New South Wales, that the people of that State are in favour of this motion. </para>

                        <para>- We will admit that. It does not matter that a country is separate geographically. I am not now saying whether the people of Ireland are entitled to self-government or not. I am raising the question of whether it absolutely and necessarily follows that men, having democratic leanings, shall support the claim of any section of the people of a country to self-government. If that be so, it follows that, quite apart from Ireland, when any section of the people of any country ask for separate legislative machinery, it ought to be granted them. Are those who support this motion prepared to say that? </para>

                        <para>- It appears to me that it is. I direct the attention of honorable senators to an instance that occurred not long ago in Queensland. There was a demand in Queensland for the separation of that Colony into three separate Colonies, and I may say that I know of no argument put forward in support of the demand for Home Rule, and in support of the general contention that it is democratic to support a proposal for local self-government, which could not have been used in support of the demand&#39; made by Northern and Central Queensland for separate forms of government. What happened in that case? Did the democrats of Queensland support those demands? I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> to say what was the attitude of the staunch&#39; democracy of Queensland on the proposal made to divide that Colony into three Colonies. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> I am sure, will admit at once that, while there are a certain number of labour men who supported the demand, there were others who opposed it. I mention the instance as showing that it does not follow necessarily that because a section of the people of 1 a country enjoying legislative sovereignty desires separate legislative; machinery, every friend of democratic institution is bound to support such a demand. No doubt those who supported the proposition had good reasons for their action, but I think that its opponents had stronger and better ones for their opposition. The principal reason which animated a great number of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart&#39;s</inline> friends was that they feared, at any rate at one time during the negotiations, that if self-government were conferred upon the northern, and perhaps the central, divisions, it would result in black labour States being formed. That fear animated very many of the democrats when they opposed the proposal. </para>

                        <para>- Otherwise I intended to read a statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dutton</inline> on a Bill which proposed to separate the State under some form of financial readjustment. It practically confirms what I have just said, and what the honorable member admits. It would have been an absolutely sound reason for the strongest democrats to oppose the gift of self- government to North Queensland if they feared that, as a result of its being granted, the action of the new State would have been such as to jeopardize the social, economical, and political interests of the State. Therefore&#39; it does not follow that every section of the community, when it so desires, is entitled to have separate legislative and administrative machinery. We have to consider the interests of the remainder of the original political unit. The same principle might have been applied with regard to the American Union, and the unfortunate events which led up to the civil war. There was a demand made by a number of the States that they were entitled to absolute self-government. What answer did the Union give? &#34;We cannot,&#34; the Union replied, &#34;concede that right. We have to consider the interests of the whole country, and the secession of so many States therefrom would, in our opinion, seriously jeopardize not only the immediate but the permanent interests of the Republic.&#34; Consequently the demand was refused. Every argument which has been put forward here in favour of the mere contention that any section of the people has the right to self-government could have been applied then ; but the &#39; Americans, at an enormous cost of blood and treasure, disputed the contention, and fortunately, in the interests of the world, they were successful. I suppose that there is hardly an American to-day who is not congratulating himself, at any rate in his mind&#39;, on the result&#34; of the civil war. </para>

It denied to Ireland the right to manage her fiscal affairs, to control her constabulary, or to deal with her coinage and legal tender.

The original Bill contained a distinct provision for the protection of the minority.

                    <para>- After the lengthy and interesting speech made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy,</inline> I think it would be unwise on my part to deal at any length with the subject-matter of the motion. I certainly disagree with those who consider that because Australia is distant so many thousands of miles from England, and that Ireland is in such close proximity to England, we ought to allow this question to remain absolutely in the hands of the English people, and to take no part either one way or the other in the endeavour to influence the decision on a question which appears to rest absolutely with the Imperial Parliament. As a part of the British Empire, we have no right to bind ourselves to anything which we may consider to be a living wrong. We may love England very dearly, and we may feel all the pride that is the stock-in-trade of the average patriot, but it would be unwise on our part to shut our eyes to the wrongs which other people are receiving at the hands of England. It is for this reason that I have advocated Home Rule for Ireland for many long years. With me it is not a question of yesterday, &#39; or of ten or twelve years ago. For the last twenty-five years, I. have been convinced that Home Rule should be granted to Ireland. I feel that I ought to support this motion, because I believe&#39; that when it has been passed - by a very large majority, I hope - it will have some influence with the British Parliament. I believe that our voice will at least be listened to, and that the fact that Englishmen and Irishmen are associated in this movement, will induce the British Parliament to incline its ear to the request for Home Rule. By this motion, -we are not, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> suggested, endeavouring to demand something from England. We are merely asking that for the love of British traditions, for the love of liberty and justice, England shall listen to our appeal, and concede the right which has so long been withheld from Ireland. I had a few quotations to read ; but seeing that so much of the time at our disposal has been consumed, and that such a lengthy speech has been delivered this afternoon, I shall abandon most of them. In the early part of the debate, one or two questions were asked which I desire to answer. In leading the opposition to the motion, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker,</inline> who, unfortunately, is not in the Chamber at present, said - </para>

                </quote>
                <para class="block">That was a very fair request on his part, and I intend to state what I mean by Home Rule for Ireland. I have read most of the principal speeches on the occasion of the introduction of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gladstone&#39;s</inline> Home Rule Bill. Quite recently I have had the plea- sure of reading the Bill itself. But I have also had the pleasure of realizing what it is to live under a form of self-government in Australia ; and the meaning which&#39; I attach to Home Rule is this - that every vestige of liberty which we, as citizens, enjoy in Australia ought to be conceded to Ireland. She ought to enjoy as great a measure of Home Rule as we do. Her people have proved in all the walks of life that they are capable. Her sons in every part of the world have proved their capacity to fill literary positions, to ornament the legal profession, and to distinguish themselves in every trade or calling. Why should not Ireland be permitted to exercise her will by making the laws by which she is to be governed? I may inform <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> that I believe that there ought always to be a form of union between England and Ireland, and I do not think that the ultimate granting of Home Rule will interfere with our desire in that respect. But I have never yet known a man: who liked to be flogged into submission. I have never known a man who enjoyed hi&#174; position after being flogged. He would not be a man if he did. Those who prattle about their love for Ireland and their loyalty to England should bear in mind that a country should make her citizens love her if she wants them to be loyal ; whereas a country that makes her citizens despise her will make them disloyal in a very short time. I believe in a higher and better union between England and Ireland than that which exists to-day. I believe in the kind of union expressed, not by an Irishman or a Roman Catholic, but by a Protestant and a great man, who made use of the words which I shall quote. I refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Grey,</inline> who ultimately became Earl Grey. In the year 1800 he stood up in the House of Commons and protested against the bartering away of Ireland&#39;s rights, and defended her cause in the following terms : - </para>

                    <para>What I most heartily wish for is a union between the countries, but by a union I mean something more than mere word union - not of Parliaments, but of hearts, affections, and interests, a union of vigour, of ardour, of zeal for the general welfare of the British Empire. It is this species of union, and this only, that can tend to increase the real strength of the Empire, and give to , it security against any danger. </para>

                <para>It is that kind of union which I believe will be the outcome of the extension of Home Rule to Ireland. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> interjected, while <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> was speaking, &#34; I come from Scotland, which has a smaller proportion of representation, than Ireland has in the Imperial Parliament. The Scotch have only 72 representatives, whilst the Irish have 105, and yet they are not satisfied.&#34; There is a verv good reason for that. There is even a better justification for the case of the Irish people than that given by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> to-day. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> simply had regard to numbers of representation,&#39; without remembering that, throughout the history of the relationship between Scotland and England, Scotch laws have been as clearly Scotch as it is possible to make them, and English laws as clearly English as possible, whilst Irish laws contained no trace of Irish sentiment or Irish aspirations. In other words, Scotch Jaws passed by the British Parliament have always expressed the will of Scottish people. </para>

There may have been one or two cases in which that expression has been retarded, but ultimately the Scottish mind has been imprinted upon the Statutes relating to Scotland. The same may be said in reference to English law. But in the case of Ireland we must candidly admit that there is scarcely an impression of Irish sentiment upon the Statutes that have been passed for her government.

                    <para>Scotland, wisely recognised by England, has been allowed and encouraged in this House to make her own laws as freely and as effectually as if she had a representation six times as strong. The consequence is that the mainspring of law in England is felt to be English, the main-spring of law in Scotland is felt by the people to be Scotch, but the main-spring of law in Ireland is not felt by the Irish people to be Irish. I am bound to say - truth extorts from me the avowal - that it cannot be felt to be Irish in the same sense as it is English and Scotch. </para>

                </quote>
                <para class="block">The very best .way to make this people loyal is, in my opinion, to give them the right of all free men, all intelligent men, and all right-thinking men, namely, the right to govern their own country. I believe that I am&#62; as loyal a British subject as there is in Australia to-day. But I am only loyal to that which is good and noble in our English customs and systems. I am only loyal to anything that I can honour, and which I feel that I can open my heart and conscience to. But I. am disloyal to everything that is unmistakably bad in the institutions of my own country, and it is that disloyalty which prompts me, in my love for my country, to advocate reforms. That is the feeling with which we ought to credit Irishmen. If an Irishman is disloyal, though, of course, he is not, his disloyalty is simply the reflection of a man - it is his manhood that makes him disloyal. I know that an Irishman is disloyal to all that is bad, but I am absolutely satisfied that he is loyal to everything that is good and noble. I wish to see the day dawn in&#39; my time when Ireland shall have the Home Rule which her sons now demand. I shall not recount the circumstances under which the Union, of Great Britain and Ireland was effected. Home Rule was taken from Ireland by means which, under our present laws, would have landed all concerned in durance vile. It is because of the unhallowedness of that ghastly transaction that I refuse to turn back the pages of history. I trust that the Senate, by a substantial majority, will carry the motion&#39;, and thus place on record an attempt, at least, to influence a movement which we sincerely believe represents the true sense of patriotic manhood Loth in England and Ireland. </para>

                            (New South Wales). - I seconded the amendment, on the broad ground that I do not regard this as a proper subject on which to ask the Senate to give an expression of opinion. I should have been quite well satisfied if the previous question had been moved, and a vote evaded ; because it is not desirable that the Senate should place on record its views on such an issue as that of Home Rule. Our duties are &#39;distinctly laid down, and it is not wise for the Senate to unnecessarily meddle with matters of British legislation. As a Parliament, we are in no way concerned with any action that may be taken by the British Government in regard to Home Rule, and I object to be called upon to cast a vote when we may be told subsequently that it was consummate impudence on our part to interfere. Some time ago the question of the employment of Chinese on the Rand was before both Houses of the Commonwealth Parliament. What has been the effect of the resolution then passed ? The Imperial authorities courteously acknowledged the receipt of the resolution, and that is all that has happened. I dare say that if the Imperial authorities had expressed an opinion we should have been told that that was a matter in which we were not entitled to intermeddle. At that time it was urged that there were strong reasons why Australia should express an opinion. We were reminded of the assistance, whether great or &#34;Small, which Australia had given in the South African war. Here, we were told, was an evidence of the unity of the Empire ; and the claim was set up that, as Australia had taken part in that war, there was some right on the part of the people of the Commonwealth to express their views on a question prt which they had some strong feeling. Our representations, however, had no effect, and I feel quite sure that the motion under discussion, if carried, will be equally futile. This Parliament has no mandate whatever to deal with this matter of British domestic legislation. It is perfectly competent for those who favour Home Rule to organize public meetings, as has been done over .and over again, and there get expressions of opinion from men free from the trammels of legislative duty.

But I decline to recognise any right on the part of this Chamber to express an opinion on the question of Home Rule.

                        <para>.- Personally, I should give Ireland the largest possible measure of local self-government, retaining all international powers with the Imperial Parliament. I dare say that If 1 had an opportunity to raise my voice in the House of Commons on this question, 1 should be found prepared to concede a great deal to Ireland, for which country I have much respect and regard. I should, however, not favour the granting of more than a large measure of self-government. For instance, I know that a claim has been made on behalf of the Irish people to have entire control of the Customs - to have the power to make their own Tariff. </para>

                        <para>.- But in Australia, under our form of self-government, we have entire management of the Customs, raising or lowering duties against Great Britain as we like; and we also have control of the Defence Forces. Is it proposed to give Ireland control of the Defence Forces? Would that not be conceding a principle of nationality that cannot be justified, in view of the close connexion of Great Britain and Ireland? We must remember that Australia is 12,000 or 14,000 miles from the old country, and has no representation in the British Parliament, whereas Ireland is within a few hours&#39; sail of England, and returns a large number of representatives to both the House of Lords and the House of Commons. The positions of the two countries are altogether different. If we were to concede to Ireland the same measure of self-government that is enjoyed in Australia, we might possibly be confronted with similar claims by the people of Scotland and of Wales. However, we do not find either Scotland or Wales clamouring for any large measure of self-government under a form of Home Rule. I should like honorable senators to picture to themselves the state of Great Britain with three or four Houses of Parliament, all passing legislation which would possibly conflict when once the local boundaries were passed. The strength and power of the United Kingdom lies in the fact that whenever matters of Imperial moment are at stake there is but one Parliament to speak with, presumably, a united voice. In our own case, we find the powers of the Commonwealth and pf the States carefully mapped out ; and a similar arrangement prevails in Canada. What would be the position, if any one of the States Parliaments could pass effective legislation, interfering with that of the Commonwealth Parliament, which has to deal with questions effecting the whole of the States? The Parliament of each State is supreme within its own boundary, but the moment the border is crossed the Commonwealth Parliament has absolute power, or the right to acquire power as time goes on. Such a system as that is all very well ; but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> contends that the Irish are a distinct race and people, and that, therefore, they have the right to govern themselves. In advancing that argument, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline></para>

                <para>Mulcahy is on dangerous ground. If the Irish are to be regarded as a distinct race and people, so must the Scotch and the Welsh. They may just as truly be said to be separate nations and separate races. We should then have sovereign powers in four different instances within the kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has referred to what has happened in Sweden and Norway. There we were told that they were a united people, but distinct races. But to-day we find that the people of each of those distinct races desire to stand alone, and the fostering of the idea of distinction of race has tended, not to concentration,&#39; but to disintegration. I could wish that honorable senators, and indeed the people of the old country, would try and realize that what is really wanted is to make the people of the United Kingdom one people and one nation, that they should be fused together ; and that for the future an effort should be made to counteract the idea that they form separate nations, and should therefore be given separate powers which may render them antagonistic one to the other. </para>

                        <para>.- He may- pi may not have made, such a speech, but I am not responsible for what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gladstone</inline> said. I am, I think, expressing the views which are held by the leading authorities at the present time, when I say that what is required is a greater measure of fusion of the peoples rather than the adoption of any proposal which will tend to disintegration. What has been the history of Australia? Before Federation one Colony was jealous of another, and we know that such feelings were in the past a hindrance to the! prosperity of Australia. We felt that by the establishment of Federation and a Commonwealth Parliament we should do away with the jealousies of the past, and make Australians one nation and one people. So J say with regard to Great Britain and Ireland, that, in my opinion, the truest friends of both and the most earnest British patriots are the men who will endeavour to, as far as possible, combat the feeling that there is distinct nationhood and distinct rights which should be exercised by the people of the one country as against those of the other. I have not gone into the historical aspect of the question as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> has done. Credit is due to that honorable senator for the delivery of a most interesting speech, containing a great deal of information which I have no doubt will have put thoughts on this great question into the minds of honorable senators which they would not otherwise have had. While I seconded the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford,</inline> and hope to see it passed, honorable senators supporting the motion must not think I am taking up a position of antagonism to, or have any want of ! regard for or sympathy with, the Irish race. No man can study history and&#39; learn what Ireland has done to assist the United Kingdom in the defence and maintenance of her rights) and of the rights of others, or call to mind the great men in every walk of life whom Ireland has produced, without having the fullest and most profound respect far that country. But I say that it is not good policy to do anything in connexion with this question which will tend to the disintegration of the United Kingdom. I say that the people of Ireland should be given the fullest measure of self-government, compatible with Imperial rights and Imperial sovereignty, and compatible with the welding together of the British nation. I have said that I have no definition of what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dawson</inline> means by Home Rule. Even if I had, I would not know what is meant by those who are claiming Home Rule in Ireland. We who are 12,000 or 14,000 miles away from the scene cannot understand as well, and cannot have as full a knowledge of, the feelings, aspirations, desires, and inten-tions of those men as those on the spot, who have an opportunity of hearing them; of mixing with them, and of knowing exactly what their wishes are. Again, I say, it is better that we in Australia, who, whether Irishmen or Englishmen, desire to live in the utmost amity one with the other, should leave this matter, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford&#39;s</inline> amendment suggests, to be decided by the good sense and justice of the British nation, which in our day will, I believe, never be looked to in vain. </para>

                    <para>- I do not propose to speak for more than two or three minutes, because I believe it is the wish of the majority of honorable senators, if not the unanimous wish of the Senate, that we should come to a vote on this question to-day. The subject of the motion is certainly a very tempting one on which to make long speeches, and some honorable senators have yielded to the temptation. It should be unnecessary for me to tell those who have noticed the big round ring in the fore part of my name that I intend to vote for the motion. I&#39; think that any one of my name who is not prepared to support such&#39; a motion should not continue to retain the name. If it were not for the strong desire on the part of honorable senators to take a. vote on the question, I should probably be disposed to go into history, and, as some honorable senators have done, to give my reasons at some length for supporting the motion. In a long and interesting speech <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> has referred to the earnest and enthusiastic work done and the speeches made in the cause of Home Rule by many great members of the House of Commons and men who have been great in other walks of public life during the last century. Seeing that numerous quotations from recent utterances of authorities on the question have been read in this Chamber and in another place, and knowing that during the last century leading public men in Great Britain, in Ireland, and in other parts of the world, have expressed themselves strongly in favour of the proposal that Ireland should be granted autonomy, it is unnecessary for me to detain the Senate with further references to what has been said so many times. There are just two phases of the question to which I wish to address myself. One was introduced very early in the debate, but I am very pleased to have noticed that it was not re-introduced this afternoon. However, I think it is my duty to refer to it. We know that the first&#39; loud note of opposition to this motion came from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser,</inline> and I wish the honorable senator were present this afternoon. </para>

                        <para>- I suppose if he were not ill he would be here. It would be far more satisfactory to me to be able to say what I intend to say in the honorable senator&#39;s presence, but I cannot help his absence. I. regret extremely that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser,</inline> or any other member of the Senate, should have attempted to mix this question up with that of sectarianism. Throughout <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser&#39;s</inline> speech in opposition to the motion there was nothing but rampant sectarianism. It is deplorable that in this young country of Australia any public man should bring the element of sectarianism into the discussion of a motion of this kind when all the evidence before him goes to show that it has no relation whatever to such a question. I am very glad indeed that in the speeches made this afternoon for and against the motion this slimy serpent of sectarianism has been allowed to remain where it should have remained all along. As an adherent of the Roman Catholic faith I have always repudiated, as I do now, the suggestion that the question of religion has anything to do with my opinion as to whether Ireland should be granted autonomy or not. </para>

                        <para>- Luckily this afternoon no such suggestion has been made, but I deeply regret that it should have gone forth to Australians in the pages of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> that any member of the Senate should have gone out of his way to say that this was chiefly a religious question, and that it was only because Home Rule meant Rome Rule that certain public men in Australia were supporters of the proposal. So much for that phase of the question. The second phase on which I desire to say a word has just been referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould.</inline> The honorable senator and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford,</inline> who has moved the amendment, in speaking in opposition to the motion, took up the position that no House of Parliament in Australia has any right to interfere in the concerns of the Imperial Parliament. I say that if is altogether too late for the Senate or the Federal Parliament to take up that attitude. We have interfered on former occasions, and we have just the same right to interfere now. After all, I look on this motion as no unwarrantable interference. It is surely no unwarrantable interference for the Parliament of any self-governing portion of the Empire to respectfully lay before the Imperial Parliament at the heart of the Empire an expression of its opinion on the right of people in any other portion of it to govern themselves. That is all we shall do if we pass this motion, as I Hope we will. As we know perfectly well, Australia has already taken a pretty active part in interfering with the concerns of the Imperial Parliament. Although the South African war was a matter which affected the whole of the British Empire, it was the Imperial Government that was primarily responsible for that war. This Commonwealth, following up the action taken by the various States Governments&#39; before Federation, in despatching, contingents to assist the Empire, sent a Federal contingent to take part in the war, and in that way the Federal Parliament interfered in a most emphatic and practical manner in the important concerns of the Empire. It seems to me that any interference involved in this motion must be very small as compared with that. On another occasion, also, we thought we were justified in interfering in the concerns of the Empire. This Parliament passed a motion addressed to the Imperial Government, and expressing the opinion of the people of Australia on the employment of Chinese in South African mines. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think it was altogether a snub, as has been said, and the Imperial Parliament did not say thai we had no right to express an opinion on that occasion. I make bold to assert that if the motion be passed - and I am glad to learn that a similar motion was passed in the other House this afternoon by a majority of twelve - it will receive favorable consideration at the hands of the Imperial Parliament. I have no desire to speak at length, tempting as the subject is to me. I could not allow a vote to be taken without expressing my opinion, even in these few words. Had it not been for the deplorable introduction of the sectarian element into the consideration of this question, which is absolutely outside sectarianism, I should not have spoken. I trust, sir, that the motion will be carried. </para>

                    <para>- As a division is to be taken on the motion, to-day, I should be sorry to record my vote without, in a few sentences, stating the position I take up. I think that we all agree with what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe</inline> has said in respect of the element of sectarianism. My stand-point is exactly the same as his - that the element of sectarianism has nothing to do with this question - and whatever view we may take of the motion or the question itself on its merits, I feel perfectly certain that we shall all eliminate from our consideration any such influence. Although we know that our excellent friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser,</inline> who, unfortunately, is absent, owing to a severe illness, is vehement in the expression of his views, still I am sure that he did not intend to rest his opposition to this motion on that ground. </para>

                        <para>- I read a little between the lines, and I am perfectly certain that my honorable friend did not intend to rest his objection entirely on that ground. The most vehement advocate, and the most strenuous leader of the Home Rule movement of recent years, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Parnell,</inline> was a Protestant. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe</inline> has referred to the conditions which affect his mind. I yield to no one in desiring to see the true genuine aspirations of every portion of the British Dominions for freedom, and for a share in its own self-government, thoroughly satisfied. But I do not agree with my honorable friend, when he uses the term autonomy to describe that species of Home Rule, which, in his judgment this motion contemplates. .We have had it disclaimed by several honorable senators. Autonomy means absolute self-government. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> expresses the view that the Home Rule desired is not autonomy in the sense of complete self-government, but something short of that, such as was indicated by the second Home Rule Bill which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gladstone</inline> introduced a considerable time after the first one was defeated. We must all remember, too, when illustrations are given, in respect of what is meant by Home Rule, from the self-government of the British self-governing Colonies, that our home rule is practically independence. If we were to discuss this matter on. its merits, does any one contend that the same measure of self-government ought to be granted to any portion of the United Kingdom? The home rule that we possess is of such a character that, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> has pointed out, we have absolute control of every department, and all the equipment of government. We are a self governing nation in the widest, broadest, and deepest sense of the term, and one ground on which I feel that wa ought to discourage, and, if necessary, to vote against, motions of this character, is that, regarding ourselves as possessing a self-government which amounts practically to independence, we should resent any interference with the exercise of that power by our own Parliament. Ever since the Commonwealth has been established, I have regarded Australia as a nation. I am a most devoted adherent to and advocate of Australian nationality, and upon all occasions I shall resent any attempt - under cover of the expression of an opinion, or of any other form of dictation, however courteous - on the pant of the Imperial Parliament to interfere with or to direct the Commonwealth Parliament as to how it should discharge its duties. I deny its competency to interfere with us, just as I deny the competency of this Parliament to interfere, even by a motion of this description, with the discretion, the judgment, and the sense of justice of the Imperial Parliament and the people who are behind it. We know quite well that measures of Home Rule involve keen issues1, raising, as they have certainly raised, party passions to a degree of which, perhaps, we have no conception in this country. On the one hand, we have no right to make suggestions as to how the Imperial Parliament should deal With the government or administration of any portion of the British Isles ; and, on the other hand, it would be a great mistake on our part, by means of a motion, even of this description, to add fuel to the flames of party strife when, as we know quite well, a general election is imminent in Great Britain and Ireland. </para>

                        <para>- My honorable friend, naturally and rightly, expects that it will have an influence with both the Imperial Parliament and the constituencies. On the one hand, we are seeking to influence a Parliament which is perfectly competent, as the motion itself says, to deal with the subject; and, on .the other hand, be adding fuel to the flames of party strife in the consideration of this issue, when it comes before the electors next year. I therefore decline to express any opinion on the merits of the question. We, as a Parliament, have enough to do to govern our own great country. We have enough to do in determining how its different component parts - differing, as they do, in climate, production, and other , respects - shall be dealt with. And I positively decline to express an opinion as to whether Home Rule for Ireland, which does not concern us here in the slightest degree, should or should not be granted by the Imperial Parliament. My honorable friends put it that we are entitled to speak. Of course, we are entitled to discuss any question in this Parliament ; but is it wise to enter upon a discussion of this character .in respect of matters which are in the scope and jurisdiction of other Parliaments and other people? Is it wise for us to set a precedent which, perhaps, the Imperial Parliament .may follow in seeking to interfere with our doings ? How should we treat a resolution, come to after a lengthy debate in the Imperial Parliament, with regard to black labour? Or how should we treat a debate there as to the sugar bounty ? It would be probably courteous, but we should resent it all the same. I ask honorable senators to place themselves in the position of the authorities, and of the members of Parliament in the United Kingdom, when they receive such a communication as is embodied in this motion. To my mind, it is foolish, and certainly it will be futile. Reference was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;</inline> Keefe to the position in respect of the South African war. That was no interference with the control of the British Parliament over the immediate defence of &#34;those committed to its care. That was an offer of material assistance, which was given by Australia from patriotic motives, but without any interference in the policy which led to the war. </para>

                        <para>- I am not saying for a moment that a course of action such as that has not been taken. Honorable senators have referred to what was done in the case of the importation of Chinese into the Rand. We know how that was received. It was received with courtesy, but rejected, and probably if it were repeated often enough it might be rejected without quite the same degree of courtesy as on the former occasion. But we must remember that it is not those high in authority who may deal with this motion. It may be dealt with by strong anti-Home Rulers on the platform during the coming election, and certainly they will not be so careful as to the language they employ in criticising our interference as would be the Colonial Office, or the Imperial Government, or perhaps the Imperial Parliament itself. I ask honorable senators to consider all these things before committing themselves to one more instance - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> has referred to one - of our desire practically to exercise a kind of patronizing control over the doings of the Imperial Parliament. I take the words which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dawson</inline> has put into his motion to heart and in respect of Ireland. They appeal to my sympathy. I belong to a different portion of the British Isles. I belong to Scotland, which has no greater degree of freedom than has Ireland. She has fought for her freedom in the past, but is perfectly content with the existing state of things, and, so far as I know, has no desire to have even the limited powers of Home Rule favoured by some of the supporters of this motion. At the same time, no one can complain of the desire of the Irish people to secure local self-government, or any other form of accession to the freedom to control their own affairs which they already enjoy. No one can. complain of that for a moment. That, however, is an issue between their people and the Imperial Parliament itself. The people of England, Ireland, and Scotland form one nation, just as the component parts of this Commonwealth of Australia now constitute one nation. And I take to heart the words of the motion - &#34; In accordance with the most treasured traditions of British government and British justice.&#34; I say that I have complete confidence in those treasured traditions of British government and British justice, and I am perfectly willing - it is my duty, in fact, and it is the duty of this Parliament, if I may say so with great submission - to trust to those traditions. I have confidence that Home Rule will be granted to Ireland if it is considered that Home Rule is consistent with those traditions ; but it will be given without our interference. For those reasons, and without expressing any opinion upon the merits or demerits of Home Rule itself, I shall be found recording my vote against this motion. </para>

                    <para>This is no doubt a very important motion. I do not think there can be any question of greater importance to a country than its defence. But while agreeing with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> as to the necessity of doing something tangible in the way of training our people for defensive purposes, I am not quite sure that he has hit upon just the right scheme. I take it that his intention is that military drill shall be a portion of the common school curriculum. I am not sure that it is desirable that military drill in the commonly accepted sense of the term should be introduced in our schools. In the first place, what is the purpose of this military drill ? Is it to teach boys how to turn to the right or the left, to form fours, and stand erect, or, perhaps, the &#34; goose step &#34; ? So far as I understand the matter, that is the common idea of military&#34; drill. What we ought to do with boys of twelve who are at school, is to ground them in education, so as to make them as fit as possible to play their part in life, while cultivating, so far as we can in their school time, their physical powers. In my opinion, the ordinary rough and tumble sports of the play-ground do much more to develop boys physically than any military drill we could establish. </para>

                        <para>- I have seen very few boys who do not. In different parts of Australia I have had opportunity to see boys drill at various schools, and I must say that on many occasions I have felt sorry for them. There they were, standing stiff in one position, with the school-master as drill sergeant, the latter issuing his orders, as the boys cast longing glances in the direction of the play-ground, where others were engaged enjoying ordinary sports with all the exuberance of youth. Surely those boys would be much better engaged in sports, than stuck against a wall in order to learn a number of so-called military evolutions. What we want in our Defence Force is not so much drill as physique. We desire to make the people physically strong and healthy ; and to do that we must begin at the very beginning. Every young man and young woman should be well fed, well clothed, and comfortably housed; because if we have lusty men and women, the drill may come afterwards. I suppose that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson,</inline> being a close military student, has read accounts of all the principal campaigns in ancient and modern times. If he has, he must have been compelled to come to one conclusion, namely, that it is not so much drill that tells in a, war as endurance - the power to march long distances, and bear hunger, thirst, and all the fatigues of the flesh. Military drill is very good in its place, although the English form of it is speedily becoming obsolete, as we found to our cost in the South African war. Then as to shooting, I am not sure it would be wise to trust a number of lads with rifles. We can scarcely look at a newspaper without seeing an account of one boy shooting another with a pea rifle. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot say that there are accidents in the Cadet Force, but I do know that accidents of the kind occur all over the country. I am bound! to come to the conclusion that these occurrences are not the result of ignorance, because if boys were altogether unacquainted with the weapons they would not be allowed to use them. The lads become, as I say, too familiar with the pea-rifle, or whatever it is called, and their parents or guardians permit them to use it without restraint, with the results I have described. This has become so much of a scandal in Queensland that the State Government have seriously thought of imposing a special tax on these small rifles. </para>

                        <para>- That may be so j but another object is to put down the use of these weapons. My objection to the first part of the motion is that&#34; these boys would be better engaged in the ordinary sports of the playground, so far as their physical education is concerned. If military drill is made a prominent portion of the school routine, if&#39; will have the effect of diverting the attention of the pupils from their ordinary education, and that in itself would be most serious. However important defence may be to a country, education is of much more value. After all, a country is engaged in a war only once or twice in a century, whereas the people have to earn their living every day of every year of the century. The second portion &#34;of the motion means that for some portion of a youth&#39;s life, from the age of nineteen to twenty-four, he would be engaged exclusively in military training for a certain portion of each y_ear. </para>

                        <para>- Switzerland is a very compact country, and the people live in a very limited area, and probably it is possible there to spare the young men for a certain period every year. Then Switzerland is situated in the very heart of an armed camp. No doubt the independence of Switzerland has been guaranteed by several of the great powers, but that guarantee may be torn up at any moment. The people live in constant fear of invasion, and they are compelled, by the very circumstances of their case, to make some serious sacrifice for the purpose of defence. In Australia the situation is altogether different. We are _ 4,000,000 of people spread over nearly 4,000,000 square miles, and it would be very inconvenient for a large number of our young men, who live in the bush districts, to set apart any portion of the year for compulsory military drill. </para>

                        <para>- It is not always convenient to attend the drill in the country, though it might be all right in the town. T should like to see a larger number of our young men take an interest in shooting and defence operations generally. But there is a great difference between voluntary service and compulsory service. If a man is compelled to serve, the country must pay at least some share of the cost of his service. Considering the number of young men in Australia between the &#34;ages of nineteen and twenty-four the cost of carrying out a policy of the kind proposed would probably be so great as to impose a serious burden on the taxpayer. </para>

                        <para>- As the honorable senator says, we have scared ourselves into a silly, hysterical frame of mind. I have no .doubt that, in time, this, mania will evaporate - -that it is merely ephemeral. We ought not to rush the Commonwealth into a scheme which may be found not only expensive and cumbersome, but ultimately unnecessary. We cannot lose much by delaying to take action in a matter of this kind ; because, so far as I can see, there is little danger of Australia being attacked by any outside power within the next fifty years. Australia, in my opinion, is one of the most difficult countries in the world to attack. Notwithstanding that fact, we ought not to leave everything to chance, but ought to be prepared. </para>

Suppose we were to encourage the Volunteer Forces and rifle clubs a little more than we do, would not they provide a sufficient home defence? If we enter upon a scheme of this character, we shall find that it will land us in an enormous expenditure. That cannot be avoided. In the first place we shall have to introduce drill into every school of the Commonwealth, and in order to do that our schoolmasters must all be taught drill. </para>

                        <para>- Very probably Drill instructors will have to be engaged and paid for this purpose. As I have already pointed out, when we come to deal with young men from nineteen to twenty-four years of age, they are asked by this motion to give up a certain portion of their time each year for five years. We must pay them for that. If we do not pay them an equivalent or their wages during the time they are employed in compulsory drill, we must at least pay their expenses, and that will amount to a very large sum indeed, a sum so large that, in existing circumstances, I am- afraid the Commonwealth would be unable and unwilling to stand it. We may very well be contented with encouraging our Volunteer. Forces and our rifle clubs, as well as the cadet corps already in existence, without going to the extreme suggested by this motion. This is practically conscription. If the people of Great Britain, who &#39;are separated from that armed camp, Europe, by a narrow strip of sea, can live without conscription, I do not see why we should -trouble ourselves . to adopt such a system. I would like to know if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> has considered this aspect of the question : whether it is wise that we should interfere with our industrial system? Let honorable senators consider the number of young men who would be drawn away from their ordinary avocations every year under this proposal. The thing would go on continuously, and every year the ordinary operations of trade and industry in the Commonwealth would be dislocated, as the young men employed would be compelled to hurry away to engage in drill. I hope I am as sensible as are other honorable senators of the necessity for defence, but I really do not think the case is so urgent as to require that we should go to extremes of this character. As the motion is framed, I am unable to vote for it, for the reasons I have given, and in the interests of our defence itself, as well as in the interests of economy, I hope it will not be adopted. </para>

                    <para>- I share in the general dissatisfaction which has been expressed here with regard to this mail contract. I make that statement quits frankly, although I am well aware that the contract was entered into by the late Government. At the same time, I recognise that the late Postmaster-General .was very considerably hampered in carrying on the negotiations. He found himself confronted with a position of very great difficulty, and no doubt he made every possible effort to secure the best terms he could for the Commonwealth. But, while I use the word &#34; dissatisfaction &#34; with regard to the contract, I am compelled to use a very much stronger term with regard to the Orient Steam Navigation Company. The information made public regarding the negotiations with the company was quite sufficient to raise in the mind of any ordinary man absolute disgust with their methods and tactics. I cannot forget that they threatened - and I believe that in one case they carried out their threat - to omit Adelaide as a port of call. I also know that they resorted to such unworthy tactics as to refuse to give information, not only to the Commonwealth, but to the people of South Australia, as to the time when their boats would leave. I remember an incident of a very ugly aspect indeed which occurred at Marseilles. I do not wish to blame the company where blame is not thoroughly deserved, as I think it has been in. many other cases. But that incident has never been quite cleared up to mv satisfaction. I believe that the impression 1 -which it made upon the minds of us all was that the company had again been carrying out the policy which they had made very evident in the waters near Australia. If the Government of the day had intimated clearly that they would have nothing to do with the company any longer, I should have welcomed the intimation most heartily. Feeling, as I do, that it is the proper thing to give immediate notice to the company, I move - </para>

A great many of the difficulties which confronted the late Government in .arranging the present contract arose from the fact that the time at their disposal was very short.

                        <para>- While certain steps were taken by a preceding Government, the negotiations had to be, to a cer-. tain extent, interrupted, and the late Government had to take up work which had been begun by their predecessors. There was not a continuity of effort to obtain tenders. Seeing that nearly two years&#39; notice was given on that occasion, it is eminently desirable that, immediately the present contract is ratified, we should call for fresh tenders. Obviously, there is not a day to be lost. Otherwise we shall be in just as bad a position as we were in before, and that is a contingency which I believe we all wish to avoid. That is the reason why I propose the second part of my amendment. </para>

                        <para>- Time is very much&#34; of the essence of the notice. The best course is to give the notice as soon as possible, and that is why I use the word immediately. I do not think, especially after what we heard this afternoon, that it is necessary for me to enlarge upon the desirability of adding these words to the motion, because we all heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> - shall I say in a threatening tone - ask the Ministry if they would be prepared to do just what my amendment intimates. </para>

                        <para>- Nothing could please me better than that announcement, because I believe we are all animated by a desire to do the best we can for the Commonwealth. This question has to be considered irrespective of any Ministry. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> will recognise that time is pressing, and that if the Government wish to secure, as I aim sure they do, the benefit of a good contract to Australia, no time can be lost. I must also recognise the fact that in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce&#39;</inline> s question this afternoon there was nothing suggestive of premeditation or an agreement that it should be asked. Apart from the method in which it was asked, and the circumstances by which it was surrounded, I was very glad indeed to hear the answer. It is true that my amendment was in print at the time, but I do not suppose that that fact had anything to do with the question. The motion before the Senate is divided into two parts. The first part represents merely ,a desire to ratify the arrangement which, unfortunately, was entered into by the last Government. The second part is an addition by the present Government, and, in my opinion, it contains an absolutely false consideration, It says that the Senate is of the opinion that, without varying the original contract with the Commonwealth Government, arrangements should be made by which, during the continuance of its present contract with the Queensland Government, the company, in consideration of the payment of a sum of 3s. Sd. per mile by the Commonwealth, shall agree to carry postal matter between the ports of Sydney and Brisbane. </para>

                <para class="block">That, as we all know, is not the consideration. On its face it is a false consideration. If we offered to the company 3s. 8d. a mile to carry our postal matter between Sydney and Brisbane, the offer would be promptly refused. It is quite certain that the company are not going to carry postal matter between those ports simply because they get, if they do get, 3s. 8d. per mile. We all know that they are going to carry the postal matter because they are to be paid a large sum by the Queensland Government. It is a great pity that the motion, is submitted in this form. The concluding words of the second part of the motion are - and also that arrangements shall be made for making a similar provision in the case of Tasmania. </para>

                        <para>- It is a false hypocritical statement in regard to the mileage and the payment. The assumption is that the Commonwealth is going to pay a little under &#163;5,000 to Queensland, and I believe a sum of &#163;2,000 to Tasmania. I ask what these sums are going to be compensation for? Upon what estimate are they based? I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> if his estimate of the cost of carrying .mail-matter between Sydney and Brisbane is .&#163;5,000. or if his estimate of the cost of carrying mail-matter between Melbourne and Tasmania is &#163;2,600, or whether it is not a fact that those sums have no relation to the cost of carrying the mails ? That- being so, is it not hypocrisy on the face of it? </para>

I presume that I am correct in saying that the amount to be paid in the case of Tasmania is about <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2,</inline> 600. What relation does that sum bear to the actual estimated cost of carrying mail-matter between Melbourne and Tasmania. </para>

                        <para>- It is not effective, so far as I am concerned. If this motion had been put before us containing the first part only, I should have said, as I say now, that the arrangement made was very unsatisfactory. But I should have had to vote for it. Now, however, since the second part of the motion has been added, which represents an attempt to bribe members from Tasmania and Queensland, nothing will induce me to vote for it. After my amendment is disposed of I shall leave the chamber. I shall take no part whatever in assenting to an obvious, but clumsy, attempt to bribe members from two States. If I could reconcile myself to put the whole of Australia to very great inconvenience, and to punish&#34; persons who are in no way guilty in regard to this arrangement, I should certainly vote against the whole motion. But I do not consider myself justified in adopting that attitude. I think I am bound, however, to enter my protest against such a provision as we find included in the motion. That is my attitude regarding the whole matter. I am very glad to find that, so far as I know, the Ministry intends to support my amendment ; and seeing that I have satisfied myself in entering my protest against the arrangement, and especially in criticising the latter part of the motion, I do not intend to pursue the question any further. I hope that the carrying of my amendment will enable the Government to have an opportunity, at any rate, to obtain a better service than we have by depending upon the Orient Steam Navigation Company. I have in the amendment, and I think rightly, only suggested to the Executive what should be done. Its duty is to frame the conditions of the tenders. But I should like to make this suggestion - and it is merely a suggestion - that we put to the test the question with regard to the employment of black labour or white labour on these mail boats. It has been stated that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Anderson,</inline> the manager of the Orient Steam Navigation Company., said that the employment of white labour did not add to the cost. But I think that honorable senators opposite would be extremely reluctant to take the word of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Anderson</inline> of the Orient Steam Navigation Company on anything. </para>

                        <para>- I have no hesitation in saying that much., but I will modify the statement to suit <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie&#39;s</inline> more sensitive temperament. If he were engaged in a business controversy with the manager of th&#39;e Orient Steam Navigation Company, he would be very conscious of the fact that he would have to be perpetually on his guard, and extremely careful about accepting as &#39; absolutely true the statements made in the course of any negotiations. Seeing that even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> would admit that his attitude towards <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Anderson</inline> would have to be of the nature I have described, it is singular that honorable senators opposite, with the greatest eagerness, and without the slightest hesitation, accept <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Anderson&#39;s</inline> dictum that the cost of running the mail service with white labour would not be more expensive than that of running it with black labour; or. to put it in other words, that this contract would not have been obtained on cheaper terms if the em&#39;ployment of black labour had been permissible. As honorable senators opposite accept that dictum, I would ask them to assent to alternative tenders being called for. I am perfectly willing to put this matter to the test. I do not suppose that my honorable friends, who are so very confident that the cost of carrying our mails is not increased by the white labour section of the Post and Telegraph Act, can have any objection to such a test. </para>

But that is rather beside the question, which is, that it is not possible to accept tenders for a black labour service, but quite possible to call for them. I certainly hope that the matter will be put to the test in that way. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> is at liberty to use harsh words if he likes, but, nevertheless, I suggest this as a fair test; and if honorable senators opposite do not like it they can put some obstruction in the way of its being brought about. I, at any rate, should like to see it tried. I do not think it will be denied that in consequence of the white labour section in the Post and Telegraph Act we have had to pay more for this service - not because white labour in itself is so much dearer than black, perhaps, but because the section prevents the Imperial Government from opening negotiations for the service. It is quite certain that if the Imperial Government had been unhampered in calling for tenders for the carriage of mails between England and Australia, we should have had our service at a cheaper rate. </para>

                        <para>- It is a business presumption that the Imperial Government could have secured a cheaper service. Perhaps <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> will also allow me to remind him that the present contract costs &#163;45,000 per annum more than was -paid when we passed the section in the Post and Telegraph Act to which I have referred. The mere reminder, of such a fact ought to be sufficient to satisfy <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> that, at any rate, there is some plausibility, if nothing else, in what I have said. </para>

                        <para>- So long as that section remains part of our Act, it will be impossible for the British Government to take full control of the negotiations for the service. That being so. no test can be secured, so far as the English Government is concerned. We shall never be able to put side by side a comparison of the cost of carrying our mails with black labour and with white. But we shall be able - and I should welcome it - to call for tenders in&#39; the form I have suggested ; and I cannot see how, fairly and reasonably, honorable senators opposite who support the section can object to it. Surely they are not afraid of the test. Surely, from their point of view, we run no great risk, and the Government, helped by those who keep them in office, should be bold enough, to take the step. </para>

                        <para>- - I have already explained that I think that would be- an improper course, especially as Parliament has been invited to ratify the contract. It would be fit and proper for the Senate to give the expression of opinion contained in my amendment, but, at the same time, it would be rather improper to direct this or any other Ministry to so frame their tenders as to embody in them all the conditions which have been suggested. That is purely an administrative act of the Executive. </para>

                        <para>- I think there is a great deal of necessity. It is desirable, not merely (hat the Ministry should express the desirability of securing a fresh tender at the conclusion of the present one, but that the Senate should unanimously express their approval of such a course. If there is any hitch- in the division, it will not be because the majority of honorable senators are not in accord with every word of the amendment. </para>

                    <para>- I am very glad to hear that the Government intend to notify the Orient Steam Navigation Company that the present contract will not be renewed, and that, as proposed in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons&#39;</inline> amendment, it is intended to show that even a shipping combine may not continue to dictate to a Continent as in the past. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> that on the next occasion alternative tenders should be called for ; but the alternative tenders I should favour would not be as to whether white labour or coloured labour should be employed, but as to whether the contract should be for mails pure and simple or be a mail-cum-commercial contract. I hope a special effort will be made by the Commonwealth Government to so arrange the conditions that some Australian shipping; companies may have an opportunity to tender. There are in Australia and New Zealand many shipping companies which have largely extended their fleets by the addition of some most excellent fast vessels. </para>

                        <para>- I do not say Australians, but white British subjects. And there are, I believe, fast vessels in Australian waters which could be utilised for this service, and in time of war sent out as armoured cruisers. In that way the expense could be divided between the Defence Department and the Post and Telegraph Department. It has been suggested that we should vote against the ratification of the present contract; but I cannot support that view. </para>

                            Smith deserves credit for holding out until he was able to save the Commonwealth &#163;30,000 per annum, in spite of the storm of protest and abuse from certain quarters. In fact, I believe that the first sum demanded by the Orient Steam Navigation Company was &#163;170,000, and, although, in my opinion, &#163;120,000 is far too much, the time
                            <inline font-style="italic">was</inline>
                            so short, and there was such a fear that our mail arrangements would be dislocated, that it was necessary to come to some terms. The contract cannot be determined until two years after 1st January next, and if we now bestir ourselves we can so arrange as to be independent of the Orient Steam Navigation Company, which has treated the Commonwealth in a most shameful manner.

                <para class="block">British Government. When the tenders were called for by the Commonwealth, I casually said to a very prominent business man in Australia, whose name I shall not mention, that I hoped there would be some good offers, and the reply he gave was that I need not trouble my head, because there would be only one tender, and that from the Orient Steam Navigation Company - that the other shipping companies dare not tender. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford,</inline> when: speaking last night, tried to buttress his case by saying that there were comparatively few British ships fast enough to compete for this service. That, to my mind, enormously strengthened the allegation that there is a combine, because, under the circumstances, it is much easier to make an agreement under which it is possible, practically, to dictate to Australia what shall be paid for the carriage of the mails. Australia has been made the sport of this shipping combine - has been made the subject of a gigantic squeeze. The first demand of the Orient Steam Navigation Company was, as I say, for .&#163;170,000, or considerable more than double the previous subsidy of &#163;72,000, and more than double the sum paid to the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company for a very much quicker service. The only possible threat that Australia was able to hold out was that we would resort to poundage rates if the demands were absolutely extortionate. Then they came down to ,&#163;150,000. They published a lot of alleged facts with regard to the losses they were making. </para>

                    Smith held out they came down to &#163;120,000. Previously we were paying them ,&#163;72,000, and as I have said, the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company are being paid about that sum at the present time for a quicker service with superior boats. The cost of the service at poundage rates would have run to &#163;10,000 a year, and if the mails were carried in bulk under the Berne Convention, the cost would be .&#163;15,000 a year. That being so, we are paying ,&#163;110,000 a year extra to secure a little more regularity and celerity under the mail contract. As
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline>
                    has pointed out, the company in their negotiations resorted to all kinds of threats. They first tried to intimidate South Australia by saying that their boats would not call at Adelaide. Then they stated that in the off-season they would run their ships only once a month. I presume they proposed to lay up half of their fleet, so that it might not be earning anything at all, in order to spite Australia.

The only possible excuse which the .company could have for demanding an increased subsidy lies in the conditions other than those connected with a purely mail service imposed on them under the contract. We said that they must have a certain, space for cold storage, and matters of that kind. That may have involved increased expense to the company to meet which an increase in the subsidy might have been necessary. 1 I think there was some correspondence to the effect that the conditions advertised were so stringent, and the penalties proposed so great, that an increased subsidy was necessary on that account. </para>

                    stated that Western Australia receives the chief benefit from this mail contract. That is incorrect. Western Australia gains no greater benefit than any of the other States, and she has to pay a
                    <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline>
                    contribution to the cost of the service in the same way as the other States.
                </para>
                <para class="block">There appears, to be equality between the States, so far as the purely mail service is concerned. But when we come to consider the commercial aspect of the service involved in the conditions requiring cold storage and accommodation for cargo, Western Australia is not so well placed. It is well known that that State does not export anything but timber and gold. As the timber is exported in sailing ships, it is clear that Western Australia receives no benefit whatever from the increased subsidy paid as the result of the commercial conditions of the contract. In this respect Western Australia is worse off under this contract than is any other State in the Commonwealth. We should call for tenders for a mail service only, running between Adelaide and Naples, with the right given to the companies tendering, if they care to avail themselves of it, to run their boats round to Melbourne, Sydney, and Brisbane. All that we should stipulate and pay for is a purely mail service. That is the attitude which is always adopted by the Imperial Government. It was stated <inline font-style="italic">\v</inline> one of the speakers that when the question of cold storage was mentioned in connexion with the contract between the Imperial Government and the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, the Imperial Government said they would make a contract purely and simply for a mail service. We should call for tenders for a mail service, and for alternative tenders for a mail and commercial service combined, when we could learn the extra amount required to be paid for imposing commercial conditions. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> expressed the hope that for the next contract alternative tenders would be called for a mail service conducted with white crews and for a service conducted with coloured crews. Australia has suffered a great deal in consequence of the statements made as to the object of the Federal Parliament in insisting on the condition requiring that ships under the contract should be manned with white crews. The attitude of Australia in this matter has been misrepresented to the people of the world, and she has been defamed by certain persons with the object of securing a party triumph over their political opponents. The statement has been made that a certain party in the Federal Parliament desires not only that there shall be a White Australia, but that the coloured peoples of the world shall not be allowed on the high seas. No party in the Federal Parliament has ever said or thought such, a thing. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> has told us that the general opinion in England is that we advocate not only a White Australia, but a White Ocean policy. We have been told that we have adopted a dog-in-the-manger policy in saying that we shall not allow coloured people to come to this huge, continent. I do not suppose that one per cent, of the people of Australia would&#39; be so recreant&#39; to its best interests as to consent to allow coloured people to come here. We are, however, told that the White Ocean policy is but a part of the White Australia policy. I have never subscribed to that doctrine. As I understand the White Australia policy, it is that, for national, racial, and industrial reasons, we say - and we have crystallized our decision in an Act of Parliament - that for all time people of the coloured races shall not be allowed to reside in Australia. This question of white crews on &#39;vessels subsidized bv the Commonwealth has with me no necessary relation to that policy. Is have always supported the proposal chiefly for reasons of defence.. </para>

We are told that the British Navy is the bulwark of our liberties ; that it is our safeguard against foreign attacks, and that we must rely on our sailors for the continuity and the safety of our Empire. And the very first thing they will tell you in case of attack is that, with the rapid creation of ironclads and battle-ships, we must draw on the mercantile marine for our sailors. If our sailors are to be lascars, it is perfectly plain that we cannot man our men-of-war except with coloured Asiatics. Therefore, the very strength of the British Navy is sapped by this intrusion of coloured people. </para>

                        <para>- I say that the number of British sailors is decreasing, whilst the number of those required in the Navy is increasing, and the policy of displacing British sailors with coloured crews strikes at the maritime supremacy of Great Britain. I have not the temerity to make such a statement on my own account. I am fortified in the view I hold by the opinions expressed by some of the ablest and most patriotic men in Great Britain, who can claim to have an intimate knowledge of the subject, such as Admiral Bowden-Smith, Admiral Hopkins, the members of the Navy League, Lord Brassey, and other eminent authorities. These have all pointed to the danger threatening Great Britain in her naval policy. If it had not been for the defence aspect of the question, the section of the Post and Telegraph Act to which so much exception has been taken would not have been carried by the Federal Parliament. Those who have been our most virulent critics with regard to the White Ocean policy, as it is unfairly called, have altogether overlooked the aspect of defence. Their misrepresentations have undoubtedly injured Australia. They have held up the Commonwealth Parliament to. the world as a laughing stock, and have suggested that Australian legislators, not content with insisting on a White Australia, propose to make the oceans white by sweeping the coloured races from them. That statement is not warranted by the facts, and it has done a great deal of injury to Australia. I venture to think it would be an excellent thing if not only Great Britain, but all the self-governing nations of the Empire, would lay it down as a broad principle that they will not grant any subsidy to a steam-ship company unless its vessels are manned by white British subjects. </para>

                        <para>- My object is to promote defence, because I hope we are not going to subsidize any vessels which are not capable of being turned into fast cruisers. If that policy were adopted throughout the Empire, we should have a fleet manned by British white people, who, in time of war, would serve excellently as, not only a ground from which the Navy could be recruited, but also as a large fleet of fast-armed cruisers which are absolutely necessary to protect the Empire&#39;s enormous commerce floating upon every sea. When I contend that the lascars are unsuitable, and should not be employed on these fast vessels, it is not upon ethnic grounds that I base my objections, but simply because they are not fighting men. We would not employ the lascars in the Navy, and we should not employ them in the recruiting ground therefor - the mercantile marine. A general laugh was raised on one side just n&#169;w, when I said that we were destroying the British Jack-Tar ; but let me quote a table from the <inline font-style="italic">British Year Book</inline> for 1903 - </para>

                        <para>- My point is that we should have white crews in the mercantile marine. A great number of British warships have been laid aside lately, and one of the reasons given by Admiral Fisher, who so splendidly reorganized the British Navy, was that by laying up ships which were obsolete or semi-obsolete, full crews were being provided for the effective warships. </para>

                <para class="block">I have made that quotation simply to show that, from the defence point of view, one of the greatest dangers to British naval supremacy is the fact that our recruiting ground has become depleted through British sailors being displaced by foreigners and lascars. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> asked, why should we insult the Hindoos when they have been fighting so magnificently for the Empire, by: saying that they are not good enough to man our mercantile ships? Surely the honorable senator ought to know that the lascars are a different class from the Hindoos who have fought for the Empire. The very word &#34;Iascar&#34; means a servile people. It is taken from the Persian word <inline font-style="italic">lashkar,</inline> which means a noncombatant, a public follower in the ordnance department, a supernumerary or a native sailor. In fact, the lascars are a seafaring population, who are scattered along the southern, littoral of India, and are derived principally from the aboriginal races, which never have been and never will be fighting men. You could not level a greater insult at the autocratic Brahmin princely Rajput, the valiant Sikh, and the fighting Ghoorka than to tell them that they are of the same class as the original inhabitants, the lascars, who are employed in our fleets. </para>

But I am trying to argue that it is not advisable to employ them on the ships, which are not only a recruiting ground for the Navy, but are capable of being turned into fast cruisers for our defence. You could not level a greater insult at the fighting races of Northern India than to class them with the Iascar race. It would be equivalent to saying that the aborigines of Australia are of the same race as ourselves. </para>

                        <para>- I have already said that on subsidized ships we should have British white subjects, because we require them for fighters. If we desire to subsidize steamers for the carrying of produce - and it may be advisable for us to do so - we should consider that question separately from the mail contract. If Ave insist that for commercial reasons the vessels shall call at Sydney and Melbourne, I do not see how we can logically refuse to include in the contract a provision for them to call at other State capitals. It is against the intention of the Constitution that <inline font-style="italic">We</inline> should expend Commonwealth&#39; money to benefit certain States when we do not afford the same privileges to other States. In common fairness, these vessels should also call at Brisbane. At the present time, Queensland pays &#163;15,000 a year towards the Commonwealth subsidy to the Orient Steam Navigation Company. In other words, that State pays exactly the same as any other State for the service, and is, therefore, entitled to equal privileges. But Queensland, in order to reap the same advantage as New South Wales and Victoria - an advantage to which she is equally entitled - has had to pay &#163;26,000 a year, and we have relieved her.- of the payment of &#163;4.766. As a matter of common fairness that State is entitled to object to the conditions which she has had to bring about in order to gain the same privileges as Melbourne and Sydney, when all the States are paying equally for that service. If we pay a steam-ship service for the carriage of mails and produce between Great Britain and Australia, they must go to all the States, if it is to be a fair arrangement. We are paying ^26,000 a year for the Vancouver mail service and getting very little advantage from it. Our exports and imports by the vessels are very small, and so also is the mail matter. If the contracting company is going to call at other ports than the one for the delivery of the mails - the nearest port to Vancouver - then undoubtedly on the same line of reasoning every State should benefit equally from the expenditure. VVhy should not Western Australia be able to send her timber to Canada? </para>

                    SMITH.The timber of Canada is pine, whereas the timber of Western Australia is hardwood. If, for commercial reasons, we are going to subsidize a steam line between an outside nation and Australia, then every State should benefit equally by the service. The Vancouver mail contract should simply provide for the carriage of mails between Vancouver and the nearest port, whether it be Brisbane or Sydney. We should not compel the vessels to go anywhere else. The mails can be sent by train to the other States. The contract with the Orient Steam Navigation Company should be for a service between Naples and Adelaide, and no further. If the company likes to run its vessels beyond Adelaide it can do so, but we should1 pay nothing extra on that account.

                        <para>- It would be for the; company to arrange for such contingencies. I trust that when the new tenders are called for, if the Government does not confine itself to calling for tenders between Naples and Adelaide, it will, at any rate, call for alternative tenders, so that we can see what extra amount we are paying for the commercial considerations which we impose. I hope that the Government will endeavour to have such provisions inserted in the contract that it will pay some of the enterprising Australian shipping companies - say trie A.U.S.N. Company - or a combination of them, to put on steam-ships to carry our mails between Naples and Adelaide. </para>

                        <para>- We are calling for tenders which will be due in about two years&#39; time. The companies will have plenty of time to obtain steamers if they desire to enter the trade. One of the great advantages in notifying the Orient Steam Navigation Company that we do not intend to continue the contract after January, 1908, is that it gives time for the Australian companies to prepare tenders for the service. I also trust that there will not be alternative tenders with regard to white and coloured labour, and that we shall see that the vessels are of such a nature that they can be used as fast armoured cruisers in time of war, and manned exclusively by white British subjects. Then we shall have done something towards the defence of Australian commerce, and shall not be the sport of a shipping combine which dictates to us whatever terms it likes. </para>

                    <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator .Clemons</inline> has endeavoured to show that this ought not to be looked upon as a party question. I should have thought that if he considered it to be a non-party question he would not have adopted the role which oppositionists are supposed to assume - that of pitching into the Government. The Government has been charged with making a hypocritical proposal for the purpose of bribing members from Tasmania and Queensland. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> took precious good care, before he uttered that statement, and objected to the latter part of the motion, to make the reservation that he would not put his own views to the test by voting on the question. And how was it that when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> proposed to omit the provisions to which he objects, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> did not vote for the amendment ? If he was so strongly opposed to the provision relating to Tasmania and Queensland, why did he not give expression to his view ? Was he, as a Tasmanian senator, bribed bv the Government? It is a very singular thing that, although the honorable senator says that he disapproves of the latter part of the motion, believes that the Government are hypocritical in bringing it forward, and that they have done it to bribe members of Parliament, he did not vote against it when he had the opportunity. </para>

                        <para>- The &#93;ate Government also refused. But a fair and satisfactory method was afterwards agreed upon. As Queensland was paying for the steamers to go to Brisbane, it was only fair that the Commonwealth should pay a certain rate per mile on the scale paid for carrying the mails from London to Sydney. Having granted that concession to Queens- land, we were bound, in common fairness, to grant the same privilege to Tasmania. Tasmania was carrying her mails from Melbourne to her own ports at her own expense. , </para>

                        <para>- I do not know. I only say that the principle upon which we agreed to pay to Queensland a certain sum applies equally to Tasmania. That appears to me to be absolutely fair. The reason why we cannot actually estimate the amount in the case of Tasmania is that sometimes the steamers go to Burnie, and at other times they go to Launceston, which is a longer journey. They are to be paid for the actual mileage run. </para>

She already pays her share for bringing out the mails from England by the Orient Steam Navigation Company in common with the rest of the Commonwealth. \ If we make this concession to Queensland, we are bound to make it also to Tasmania, and to give her a corresponding sum, even if the amount is in excess of what she now has to pay. </para>

The subject was brought up by the Postmaster-General, with &#187;a strong recommendation that we should, immediately after the ratification of the contract, and before the 1st January next, give notice to the Orient Steam Navigation Company to terminate the agreement, .so that there might be as long a period as possible in which to call for tenders, and to enable companies that desired to tender to obtain the necessary ships to carry out the contract if accepted. </para>

Honorable senators may have a suspicion in their minds, and make .all sorts of insinuations ; but they are not quite sure, and I do not intend to enlighten them. The position I take is that the proposal made is our policy, which we intend to carry out; and surely the Senate may trust the Government in the matter. Why should we not carry the motion in the same terms as were agreed to in another place? I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> to withdraw the amendment. </para>

As to the White Australia policy, the Commonwealth has been grossly and unfairly blamed for what has occurred in connexion with the mail service. In 1894 the Premiers and the Postmasters-General of the various Colonies unanimously requested the postal authorities in England, when tenders were called for, to secure a provision for the employment of none but white crews. At that time, I believe, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid</inline> was Premier, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joseph</inline> Cook was Postmaster-General, of New South Wales. But the Commonwealth Government received nothing but blame when, at the first opportunity which presented itself, they endeavoured to carry out the policy unanimously approved by the Colonies in 1894. </para>

                    <para>- I have nothing to do with the quarrels of the Government or the Opposition, but regard the question purely from the stand-point of a senator who is desirous to uphold the rights and privileges of the Senate. I shall not refer to some of the ugly words used in the course of the debate, except to say that, although Queensland is supposed to be unduly influenced in the matter, the probability is that if a vote were taken for or against the contract more senators from Queensland than from any other State, would be found voting against it. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> had deliberately said that his motive in moving this amendment was to cast a reflection on the Government, or express a want of confidence in their administration, I should still feel it my duty to vote with him. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> has distinctly stated that he has no such desire, and I cannot see why the Government, if the amendment be carried, should regard that as a reflection on their administration. Whatever may have been the intentions of the Minister in another place, he did not say that the Government were going to give notice to terminate the contract, but that, while he asked the House to agree to the ratification, he thought they ought to give early notice, so that there might be sufficient time in which to obtain tenders. </para>

                        <para>- There might be such changes in the political atmosphere as would place it within the bounds of possibility that notice would not be given in connexion with this particular contract. It will be observed that the Orient Steam Navigation Company has so arranged matters that two years&#39; notice must be given within the next two months and a half. It will certainly strengthen the hands of the Government, and of Parliament, if this Senate speaks with &#39; a unanimous voice, but, if not, by the voice of a majority, in favour of notice being given as soon as the contract is ratified. Many people endeavour to cast reflections on the Senate, one section holding that the Senate has no right to interfere in matters of this kind, and the other section taking the view that no one cares what the Senate does&#39;. I desire to show both sections, whenever the opportunity arises, that the Senate considers that it has a right to express an opinion as to the expenditure of the money of the Commonwealth. If another place has been so short-sighted as to accept an expression of opinion on the part of a Minister as something binding on the Government, it is our duty to place it on record that we do not take the same view. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> when submitting this motion, said, &#34; I think that, if it is the wish of the people of the Commonwealth that the contract should be terminated, notice should be given early.&#34; When I asked him, by interjection., how he proposed to ascertain the wish of the people between now and January, he gave no reply. I then asked him what his own opinion was, and he then said, &#34; I have not stated that I am not in favour of giving immediate notice, and I have not said that the Government are not in favour of that course.&#34; The -representatives of the Government said nothing of a definite character until the reply to the question this afternoon ; and, without doubt, that reply was given after notice of the amendment . </para>

                        <para>- It does not matter whether the reply was by arrangement or not. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> moved the amendment, the Government, seeing the attitude of the Senate, ought to have gracefully accepted it at once. I trust, in the interests of the Commonwealth, that the Government will not call for a division, and thus compel some of their supporters to vote against the amendment. We desire to show the Orient Steam Navigation Company, and any other shipping combine, that the Senate is, fully seized of the position, and that objection is taken to the levy made on the Commonwealth in the shape of the exorbitant charge for the mail service. I intend to vote for the amendment if a division be called. </para>

                    <para>- This matter has developed so much that, as one who was associated with the late Government in. the earlier stages of the negotiations, I think I may fairly take a hand in the discussion. I am disappointed that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> did not conclude his speech with an intimation that he accepted the amendment!. It seems to me that if anybody has reason- to complain of lack of courtesy, it is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons,</inline> who gave notice of his amendment, I understood, last evening, and had it put in print. Instead of adopting a perfectly legitimate, but adroit arrangement, which was expected to have the effect of forestalling the amendment by means of a question, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford&#39;s</inline> proper course would have been to intimate privately to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> that the amendment would be accepted. </para>

                        <para>-- It would not fit me at all and I should disregard it. For a similar reason I expect <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> to disregard it, and not to permit the use of an expression of that kind, in the heat of debate, to induce him to oppose an amendment, which would give effect, as the honorable senator admits, io&#62; the intentions of the Government as they are not given effect to in the motion as it stands, an3 which would insure the support of tEe Senate. There are one or two other matters to which I desire to call attention. It has been said, as a reason why the motion should be carried at an- early date, that there is a large amount of money payable to the Orient Steam Navigation Company, which cannot be paid until the contract is ratified. We are entitled to complain, and certainly those of us who were associated with the late Government are entitled to complain, that the motion for the ratification of the contract was not brought forward three months ago. It is a monstrous thing that this Parliament should have been called upon to deal, for instance, with the wretched Commerce Bill, and that its time should be occupied with such a measure when the Orient contract might have been brought up for debate. It is three months since the present Government came into office, and if. as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> has said, they had this matter under consideration immediately they they took office, it ill-became them to withhold it from the consideration of Parliament for so long. In connexion with the statement made as to the arrangement with Queensland, I wish to- say that the late Government were never asked to give their assent to what is now submitted to Parliament. The agreement between Queensland and the Orient Steam Navigation Company was not entered into until the j st September, some two months after the late Government left office. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> was mistaken, I am sure inadvertently, in saying that the late Government had at first refused the .request of Queensland to contribute to what she was paying under her contract, and that, therefore, the present Government were in exactly the same boat as their predecessors. There is no foundation for that statement. </para>

But whatever criticism may be passed on the late Government in connexion with this or any other matter, they are entitled to credit for the resistance they offered to demands, first for &#163;170,000, and then for &#163;150,000, which amount was for weeks and weeks held out as the ultimatum. All honour and credit are due to the late Postmaster-General, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sydney</inline> Smith, who exhibited great skill, firmness, and fairness in carrying on the negotiations which led to this contract. Honorable senators will remember the disturbance that was set up, and they know how easy it is to get up an agitation in business circles. </para>

                        <para>- I will not say whether it was hysterical or not. There may have been good grounds for a great deal of it. We know how sensitive commercial people are, and how easy it is for an agitation to swell and increase until it becomes almost irresistible, and one feels that the whole commercial enterprise of the country is being interfered with. The pressure which was brought to bear was such as to threaten to involve more or less of a collapse in commercial matters unless something were done, and in point of fact the late Government were absolutely driven to make the best arrangement they could. I say here, fearlessly, that this contract with the subsidy of &#163;120,000, although I consider it was an exaction, was the best arrangement which the late Government, or any other Government, could have made at the time. I suppose that, owing to the fact that a vote was taken, yesterday, it will be impossible to have the questions involved in the motion divided ; but I should like to have been able to have voted separately on the two proposals associated here with the ratification of the contract. I deeply regret that this provision with regard to Queensland is tacked on to the ratification of the contract. I shall not deal with the question of black labour, or any other kind of labour, or whether &#34;lascar&#39;&#39; is a word which comes from the Persian. It does seem to me that this proposal in relation to Queensland, whether it is just that a contribution should be made or not, is framed in such a way, that we shall be giving parliamentary ratification to what is absolutely a false pretence. For the sum of 3s. 8d. per mile the Orient Steam Navigation Company is to agree to carry postal matter between the ports of Sydney and Brisbane. What a farce that is ! We know that the company will not carry a letter or a postcard. </para>

                        <para>- Very little. Will the carriage of it be worth 3s. 8d. per mile ? I am aware that in legal matters the amount of consideration &#34;is nothing; however insignificant it is, it may support the promise. But to suggest that any one should assent to this motion as a true representation of an honest business arrangement is asking us to believe something which no one in his saner moments, and outside of politics, would believe for a moment. I am equally against this - I do not wish to call it a bribe, because my honorable friends from Tasmania are, I know, incapable of being bribed - this verbal sop proposed to be given to Tasmania. What does it mean? The motion tells us nothing. We are informed that arrangements are to be made &#34; to make a similar provision.&#34; What provision? What are the Government to be bound to? What do they propose to give Tasmania? What is to be the postal arrangement made with Tasmania? What does Tasmania desire? We have no information on these points; but Parliament is solemnly asked to put a vague phrase into the motion as a sop to Tasmania. I observe with some pleasure that there is a total absence in this motion of anything in the nature of a sop to South Australia. I have said that it is with the greatest reluctance that I agreed to the payment of &#163;120,000 under this contract, and it is with the greatest regret that I feel myself obliged to vote for its ratification. I have a very vivid recollection of the kind of strategy to which the Orient Steam Navigation Company resorted, and the petty shifts adopted at Largs Bay, for instance, in anchoring steamers a mile or two further out, in. order to make it inconvenient to reach . them, appointing an early hour in the morning, instead of mid-day, for the embarkation of mails and passengers, in order to prevent the ordinary express from Melbourne carrying the mails to Adelaide in the usual way, and compelling the people of Australia to pay for a special train for the purpose. </para>

                <para>which I should have gladly welcomed if I had been at the table submitting the contract for ratification. The first reason is that it gives effect to the unanimous desire of the Parliament, I believe, and the intention of the Ministry to give this notice; and the second reason is that it enables those of us who feel that way to vote for an amendment which will indicate to the Orient Steam Navigation Company our displeasure, to say the least of it, at the injudicious proceedings by which they brought about the contract. I appeal to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> to look at the amendment from the same point of view. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> has disclaimed anything in the nature of a reflection upon the Government; at any rate, I have no such intention. We shall be abdicating our function as a Senate unless we put on record our opinion of the matter by an intimation to the Government that we desire a contract brought about in that fashion, and so unjust in its terms, to be terminated. </para>

Members of the Ministry have pointed out - and they obviously speak with an authority which will be recognised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> - that refrigerating apparatus was provided on these mail-ships long before there was any question of inserting such a clause in the agreement. </para>

In order to be effective, it should contain a clause stipulating that the Government should not ask for tenders for a refrigerating service, because that has been provided by all these ships without any- such clause being in the contract. The effect of inserting that condition in the mail contract has been to give Queensland very grave cause for discontent.

I therefore most strongly urge an honorable senator who is not debarred, by reason of the fact that he has spoken to the main question, to move an addition to the amendment.

                <para class="block">It will be remembered that I voted for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce&#39;s</inline> amendment to strike out that portion of the motion which deals with the allowance to Queensland, and possibly to Tasmania. I am satisfied that it was the conditions under which the tender was accepted which has caused us to make that allowance. I believe that if it were a contract for the carriage of mails only we should not dream of making an allowance to Queensland ; in fact it would not be necessary. I believe that the mixing up of commercial arrangements with the necessity for carrying mails has landed us in the peculiar position of making an allowance to Queensland for a purpose which is not apparent to me. It- will be a hard thing for me to explain in Western Australia how it is that this amount is paid to Queensland when there are no mails to be carried by the steamers which&#39; are engaged to go to Brisbane. I think it is a scandal and a disgrace that the Commonwealth has beers called upon to pay the subsidy of ,&#163;120,000 to the Orient Steam Navigation Company. </para>

                        <para>- The shipping ring, by their action, squeezed the business people so hard that they got into a state of funk, started the agitation which they so successfully carried through, and eventually squeezed the Government into entering into this contract. In the circumstances, we might as well accept the position, and treat them as they deserve on a future occasion. If the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> is accepted, the best thing we can do is to ratify the contract, and at the first opportunity get even with the shipping company against which we believe we have a genuine grievance. </para>

                    <para>- I shall support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons&#39;</inline> amendment, but I cannot vote for that proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Croft.</inline> It appears to me to be a silly and unbusinesslike thing to bind the hand&#39;s of the Government two or three years before the event. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Croft</inline> does not put it as an alternative, but absolutely binds the Government to ask simply for a mail contract, leaving out altogether the question of the carriage of produce and of cool storage accommodation. No one can tell how our trade will increase, or what the exports of Australia will be two years hence. No one can tell what the inventions of science may provide for us. It may be of the greatest importance that our mail steamers should be provided with cool chambers, in addition to hold&#39;s for the carriage of mails. The whole of our producers and merchants would be against this amendment. I have been perfectly astounded at the way in which some honorable senators talk about the commercial community consisting of a handful of people. That is arrant nonsense. Every consumer in Australia is interested in the commercial community. I see no reason to hurl epithets at the heads of the gentlemen who manage the Orient Steam Navigation Company. They have done nothing dishonorable - nothing which honorable senators in their own business would consider to be unfair. I believe them to be just as honorable as any commercial nien in the world. It is monstrous to condemn them simply because they would not furnish our Government with time-tables or guarantee to call at Adelaide when we insisted on their taking our mail matter at a poundage rate of 3s. 8d. per lb. There is a unanimous feeling among commercial people that the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company and the Orient Steam Navigation Company have rendered enormous services to Australia. If, as some advocate, we nationalize the shipping business, it would be as great an act of folly as we could be guilty of. We surely ought to remember that this company has carried on business year after year at an absolute loss. </para>

                    <para>- I only rise for the purpose of endeavouring to bring this debate to a happy conclusion. Last night <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> gave notice of an amendment for a certain purpose. Today the Government, in reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> stated that what was proposed in that amendment was already part of its policy. In fact, the Government says that it intended to do exactly what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> says it should do. We have this extraordinary position now : that the very thing which every one wants the Government to do is opposed by one side, and is being forced unnecessarily by the other side. I do not believe in the Senate being a party House, and I should not like to see any step that would take the conduct of business out of the hands of the Government. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Croft&#39;s</inline> amendment seems to me to remove the whole difficulty. It proposes that alternative tenders shall be called for. By accepting his amendment the Government might obviate a difficulty. </para>

                <para class="block">Navigation Company, I had promised <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> to support his amendment. I must confess that I have very little sympathy with the attitude taken up by the Government. One would have thought that it would be glad to be fortified by the unanimous vote of the Senate. Instead of that, the Minister of Defence seems to hold the same opinion as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy,</inline> that if this amendment is pressed to a division, it will be tantamount to a vote of no confidence in the Ministry. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> is not justified in taking that view. In any case, the Senate has the conduct of this business in its own hands. It is entitled to insist if it likes upon immediate notice being given of the termination of the contract. If we believe in doing that, it will be exceedingly unwise to put our trust in the Government. We know how unreliable almost all Governments are. A Government&#39;s tenure of office is very uncertain. Before notice is given of the termination of the contract, the present Ministry may be out of power, and their successors might not feel bound to carry out a promise made casually, in answer to a question which some people say was prompted. I shall support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator demons&#39;</inline> amendment, not because I wish to humiliate the Government, or to take the conduct of business out of their hands, but because I wish to place it on record that in the opinion of the Senate notice of the termination of the contract should be given at the earliest possible moment. I intend also to support the addition proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Croft.</inline> I think the Government should confine themselves strictly to Commonwealth business, and that, in this instance, is the carriage of mails. If the Government were to propose rates for the carriage of goods over the railways of the various States, it would become at once apparent that they were interfering with business which did not concern them. It seems, however, that when a similar course is taken when arranging for the Inter-State carriage of oversea mails, no objection is taken. I must not be held as being opposed to cold storage, cheap transit of goods, or all the facilities possible being provided for the transit of goods ; but I hold that these are the business of the States. If the States choose to make the Commonwealth their agent, that is a different matter. I am sure the Commonwealth Government would be quite willing to make the best terms possible, on behalf of the States, with the steam-ship companies, always on the understanding that each State paid its proportion of the additional cost, and that that should not be reckoned as part of the cost of the carriage of the mails. I understand that the Secretary to the Post and Telegraph Department strongly objects to the conveyance of mails being connected in this way with the transit of produce. 1 do not wonder at that attitude, because the method simply loads that Department with expenditure which it ought not to be called upon to bear. I can easily understand, on the other hand, that the States wish to heap all the burden possible on the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>- When speaking on the motion last night I expressed the firm&#39; opinion that a contract of this kind should be for the carriage of mails, and the carriage of mails only. The amendment proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Croft</inline> provides that any contract called in the future shall be of an alternative character, and I cannot, neither do I wish to, avoid voting for that amendment. But I most emphatically state that I am just as much in favour as can be any other honorable senator of giving the producers of the Commonwealth every possible facility for the exportation of their goods. There is, however, a right way and a wrong way of attaining that end; and, as I say, we ought not to mix up the encouragement of the exporting business with the arrangements for the carriage of the mails. The reception given to the more important amendment submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> would appear to indicate that we have arrived at a peculiar stage in our system of Government, when party feeling enters into our calculations more than I think is desirable. Last night, several honorable senators, including myself, expressed the belief that the contract with the Orient Steam Navigation Company is a bad one, and ought not to be ratified, and that Australia was being fairly well served under the poundage system at a saving of ,&#163;38,000 or ,&#163;40,000 per annum. However, I added, if the motion for the ratification were carried, the very earliest opportunity should be taken to terminate the contract. </para>

                        <para>- Before I made that statement last night, I was informed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> that he intended resubmit the amendment which has given rise to the present position in the Chamber. It was my own. fault that I had not the pleasure of being .present when the Honorary Minister proposed the motion for the ratification of the contract ; but I am given to understand that he then said that it was the intention of the Government to give notice to terminate it at the earliest opportunity. I certainly thought I was doing right in saying I would support an amendment which I regarded as a proper one; and I am sorry that the Government, in submitting .the motion for ratification, &#34;aid* not give honorable senators some intimation of the fact that they intended to terminate it at the. earliest opportunity. Had that course been taken, I and other supporters of the Government would not have been placed in a false position. I am a general supporter o&#39;f the Government, and it is no use blinking the fact that a good deal of party capital is going to be made out of this question. The Minister of Defence has said distinctly that, if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons&#39;</inline> amendment be carried, the Government will regard it as tantamount to an expression of want of confidence in the promise they have made. </para>

                        <para>- It was remarks of the kind that led me to express the opinion at the outset that party feeling is sometimes carried a little too &#39;far. It is, without doubt, a great pity that this should be made a question of party tactics. On the one hand, we have the Government declaring their belief in the policy of terminating the contract at the earliest moment, and, on the other hand, we have <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons,</inline> a prominent member of the Opposition, submitting an amendment, notice of which was given before a number of honorable senators knew the intentions of the Government. If the Government regard this amendment as a &#34; slap in the face,&#34; or as an attempt to defeat them in this Chamber, then, naturally, they desire to have as many supporters as possible. But the amendment contains a proposal of which I approve, and, although it is moved by a member on the Opposition side of the Chamber, I feel absolutely free to vote for it. Had I known the intention of the Government to terminate the contract, I should have declared my intention to vote against the amendment, because I absolutely believe that the Government will carry out their promise. If I had not confidence enough in the Government to believe that they will carry out any promise they make, I should not be found giving them general support, and I am certain that, whether the amendment be carried or not, they will take the earliest opportunity to terminate the contract. However that may be, I do not feel compelled to vote against the amendment - an amendment which will carry into effect a principle in which I believe - simply because it is proposed by an honorable senator on the Opposition side. I repeat that it is a pity the leader of the Government in this Chamber has made this a party question. </para>

If such a term as that indicated by the Minister of Defence was used it is regrettable ; but I am not responsible for the sins of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons.</inline> Under the peculiar circumstances, I feel reluctantly compelled to record my vote in the way I indicated last night. I believe the contract should not have been entered into ; but, as the position now is, the next best course is to take the earliest possible opportunity to terminate it. I accept the assurance given by the representatives of the Government that the Government intend to give notice to the Orient Steam Navigation Company at once that it is their intention to terminate the contract. At the same time, if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> insists on carrying his amendment to a division, I shall have to support him. </para>

                    <para>- I cannot understand the position of affairs, or how this quick change has come about. This is a question which, of all others discussed in the Senate, ought to be free from party influences, and it is difficult to appreciate the attitude of the Government in the face of such a general agreement as to the desirability of terminating the contract, in making it a party question. We all recognise that the Government were powerless to do anything else than enter into this contract. It has been recognised that, no matter what Government had been in power, they would have had to deal with the same state of affairs. Iri the circumstances, I cannot understand why the Government should make this a party question. </para>

                        <para>- Not at all. After waiting eighteen months, there was really only one practical tender received, and that was the tender pf the Orient Steam Navigation Company, who had steamers fitted wilh refrigerating machinery and chambers, which they had for carrying on a commercial service under another contract which did not require them to make that provision at all. There cannot be the slightest doubt that tenders will be called for on the same lines as have been adopted in the past, so that any company that pleases can forward a tender for a purely postal service. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Croft&#39;s</inline> amendment is therefore surplusage. </para>
