                <para class="block">It will be admitted that this motion deals, with, a subject of vast importance. It strikes, at the very root of our system of defence, and suggests the question whether we have any sure foundation upon which to build: a scheme of defence worthy of the name. It deals also, to some extent, with the question of Imperial defence. Whilst I think the question of naval defence is of the very greatest importance, I do not see why we should not now consider the question of Imperial defence from a military point of view. The motion also suggests vast possibilities for the improvement of the physique of our youth and manhood, and that we may;, by a change in our system of education, improve and increase the moral and mental vigour of our citizens. </para>

                        <para>- That would be apart of the scheme. I desired the Senate,, last session, to affirm the principle of compulsory drill for youths, but I asked that a Select Committee should be appointed to inquire particularly into the cost and practicability of such- a scheme. Honorable senators will notice that in the present motion I do not ask for the appointment of a Select Committee, but I ask the Senate to affirm the principle npt only of compulsory drill for youths, but . also of some compulsory system of training for men between the ages of eighteen and twenty-three. The motion is, therefore, an affirmation of the principle of universal military training. I had a conversation with the Prime Minister before I tabled this motion, and he suggested that I should leave out any, reference to a Select Committee, and" ask the Senate merely to affirm a principle. I am glad I have done so, because I believe that is the right course to adopt. If I were to obtain the appointment of a Select Committee, it is true that it might examine a. number of military men, and obtain exceedingly valuable evidence as to whether universal military training is desirable. But the Legislature is. specially called upon to deal with principles ; and if we affirm the principle 'of universal training, our military men will, no doubt, have very little difficulty in preparing such a scheme, based on the. conditions of life in Australia, as will meet with the approval of Parliament. It is, of course, essential that we should take local conditions into consideration. I consulted with the Prime Minister because, to my great delight, I found that he was very much in favour of the scheme which I advocate. At the outset I direct the attention of the Minister of Defence to the words which the Prime Minister has uttered in this connexion. He said - </para>

                        <para>- I have not ignored the Minister of Defence. I have asked him privately to support my motion, and I understand that whilst he is in favour of it he thinks that the people will not stand it, and will be inclined to object to the cost, and also to give their time to the service of their country. I hope, before the debate terminates, to persuade the honorable senator that what the Prime Minister has said is wholly right, and that no system other than that which he advocates can possibly be adopted in Australia. Let us look for a moment at the opinions expressed bv the foremost military men of the time, "and some of the foremost politicians, statesmen, and writers, and we shall then gain some idea of the importance of the subject. The first public document from which I propose to quote is the report of a Royal Commission appointed by the Imperial Government to inquire into the conduct of the war in South' Africa. The pith of the report is contained in the following sentences : - </para>

                    <para>If the war teaches anything it is this, that throughout the Empire, in the United Kingdom, its colonies and dependencies, there is a reserve of military strength which, for many reasons, we cannot and do not wish to convert into a vast standing army, but to which we may be glad to turn again in our hour of need, as we did in 1899. In that year there was no preparation whatever for utilizing these great resources. Nothing had' been thought out either as to pay or organization, as to conditions of service, or even as to arms. Even here in England it was to be " an experiment." The new force was not to be discouraged, but it was allowed to equip itself, and it was denied anything beyond the barest complement of trained officers. </para>

                    <para>The training given to the Swiss officer may be taken as the minimum received in any country by the officers who form the framework of an army. . . . But no provision is made for the careful progressive military education before and after receiving a commission which is conspicuous in all armies, although a small number of volunteer officers attempt to acquire it for themselves. . ... We are agreed in the conclusion that the volunteer force, in view of the unequal military education of the officers, the limited training of the men, and the defect of equipment and organization, is not qualified to take the field against a regular army. </para>
                    <para class="block">Then, under the head of militia, they say - </para>
                    <para>For an increase of efficiency in the militia we must look in the first instance to an increase in the period of training. The evidence satisfies us that the principal part of this increase must be given during the recruit stage, and in view of the opinions expressed by a large majority of those officers who have appeared before us, we cannot recommend less than six months' continuous training for the militia man in his first year of service. This should be followed in the second, third, and fourth year by not less than six weeks' training. We have adopted these periods of recruit, and subsequent training, because we believe that a further extension would diminish recruiting, and deplete the force. </para>
                    <para class="block">The members of this Commission regarded the training provided for in Switzerland as insufficient, but I hope to see a scheme adopted under which we shall be able to do with less training than is required under the Swiss scheme, and at the same .time increase to a wonderful extent the efficiency of our Military Forces. Under the head of volunteers, the Commissioners say - </para>
                    <para>The governing condition is that the volunteer, whether an officer, non-commissioned officer, or private, earns his own living, and that if demands are made upon him which are inconsistent with his doing so, he must cease to be a volunteer. No regulations can be carried out which are incompatible with the civil employment of the volunteers, who ,are, for the most part, in permanent situations. . . . The cardinal principle must be adopted that no volunteer, whether officer, non-commissioned officer, or private, should be put to expense on account of his service. The cost of all instruction, of all exercises, and of all necessary travelling, should be defrayed by the State, so that no volunteer may be out of pocket in consequence of his endeavour to train himself as a soldier. </para>
                    <para class="block">Honorable senators will see from these extracts that the members of the Commission found that the volunteer, by reason of his avocation in life, is unfitted to form the backbone of a military force. They go on to say - </para>

This appears to the Commission to be the longest period practicable.

                    <para>The volunteer force has had a great effect in educating the people of Great Britain to think of the army as a national institution, and at the same time it has enlarged the ideas of professional soldiers on the subject of the means and methods of military training. We deprecate any changes which would modify the spirit which this force has cherished, or any fundamental change in its position, except as a part of s'ome comprehensive measure, which would replace both the militia and volunteer forces by an organization which, while giving greater military efficiency, and at least equal numbers, would also render permanent that sympathy between the nation and the army which, before the rise of the modern- volunteer force, was undoubtedly defective. </para>

                <para>The principles which have been adopted, after the disastrous failure of older methods, by every great State of the European continent, are, first, that as far as possible the whole able-bodied male population shall be trained to arms ; secondly, that the training shall be given in a period of continuous service with the colours, not necessarily in barracks, and thirdly, that the instruction shall be given by a body of specially educated and highly, trained officers. We are convinced that only by the adoption of these principles can an army for home defence, adequate in strength and military efficiency to defeat an invader, be raised and maintained in the United" Kingdom. To make detailed recommendations under this head appears to us to be beyond the scope of the task entrusted to us, especially as the principles which we recommend cannot be adopted without producing an effect on the regular army. But we submit the following general observations. We believe that the necessary thorough training could be given within one year, after which only one or two annual periods of a few weeks exercise or manoeuvre would be needed. The condition of such a short training being sufficient is that the instruction should be given by professional officers and noncommissioned officers. </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable senator says that, I want him to give effect to his own common-sense views and not to be led away by the thought that the people will not stand it. I ask him to recollect that leaders of men are supposed to point the way and not to follow after. Leaders of men are supposed to give emphasis to their convictions, and to carry them out. I am perfectly certain that we shall have to adopt some system of compulsory military training. But as the Minister seems to be rather averse to the motion - although I really do not understand what he means - I shall quote a few more opinions. English opinion in f avour of some system of compulsory training has increased wonderfully since I brought forward the subject last session, and as I have before me the opinions of some of the first military men in the world, as well as of other leaders of opinion, I think it would be a mistake for me to try to put their ideas into language of my own rather than to quote from them. Therefore I do not apologize to the Senate for quoting pretty freely. Lord Roberts says - </para>

                    <para>I maintain it is the bounden duty of the State to see that every able-bodied man in this country, no matter to what grade of society he may belong, undergoes some kind of military training in his youth, sufficient to enable him to shoot straight, and carry out simple orders if ever his services are required for the national defence. I believe that such a training would be of the greatest benefit to the nation, inculcating as it would a spirit of sober self-reliance in the individual, and raising the standard of physical efficiency. Moreover, there does not seem any other way by which, it would be possible to obtain the very large reserve of officers (amounting to some thousands) that is essential to our success in war, no matter under what system our army may be organized. </para>

                    French have all, time after time, given public utterance to their view that some system of compulsory military training is necessary if the nation is to have an army on a national basis to meet every possibility in time of Avar. I now come to a quotation, which I think is exceedingly apt, and I will ask the Minister to pay attention to it -

                    <para>Had we had a system of general military service, no such calamity as the Boer War need have occurred. There would have been no Majuba, and had there been any conflict between Boers and English, the individual Englishman's consciousness of his well-trained physical power and military efficiency, and the knowledge possessed alike by English and Boers, that this country could at any moment place a large army of well-trained men in the field, would have enabled both races to live side by side, as self-respecting neighbours who respected each other. A system of national service may. cost much money, but it gives in return vast gain of health and strength, of self-respect and sense of safety from wanton attack and wanton insult. Our system has cost all the lives lost, and the constitute- lions ruined, in the South African War; the loss of all those two hundred and fifty millions of money; all that weakening credit and loss of reputation which came of the war. </para>

                    <para>It may be asked, in what this system of compulsory military training differs from conscription. It differs in the most essential features. Under conscription, generally speaking, the service is not universal ; it does not fall on all classes alike. A certain number of conscripts are drawn each year, and any well-to-do youth, who may happen to be drawn, can escape service by paying for a substitute. Moreover, the officers are almost entirely drawn from the " superior " classes. With the armed nation no one, unless he were physically incapacitated, would be exempt from the compulsory training. . . . Above all, there is this vital difference, that with the armed nation there would be compulsory military training, but no military service, except in time of war, when all would be liable to be called on in proportion to their age, training, &amp;c. This system would not mean, as conscription means, the maintenance of huge bodies of men, divorced from civil life, in comparative idleness, at the expense of the industrial community. Every citizen would be a soldier, but every soldier would be a citizen. </para>

                <para class="block">In Australia we have the permanent forces, militia, volunteers, cadets, and rifle clubs. A committee of officers have suggested a scheme for the training of cadets, and in this they provide for 22,956 cadets, at a cost of , £13,606 per annum for allowances, and a total cost of , £30,700. That committee recommend that effective cadets should be allowed 10s. per annum for uniforms, and senior cadets 20s. for the same purpose. But Lt.-Col.

                        <para>- It is compulsory, but it applies to those boys who are attending schools, and only during two or three school hours in every week. We all know how various citizens, from time to time, suggest that certain subjects should be taught at the State schools; and the curriculum has become so enlarged as to be almost beyond control. I should object to the boys being taught drill, gymnastics, and rifle shooting during school hours, because I think that sort of tuition ought to be given during play hours. Another fatal objection to the scheme is that, while it may be applicable to the boys attending grammar schools and colleges, it would not meet the case of State school boys, who generally leave at the age of thirteen, or thirteen and a half years, not one being found at school after he has reached fourteen. What is the use of making the system compulsory only in regard to boys attending schools ? The compulsion ought to be' applied to all boys between certain ages, and not merely to scholars. </para>

                        <para>- But surely an hour and a half or two hours might be applied to this training during the week. I should like to give honorable senators some statistics as to school attendance, so that they may see, as I hope they will, the weak spot in Lt.-Col. McCay's scheme. The total number of males attending the schools is 361,404, with an average attendance of 237,451, so that 123,953, or one-third of the whole number, do not attend regularly. It would, therefore, appear that under this scheme boys would not be at school to be trained. The statistics of the Commonwealth with regard to the ages of our youths, apart from the attendance at school, are as follow : - Between the ages of fifteen and twenty there are about 189,472, and about 218,308 between ten and fifteen. These are the boys to whom, of course, I wish to apply the system of compulsory training. Lt.-Col. McCay goes on to say in the memorandum : - </para>

                <para class="block">How can we possibly inaugurate a system of this sort, and apply it only to the boys at school, when we know that boys leave school at the age of thirteen ? It has been found, both in the United Kingdom and in Australia, that the voluntary system, although good and admirable in its way, will not give us the numbers we require. It is monstrous for us to shrink from the idea of saying at once to the youth of the Commonwealth - " You are bound to serve the State, in return for the privileges and advantages which the State gives you." Lt.-Col. McCay has thought out his scheme exceedingly well so far as it goes ; but it appears to me to stop just where it ought to begin. Let me give honorable senators some information as to . the ages at which boys attend school. In-. </para>
                <para class="block">Victoria, boys attend school between the ages of six and thirteen ; in New South Wales, between five and fourteen ; in South Australia, between seven and thirteen; in Queensland, between six and twelve; in Western Australia, between six and fourteen; and in Tasmania, between seven and thirteen. In view of these figures, we cannot avoid the conclusion that the scheme of Lt. -Col. McCay would fail" in getting hold of the youth of the Commonwealth. Lt.-Col. McCay goes on to point out that it is very essential to have well-trained officers; and there I quite agree with him. He also says that all boys attending colleges and grammar schools should be compelled to undergo a certain amount of military training. But while there are 361,000 boys attending the State schools there are - 14,680 between six and thirteen, and 5,001 over thirteen, who attend private educational establishments in Victoria. The particulars as to the number of boys attending private schools in the other States of the Commonwealth are not available. I contend that no system will be complete unless it be compulsory, whether a boy leaves school at fourteen years of age or eighteen years of age. </para>

The secret of failure lies deeper down below the surface. It is not the War Office, but the citizen who is to blame, because he will not make the necessary sacrifices to maintain an army adequate to the needs of the Empire ; and it is to him we must look to provide the necessary driving power for that object. </para>

Is it to be supposed that Japanese soldiers would have quietly sat down till these places were relieved, or have waited till reinforcements came from England, before overrunning the colony?

                <para class="block">That is plain speaking, and I do not think that honorable senators can deny the statements made. Then another writer, the Rev. H. Russell Wakefield, Mayor of Marylebone, in a companion article to that of the Earl of Errol, says - </para>
                <para>Many people are deterred from supporting universal military training, because they hold, that it is morally© indefensible.

                <para>The universality of the teaching will cause the bonds of union between Englishmen to be better realized and more highly valued. The fact that the whole of our male population is one in its ability to be of use to the Empire may do much to draw together those separated by many circumstances which cannot be got rid of, while a truer conception of duty as citizens, exemplified by bodies well trained for service, will be an object lesson to other lands, valuable as proving not only England's strength, but also her high moral conception of national responsibility.

The time may come when we shall have to flock to the standard of the Empire, as we did in the South African war. The time may come when other nations may be jealous of our paramount position in Egypt, and we may have to fight a European combination.. There may be a great uprising in the Balkan Peninsula, and the action of the Sultan of Turkey may bring about complications in which we shall have to intervene, and a great European war may be the result. We all know that Russia has been foiled in her aggressive policy in the Far East, but she may now devote her attention to Persia, and Great Britain may have to defend her rights in that country, and her interests in the Euphrates Valley. Again, the time may come - though God forbid that we should ever have to fight our Anglo-Saxon cousins in the United States - when we may have to defend Canada for all we are worth. The time may come also when there will be a revolution in India with which the former revolution cannot be compared. </para>

I cannot help that. I am sure that the honorable senator will be left in the lurch; that he will find that he must follow his Prime Minister; and that, instead of leading the people, the people will lead him. I have read certain articles in which suggestions are made on the subject of preferential trade, and the question . of naval defence. One writer suggests that we shal'l give preferential trade to the mother country, although she will be unable to reciprocate because she cannot afford to tax food or raw material. He points out that we are deriving the verv greatest protection from the Imperial Navy, and that we cannot afford to pay as we should like - and I hope honorable senators are agreed on that point - our fair share. of the expense of it, either on the basis of population or of revenue. On the basis of population, the Colonies of Great Britain should pay £7,000,000. </para>

If we adopt some form of compulsory military service, although we may not be in a position to pay our proper proportion of the cost of Imperial naval defence, we may be able to say that we shall be ready. when the necessity arises to supply 25,000 men for foreign military service. </para>

                        <para>- From one point of view it is. But we cannot deal effectively with the question of defence if we leave everything to voluntary effort. We must know the means by which we are going to defend the Commonwealth and, if need be, assist in defending the Empire. If we are to give assistance to the Empire when it is in trouble, we must have some system laid down, and some definite plan on which the Imperial authorities can depend. Are they to be refused adequate compensation for the naval defence of the Commonwealth, and at the same time to be told that we cannot guarantee the offer of r.ooo men, or of one man, in the hour of England's trouble? </para>

                        <para>- I have done so, because the writer to whom I have referred has said that we might make up for our deficient contribution to Imperial naval defence by giving preferential trade to the mother country, and asking nothing in return. The objection to that is that it would probably be disastrous to our local manufacturers. I am submitting a national scheme for the compulsory training of men and boys, and I suggest - and the men might be consulted beforehand - that a certain proportion of our trained men might be invited to offer themselves for foreign service under certain conditions. I am merely endeavouring to point out a way by which we could make up to the mother country for our niggardly contribution towards the naval defence of the Empire. </para>

                        <para>- I am sorry to hear the honorable senator say so. This is only a very small portion of my case. I am urging that all boys should, while in school, receive some military training, and be taught the use of the rifle; and the latter part of the motion proposes that after they have left school they shall still be liable to some kind of compulsory training. I have been told by a layman that I would do much better to limit my motion to the training "of boys in school, but I have been advised by military men that we should affirm the principle of the compulsory training of men, because, whilst we may not make a soldier of a boy by training him at school, we shall make a soldier of a man by training him between the ages of seventeen and twenty-three. I hope the Senate will not shrink from affirming the principle that, no matter how little drill or training may be imparted, our youths and young men shall make some sacrifices to prepare themselves for the defence of the Commonwealth. We have a right to ask this of them in return for the advantages they derive as residents in Australia. I recollect reading a letter by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kipling,</inline> in which he referred to the enormous contribution universally levied on boys in the pursuit of football, cricket, and other games. Whoever heard of a boy attending school, and not taking part in these games? I suppose that in most schools boys are compelled to take part in them. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kipling,</inline> in his letter, pointed out that if a youth is at school between the ages of twelve and seventeen years, he will have been compelled practically to put in 2,500 hours at football, cricket, and other games, and if he is at school from ten to eighteen years of age. he will have been compelled to devote about 4,000 hours to such recreations. He adds, that if we took 10 per cent, of that time and devoted it to military drill and rifle practice, our schoolboys would be fitted to some extent to take their part in defending the country. I should think that we might take more than 10 per cent, of this time; a third, or a fourth, would be well employed if devoted to some kind of military training. </para>

                        <para>- I think my honorable friend is joking. We want the boys to play at football and cricket; but I am suggesting that a certain portion of their time should be devoted to military drill and rifle practice, which would be quite as fascinating as any game. The time devoted to such exercises should not be taken out of school hours, as Lt.-Col. McCay suggests. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Rudyard</inline> Kipling has two lines which are to the point - </para>

                        <para>- It is a compulsory system to some extent. There are four possible systems of defence for Australia. The first is to perfect the present system - to enlarge it if you like, and make it as complete as you will ; but it is a very costly system, involving an expenditure of about £560,000 per annum. The second possible course is to perfect the present system, and to add to it the compulsory training of youths. The third possible course is to perfect the present system, and to add to it compulsory rifle practice, so that every young man in the country may learn to shoot straight; and we could combine with that the compulsory training of youth, if that be thought desirable. The fourth system is that mentioned in the motion, namely, compulsory military training of some sort. That includes numbers two and three, and would provide for such military training between the ages of twelve and twenty-three. I ask my honorable friend the Minister of Defence which system he is going to adopt. He can adopt the first system if he likes. </para>

                        <para>- What the honorable senator has to administer is a system in which there are 22,000 paid men, costing about £550,000 per annum, and Lt.-Col. McCay has suggested that in time of war 40,000 is the least number of men required to protect the Commonwealth in case of a raid or a small invasion. Thus my honorable friend, in addition to the 22,000 men, has to provide for 18,000 more men, and I contend that there are not in this Commonwealth 18,000 men sufficiently trained to add to the 22,000, and to make up an efficient army. </para>

                        <para>- I tell my honorable friend on military authority that it would cost him about £200,000 a year to get those 18,000 men to make up the 40,000 which the late Minister tells us are necessary. For that sum we could introduce a system for the compulsory training of all our youths, and to a great extent of our manhood. I urge, therefore, that this system of universal training - not compulsory service - is by far the best to adopt. I do not know what arguments I shall have to meet in opposition. I have a great many more arguments and opinions, but I will reserve them for my reply. I wish to hear what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> has to say with regard to the motion. I have pointed out the views of his Prime Minister, and when I have heard his own opinions, I shall be able to produce more arguments. But I am perfectly satisfied that if the Minister will adopt some sort of compulsory military training the greatest possible benefit will accrue from it. There will be, first, greater security. It will give us a guarantee of peace; because if all the world knows that we have trained citizens throughout the Empire other nations will be very loth to go to war with us. Secondly, there will be an improvement in the physique of our people. In the third place, there will be the advantage that the system will give our people a training in sacrifice, and will bring home to them the duties and responsibilities of citizenship. In the fourth place, it will give thousands of people a valuable training in methodical habits, punctuality, cleanliness, order, and discipline, which will have a beneficial effect upon the commercial and industrial life of the Commonwealth. In the fifth place, it will bring all classes together for their mutual benefit, and will teach them the lessons of national duty and human brotherhood in a common service under the Union Jack. If my honorable friend can show that we can adopt any other scheme than this, and secure an efficient force, I shall be glad to listen to him. But I do not think he can. I would suggest to him that he should take a leap ahead, and adopt some form of universal service. There is the Swiss scheme and the Japanese scheme to choose from. Under her scheme. Japan has shown how it is possible for a people to jump to the front rank in nationhood. Her army has been an admirable success in every way. Count Oyama says that that success is owing to compulsory education and compulsory service. Under the system which prevails in the Swiss confederation beneficial results have also followed. I do not know whether my honorable friend has a copy of Lt.-Col. Campbell's pamphlet. </para>

                    <para>- I beg to second the motion. In supporting it I have to say that I think that if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> had omitted his unfortunate reference to recruiting for service abroad he would have earned the thanks of every honorable senator for bringing the question forward. But notwithstanding those remarks which I am proud to say are out of touch with the feeling of the majority of the members of this Parliament, and of public opinion I think that his motion is a very useful one, and is brought forward at a very opportune time, when the public mind has more or less been fastened on to the subject of a complete system of defence for Australia. There are times in the history of peoples when questions of this kind are much more acceptable than at others, though «the necessity for considering them may always be pressing. For instance, during the South African war. I believe that the public mind of Great Britain was very much inclined towards a system of compulsory training, or of universal service. Public attention was directed to the necessity of having a more effective means of defence and a better trained army. Since then public feeling has been allowed to cool down, with the result that, to-day, if universal training were proposed in Great Britain it would probably be a much greater task to convert the public to that way of thinking than it would have been had action been taken when the iron was hot. There is no doubt that the late war between Russia and Japan contained valuable lessons for Australia. We have seen how an Asiatic nation, which most of us considered to be merely a second or third rate power, has sprung at one leap into the first rank of world powers. Japan to-day stands in a position that no one can dispute. It would be futile and foolish on our part to shut our eyes to the lessons of the war. There is no people in the world that stands in such danger from that Asiatic people as we do in Australia. I am attributing to the Japanese no more than the natural tendencies that I should attribute to a European people, when I say .that the military laurels they have gained in the war will have at least as great an effect upon their imagination as military victories have had upon the imagination of European peoples. If we take the most advanced countries in the world - the energetic, progressive people of the United Kingdom, the cultured people of France, the far-sighted and deep-thinking people of German}' - we shall find that their military victories have always had the effect of making them jingoistic, and too prone to make war. </para>

                        <para>- Inclined to get swelled head, if I may use a vulgarism, and to swagger over others. And if that has been the effect upon Europeans, I am quite satisfied that the same will be the case with Asiatics, who have been looked down upon for generations as inferior to white men. Considering our geographical position, we have, therefore, every reason to take to heart the lessons of the war, and to begin to prepare our country for that defence which I hope we shall never need to put into requisition. If ever we do, I trust that we shall have a defence worthy of the name. I believe that we shall be able to put up a gallant fight, and we shall certainly be better able to do it if our men are given such a training as military science can furnish. This is not a party question in Australian politics. I had the honour to propose a motion similar to this at a political Labour Conference a few months ago, and, although it was not adopted, it was defeated by such a small majority, that I have reason to think that in time the Labour Party will adopt compulsory training as one of its principles. The movement is growing in every State, and I think it is bound to extend. But, while I am a supporter of the motion, I wish it to be clearly understood that I, individually, and the party to which I belong, have no sympathy whatever with wars of aggression. Such wars are totally opposed to our principles. Wherever our party has a footing, in any part of the civilized world - and it is, I hold, a worldwide party - it has absolutely condemned all wars of aggression. But it has always been most enthusiastic in supporting wars of defence that are forced upon a country. No people have rallied more fervently to the defence of a country attacked by a foreign foe than those holding democratic opinions, though we have no sympathy with anything in the nature of jingoism. I support this motion, first, because I believe that the proposition it contains is forced upon us by the necessities of our situation. The adoption of compulsory military training in Australia would be a safeguard to our country. It would not only be a safeguard against aggression from without, but I hold that it would also prove the best defence that a democracy could have. One of the most truly democratic peoples in the world, the Swiss, have adopted this system, and consequently are not afraid of attack from any quarter. But they know that, if they had a standing army, their democracy would be threatened by a grave danger. We, in Australia, have less to fear than any people in the world in that respect, as our democracy is free from the taint of militarism. That being so, we ought to make ourselves as free as possible from the danger of aggression from without. People who are not prepared to defend their country cannot, in the right sense of the word, be described as free. If a country is worthy of defence - and I know none more worthy than Australia - that defence cannot be in better hands than those of the inhabitants ; and this is a duty which should be compulsory on all who exercise citizen rights. Considering that the rights and privileges of citizenship are so general in Australia, I cannot see how any one who enjoys them could refuse to perform the accompanying duties. We cannot get away from the fact that there may be forced upon us at any time the duty of defending Australia, and if we are not prepared to offer that defence by having a thoroughly trained citizen force, we shall certainly not show to advantage. I have no doubt whatever as to the abilities of the average Australian, who is quite as capable of taking care of himself as the citizen of any other country in the world. In our athletic sports, and in the fistic arena, where a man's endurance and skill are thoroughly tested, a young Australian is always capable of giving, a good account of himself ; and I have no doubt that if military knowledge and training be placed within reach, he will, in this connexion, compare with any other citizen in the world. We have an enormous area and a verv small population, but if we* have the training <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> has indicated, I have no doubt that should the day come when we are called upon as a people to take action in our own defence, we shall have no reason to be ashamed of ourselves. I see no other way than that of compulsory military training to escape the institution of a standing army, which would not only be a menace to the democracy of the country, but would impose ari unbearable burden of taxation on the people generally. We know that the Australian does not care to pay too dear for his defence, and time and again the Defence Estimates have been severely cut down. Our military defence is not adequate under the present system, and to extend" it to the extreme limit that our finances, would bear would be objectionable. Certainly the very upmost we could afford te* spend on a defence scheme would not provide a standing army sufficient to guard a country so enormous as Australia. Under the circumstances I see nothing before us but a scheme like 'that submitted in the motion, which would give us an adequate force at a minimum cost, and cause no danger to our democratic institutions which we have laboured so hard to build up. Adam Smith, the great political economist, cannot be charged with having been a " jingo," and he laid it down as a basic principle ?hat a citizen army is the best of all armies for a free people. Adam Smith's words are - </para>

                <para class="block">In that view I agree. My acquaintance with military men, both at Home and in Australia, leads me to believe that once a man makes the" Army his profession, it monopolizes all his thoughts and energies. To such a man the institutions of the country, other than military, are as nought ; he looks on the military as the beginning and end of all things. We have endless lessons in history which show the lengths 'to which individuals deeply imbued with the spirit of militarism are prepared to go in order to uphold the system. That sort of character is not developed in a citizen army ; and the way in which to make the character of the labourer and tradesman, predominate over that of the soldier is to cause every man in the community to be a citizen soldier. This is the price we have to pay for our independence - the price we are obliged to pay in order to maintain and defend our country. I have already referred to the citizen army of Switzerland, and I should like to make some quotations from a recent and very instructive book on the subject. I find that the soldiers of Switzerland are scarcely observable to any one travelling through the country; that there is no country where militarism is less in evidence, though the whole place is practically an armed camp. The system adopted in Switzerland, which is similar in principle to that outlined by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson,</inline> is known as the compulsory-voluntary system. That may appear to be a contradiction in terms. </para>

                        <para>- However that may be, it has been adopted in Switzerland, and, perhaps, there is no institution that is more firmly established in the country. A standing army has scarcely ever been known in the history of Switzerland; if such an army were ever established there, it has been unknown, for many generations. In Switzerland, ' notwithstanding treaties which make her territory neutral, it has been found necessary to organize the whole of the people for defence; and, considering that we have no treaties which guarantee our neutrality, and that we are open at any time to attack, close as we are to Asiatic peoples who regard Australia with an envious eye, the necessity for a similar system here would appear to be much greater. The population of Switzerland is a republic made up of people who speak German, Italian, and 'French ; they are not what may be called a distinct people. But, notwithstanding the fact that the population is composed of people of the surrounding nationalities, they do not consider themselves free from aggression unless prepared to defend themselves by means of their citizen army. Our danger is not from people of European race, but from the hordes of Asiatics that are our nearest neighbours.

Indeed, many of the schools in Australia carry on gymnastic and physical training at the present time. At the Eight Hours' Demonstration in Sydney the other day I saw a very large number of scholars from the State schools give gymnastic exhibitions, including drill with field guns as well as with rifles.

Switzerland's mode of defence is thus in striking contrast to that of the great powers surrounding her. No great army is apparent to the eye in time of peace. No draft upon the youthful strength of the nation withdraws for terms of years a large body of working men into an unproductive occupation, vet by careful organization and short periods of drill, the whole able-bodied male population has been made into an army. We are carried back to the old Germanic idea of the folk as " the people in arms." </para>

                <para class="block">According to this writer, the system in Switzerland causes very little interference with the industrial life' of the community. At any rate, the time devoted to drill and training has not called for any adverse comment. And I think a similar system could be carried out here with just as much ease. Much of the training could be given in the evenings, on Saturdays, and at holiday times, and, as in every industry there are dull periods, a camp training could then be arranged. I have taken the trouble to collect some figures showing the . cost of the Swiss system as compared with the cost of the systems of other European powers. In Switzerland the , cost per armed man, namely, <inline font-style="italic">£7</inline> per annum, is the lowest in Europe. In Great Britain the cost ranges as high as <inline font-style="italic">£64</inline> per annum per armed man ; in Austria, <inline font-style="italic">£52</inline> ; in France, <inline font-style="italic">£46</inline> ; in Germany, <inline font-style="italic">£46</inline> ; in Italy, ,£43 ; and in Russia, <inline font-style="italic">£22</inline> per armed man. The financial aspect of this question is most important; and I have already referred to the severe criticism which has at times been levelled at the Defence Estimates in this Parliament, and which indicates the necessity for the most economical administration. In order to secure efficiency with economy, there is no system which we can adopt with any chance of success, except that of making every individual take his part in the defence of his country. I should like to read some extracts from a letter written by an Australian military man who took part in the South African war, and who, with a thorough knowledge of Australian characteristics and institutions, has given the subject under discussion much attention. This gentleman recognises the need for economy, and holds that it would be foolish to dress up our lads in what he calls "millinery." He also points out that the Boers fought in civilian dress quite as well as they would have fought in the most gaudy uniform; and he suggests that a badge on the arm or a number on the hat or cap is all that is necessary for military purposes. I will read an extract from the letter. The writer says - ' </para>
                <para>Drill at present day consists of about four movements, which any schoolboy can learn in a week, and has little tactical effect on fighting. Physical training, which should be begun, at school, and carried out daily until a boy leaves it, is the groundwork of every army. </para>
                <para>To add rifle-shooting, not at short and well-known ranges (good enough for the Martini-Henri), but up to the full extent of the rifle in use, at unknown ranges, and in all lights and weathers, will have the boy out of school far fitter than his ancestors to tackle daily fife, and always ready to fall in to his place on the first note of war. , </para>
                <para> To use the present electoral (districts as regimental areas, and to be able to rally every man at the polling-booth to resist an invasion bv batteries and .regiments of his own electorate as he now goes to the poll to record his vote is but the work of a day, with a proper system of skeleton army in time of peace. </para>
                <para>The Boers were quite as invisible as the British ; they fought as well, man for man, in their everyday working clothes, and to say that we .cannot do the same is giving us very little credit. </para>
                <para>We cannot afford to dress up the entire male population of Australia, and yet nothing short of these numbers can be looked upon as effective to guard an area equal to the United States of America. </para>
                <para>Nor can we provide ponies for them all ; and I advisedly say ponies, for horses are absolutely out of place for this purpose. </para>
                <para>Firstly, they cannot do the work of ponies on short rations; their own weight tires them much sooner; they offer a much larger target to the enemy ; are not so handy in any shape or form. </para>
                <para>Taken month after month, good marching infantry will go as far. When in the firing line, 25 per cent, of the effective force have to be detached to hold the horses, and during the second Boer war it was found that about 25 per cent, were permanently dismounted, from horses running short, going back for fresh ones, &amp;c, &amp;c. </para>
                <para>To lead a horse into the firing line is to court disaster; the machine-guns of an opposing force would mow down or stampede the lot, to say nothing of drawing a deadly fire on to the men who were trying to fire and hang on to their bridles at the same time - about as impossible a thing for any number of men as can well be imagined. </para>
                <para>Again, we are defending our coast, not raiding an adjacent power; and if the trains and carts cannot bring the men approximately to their posts, well, it will be a bad day when entire dependence is placed on marching a regiment from Sydney to Brisbane. </para>
                <para>If the men in the rifle clubs cannot ride now, well, they will be better on their feet, for their own comfort and that of the horse, in the day of battle; if they can ride, it is waste of time drilling riflemen like cavalry in peace. </para>
                <para class="block">Honorable senators will see that the writer of this letter seems to understand the system which was followed in the South African war. There can be no doubt that many valuable lessons for use in Australia can be drawn from the experience gained in that war. This gentleman .took part in the war from the beginning to almost the close, and, as he is an Australian, he is able to give sound advice on this matter. He points out that the dressing of men in fancy uniforms is of very little use to them in actual fighting. The Boers found it no disadvantage not to have a red coat in the firing line. It should not be forgotten that the training imparted under these schemes, wherever they "have been adopted, has greatly benefited the health of the youths who have undergone it. On this point <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> has quoted many valuable figures which further reacting on the subject would, I am sure, substantiate. We have heard that want of exercise is telling on the race at Home, and, perhaps, this applies to some extent in Australia: </para>

                        <para>- It has no doubt had some effect. We cannot expect men or boys to be healthy if they are not well nourished and well fed. We know that leading statesmen in Great Britain have said that there are something like 12,000,000 of people in the United Kingdom who are always on the verge of starvation, and no doubt hunger has had a very injurious effect on many of the youths in the mother country. I am sure that the race in Australia would be the better physically for the adoption of the scheme proposed ; and, once it were properly understood, I have little doubt that our boys and young men would take it up with enthusiasm. There would be no need to force it upon them ; and I may say at once that if I thought that this motion meant anything in the nature of conscription, I should be opposed to it. I believe that that will not be its effect, but that it would lead to our boys and young men learning many useful lessons which would be beneficial to them in after life. It should be remembered that we have already legislated in such a way that the young men who would Le effected by this motion could be called upon for service in defence of the Commonwealth. In the Defence Act we have laid it down that every male between the ages of eighteen and sixty shall be liable for service. What greater folly could there be than to provide that every man in the country should be liable for military service, if we did not also make provision for their necessary training? It will be of no use to call to the defence of the country men who will have had no military training whatever, and who will not know one end of a rifle from the other. We cannot expect men to "be capable soldiers without some training. A mob of untrained men in the field would be a greater danger to themselves than to the enemy. . Having laid down the principle of compulsory service in our Defence Act, the logical sequence is that we should provide our youths and young men with the means of learning something of the duties which they may be called upon to perform. The system outlined by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> is one which, in my opinion, should meet with the approval of the Senate. </para>

                    <para>. - I wish to say only a very few words on the motion, because I I00K upon the question as practically in the academic stage at the present time. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie has argued on the assumption that we have not a citizen army now, and that, unless we adopt some proposal of this kind, we shall by-and-by have an army which will not be a citizen army_, but which will be under the control of a certain section of the community, and will be used, possibly, to the injury of the rest of the community. That is altogether a mistaken idea. With the exception of a few men forming a permanent force, which we cannot do without, and which we must have, even though we adopt the Swiss system, the army we have at present is a citizen army. The whole of our troops are citizen troops - militia, volunteers, riflemen, and so on. </para>

                        <para>- They have every information on the subject. They have maps and plans, and they understand the question, practically, as" well as do military men here. In commenting upon Major-General Hutton's scheme, and the force he suggested on _ a peace and on a war footing, they say that it is adequate. After all, what do we require a military force for? It is for the purpose of protecting ourselves. Then the question arises: What force is likely to be brought against us? Estimates in such matters are of course arbitrary ; that cannot be helped; but military authorities have laid it down that a force of a certain strength might be expected to invade our shores. They say that no force of less than 20,000 men would ever think of attacking us, and the chances are that an invading force would not exceed 50,000 men. It is held that we have made adequate provision to meet an attack by such a force. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie and with others who contend that the most perfect system of defence would be one under which every able-bodied man in the community would be trained to bear arms and to shoot straight. That would be a perfect system undoubtedly, but the question is what would it cost, and would the people of the Commonwealth stand the expense that would be involved? It is all very well to refer to the Swiss system, and to say that we could take men away from their ordinary avocations and compel them to undergo military training, but is it proposed that they should serve without pay ? If the proposal is that the men should be paid for the time devoted to training, a very little consideration will be sufficient to convince honorable senators tha1*: the cost will be enormous. To attempt to enforce this system without pay would be to inflict the grossest injustice on the poorer members of the community, who would be taken away from their ordinary avocations, perhaps, at times which' would be most inconvenient to them, and who would lose their wages when engaged in military training. It would mean precious little to the richer members of the community, but to the rest it would mean a very great deal. </para>

                        <para>- It does not matter. So far as the Swiss force is concerned there can be no doubt that the training imparted is absolutely inadequate. It is so very small that it is extremely doubtful whether, with the exception of a few of the <inline font-style="italic">elite</inline> of the active army, they could be depended upon as being anything more than irregular troops. It can hardly be assumed that man for man the Swiss forces could stand against properly-trained and drilled troops. </para>

                        <para>- I admit that to establish a perfect system of defence we should make it compulsory that every man should undergo a military training, but in order to establish such a system, we should have to bear the expense of paying the men while they were being trained, and if they were to be properly trained the cost would be enormous. Under the Swiss system, when men are being trained for a lengthy period, they receive an average payment of 6d. per day. Recruits get 4½d., and men who have been some time in the service get 7d. per day. We should have to pay our men considerably more than that. We could not, I suppose, pay them less than 5s. or 6s. per day while they were being trained. Our population is practically the same as that of Switzerland. The population of Switzerland is about 3.900,000, whilst the population of the Commonwealth is 3,500,000. The annual cost under the Swiss system is £1,120,000; and if we were to pay our men under the scheme pro posed we should have to multiply that by twelve, and the expense would run into £12, 000,000 or £13,000,000 a year. </para>

                        <para>- If we reckon the pay which men of the Swiss forces receive as one-twelfth of what we should have to pay our men, seeing that their annual expenditure on this account is £1,120,000, we should require over £13,000,000 a year. My contention is that if we insist on compulsory service, we must pay our men fairly for the time they are compelled to devote to military training. I say that that would involve the expenditure of an enormous sum of money. I admit that the system by which a country can hope to defend itself to the best advantage must be one of compulsory military training for every able-bodied man in the community, but, so far as I can see, we are not in a position to carry out such a system. </para>

                        <para>- I think we pay 5s. per day to our men at the encampments. At any rate, the expense will be considerably increased, and it is questionable whether there is any necessity for it. I. should be willing to alter ourl present system if I could see my way to find the money, because I admit that compulsory military service is the best system a country could adopt. But in the first place I do not know that we could afford it, and, secondly, I do not know that the people of this community would agree to it. If there is one thing more than another about which the Anglo-Saxon race has held a strong opinion, it is the refusal to bow the knee to conscription in connexion with military and naval affairs. The people have refused it in the United States, in Canada, in Great Britain, and in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- That was a system adopted under great pressure, and in peculiar circumstances, when the very life of the nation depended on maintaining the strength of the fleet. Great Britain then resorted to measures which would not be justified under other conditions. "Self-preservation is the first law of nature," and a country under fear of foreign aggression may resort to a system that would not be justified under normal circumstances. But there is a great difference between the situation of Great Britain al that time and our situation today. There is also a great difference between compulsory service and conscription. Conscription is compulsion, but compulsion is not necessarily conscription. A grey mare is a horse, but a horse is not necessarily a grey mare. Conscription prevails in France, where the authorities go into a village, and take by ballot a certain number of young men of certain ages to serve in the army. In Germany, however, every young man is compelled to serve for two years with the colours. The period used to be three years. After that period of service men become members of the reserve, and may be called upon to serve in case of necessity. That is compulsoryservice. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, I think there is. If they are compelled to serve they are taken away from their ordinary work, and lose their wages. I can see no objection on principle to a paid compulsory military service, because under it" the poorer class cannot complain that they lose money, whereas the richer class, who have their property protected, are well able to pay for the service rendered. If the men are paid for their service, and there is a proper system of taxation that compels the richer classes to contribute more towards the revenue than the poorer, and therefore to bear their fair share of the military expenditure, it is a proper system. </para>

                            is exceedingly rude, and would complain if I retorted upon him in his own terms." I have looked into the matter, and I find that there is only one State in the Commonwealth in which .the cadet system flourishes to any extent, namely, Victoria. But I have made inquiries amongst school masters and others, and I find that there is not the slightest trouble in getting lads to join the cadet corps. They are only too pleased to shoulder their arms and " show how fields are won."
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline>
                            was very unfair to the late Minister of Defence in reference to the cadet system. That gentleman took an immense amount of trouble, and, I believe in the principles that he had laid down, on the whole. I am willing to extend the cadet system with the co-operation of the States Governments. It is useful to teach the boys to handle rifles, and a little drilling does them good physically. If ever the country was attacked, the training 'they received as cadets would be extremely useful. This is just like learning to swim. I learned to swim when quite a little boy, and found that after twenty years, when I jumped into the water, I could swim just as well as ever. Similarly a boy who learns to shoot as a cadet would, no matter how long he lived, be able to shoot later in life if his country required his services. We cannot, however, increase the number of cadets without the 'assistance of the States. I have left upon the Estimates the sum of ,£7,000, which the late Minister placed there for the purpose of encouraging the system. T have also under my consideration the idea of having for the cadets an inexpensive uniform, because I have found that nothing pleases a boy more than to have a nice little military cap, and a uniform, decorated with a few bits of braid
                            <inline font-style="italic">to</inline>
                            show it off. But we do not want any 'compulsion applied to the cadet system. I did not approve of that part of the late Minister's scheme, not only because it is not necessary; but also because it would involve the passing of a special Act of Parliament. We could not compel these boys to join cadet corps.

I have been living in this country over fifty years, have had a considerable family of my own, and know my neighbours and their families. I have kept my eyes open, and, as far as I can see, the rising generation compare very favorably with their parents, so far as size and physique are concerned. I do not pretend to be an Australian, having been born a Cockney, but I have five sons of my own, every one of whom is over 6 feet high, while one stands over 6ft.3in. They do not compare very unfavorably with past generations. Similarly, when I look at the children of my neighbours, I see little men about 5ft. <inline font-style="italic">6m.</inline> in height with sons 6 feet high. There is no physical deterioration there. As for the females amongst our people, it seems to me that for a considerable time past the younger generation have been growing taller and stronger. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator has dropped the Prime Minister on to me once or twice, but he does not frighten me. As a matter of fact, I do not know what the Prime Minister's opinions in this particular matter are. I have heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> say that he is in favour of compulsory military training. So am I if we can find the money. To say that we are in favour of it is one thing, but it is quite another to get the people of this country to agree to it. I am afraid that if this matter were to be brought before the country we should find that the majority of the people entertained the old-fashioned feeling of our forefathers, that no matter what might come they would never have anything but the voluntary system if possible. </para>

                        <para>- They can bring their army up to a million men if required, as they did during the great civil war. Because in Australia we have only 23,000 men enrolled it does not mean that we could not put a very much larger force in the field. We could bring that army up <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> 40,000 men, and there are 30,000 members of rifle clubs. We could probably, in an emergency, put in the field 70,000 men. </para>

I then dealt fully with every aspect of the question, and I think that, in view of the facts which were then laid before the Senate, any impartial person must come to the conclusion that much injustice has been done under the classification scheme. I showed that rights enjoyed by public servants previous .to Federation had not been continued, and that the emoluments received now are much less than were the rule under the administration of the States. With a view to affording an opportunity for discussion I now simply submit this motion, which sets forth the amendments that I consider necessary in the classification scheme. </para>

                    <para>- This seems an extraordinary procedure, considering that we have decided to adjourn from to-night until Wednesday next. There is a fairly full attendance of honorable senators, who are, I believe, prepared to go on with business at a time of the evening which ought to be the most profitable. If we have these continual adjournments for the convenience of the Government, or the convenience of some honorable senators, Ave shall find the notice-paper filled </para>

                <para class="block">Avith important business towards the close of the session, when Ave shall be called upon, probably, to meet four or five days a week. and sit until a late hour. There is now plenty of time to give proper consideration to the various Bills set down ; and we have yet to deal Avith the second reading of the Electoral Bill and the Representation Bill, while the Copyright Bill is still in Committee. As to the last measure, when it was introduced the Government thought that it could be disposed of within a few hours, and the Senate then adjourned for a week; But experience has shown that the measure contains many most contentious clauses, not the least important amongst which is clause 4, the consideration of which ought to have been resumed to-day. Then, again, there is another most contentious measure in the Commerce Bill. So long as I occupy a seat in this Chamber I shall continue- to protest against these repeated adjournments", and I shall call for a division on this motion. </para>
