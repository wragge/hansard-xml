                    <para>In the last Parliament, when they were considering the question of changing the headquarters of the Savings Bank; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Waddell,</inline> who was then Treasurer, brought down a Bill to give the Government the power to make a contract for new offices. He stated that they had to remove the </para>
                    <para class="block">Savings Bank because the Federal authorities&#39; had told them that they had to shift. The annual cost of that removal would be , &#163;24,000, and that had to be paid out of the interest on the savings of the thrifty people of the State. That could have been avoided, because, as he understood, there was no need to have forced the service out of the post-office building. </para>
                    <para>During the last month, the Federal authorities had given notice to the auditors who had been doing their work in this State, that their services were to be dispensed with, as the FedeTa-1 Government was establishing a separate department of audit in this State. He had reason to know that Queensland bad entered a strong protest against the establishment of a Federal Audit Department in Queensland, and this State had also entered a strong protest. But in spite of the protests, the Federal Government had decided to have its own departments, and the consequence was that the worthy men who had been doing for years the work of auditing the public accounts were now bundled out of their offices, and the Federal Government was going to do the work with its own officials, brought from anywhere, and at a cost in excess of what the present officers had done it. </para>

                        <para>- I made a distinct promise to the Senate that no further sums would be expended on the up-keep of Government House at Sydney unless provision were made for that purpose by Bill. I understand that the agreement between the two Governments will terminate at the end of the natural year. But we believe that there will be no trouble as regards the up-keep of the building, and the Governor-General being able to make use of it up to the 30th June next; that is, until the end of our financial year. No doubt the provision which has been made for the upkeep of the building until the 30th June, 1906, will be expended, but afterwards 110 expenditure will be incurred, and no binding arrangement will be entered into without the approval of both Houses. </para>

                            <para>- The Bill is not on the notice-paper, and may not reach the Senate. During the present session, I have been silent about the Capital site, but in consequence of remarks made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers</inline> last_Friday, I think it is desirable to refer to the matter, and, in view of the stage of the session we have reached, I propose to be as brief as possible. I would remind honorable senators that the Constitution in section 125 distinctly provides that the Capital shall be in New South Wales. Naturally that State claims the fulfilment of the provision ; but I venture to say that it is not making the claim so much on the ground of. constitutional right as on the ground of the justice upon which it is based. The settlement which was come to in that regard was based entirely on the logic of population. If we take the figures for Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania, we find that the aggregate population of those four States is considerably below the population of New South Wales, and that it takes the whole of the population of those four States, and more than one-ninth of the population of Victoria, to reach the total of the population of New South Wales. It is on that ground that it was decided that the capital should be in that State. </para>

                        <para>It is considered that the fixing of the site of the capital is a question which might well be left to the Parliament to decide ; but, in view of the strong expression of opinion in relation to this matter in New South Wales, the Premiers have modified the clause so that, while the capital cannot be fixed at Sydney, or in its neighbourhood, provision is made in the Constitution for its establishment in New South Wales at a reasonable distance from that city. Accordingly, the request of New South Wales that the capital should be in that colony was granted, but with two conditions which Victoria insisted upon : - 1. That it should not be within 100 miles of Sydney. 2. That the Parliament should sit in Melbourne until it met at the seat of Government. </para>

                            <para>- I am obliged to the honorable senator. I shall refer to that point later on. The resolution deals with these two points, that the Capital should be established in New South Wales, and should not be within 100 miles of Sydney. But the agreement on which it was based contains also the words, &#34; Provision is made in the Constitution for its establishment in New South Wales at a reasonable distance from that city.&#34; I have been glad to find that one honorable senator is entirely ignorant of that fact. I take it that whether the whole of the conditions were finally embodied in section 125 of the Constitution or not, so long as they were agreed to by the representatives of the different States, the one fact will be held to have equal weight with the other. </para>

                        <para>Since a special district has been sot apart for the Federal Capital, I may say that, so far as I have any knowledge of the feeling of the electors of Melbourne, and of the feeling of the members of this House, as well as o&#39;f the Victorian representatives at the late Convention, there will be no. attempt to keep the capital in Melbourne one single day longer than is necessary. I believe this colony would feel that such conduct constituted a breach of faith. The people of Victoria would be ashamed to cherish such a prospect, and would resent any such statement as an aspersion on their honour. Be that as it may, there stands in the Bill a provision that the capital shall be within New South Wales, and I take it that the Parliament will be removed thither as soon as a site can be selected, and that will be before any lengthy period has elapsed. </para>

                        <para>The Federal Capital, I hope, will be created at an early date on the most suitable site, not situated so as to be under provincial or metropolitan influences, but sufficiently in the interior to give a guarantee to the great ..&#39;.. of the people of Australia that their interests will be considered apart from the overshadowing influences of any town, class, or caste. I believe that the Federal. Capital can be founded in temporary fashion within three or four years of the establishment of the Commonwealth, and I hope to sec it during that period able to accommodate the Federal Parliament and its Executive. </para>

                    <para>These extracts from the speech delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> make the matter very clear. I have only to add that I do not think that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. by other</inline> utterances, and similar utterances by other men, were repudiated by public men, either in &#34;Victoria or in any other State. It was under this inducement, and with the full knowledge of these statements, that New South Wales accepted the Commonwealth Bill. It was in a belief in what was said that the people of New South Wales said &#34;Yes&#34; at the Referendum. It was with the expectation that the promise would be fulfilled, and that the interests of New South Wales would be absolutely safe that the people of that State entered into the Federation, although the Constitution provided for a Senate in which New South Wales would be represented by only six members, whilst a population less in the aggregate than hers would be represented by twenty-four members, because it was divided between four different States. Surely the trust of New South Wales was justified, and representatives of the other States are prepared to show that it was justified? It will be observed that the utmost limit of time mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> in the quotations I have given was three or four years. Within that period, at the utmost, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> expected not only that the Capital Site would be selected, but that the Federal Parliament and its Executive would actual Iv be located there. </para>

There has come gradually <inline font-style="italic">to the front</inline> a certain force - I do not know how strong it may be, but it has its mouthpiece in the <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> and this newspaper stated not very long ago that fifty years hence will be early enough to&#39; think about translating the head-quarters of the Federation from Melbourne to its. own Capital. I ask honorable senators if, on this bare recital of the facts, they do not think there is some justification for annoyance in New South Wales - that there is even .some ground for the use of strong language, and some excuse to be made for the rather heated speech delivered on Friday last by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers?</inline></para>

Then it has to be remembered that two New South Wales representatives - <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Austin</inline> Chapman - representing border constituencies, fought keenly for their own individual electorates, without reference to the condition about a reasonable distance from Sydney, and ignoring also the wishes of the majority of the people of New South Wales. Further,, the reports of the two Commissions appointed to consider the question left much to be desired from the point&#39; of view of New South Wales. One was appointed by New South Wales and one by. the Federal Government. </para>

                            <para>- These matters all tended to delay, and in bare justice they should have been recognised by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers.</inline> There is another matter. Honorable senators will remember,, that in the Senate I have most frankly recognised the honesty of those members of Parliament who have asked for information as to expenditure. The years we have passed through have not been years when the representatives of any State would have been justified in overlooking the necessity for economy. Two or three years ago I suggested the wisdom - nav the necessity - of a scheme of finance being arranged to cover a given number of years, and under which modest buildings could be constructed which ultimately could be superseded by larger and more imposing structures. To fail to recognise the honesty of opponents is not uncommon in( politics, but it has not been a failure of mine; and I have always deemed that Tasmania, for instance - which is struggling gallantly in the face of a very difficult financial position - is thoroughly justified in asking, when this Federal Capital business is pushed forward, what .it means as a matter of finance. The framers of the Constitution thought only of building with borrowed money. We have advanced, and, as I think, happily advanced, under that system of finance. But it brings difficulties with it. The cash system must be faced in all its details. These are some of the points which I think in all fairness must be remembered by those who study the subject. In these few remarks, I have, I think - as I said I would! - briefly traversed the main points connected with the subject. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers</inline> has referred to a large number of matters in respect of which New South Wales has suffered, and under which it is, perhaps, natural that he and his Ministers should smart. I do not desire to go into those matters, except to say that I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers&#39;</inline> picture is over coloured. I have thought it to be my duty to refer to this subject in order to make clear the salient points, and also in the hope, and with the expectation that I should elicit from honorable senators an expression of their willingness to do all that is necessary in the most friendly spirit to carry out the conditions of section 125. </para>

                            <para>- I will withdraw the word &#39; &#39; gross &#34; if it is offensive. I think I have given sufficient reasons why the action taken is an abuse. The Government has promised to bring in a Bill dealing with the question, and when it comes before us every honorable senator will have an opportunity to make a speech. There was no necessity to take up Ministerial time in dealing with it - this afternoon. There are only one or two points to which it is necessary for me to refer. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> has alluded to the words &#34; within a reasonable distance from Sydney.&#34; I point out that those words are not contained in the Constitution. If we were to take notice of everything that was said by persons who spoke upon or took an active part in the framing of the Constitution we might just as well do away with the Constitution itself. So far as the people of New South Wales are concerned, I believe that the question of the Capital being within a &#34; reasonable distance from Sydney &#34; never entered into their minds&#34;. Why was it that the Government of New South Wales gave the Federal Government an opportunity of selecting sites like Bombala, Dalgety, or Tumut, all at the extreme end of New South Wales? Whatever the honorable senator may say about an understanding that the Capital was to be &#34; within, a reasonable distance from Sydney,&#34; the people of New South Wales themselves, through their Ministers, never accepted that interpretation of the Constitution, or their Government would never have offered us The sites I have mentioned. The position is as plain as possible.- We have chosen pur site. New South Wales will not give us the land. The Government intends to bring in a Bill relating to nlm subject, and Parliament will have to deal with it one way or another. The responsibility for the delay that has taken place rests&#39; with New South Wales, and not with the Commonwealth Parliament.&#39; We might have been in the Federal Capital to-day had it not been for the action of New South Wales. </para>

I have here the volume of Parliamentary Papers containing documents for the first session of this Parliament. I find that the question was first opened by a letter from <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton, then Prime Minister of the Commonwealth, to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. John</inline> See, then Premier of New South Wales. The letter was written on the 13th April, 1901. I will ask honorable senators to notice the two points raised by the Prime Minister at that time. The letter is as follows : - </para>

                        <para>I desire also to state that if any other site ir&#187; New South Wales be considered by your Government to be more suitable for the purposes of the Federal Capital than those recommended in the report, I shall be glad to receive any further representations from you, and will endeavour, as far as possible, to meet your views. </para>
                        <para>I further desire to inform you that, pending the decision of the Parliament of the Commonwealth in this matter, steps have been taken to prevent the alienation of Crown lands within any of the three sites recommended by the Commissioner. </para>

                            <para>.- The four honorable senators who have supported the motion are the judges of the urgency of it. I protest against any one being permitted to brow-beat&#34; a senator because he is exercising His privileges. It is true that it has been said in the newspapers that the Government intend to have the Capital site question dealt with by a Bill. But where is that Bill? So far as we know it is not in existence. We learnt from the newspapers the other day that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> did not  even  know whether the Bill would he ready this week or next week. We do not know whether the Senate will ever see it. Even though it may be introduced in another place, it may never reach the Senate. Therefore, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> has properly brought this matter forward in order to show that there is a strong desire on the part of at least some members of the Senate that definite action should be taken in connexion with the matter, and without delay. </para>

                            <para>.- The Government assures us that it is taking steps, but we do not know that the measure will ever come before this Chamber. If the honorable senator had waited for the Bill, he might have been blocked of the opportunity to make observations which he considers pertinent, and which ought to be brought under the notice of the public. I have always said that it is a great pity New South Wales was not alive to her position at the particular juncture referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> and did not definitely offer a site to the Commonwealth Government. Had that been done, this question would, I feel, have been settled long ago. </para>

                            <para>- But how were the sites offered? The New South Wales Government appointed a Commissioner to examine the State and report, and the Commissioner did report on three sites - Bombala, Yass, and Orange. These sites were never submitted to the New South Wales Parliament, nor to the people of that State, but were simply reported upon by an officer, who, it was known,, would deal with the matter in the way he considered best in the interests of the Commonwealth, and, I presume, the interests of the State. I want honorable senators to realize that these sites were never accepted or indorsed by the Parliament of New South Wales. </para>

At the same time, there is no justification for saying &#34;these men &#39; &#39; did so and so ; and I assume that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> in using these words, extended their application to the present Parliament of New South Wales. It must be remembered, however, that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> See and his following have been practically wiped out of public life in that State, and that another party altogether is now at the head of affairs. </para>

The Parliament of New South Wales is not pledged in any way, as is shown by the fact that the Government are willing to introduce another measure, and that honorable members elsewhere talk of doing something in the nature of a compromise </para>

Whether we agree or do not agree with what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers</inline> said, we ought to be above saying that, because the Premier of New South Wales has made an attack, we shall not perform what we consider to be an act of justice as between the State and the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>.- The condition was inserted at the request of the other Premiers, in order to make the accomplishment of Federation possible. Any lawyer will admit that such a stipulation means within a reasonable distance outside the area of 100 miles. In my opinion, a reasonable distance would mean fixing the Capital, say, anywhere within 200 miles from Sydney. </para>

When the Constitution Bill was accepted by New South Wales and the other States, there was an honorable understanding, if riot a legal obligation, in regard to the Federal Capital, and I have yet to learn that the people of the Commonwealth are prepared to refuse to carry out a fair and reasonable compact. If New South Wales is dissatisfied with the choice of Dalgety, and the Commonwealth can find another site which suit9 our purposes just as well, why not select the latter? </para>

The Commonwealth will never be the success we all hoped it would be unless there is a little give and take on all sides, so that each State may be satisfied that the other members of the Federation will only do what is fair. </para>

I remind honorable senators, however, that the site of Bombala was officially reserved by the Government of New South Wales. </para>

                                was careful not to mention that the whole of this land at Bombala was reserved from sale to private individuals, in order to enable the Commonwealth Government to acquire the site for Federal purposes. That was an official action by the Government, and was never objected to by a single member of the State Parliament ; and this, in my opinon, amounts to an indorsement by Parliament of the action of the Government. The whole question as to whether the Capital Site should be 100 miles or a little more from Sydney goes by the board, when we remember that a site as far distant as Dalgety was/ still reserved from sale at the very time when the Commonwealth Parliament decided on the latter, and we have had no intimation since then that there was any objection to our having Bombala.

                            <para>- But if the correct procedure be for the New South Wales Parliament to offer a site, we cannot carry out the intention of the Constitution, which provides that the site shall be chosen by the Commonwealth Parliament. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould&#39;s</inline> interpretation means that the New South Wales Parliament can select a site anywhere not within the joo miles radius ; but no one can possibly contend that that is the intention of the Constitution. I regret to say that, in my opinion, most of the trouble has been caused purely for political purposes. I am very desirous to see this question settled ; and if a Bill be passed enabling the High Court to interpret the Constitution in this connexion, we shall have done something which will, at any rate, clear the atmosphere, and enable definite steps to be taken. </para>

The grievance of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> was that the Government had not come forward with another Bill. Is it not preposterous, to make that the . subject of a grievance ? Why is another Bill required? It is required simply because the Government of New South Wales refuse to do what we maintain they are bound to do in the circumstances. Yet the honorable senator would like to make that a grievance, and endeavour to persuade the public that the Federal Parliament is. to blame, when it is clear that the Government of New South Wales are solely to blame. Then the honorable senator asks this question : &#34; Why not choose .another site?&#34; Is not , that absurd and childish? We spent I do not know how much money in sending expeditions of Members of Parliament round the country like a circus to examine the sites, and as a result of many debates in this and the other House, we eventually came to the conclusion that one site was preferable to all the others. Yet the honorable senator asks this question : &#34; Why&#39; not choose another site in the interests of peace and so remove a grievance?&#34; Is that our duty towards the Commonwealth? The honorable senator seems to overlook the fact that we come here to act in the interests of all time and of the whole Continent, and not merely in the interests of a small section called New South Wales. </para>

Owen .went fishing, and satisfied themselves, that the s,ite chosen was excellent. I wish to say a few words on the question of the grievances of New South Wales.

                        <para>- I think that eventually this question, if it is to be settled, will have to be referred to a Royal Commission composed of the representatives of Tasmania in this Parliament, because we should then be able to get an impartial selection which would be satisfactory to the Commonwealth. When I entered the Senate there were several sites submitted for the consideration of Parliament. I, in common with, I think, every other senator, understood that those sites had been submitted by New South Wales for inspection, with a view to afterwards making a selection. We were taunted because we were so long in making a selection. The various sites had their supporters. By one of those curious coincidences associated with politics, each representative of New South Wales supported a site in his own district, and those of us who had not an opportunity of visiting the sites had some trouble in coming to a decision. Speaking for the Parliament as a whole, I believe that it made the selection in the interests of the Commonwealth and of New South Wales, and without any feeling of partiality. I, for one, strongly resent the charge recently made by the Premier of New South Wales, and that we were animated by feelings adverse to the State of New South Wales. I voted for Dalgety because it was adjacent to Twofold Bay, and I thought it was desirable to have a seaport in connexion with the Capital. After, being abused from inside Parliament for some time because we dm not immediately select a site, we are now abused from outside Parliament because we have done so. In this matter, New South Wales has not, I think, a leg to stand upon. According to my view, an Act of the State Parliament was not needed in connexion with the submission of the sites. Since the Constitution Act was accepted by New South. Wales, it seems to me that the Government of that State had power, by Executive act, to offer certain sites, and to reserve certain lands for the purpose of a site for the Federal Capi-tal, to be selected by this Parliament. The position now set up, if it is logically carried out, is that the Federal Parliament should have no choice, but should take whatever should be offered by New South Wales. That seems to me to be preposterous. I regret that the honest endeavours which were being made by some representatives of New South Wales to bring about a settlement of this very much vexed question have been frustrated. When I was asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watson</inline> if I would be prepared to reconsider my vote on the question, I said : &#34; Certainly ; other tilings being, equal, if we can suit New South Wales we ought to try te do so.&#34; </para>

                            <para>- Yes ; but the honorable senator expects us to be more than human. Are we going to allow a perky little Premier to threaten secession and all sorts &#39;of nonsense, and not to express any resentment ? The action of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers</inline> in the Parliament of New South Wales has done more mischief than anything else could do. I quite agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> that there is something else behind his action. Why did he not, as a member of the New South Wales Parliament, move in the direction of having Dalgety withdrawn from the areas approved for selection? He did nothing of the kind, and now we are to be abused, and called names, because we happen to have done something of which he, and, possibly, a few of his followers do not approve. It is possible that as the result of his action the Federal Parliament will not reconsider the matter this session. Whether it comes on this session or next session, I shall be prepared to endeavour to placate New South Wales, and, if POSSible, to make a better selection than that which we have already made. But it seems to me that we have done no wrong whatever to New South Wales, and if any grievance exists between the Federation and that State, the fault lies with the State, and not with the Federation. </para>

                        <para>- Since I have been a member of the Federal Parliament, I have found honorable members of both Houses exceedingly anxious to give effect to the section of the Constitution providing for the fixing of the Capital site. All the members of this Parliament to whom I have spoken, or whom I have heard speaking on the matter, have expressed a desire that the site should be fixed as soon as possible, in the way most advantageous and most satisfactory to the Commonwealth. I have personally been exceedingly anxious that as little delay as possible shall take place in the settlement of the question, because I believe the Federal Parliament should have a home of its own. I am one of those who believe that it is not a good thing to have the political capital of the Commonwealth identical with the commercial capital of any State. I am opposed to the Seat of Government remaining so long in Melbourne, just as I should be opposed to its remaining for any length of time in Sydney. I believe that most of the legislation of this Parliament, by reason of the fact that it has sat in Melbourne, has been unduly coloured by Victorian commercial and political feelings and exigencies. I believe that just the same kind of difficulty would have occurred if the Seat of Government had been located in Sydney. That being so, I have been exceedingly anxious, and prepared to do anything within my power, consistent with the interest of the Commonwealth to have this question settled as soon as possible. I believe that I have expressed in this way the feeling of the majority of the members of the Senate. But it is net the Senate or the Federal Parliament that is responsible for the delay. It is New South Wales, or perhaps I should rather say that it is Sydney. I have no wish to refer in detail to the various sites offered to us, but it was felt that the selection of a site in the Monaro district would be acceptable to New South. Wales. In fact. Dalgety was one of the sites most favoured by those appointed to inquire into the matter bv the New South Wales Government. We, therefore, had every reason to believe that our selection of that site would be agreeable to the people of New South Wales. But what has been the result? New South &#39;Wales, instead of loyally accepting the decision of the Parliament in carrying out the provision of the Constitution, has thrown every possible difficulty in the way. We have been refused every facility to settle the Capital at Dalgety, where we decided it should be. Now, we have <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers,</inline> the Premier of New South Wales, breaking out into a tirade of abuse against the Government and </para>

It appears to me that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers</inline> adopted the well-known legal maxim. and, having no case, decided to abuse the other side.

                            <para>- I think that Lyndhurst is. the site which he most favours. He hass entered into a tirade of abuse against this Parliament which no public man in, Australia occupying a similar position would have descended to. If we look at the history of the controversy for some little time past, it mav throw some light upon the attitude of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers.</inline> It should be remembered that twelve months ago this gentleman was. apparently anxious for nothing so much as for some means of referring this vexed question to the High Court. He approached the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth time after time, begging and praying of him to do something which would enable the New South Wales Government to appeal to the High Court. Now that the Commonwealth Government propose to do something which .will enable the New South Wales. Premier to adopt the course which he professed himself so anxious to adopt, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers</inline> squeals like a pig stuck in a gate. In my opinion, this shows that the Premier of New South Wales has not desired a definite settlement of the matter. It appears to me that he had desired something else: that New South Wales should be allowed to settle the question, and that this Parliament should abrogate the functions with which it has been intrusted by the people of New South Wales, under the Constitution. It appears to me that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers</inline> has desired that he should be allowed to gain some little temporary kudos by settling this question for the people of Australia. It will be time enough for him to settle questions for the people of Australia when they give him a mandate to do so. It is possible that he may have some ulterior motive. He might desire, for instance, to distract public attention from his own misdeeds, by diverting it to the alleged misdeeds of the Commonwealth Parliament. That is not an uncommon course for public men to adopt, and, in view of recent revelations in New South Wales, it does, not require a very strong effort of the imagination to suppose that something of that kind may be the matter with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers.</inline> I believe that Dalgety is a good site for the Federal Capital. I have taken the trouble to read the reports on the various sites, have visited most of them, and have tried to get at the facts, and Dalgety appears, to me to be one of the best sites that could be selected, not only in the interest of the Commonwealth, but also in the interest of New South Wales. I believe that the establishment of the Federal Capital there would practically add a new province to New South Wales, as well as to the Commonwealth. If Dalgety and the district around it were opened up, as it would be by the establishment of the Federal Capital&#34; there, it would, in the next twenty-five or thirty years, probably be supporting a population of 250,000 instead of being a sheep-walk,&#39; as it is at the present time. Most of the district consists of good country, and it has access to what would be an important new port for the great State of New South Wales. However, we know that the people of Sydney desire to drag everything to Sydney. In the mind of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers,</inline> this is not a New South Wales question but purely a Sydney question. Everything must gravitate towards Sydney. All the railways of the State radiate from Sydney, and the people of that city desire that everything shall be dragged to Sydney for the benefit of Sydney merchants and property-owners, and Sydney interests generally, in the interests of New South Wales,&#39; it would be an excellent thing, if another port w.ere opened in that State, and Twofold Bay, the natural port for Dalgety could, I understand, be made a very fine port. I believe that its development would add greatly to the wealth of New South Wales without doing any undue harm to the port of Sydney. </para>

                            <para>- We have surmounted higher mountains with a railway in North Queensland, and surely if the small population of Queensland can build railways of that sort the Commonwealth could build any railway thai might be necessary to provide communication&#39; between the Federal Capital and the port of Eden? For these reasons, I believe that the Commonwealth Parliament, notwithstanding the squealing of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers^</inline> would do well to adhere to the decision they have already arrived at. For my part, I may say that if any course can be adopted by this Parliament, without any undue loss of dignity, and without backing down to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers,</inline> which will help forward an early solution of the question, and provide the Commonwealth with an equally satisfactory site for its Federal Capital, I shall be prepared to reconsider my decision. I admit that I should have been more ready to reconsider it if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers</inline> had not indulged in his tirade of abuse, but I shall not allow anything that he has said to influence any action of mine. </para>

                        <para>- Were it not for the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. G.</inline> H. Reid is now leader of the Opposition in the Federal Parliament, two things would not have happened. First of all, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers</inline> would never have made the speech which he did make in Sydney on Friday last, and probably <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> would not have moved the adjournment of the Senate today. I believe that the action taken bv <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers</inline> has done much to further delay the settlement of this question. I believe, also that the action taken in the Senate today by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> has been prompted more by party motives than by any desire that the question should be fairly considered. In support of that opinion, I propose to quote from a journal admitted to be favourably disposed towards <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid.</inline> There appears in to-day&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> a statement made bv <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid</inline> in an interview with the representative of that newspaper in Sydney on the question of the Federal Capital Site. Most of the right honorable gentleman&#39;s remarks were made in criticism of the action taken by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne. </para>

                            <para>- Certainly I do. There has never been any party aspect in the consideration of the choice of the Capital site by this Parliament. There was never any party action taken in connexion with :the matter in the Senate, and we know that, but for the stand taken by the Senate, Dalgety would not have been chosen. No honorable senator representing New South Wales &#39; can declare that the action taken by the Senate in selecting Dalgety was prompted by party motives. I would ask whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> belongs to the Deakinite or Labour Parties? Does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> belong to those parties ? I believe the honorable senator would not care to be told that he did. It will not be contended that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> belongs to those parties. I believe the honorable senator was not in favour of the selection of any site at the time, but he preferred Dalgety to any other site suggested. Again, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane</inline> cannot be said to be a member of either the Labour Party or the Deakinite Party, yet all these honorable senators voted for Dalgety. While we have honorable senators talking about what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid</inline> has said, that the whole trouble comes from the Labour Party and the Deakinite Party, it is just -vs well for us to remember that there seems to be at least a suspicion that the action taken by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers</inline> last week, and in the Senate to-day, is prompted as much by party motives as by an actual desire to have the question settled. </para>

                            <para>- I think I have done well in bringing under the notice of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> the fact that the leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives is trying to make party capital out of this question ; and it is my opinion that if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid</inline> had been Prime Minister, instead of leader of the Opposition, the extraordinary speech of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers</inline> would never have been made. Extraordinary charges levelled at representatives of other States, who have shown that they are actuated by an earnest desire to have the question settled, would not have been made either. I am one who is anxious to see the question settled. I voted for Dalgety after having seen the Bombala country and all the other sites, except Tooma and Lake George, because I came to the conclusion that it was the best site in the interests of the whole of Australia. My chief reasons for voting for Dalgety were, first, that it was within reasonable distance of a port, and, secondly, that there was a chance there of obtaining a large area of land, which I think is necessary in the interests of Australia. The great question which has agitated the minds of the people in all the States in reference to the Federal Capital is that of expense. We have been repeatedly told that Australia cannot stand the expense of erecting a Federal Capital. A number of us came to the conclusion that if we could secure a large area of land around Dalgety, there would be a very fair chance of making the Federal Capital self-supporting; that is to say, that the increased value given to the land by the establishment of the Capital there would, within a very few years, make the Capital self-supporting. It would not then be a burden upon the taxpayers. But as one of those who voted for Dalgety, I have recently been asked whether I should be inclined to reconsider the whole question. It has been put to me in this way : &#34; If you can be satisfied that a sufficiently large area of reasonably good land can be obtained around another site, giving free access to as good a port as Twofold Bay, would you be prepared to reconsider your decision in favour of Dalgety&#34;? I said, &#34;Yes.&#34; I have not gone the length of saying that I should be in favour of accepting the Lake George site. But as one who is anxious to see the question settled, and-who recognises that the delay is a source of friction between the Parliament of New South Wales and the Parliament of the Commonwealth - friction which has been largely brought about by the action of New South Wales - I should be willing to reconsider the question, if the new site which has been put forward offers the same advantages, in my opinion, as does Dalgety. But I shall have to be satisfied that it does offer equal advantages. Just when a movement was in progress amongst members of Parliament for the reconsideration of the question, we were suddenly confronted with the extraordinary speech of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers,</inline> which heaps entirely undeserved insults upon the representatives of other States. In view of the attitude of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers,</inline> I do not feel anxious that any further steps should be taken in connexion with the matter. It would be a good thing for the Premier of New South Wales to have a little time to calm himself down, and to come to a more reasonable frame of mind. It will be an advantage to give him an opportunity to take a more Federal view of the question than he now seems to do. I am not sorry that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> has brought the matter before the Senate, although the whole subject is likely to be gone over again between now and the end of the session. No doubt the discussion has been useful in clearing the air a little bit in advance of the debate which will take place later. </para>

                        <para>- I am sure1 that amy one who is familiar with the Capital Site question will come to the conclusion that there was no justification whatever for the remark of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid</inline> that it has been dealt with from a party point of view, and I am sorry that any member of the Senate should try to insinuate that a party complexion has been given to it either by the Government or the Labour Party, as some interjections seem to indicate. If there is one question before the Federal Parliament which is non-party in ils nature, il is that concerning the Capital site. It has been dealt with in a very reasonable way. This Parliament has shown every desire io effect a settlement. A very large amount of time and consideration have been given to it. Members of this Parliament have travelled considerably, and taken a great amount of trouble, to acquaint themselves with d;e merits and demerits of the various sites proposed. In every way Parliament has shown itself anxious to arrive at a satisfactory conclusion. I remember that when we were travelling in New South Wales, the press of that State did not treat us in a way that could be regarded as in any sense friendly. Ever since then there has been a disposition of unfriendliness on the part of a section in New South Wales towards this Parliament. Now we have the Premier of the State taking up an attitude that has done more harm in the way of preventing definite action being taken than anything that I can imagine/ and doing so just at the very moment when there was a desire on the part of members of this Parliament generally to see whether there was a way out of the difficulty that had arisen. I know that steps were being taken to bring about a settlement ; but, in the face of the resolution carried by both Houses of the New South Wales Parliament, practically amounting to a threat, I say that nothing can be done now until that threat is withdrawn. That is the attitude which I intend to take up. I put the blame for whatever delay there may be in the future in the settlement of the question, on the shoulders of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers.</inline> There is but one attitude that this Parliament can assume in the face of his threat. A self-respecting Parliament can do no other than insist that that threat must be withdrawn before we take any further step. I trust that both branches of the Legislature will view the matter in that light. It will be a lesson to these people that they have gone too far in threatening a Parliament which has shown an earnest desire to deal with the question in a practical and satisfactory fashion. </para>

                            <para>- If I am mistaken, I apologize; but I understood that every New South Wales senator was more or less in sympathy with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers.</inline> It ought to be clear to every one that the delay that has taken place in dealing with the Federal Capital question is not due to the Federal Parliament. The Constitution has given the people of Australia, through their representatives in Parliament, the right to choose the site for the Federal city. This Parliament has availed itself of that power. It lost no time in doing so. Indeed, a great number of people seemed to think that we rather hurried than otherwise. In any case,, we have done what the Constitution demand&#39;s. As pointed out by other honorable senators, we did not go searching for a Capital site on our own account, but visited the places singled out for us by the New South Wales Government. We examined each one in detail, and finally determined on a particular site; and the Federal Parliament and Government have done everything that ought to be expected1. But how have the New South Wales Government met the Federal Government? In a Federal spirit? No; anything more contemptible, more arrogant, more unFederal than the attitude of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers</inline> and his Parliament it is scarcely possible to conceive. I am not very sure whether the New South Wales people are really in earnest. It has been stated in a newspaper that the closure was applied during the debate, so that members might go to a dinner given by Lord Jersey. They were apparently more concerned about dining with Lord Jersey than having the important question of the Federal Capital discussed exhaustively. That incident throws a little light on the subject. It appears to me that somehow our New South Wales friends are making far too much noise about the question. I have read of people who try to divert blame from themselves by raising a row about something which has no particular reference to the question in hand ; and I am very doubtful whether these tactics have not been attempted by the New South Wales Government at the present moment. In any case, I do not see what the Senate can do to help our friends in New South Wales. We have chosen the site and done our part, and it is now for the people of New South Wales to do their part. I can hardly believe that the electors of the State are in agreement with the New South Wales Government on this matter. I can scarcely conceive of people in any portion of the Federation being s,o unFederal - so selfishly and1 stupidly unFederal as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers</inline> and his friends would make it appear. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers,</inline> unfortunately, from my point of view, is the chief exponent or representative of public opinion in that State at the present time, and what he says, I suppose, we must take as the view of people. But it is, not likely that the people of Australia will ever permit New South Wales to thrust any particular site clown their throats. New South. Wales, from the beginning, has shown herself to be extremely selfish. In the first instance, New South Wales insisted on the Capital being situated within her territory, though not within 100 miles of Sydney. Was that not an extremely selfish stipulation to insert in the Federal bargain? What right has New South Wales, any more than any other State, to have the Capital within her borders ? </para>

                            <para>- I know that perfectly well ; I am merely pointing out that, from the very beginning, New South Wales has apparently been actuated by the meanest and most sordid motives. Unfortunately for us, instead of becoming more Federal, New South Wales is becoming less and less Federal ; and unless she can arrogate to herself all the power, influence, honour, glory, and cash, she threatens to secede. Well, that is a frame of mind that requires a good douche of cold water. Neither the Government nor the Parliament of New South Wales appears in a very decent light before the people of Australia, who, wherever they are, must regard with amazement and sorrow the position taken up by that State - amazement that any section should attempt to arrogate to themselves powers and privileges to which they have no right, and should be distinctly so unFederal. Certainly there is not much brotherly love and affection displayed in this business on the part of New South Wales. Like SenatorO&#39; Keefe, I was prepared, in the interests of peace, to consider another site. The question of substituting Lake George on certain conditions was mentioned to me, and, in order to promote the settlement of the question, I said I was willing to give the matter further consideration. But I do not see how I can do that now. The Premier of New South Wales has come forward like a bandit or highway robber- </para>

I am not prepared to reopen this question until the resolution of the New South Wales Parliament is withdrawn, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers</inline> makes a humble and sufficient apology. That is exactly the position in which I stand at the present moment, and it is just as well that our friends from New South Wales should understand our attitude. I believe that a large number of other honorable senators hold exactly the same opinions as those I have expressed. I trust that for the honour of New South Wales, and in the interests of peace and harmony, which ought to prevail in Australia, we have seen the last of this unFederal spirit. I hope that New South Wales will take its right and proper position, and, by granting the territory within, which the Federal Parliament desires the Federal Capital to be situated, conform to the expressed will of the people of Australia. </para>

                        (New South Wales). - I have no reason to be dissatisfied with the result of the motion. Honorable senators could not fail to notice my earnest desire, as a member of the New South Wales delegation, not to be regarded as indorsing the remarks, made in the State Parliament last week. The action of honorable senators in both Houses in regard to this question of the Capital site has been free from party influence. The votes given from time to time have been cast with a due regard to individual belief as to what is best for Australia. For my part, I am satisfied that I have been able to-day to draw attention to a resolution which was the basis of section 125 of the Constitution - a resolution which, I believe, had been largely forgotten if, indeed, some honorable senators ever knew of its existence. The Premiers agreed - first, that the Federal Capital should be in New South Wales ; secondly, that it should be distant not less than 100 miles from Sydney; and, thirdly, that it should be within a reasonable distance.

                    <para class="block">It will be remembered that the two main objects of the Immigration Restriction Act of1901 were, first, to keep out undesirable immigrants, and, secondly, to prevent the introduction of contract labour. This Bill Is brought In for the purpose of dealing with a. former subject, because in the working of the Act it has been found that the proverbial coach and four could be driven through some of its provisions in that regard. The subject of contract labour is dealt with in another Bill which appears on the notice-paper, under the head of Contract Immigrants Bill. The Bill which I am now asking the Senate to read a second time deals with the exclusion of those persons who, by difference of type, render their assimilation with the people of our race difficult, if not impossible. It will be recollected that soon after the discovery of gold, the influx of Chinese to Victoria was so great that steps had to be taken, not only by Victoria, but also by the other Colonies, to stop it. Various Acts were passed for that purpose ; but, principally, they imposed a poll-tax, which, I may say, has ranged from&#163;10 a head in South Australia, to eventually &#163;100 a head in New South Wales, when the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Parkes was in power. Subsequently, when the Colonies wished to revise their laws and to keep out Asiatics, the British Government pointed out to them that the subjects of India and the Japanese objected to being kept out of Australia on the ground of their colour. The Colonial Secretary for the time being intimated to the Government of each Colony - of course, this was before the Federation was an accomplished fact - that it would be useless for its Parliament to pass a Bill for the purpose of keeping out alien immigrants on the ground of their colour, but that its desire might be accomplished by imposing the educational test which was in operation in the Colony of Natal. </para>

                            <para>- Well, we adopted something very much like that test. I should have preferred our Immigration Restriction Act to be framed with a view to exclude Asiatic immigrants on the ground of colour, because what we are doing now is really a subterfuge. We are accomplishing our object, and that is to keep out coloured aliens on the ground that we do not wish them to mix with our own population and produce a hybrid race eventually. We are faking this course in the interest of the people to-day and of generations to come. It Would have been a great deal better to exclude undesirable immigrants on the ground of colour, and not by means of a language test ; but we were placed in an awkward position. I do not know whether it was openly stated, but at all events <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain,</inline> in a conversation with me, said that he would not be in a position to submit a reserved Bill for the signification of Her late Majesty&#39;s pleasure if it sought to exclude coloured aliens on the ground of colour, that is, if the word &#34; Asiatics &#34; were used therein. Therefore, we were compelled to insert an educational test, which reads as follows : - : </para>

                    <para class="block">The trouble of administering that provision has been very great. For instance, one magistrate has distinctly ruled that the officer must dictate exactly fifty words; that if he dictates more than that number of words he has not complied with the law. There have been instances where the officer, after putting one or two questions, has found that the Chinese or Japanese could not write at all. He was required by the law to go through the farce of asking the man to write out fifty words, but, in many cases, after asking the man to write out a few words of an European language he has stopped because it was utterly useless to ask the man to go on and write down the rest of the passage. In those instances, because he did not apply the test as prescribed, the Commonwealth had to admit the immigrants. In this Bill we are altering that provision, with, a view to al lowing an officer to dictate &#34; not more than fifty words in any prescribed language,&#34; in place of &#34; fifty words in an European language.&#34; Our friends in India and Japan do not like the colour test. They say, &#34; Why should .OU examine the immigrant in any particular European language? Why should not the examination be made in any language ? &#34; It does not make any difference to us, but in order to meet their wishes we have drafted the following provision : - </para>

We intend to keep out undesirable immigrants&#39; by means of an education test, so as not to hurt the feelings of certain friends who may not possess the colour which we desire they should have if they came to mix with us.. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator need not call it a farce. If this provision had not been introduced, what would have been said ? People would have said : &#34; A Minister might come in who would be against our White Australia policy, and he would allow the Japanese language to be used straight away, when they would come by the hundred.&#34; I may be asked to say why we do not prescribe the language in the measure itself. But I contend that in. a. serious case of this kind we ought to allow the Parliament to take the responsibility of prescribing the language. </para>

They have a very clear idea of what we intend, and there is no special desire on the part of the Japanese that we should strike out the word &#34; European.&#34; We know, however, that it is their wish that we should make no special distinction on the ground of colour.

                    <para class="block">We met them on that ground in the Bill. They also pointed out that, by confining the education test to a European language, we made a distinction, because only Europeans might be expected to be able to pass the test, and in that way we practically confined the prohibition to people of a certain colour. By omitting the word &#34; European,&#34; and substituting for it the word &#34; prescribed,&#34; we meet their objection in that direction. </para>

                            <para>- We do not intend to propose a regulation immediately, but we might possibly do so in the next Parliament. There are a number of smaller amendments to which I can better refer in Committee. There are one or two principal points in which this Bill differs from previous legislation on the subject. I hope that, at all events, we shall have satisfied <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford,</inline> because, although we do not propose a treaty with the Indian Empire, and with our Japanese friends, the Bill makes provision for arrangements which, equally well with a treaty, might be entered into to accomplish the same purpose. Honorable senators will see that, by clause 6, it is proposed that the following provision shall be inserted after section 4 of the principal Act. 4A.1.

It is only right that I should inform honorable senators that there are such arrangements in force at the present time. Those who have taken an interest in the matter will have noticed that a paper was laid on the table &#39; of the Senate recently, covering correspondence respecting a proposal to modify the administration of the Immigration Restriction Act in regard to visits of Asiatic merchants, travellers, and others, dated 16th April, 1904, to1 st August, 1905.

                        <para>May I inquire whether you think it would be possible for your Government to arrange that all Japanese of the merchant, student, and tourist classes intending &#39;to visit Australia should be provided with passports sufficiently identifying them, and specifying the purpose and duration of their visit? If that could be arranged such passport might be accepted by this Department as entitling the holders to freely enter and pass through Australia, the only condition being that the documents should be examined at the first port of call. </para>

                    <para class="block">That settled the matter so far as Japan was concerned. The Commonwealth Government subsequently entered! into negotiations with the Governor-General of India with the same result, and in a! despatch signed &#34; Ampthill, Viceroy and Governor-General of India,&#39;5 the statement is made that the arrangement proposed was received with very much pleasure, that it would be accepted, and that passports would be issued in the terms agreed upon. These arrangements are now in existence. I learn from inquiry of the Prime Minister that even though, .this Bill should be passed, they will continue in force, and will be given effect to by the Government. It will, therefore, only be fresh arrangements with other countries which will require to be brought before Parliament under this measure. Of course, Parliament can, if it pleases, take action to disapprove of what has already been done. Although there were no special provisions in the principal Act giving Ministers the power to make these arrangements, they considered that they had authority to make them, and that they would meet with the approval of Parliament and of the country. </para>

                            <para>- No ; it would be very difficult to fix any definite time which would meet the circumstances of every case, and, therefore, none has been fixed. The next part of the Bill deals, with the certificate exempting from the dictation test. These certificates have been- a source of very great trouble in the past. If honorable senators will refer to paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">m</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">n</inline> of section 3 of the principal Act, they will find that a wife and children under eighteen years of age, accompanying a husband who is not a prohibited immigrant, may be admitted. That provision has been abused by Chinamen, who were obviously single men, returning to the Commonwealth with wives and a whole crowd of children in a very short space of time. They could not be refused admission, because the reputed husbands and fathers held exemption certificates. The Minister of the day had to stop that kind of nonsense. The Bill will prevent persons coming into Australia who are clearly prohibited immigrants. If we consider that a Chinaman coming here is a prohibited immigrant, we shall take good care that he shall not pass the education test. We had to stop what was taking place, and we propose to alter the provisions of the principal Act under which these abuses, arose. It will be seen that in this Bill we make the following provision : - 4b. - (1) Any person who has resided in Australia for a period or periods in the aggregate of not less than five years, and who is about to depart from the Commonwealth, may in manner prescribed apply to an officer authorized in that behalf for a certificate in the prescribed form excepting him, if he returns to the Commonwealth, within the period limited in the certificate from the provisions of paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> of section 3 of this Act. </para>

                    <para class="block">In a great many instances, Chinese who went back to China, and took with them certificates of exemption from the test, remained away a very long time, and subsequently other Chinese arriving in Australia presented those certificates. We have, therefore, found it necessary to make provision that persons leaving the Commonwealth shall return within the time specified in the certificate, if they do not desire to be considered prohibited immigrants. </para>

Under that section a police officer has authority to prevent a prohibited immigrant from landing, but has no authority if the man evades the police, and gets ashore, to detain him without a warrant. If a police officer has to wait until he can get a warrant before arresting the prohibited immigrant, the man may make his escape. </para>

                        <para>- I have listened to the explanation of the Minister in charge of the Bill with a considerable amount of interest; but, while I suppose the measure will be carried, I must point out that it is to a great extent an absolute fraud. First of all let us consider the provisions with regard to the alteration of the language test section of the principal Act. The test may be imposed in any prescribed language. The present law says that it must be in an European language. We are told that the intention is to meet the <inline font-style="italic">amour prof re</inline> of the Japanese race. We are led to believe that it is quite possible that the Government of the day will approve of Japanese being one of the languages in which an immigrant may be tested. But is not that a transparent fraud? Is it not evident that it is not intended to do anything of the kind, but that this is merely a provision inserted to say that such a thing &#34; may &#34; be done, whilst no Government will ever do it? Do we not know that, from the very beginning until now, the purpose of our immigration restriction legislation has been, by artificial means, to keep out certain persons who are regarded as undesirable? It is said that we do not want to have coloured people here, and that therefore we shall exclude them. But we do not carry out our policy by saying, frankly, &#34;We shall not allow you to come here, because you belong to a coloured race,&#34; but we say, &#34; You can come here if you can pass the test, though we will take precious good care that you shall not pass it.&#34; Is not that a fraud? We are going to say to Eastern nations, 1 &#39; The Government of the Commonwealth has power to impose any language test, and mav, if it likes, examine your people in their own language;&#34; whilst we are fully aware that the Commonwealth is committed to the policy of a White Australia, and that no coloured person will be admitted. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> has pointed out that there is a provision in this Bill giving legal effect to an arrangement already made between the Commonwealth and other Governments. When challenged as to this power to make arrangements, the Minister has not told us under what law they have been made. Personally, I do not raise the question at all. I think it is .a good thing that Ministers have made arrangements permitting visitors to come into our country under certain conditions. As the Government proposes to legalize those arrangements, I am prepared to support them in so doing. If the provisions inserted in this Bill are necessary in order that they may be continued, that is a very good reason for the introduction of the clauses in question. I come to another part of the Bill, having regard to the repeal of paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">m</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">n</inline> of section 3 of the principal Act. The Minister has told us that the present provisions of the law are very much abused. But the Government has the remedy in its own hands. The law says that the section shall not apply if suspended by proclamation. The Government, therefore, has power to suspend it whenever abuses creep in. It would be better to retain a provision of that character than to eliminate the discretion of the Minister altogether. But in addition to that, I would observe that if we are to have people of alien races coming to this country, it is far better that they should be accompanied by their wives and children than that they should probably inter-marry with white people, and produce a race of half-castes. Of course, if it is found that a Chinaman goes to China and comes back with a wife and a large family, and the same Chinaman does the same thing a year hence, that will be a good reason for suspending the provision to meet that particular case. But as a general rule I entertain the feeling that, if we are to have these aliens in our midst, and if they are going to remain here, it is better to allow; them to have their wives and families than to encourage them to intermingle with our population, and create the very evil that we desire to obviate. We have many Chinamen in the country. If we are going to keep them here, we should extend to them the same rights and liberties as other citizens have, except the right to vote, unless they become naturalized subjects. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> has directed attention to clause 6 of the Bill. In that clause provision is made for exempting from the dictation test the citizens of a country with which a certain arrangement has been made by the Commonwealth Government. That is a provision with which I certainly agree, and it is better to have it embodied in the law than to leave the matter to the discretion of Ministers, who may entertain a doubt as to the legality of the exercise of that discretion. But the clause contains a provision to the effect that any person who has resided in Australia for not less than five years, and is about to depart from the Commonwealth, may apply u&#62; an officer for a &#39;Certificate of exemption from the education test. The remarkable thing is that there is not an honorable member in this Senate who is not subject to that provision, if it is allowed to pass as it stands. A man who has lived for the whole of his life in Australia, if he wants to go away for a period with the intention of coming back, may find, when he desires to land, that he is required to pass the education test ; and if the authorities do not want him to come in at all, they may. if 1 understands English, examine him in French, or in Japanese. What if a leading senator on the Government side - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> for example - took a trip to the old country, and. when he returned, some wicked free-trade Government, who had come into power during his absence, declared that, as he had not a certificate of exemption, he would have to be tested in, let us say, Japanese? The whole position is absurd. The Minister has told us that a great many of these provisions are merely drafting amendments, or make only minor alterations in the original Act. I ask honorable senators whether in their opinion every object sought to be served by this Bill could not practically be attained by means of the present Act? There has been a general outcry in the Commonwealth about the restrictive policy concerning immigrants and persons who come to this country under contract; and the circumstances suggest that the Government have been forced to introduce some sort of legislation, in order to make it appear that they are falling in with the wishes of the community at large. The Bill under discussion, and the second Bill, which we shall presently be called upon to consider, were introduced in another place in. such a way as to convey the idea that the Government, while apparently amending the law, were, at the same time, imposing further restrictions - presenting legislation which is a mere fiction. The Bill will, in point of fact, merely tighten the cords around the necks of the people who will be affected. I can respect a Government who straightforwardly and honestly introduce a Bill for the purpose of making amendments in an Act, in order to meet the reasonable wishes of the people; but here we have a Bill which, according to the Minister&#39;s own showing, will make practically little or no difference in the law, and is, in short, a fraud and a fiction. </para>

                            <para>.- Because of that clause, I am prepared to vote for the second reading of the Bill. At the same time, the Minister has informed us that the power conferred by this clause is being exercised at the present time in the absence of any amendment of the law. and that the procedure will be continued, whether the Bill be passed or not. The Minister asks us to accept this Bill in order to make such procedure legal in the future ; and, as I have my doubts as to the legality of the action of the Government, I am prepared to accept this clause. I must, however, protest again against what I regard as fictitious legislation. As honorable senators know, I should be prepared, had I the power, to make very drastic amendments in the Immigration Restriction Act, but I do not want it to be thought for a moment that I desire to depart from the settled policy of the country in any particular lines. As for the present Bill, I can only say that people when asking for &#34; bread V have practically been given a &#34;stone.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- I greatly regret that this Bill does not meet the expectations of those who were looking for an amending measure which would be worthy of Australia, and satisfy the just requirements and wishes of great countries like Japan. The clause dealing with the exemption from the dictation test of the subjects of a country with which an arrangement has been made, is one which would be of immense advantage if it could be carried out at the present time. This clause concedes much that I have been asking in the motion which I placed before the Senate, and which, over some weeks, has been debated on several occasions. The Minister, however, does not tell us what sort of arrangement is proposed, or suggest when there will be an opportunity to put it into force. The clause goes on to provide that before notice of any arrangement of the kind can be issued, it shall have .the sanction by resolution of both Houses of the Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- Then,, again, in regard to the test, any &#34;prescribed&#34; language has been substituted for any &#34; European &#34; language, but no regulation prescribing a language is to have force until it has been laid before both Houses of Parliament for thirty days. I presume that means thirty sitting days, and if that be so. the House of Representatives- would have to sit for about two months, and the Senate, possibly, three months, before the clause was complied with. If next year there be a short session - and by this time we are entitled to a short session - the Senate might not meet on thirty days. </para>

                            <para>- That reduces to some extent my objection to that part of the Bill. Honorable senators, however, will notice that this little change is not to be brought into force until after Parliament meets again. Why should we not meet the occasion at once? Why should not Parliament prescribe certain languages? Can <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> say whether there is to be one language only, or whether several languages may be prescribed? </para>

                        <para>- I do not intend to speak for more than a few minutes, because, if there is one thing in connexion with the Bill which is more striking than anything else, it is that from neither side of the House has any one a word to say either in approval or disapproval of it. I am not always in agreement with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford,</inline> but I heartily agreed with him this afternoon when he referred to the Bill as a farce, and alluded to the subterfuges which it contains. The only thing I regret - and I dare say that he shares my regret - is that we have to go on playing this farce, and that by this Bill we add some subterfuges to those in the original Act. </para>

                            <para>- I think that, more or less directly, Japan has asked for it. If there has been any possibility of leakage under the education test - and I do not think that there has been - this subterfuge will increase it. The officers administering the law are not hampered even by the use of the word &#34; European,&#34; and this amendment will make the education test absolutely air-tight and wind-tight. I cannot conceive how it will be possible for any one to get in under the test. But, as we have all agreed that the whole legislation is, to use <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford&#39;s</inline> phrase, a farce and a subterfuge, I have very little to say in its favour. I hope, however, to be here when the Bill is being considered in Committee, because there are one or two clauses which require some attention. The Bill is full of indications that, somehow or other, both Houses are to be asked to sanction something by resolution. Speaking generally, it is nothing more than an indication in print that Parliament can resolve to take some course. I really wonder that it has not been asked to take the course. What is the use of telling us in the Bill that the Parliament can sanction a certain course by resolution, when we know that it could be done either by a Bill or by an ordinary resolution? Clause 13 enables any police officer in a State, without a warrant, to arrest any man reasonably supposed by him to be a prohibited immigrant. I do not wish prohibited immigrants to be abroad in the Commonwealth, but I have very grave doubts as to whether this clause is not giving an ordinary policeman too much power. I invite &#39;honorable senators seriously to consider whether it is desirable to enact such a provision. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> has told us that it is a necessary supplement to the power of the magistrate, but I think that he went a little too far in giving that answer, even though it emanated from the draftsman whom he consulted. It does not necessarily follow that, because we enlarge the power of the magistrates to deal with those cases, we should so greatly enlarge the power of an ordinary policeman. The clause introduces an element of danger. In the circumstances, it is a fair thing to throw the onus of proof upon the defendant, as is done by section 20 of the Customs Act. The only other amendment I have to suggest is in clause 10, which deals with the question of summary jurisdiction, and imposes a penalty of&#163;100. We shall be confronted with the usual difficulty of fixing an arbitrary sum; but I am inclined to think that, to allow the magistrate to enforce a penalty of&#163;100 is to give him too much power. </para>

                        <para>- This is one of the measures which the Government should have either brought forward at <inline font-style="italic">an</inline> earlier period of the session or held over until next year. It is hasty legislation. It did not make its appearance on the notice-paper of the other House until about the 2nd December, and the second reading was not carried until a few days ago. Owing to the rush of business, the Senate has not had a proper opportunity to consider the provisions of the Bill, and certainly the people throughout the Commonwealth have had no such opportunity. </para>

                            <para>- No, it is a very important departure by the Government from the White Australia policy. So far as I know, no person has asked for the Bill, except public men like <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> Smith and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford,</inline> who hold extreme views in the other direction. There has been no demand on the part of the general public for an alteration of the law. Of course, there have been expressions of opinion from Japanese Consuls and Ambassadors and high officials generally in favour of an alteration. </para>

                            <para>- The Minister said : &#34; There is no danger in the Bill ; pass it, because any prescribed language must come before the Parliament later on in the form of a regulation, and we do not intend to brine forward a regulation at present.&#34; The measure will, it is supposed, have the effect of mollifying &#34;the susceptibilities of the Japanese, who take great exception to our making a colour lint-.. Lately we have all formed the opinion that the Japanese are a smart and intelligent people. Does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford,</inline> or anyone else, think that Japanese Consuls and other persons, who have been objecting to our legislation, are likely to be misled by the new clause, which states that a prescribed language shall be put before both Houses in the form of a regulation, and that until such time, the old objectionable provision is to stand ? I take the view that this measure is the result of wire-pulling, if I may use the term, on the part of the Balfour Government. The party which it represented will have to face in the United Kingdom a storm of criticism, owing to the introduction of Chinese into the Transvaal. They have said that there was nothing in the charges made as to the abuse of the punitive system ; that all the evils said tr&#187; have arisen existed only in the fevered imagination of their opponents. No doubt the coloured labour legislation of Australia will be quoted, and they will now be able to meet their opponents with the statement that the Australian Parliament has recognised  its false position, and repealed the  legislation  which had for its  object  the exclusion of Chinese and Japanese. </para>

I object to the Bill, because it displays a weakening by public men on what is a vital question to Australia. </para>

                            <para>- No, but that was owing to a kind of obsession. There is no doubt that before many years have passed, the Chinese will tell all Europeans to get out of their country, and we cannot blame them if they do. This hasty legislation on the part of the Commonwealth will not delay that day by a single hour. I believe that eventually the progress of education in China will lead to that result. If the Japanese could assimilate with our people we might take up a different view, but, apparently, they do not, and will not. Indeed, the greatest student of our race has declared that it would be an undesirable thing for civilization if ever such an amalgamation did take place. We who comprise the Labour Party do not object to the Chinese or Japanese merely on the ground of colour. It is an economic question with us. Those who have preceded us, and ourselves, have succeeded in establishing a certain standard of comfort which is in the interests of the community generally, and in the interests of civilization. </para>

Some sudden agitation might arise, as the result of which the democratic or Labour Party might find itself in a minority, and with a strong majority opposed to it.

                            <para>- If we had dealt with the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company&#39;s agreement in Committee, I venture to think that the motion proposed would have been discussed at greater length, and we might, perhaps, have succeeded in carrying certain amendments upon it. The fact remains that a resolution might be given notice of one day and moved the next. It would not have to pass through a number or&#39; stages in the same way as a Bill. A Minister might bring forward a resolution, make a speech upon it, and if he had a majority behind him&#62;; prolong the sitting sufficiently to carry it in one day. That is an important objection I have to the proposal. I shall, perhaps, have something to say on a similar question when the companion Bill to this is before the Senate. In the meantime, I earnestly hope that honorable senators who take the view that if the Government is sincere in trying to mollify the susceptibilities of the Japanese they should do so in a proper manner, will vote against this measure, because, in the words of the Minister who has introduced it, it is only a &#34; farce &#34; after all. </para>

All that the Japanese object to is the European language test, and the proposal in the Bill for dealing with this is4. in the opinion of the Minister, a subterfuge, a trick, or a device to delude some one. </para>

This should induce honorable senators who sympathize with Japan to vote against the Bill. I remind honorable senators that the legislation already passed1 was passed by this Parliament in a modified form to meet the susceptibilities of Japan, and at the request of the British Government. We rejected the colour test, and adopted the practice of the United Kingdom with regard to such legislation. </para>

                            <para>- It must, I think, be admitted that there are some good points in this Bill which serve to cover up the dangerous provisions. But the Government could very easily remedy what defects there are in the principal Aci: by the introduction of an amending measure which&#39; would enable it to be administered more successfully. I direct the/ attention of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> to the fact that the Minister in charge of the Bill declares that the language test is a subterfuge, and to satisfy those of us who desire the exclusion of these races the honorable senator contends that there are important provisions in the Bill which will enable the Government to keep out Japanese and Chinese more effectively than they can do under -the existing Act. That is really the virtue of the Bill, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford.</inline> In view of the opinions held by honorable senators in </para>

                        <para>- The legislation which we are now being asked to pass has a lesson for the members of the Federal Parliament, but I doubt whether they are capable of learning it. It is the practice of some of our parties to get a principle into their heads, and then to forget that everything lies in its application. Nothing will suit a certain party but the carrying of every principle to an extreme. Nothing can bring the Federal Parliament into more disgrace and disrepute than to have to go back upon its previous legislation. We pass laws in one session, and, finding that we have made mistakes, have to alter them in the next. We probably discover that we have forgotten the laws of humanity, the principles of Christianity, and have paid no attention to the comity of nations. This can be seen by the Bill which we are now asked to pass, in order to amend the mistakes we have made in the past. There are other Bills of the same character to come before us. We have a companion Bill to this, in which we shall be asked to rectify certain mistakes made in previous legislation, because we insisted upon pushing a principle too far. We have passed a measure to provide for the deportation of kanakas. I refer to the matter only incidentally ; but in that measure we absolutely ignored the principles of humanity and Christianity. We made no provision for exceptions, and yet every Prime Minister who has considered the question since - and I believe three of them have done so - has admitted that these people must be deported in accordance with the principles of humanity and Christianity which we ignored in passing the law. I have no doubt that whatever Government may be in power when action is taken under the measure, will see that these people are not deported without clue regard to principles which we should &#39;have thought of when passing the measure dealing with the subject. We had no excuse to offer in this instance, because we knew perfectly well that the Japanese objected to what we were doing. We knew that they made protest after protest against their being included with other Asiatic races. Events which have since transpired have shown that they were perfectly justified in the position which they took up. </para>

                    <para>They have come to the front in such a manner amongst the nations of the world that the Government admitted a few days ago that something ought to be done to placate the Japanese. What they have proposed to do, however, is an absolute farce and subterfuge. I wonder that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> was not ashamed to introduce such a Bill. I understood that the Prime Minister proposed that the word &#34; European,&#34; as used in the principal Act, was to be struck out. In this Bill it -is proposed that the word shall be struck out, hut it is not proposed that the test may be applied in the Japanese or Chinese language, but in a &#34; prescribed &#34; language, and that, until a regulation is made prescribing the language, a European language, as under the existing law., is to be continued as the test. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> has told us that it is not the intention of the Government to prescribe any language whatever. </para>

                            <para>- It is because the British nation has 300,000,000 coloured subjects that objection was taken to prohibiting the admission of persons into the Commonwealth on the ground of their colour, and it was decided that it would be better to propose an education test. That test is, neither a farce nor a subterfuge, lt does exactly what we desire to do, but in a proper way, having regard to the comity of nations and the feelings of other people. If one believes that some other person is a little untruthful and inaccurate, he is not allowed to call him a liar, though he might like to do so. But he is, permitted to do so in more polite language. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> declares that an Act which appears on the Commonwealth statute-book is a subterfuge, and now he deliberately asks us to enact a greater subterfuge. While we are to be asked to proclaim to the Japanese people that we shall make an attempt on paper to do what they desire, in -the next sentence we are to be asked to nullify it. There is but one reason which induces me to vote for the second reading of this Bill. It is to insert a provision to enable the Government to enter into an arrangement with the Japanese Government, as they have asked us, to do. It is because the Bill enables us to do that- that I am going to vote for it. Everything else in it is worse than useless. </para>

                            <para>- My honorable friend, with the numbers at his back, can s.it there smiling j but does he mean to say that every Act of Parliament that we pass is to be treated as the Immigration Restriction Act has been? Does he mean to say that after we have passed an Act for the exclusion of aliens a Ministry is to make arrangements with a foreign Government as to the terms under which they shall be admitted ? We are now told that the Watson Government made an arrangement with Japan under which students,, merchants, and tourists can come into Australia. Why did we not think of this matter when we were passing the Act ? It would have been much more suitable if what has been described had been done under the authority of Parliament. It is such loose and stupid legislation that I protest against. I object to the provision in this Bill by means of which we are to strike out the section of the principal Act which enables a Chinaman who has formerly been a resident of Australia, and has been visiting China, to come back with his wife and family. It is a wise thing to enable such a man. to bring his wife with him. </para>

                            <para>- A more inconsistent thing was never done. I have read statements over and over again from the supporters of the White Australia policy that one of their objections to alien immigrants was that they did not bring their wives with them. Yet when these Chinamen go home and bring their wives, back, the Government is to&#39; have power to determine whether they shall be admitted or not. The Government can easily make a regulation providing that if a Chinaman is married he shall bring from the British Consul in China a certificate to the effect that the woman whom he is bringing with him is really his wife. I can see no reason for altering the section. I desire to say nothing more about the Bill except that I look upon it as a farce, -with the exception of the one clause to which I have called attention. And is that clause to be in the Bill as a mere make-believe ? Is it intended to enter into an arrangement with the Japanese Government ? </para>

Have they not said that they will look after their own immigrants, and not allow them to come to Australia?

                            <para>- As far as I know, it does not. The very thing that the Japanese have asked for is apparently provided in the Bill, but the Government is not going to carry it out. I never heard of a more extraordinary thing than to strike out &#34; European &#34; in order to insert a provision enabling an immigrant to be tested in any language, and at the same time say that the new provision shall mean &#34; European &#34; after all. </para>

                        (Queensland).While, no doubt, there are some good provisions in this Bill, still, on the whole, I frankly confess that I do not like it. As honorable senators are well aw.are, the education test was in the first instance a compromise, suggested to us, I believe, bv the Home authorities, as one which would in all probability meet the wishes of Japan, China, and Asiatic peoples generally. It was only accepted in deference to the opinions expressed by the Home authorities. But now we are asked to go a little bit further. We are asked to eliminate the word &#34; European &#34; from the Act, while putting it into a regulation. What could we gain by that change? We are told that Japan is displeased by our legislation. But we have no evidence of that fact. We have not a tittle of evidence to show that Japan has ever expressed the slightest disapprobation. I have read articles in the newspapers, and reported interviews with Japanese Consuls and other persons, who said mat Japan felt hurt at the attitude of the Commonwealth, but there is no direct evidence that she feels in the very least degree insulted. Before dealing with .an important matter of this kind, we should have some clear, straightforward intimation from Japan herself - through the Imperial authorities, of course - that she disapproves of our legislation. When we have that intimation clearly expressed, it will be time for us to decide in what way we can frame our Act so as to make it less offensive to Japan. I cannot see the slightest need for any change. But I can see in this proposal a very great danger, which is not apparent on the surface of it, but which, I believe, is there all the same. Section 3 of the principal Act says that any person who, when asked to do so by an officer, fails to write out, at dictation, and to sign in the presence of the officer, a passage of fifty words, may be excluded. The fifty words&#39; test is distinctly provided for. The amending Bill says &#34; not more than fifty words-. &#34;

                        <para>- The explanation is not satisfactory to me. Does the Minister mean one word, or two, or ten, or twenty ? To this new provision is linked a further one, that no regulation shall have force until it has been passed by both Houses of Parliament ; and until it has been laid before Parliament and passed, the present law with regard to European languages remains in force. Thus Ave have this position - that instead of a test of fifty words being imposed, three words will be quite sufficient. A Japanese may come along, and the only words which he may be required to write are &#34; Yes-No.&#34; That is an extremely dangerous provision. I cannot think that the present Government would sanction anything like that, but we do not know how long the present Government will live. We may have again a coalition of protectionists and free-traders. We might have a Government under whose <inline font-style="italic">regime</inline> Japanese and other Asiatics would be admitted. I do not think that any Government would dare to do that, or that Parliament as at present constituted would allow it. But we know that there has been, and there will be. pressure brought to bear upon the people of Australia, to alter their legislation with regard to aliens. Here would be a splendid opportunity. Why eliminate the word &#34; European &#34; at all? I am sure that every member of this Senate has read the old tale about the camel and the tent. At first the camel got his. head into the tent, and pushed until he had gained an entrance for his neck and forelegs, ultimately forcing in his whole body and, turning the legitimate occupant outside. The proposed amendment is the beginning of the introduction of the camel into the tent. The camel, as represented by Japan, says,: &#34;I am not pleased with the word European &#39; : take it out. for it offends my delicate sensibilities. - put it into n resolution, where it will be so hidden, that I cannot see it. but. for heaven&#39;s sake, take it out of the Bill !&#34; We agree; and next the camel says : &#34; You must take .the word out of the resolution, where it is just as offensive as in a Bill.&#34; When the word is taken out of the resolution, the camel says : &#34; I want to get right into your country.&#34; Thus all opposition, is broken down step by step ; the camel knows that if he seeks to achieve his purpose all at once, he will fail, but comes, to the conclusion that if he proceeds by degrees he may succeed. There are, as I intimated, several provisions in the Bill which are an improvement on the original Act, and those provisions I intend to support. The Senate ought Jo pause before consenting to any alteration in the clause which imposes the language test, because it is a most serious matter to whittle away the safeguards provided in the original Act. The people of Japan know perfectly well that we do not desire to have them here, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson,</inline> who, I suppose, knows the mind of the Japanese, being in close sympathy, and probably contact, with them, tells us that they are not anxious to come to Australia. If we do not want the Japanese, and they are not anxious to come here, why this trouble about the paltry matter of the word &#34;European&#34;? It is not the Japanese I am afraid of, but the probability, or even the possibility, of having a Government in power some day who may be only too- glad of an opportunity to introduce large numbers, not only of Japanese, but also of Chinese and Indians. </para>

                            <para>- We must be very careful how we tinker with the Act. I cannot understand why the Government have introduced a measure of this kind. What is. the pressure which has been brought to bear on the Government? I have read a number of articles dealing with the subject, but these have been written by people who are opposed to the idea of a White Australia - who are the enemies of the principal plank in our national platform. Why should our democratic Government truckle to such people? Will the amending Bill make any difference so far as concerns the keeping out of the Japanese ? The Minister of Defence has told us that if we pass the Bill we shall stand in exactly the same position as before. If that be so, why amend the Act? To talk about Japan being offended seems to me to be pure bunkum. Japan does not trouble about our education test ; she has very much more important matters in hand. By tinkering and whittling away the safeguard in the Act, we may place ourselves in the hand of a future Government who may be absolutely opposed to the White Australia policy, and who may, during a period of laxity in supervision, introduce large numbers of coloured aliens, I specially direct the attention of honorable senators to clause 3, and ask them to be extremely careful in. passing it as it stands. If no one moves an amendment in that clause, I shall do so. </para>

                        <para>- Very good reasons ought to be advanced before we interfere with the Immigration Restriction Act, and, so far as I know, there is no particular urgency for the Bill &#39;before us. There has certainly been no demand from the country for any alteration in the present law. I have a very vivid recollection that at the last election the mandate received by Parliament was undoubtedly to continue the immigration laws as passed by the first Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know that the amendments proposed would prove acceptable to the country, and, in my opinion, the original Act is much the preferable. Under the law as it stands we know exactly the position, whereas clause 3, with the loopholes it presents, may prove more dangerous than we at present imagine. The Act has worked satisfactorily in keeping undesirables out of Australia ; and that I take to be the first and most important object. The statistics that have been collected undoubtedly prove that, by the operation of the present law, many undesirables have been excluded. </para>

                            <para>- The amendments are of sufficient moment to make me suspicious, providing, as they do, so many loopholes. It is all very well to talk about technicalities as to the number of words dictated, and so forth ; but the proof of the success of the Act is the fact that none of the undesirable people referred to have been permitted to enter the Commonwealth. It is only so much bunkum to talk about the harm such an Act may do, even to our own countrymen. White men have not been kept out of Australia by the operation of the Immigration Restriction Act. In the year 1903 over 41,000 men entered the Commonwealth, as against thirteen coloured men, and the latter were not admitted on the language test, but because they were only temporarily here on business. The possible benefits of the Bill are more than counterbalanced by the probable dangers; and for that reason I should prefer to see the measure defeated. It is strange that Natal, and other portions of the Empire, where practically the same language test is applied, have not been asked, either by the Home Government or by any foreign Government, to make any alteration. What is the reason for proposing to strike out the word &#34;European&#34;? </para>

                            <para>- The Government must have been subjected to some influence before they decided to introduce this measure. It cannot have been exercised from within the Commonwealth, because, with the exception of the Employers&#39; Federation and the Chambers of Commerce, we know that the public opinion is in favour of the law as it stands. I wish to elicit what has impelled the Government to take this course. In Western Australia a Very suspicious incident occurred very recently. Secret despatches were received from the Home Government in opposition to its Factories Act. I am under the impression that a similar communication has been addressed to the Government of the Commonwealth, but that it has not yet been made known. </para>

                            <para>- It is rather a remarkable coincidence that the Home Government should communicate with the Government of a State on a somewhat similar question, and should not enter into communication with the Government of the Commonwealth when they were about to legislate on a somewhat similar question. We know that it was only because certain restrictions were imposed upon Asiatics, particularly Chinese, the Home Government interfered with regard to the Factories Act ,of Western Australia. There is one thing which the Senate should resent, and that is that it is called upon to legislate at the whim of a defunct Government. We all know that the Balfour Government interfered more or less in these affairs, and now that it has gone, I believe that the Liberal Government, led by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir H.</inline> Campbell-Bannerman, will view this question from a different stand-point from that of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Balfour.</inline> We might reasonably expect that the Government which brought about the influx of Chinese to South Africa would interfere as far as they possibly could with the Commonwealth Government and the States Governments in regard to domestic legislation. I am inclined to think that this Bill is the outcome of an intrigue, or whatever name may be applied to the proceeding. In view of the late period of the session, it would be very foolish on the part of the Senate to legislate on this subject. The measure has not received that amount of attention which it deserves. But that is no fault of the Senate, because it has been kept waiting for work during the whole of the session. From time to time it has been obliged to adjourn simply because it had no work to do. If an alteration of our law were deemed to be called for, the Bill could have been introduced here months ago, and if it had been it could have been dealt with more properly than it can be now. The country has not asked for this legislation. So far as we could measure public opinion at the last general election, the people were directly opposed to any tampering with our White Australia legislation. If this Bill is not directed towards that end it means nothing, but is, as the Minister said, a subterfuge. I do not think it will reflect credit upon Parliament to enact a subterfuge. I think that we shall be discharging our duty to the country by throwing the Bill into the waste-paper basket. I intend to vote against the second reading, but if the Bill is taken into Committee, I hope to submit such .amendments as will bring it more into harmony with the wishes of the people of Australia than it is now. In the first Parliament we framed our legislation on this subject in order to please the whim of other persons. We are now told that it is not satisfactory, inasmuch as section 3 of the Act gives offence. That is not the fault of the party to which I belong. We endeavoured to frame the measure in an honest way, but we were defeated in our efforts. We were told that if we were to accept the proposal of the Government, which practically came from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain,</inline> that would be satisfactory, that the Home Government would not be embarrassed in their international arrangements, and that we could carry out to the full our policy of a White Australia. We were obliged to submit to their representations; but now we are asked to alter what they then proposed for our acceptance. It should be remembered that the only persons who are likely to be satisfied with this Bill are those who opposed the enactment of our White Australia policy in the first Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- f am afraid that my honorable friend has forgotten what the real issue between the two parties, was at the last general election, and that was really whether or not our legislation on the White Australian policy should be allowed to remain upon the statute-book. We should do nothing now to minimize the victory which we then secured at the polls. For the last two or three years, honorable senators on the opposite side, as well as certain newspapers in Australia, have been howling against this legislation. Are we going to give them a justification for making that unreasonable howl ? If it were for no other reason. I should vote against any tampering with our Immigration Restriction Act. which, on the whole, I contend, has been more satisfactory in its results than will the alteration now proposed. The time is not opportune for altering the law, and, therefore, I hope that the Senate will reject this Bill. </para>

                        <para>- I confess to very considerable difficulty in working up any enthusiasm even in supporting the measure, but its introduction may be fairly justified, because - without in any way desiring to damn it with faint praise - -it is, 011 the whole, an improvement upon existing legislation. Indeed, it was quite refreshing to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> in his righteous indignation proclaiming most vigorously against the Bill; but his fierce denunciation lost all its force when we learned that it was his intention to vote for its second reading. The principal Act and this Bill have been described here as measures of a deceptive and fraudulent character, as a complete subterfuge; in fact, no denunciation in this direction appears, to have been strong enough to satisfy certain speakers. I think they went a little too far in that direction. It is quite true that many of us would have been more satisfied if the colour test had been enacted in our law. As a State Minister, it was my duty on two occasions to introduce a similar measure, but only to suffer defeat at the hands of a body which used to meet in this magnificent chamber. The reason why the colour test was not inserted was because it was represented to us? by the British Government that we could achieve all we desired bv following the lines of the Natal Act, and prescribing an education test. These representations were publicly discussed. The object of our legislation was well known. A measure, prescribing the colour test, was sent from New South Wales to the old country to receive the Royal assent, but it was represented that it could not be submitted to Her late Majesty, because it was felt that it would create international difficulties if racial distinctions were drawn, particularly as regards portions of the British Empire and allied Powers.. These representations were made to the States Governments by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain,</inline> who suggested that we could achieve our object by administration. Every one, including the Japanese, knew the object of our education test. </para>

                            <para>- Undoubtedly the matter was public property. What I feel a little resentful about is, that some of my honorable friends have seen fit to denounce a measure which has been eminently successful and effective. It cannot be doubted for a moment that the education test has realized the highest anticipations. It cannot be doubted that it has achieved everything that a colour test could have achieved. If that be so, and seeing that everything has been done in broad daylight, why need we lash ourselves into a fury, as one honorable senator has done, in denouncing a measure which has achieved all that we desired? </para>

                            <para>- I should be one of the first to denounce the present proposal if I thought for a moment that it would weaken the White Australia policy. I do hot believe that it will. I know that no alteration can be made which will relax that policy in any way, unless by the consent of the people of Australia and of their representatives in Parliament assembled. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie surprised me by one or two of the statements which he made. The honorable senator declared, for instance, that this Bill is being introduced to satisfy a whim of a now defunct Government - referring to the Balfour Administration. The honorable senator may have greater knowledge in this connexion than I possess, but certainly I am not aware that any representations were made by the last British Government to the Australian Administration on this subject. If they had been, we should certainly have been made acquainted with them. </para>

We have the assurance of the leader of the Senate that no representations on this subject were made to the Commonwealth Government by the late British Government. The motives of the Government in introducing this measure are obvious. It is introduced in order that we may remove from the principal Act a provision which appears to be offensive to a certain allied and friendly power. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie also said that he had noticed that those- who supported the measure were in agreement with honorable senators on this side, who have for their object the weakening of the White Australia policy. I have to tell the honorable senator that the Prime Minister of Australia, who introduced this measure, and is its most prominent supporter, is the leader of the White Australia policy in Victoria ; the man who raised that standard, and who, on every conceivable occasion, has upheld it. A more staunch supporter of the policy does not exist in the ranks of the party to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie belongs. </para>

The reference was, of course, to Japan, and the honorable senator must surely have forgotten what has taken place in this Chamber, and also the correspondence on the subject. I have read some of the correspondence, and I know that the Japanese Government never at any time attempted to deny the right of Australia to exclude from her shores all whom she pleased. </para>

                            <para>- They do not deny that they impose certain restrictions on the people of other nations, but at the same time they do not deny the right of a people like ourselves to exclude whom we please from our shores. They have opened their correspondence on this subject with that admission ; but they say, &#34; We, as a friendly and allied power, feel that this measure, in its present form, is an offence to us,&#34; and they point out exactly wherein it is offensive. During my own term of office in the State Government of Victoria I know that protests made by the Japanese Government to the Imperial authorities were transmitted to the various Australian Governments. Honorable senators must be aware that even before the principal A:t was introduced into this Parliament, and when it was only spoken of, a request was made on behalf of the Japanese Government that it should not contain some of the offensive features which, according to their view, were contained in certain States Acts dealing with immigration. I have here a very ably written pamphlet by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford,</inline> in which the honorable senator has brought together some of the protests and representations that have been made in connexion with this legislation. I shall read a few lines in support of my statement, and in order to satisfy <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> that a protest against this legislation has already been made. In a letter from the Japanese Consul, dated 20th September, 1901, referring to a speech made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> on the Immigration Restriction Bill, the following statement is made, in conclusion - </para>

                        <para>With reference to the statements made that there has been no protest against the same provision of similar legislation when passed by the States of New South Wales, Western Australia, and Tasmania, and that such provision has not been found to cause trouble in any one of these places, I crave permission to say that the absence of protest against the State legislation should neither destroy the right to protest against Federal legislation of the same character, nor weaken its force. And the circumstances existing at the time when the State legislation was under discussion have considerably changed, showing more need for the protest at the present time than there was then. </para>

                        <para>My communications, however, were not fortunate enough to produce the desired effect ; inasmuch as the educational test decided upon is racial pure and simple. In addition to this, the subsequent insertion of the word &#34; European &#34; in an amendment on the clause which provides for the imposition of penalties on masters and owners of ships, emphasises the intention of the Bill to make racial distinctions. </para>

                    <para class="block">He continues further in that strain, but the point I am making is that protests have been made against the principal Act before its introduction on the second and third reading, and a final protest to the Governor-General. I point out that the objectionable feature in the Act was held to be that the education test was to be a test in a European language. It is now proposed that the European language test shall be eliminated. Under this measure power is asked to make regulations to prescribe the test, but they are not to be brought into force on the mere <inline font-style="italic">if se dixit</inline> of the Governor-General in Council, but are to be submitted for the approval of Parliament. Parliament will, therefore, have to accept the responsibility of saying whether the proposed test will achieve all thai the principal measure was intended to achieve. It. is idle to suppose that the Prime Minister, who has been mainly moved on the representations of Japan to eliminate this objectionable feature from the principal Act, will be party to the reimposition of a European language test. The idea in proposing regulations to prescribe a test is to have a test which shall not be regarded as of a racial nature. </para>

They give us the assurance that they will prescribe regulations, and will submit them to Parliament. In the circumstances, I think there is a reasonable justification for the introduction of the Bill, and I propose to support its second reading, in the full hope and belief that its operation will in no way relax or interfere with the settled policy of Australia, so far as its population is concerned. </para>

                        <para>- Like the last speaker, I think we should not lose sight of the fact that the principal Act, which this Bill seeks to amend, has largely accomplished what it set out to accomplish. It has not only prevented a large number of Asiatics from coming to Australia, but it has served as a warning throughout Eastern nations that the ports of Australia are closed to them; and that has been efficacious in practically stopping numbers of Asiatics from coming to our shores. We have a great deal to thank the authors of that Act for. Australia owes a deep debt of gratitude to the Parliament which passed it. Certainly I should not hesitate to vote against any Bill which I thought would have the effect of opening our doors, or of weakening in any way the bar we have placed against alien immigration. But I am afraid that, in the criticism of this Bill, attention has been directed almost exclusively to the proposed change in the language test, and that honorable senators have lost sight, to some extent, of many faults in the existing legislation which this Bill proposes to remedy. Experience of the working of the existing Act has shown that it is by no means perfect. And it is not wonderful that that should be the case. When we remember that its provisions have been tested in the Law Courts, and that there are interested persons who are willing to spend their money to take cases even to the High Court in order to find a flaw somewhere, it is not wonderful that defects should have been found in the law. And there are such flaws that, I venture to say, if amendments are not framed to meet them, and if the Senate and another place do not pass those amendments, the breaches in the wall will, in the beginning, admit a tiny trickle of Asiatics, that will before long swell to a large stream. Take, first, the question of the education test. Is it not a fact that the education test has been found to be faulty, and that at least three Chinamen have been added to our population because of the faulty application of that test? </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator is jumping to a conclusion. He asks, why justify the amendments made in this Bill because flaws have been discovered ? I have not set out to justify all amendments. I am merely pointing out flaws in our existing legislation; and I say that there is a flaw in the provision which is the very crown piece of that legislation, namely, the education test. There is another one. We have provided in the Act that the captain of a ship who lets a prohibited immigrant escape from his vessel shall incur a penalty. The minimum penalty was fixed at and the maximum at .&#163;100. Now, all the States of Australia have had experience of what was known as the poll-tax, under which so many Chinamen were allowed to come in on payment of &#163;1 00 each. The experience was that there were hundreds of Chinamen who were prepared to pay .&#163;100 per head to come into Australia. It appeared to be a good bargain, from their point of view. In every steamer coming from Singapore, when that law was in existence, there were Chinamen who were prepared to pay &#163;100 to enter Australia. But under our present Immigration Restriction Act we provide that a Chinaman can arrange with the captain of a vessel to refund him the amount of the penalty. The Chinaman can come in, provided the captain will connive at his escape, and give him facilities for escaping. Suppose a Chinaman comes to Australia on a vessel that way, and manages to evade the Customs officers. Then what is to happen? He escapes from the vessel. The captain is taken to the Court, and is fined <inline font-style="italic">&#163;5.</inline> He pays the money, and that is the last of it. It is true that the captain pays .^5 for each immigrant, but he has received the ^5 in advance, and is not, therefore, out of pocket. In some cases recently, fines even lower than <inline font-style="italic">&#163;5</inline> have been inflicted. </para>

I point out to those honorable senators who intend to vote against this Bill that they are going to allow that state of things to continue. They are going to allow it to remain possible for captains of ships to connive to land Asiatics in Australia at the rate of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;5</inline> per head. In other words, they are indirectly going to allow a poll-tax of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;5</inline> per head to be imposed instead of one of ^100. The amending Bill increases the minimum penalty recoverable to ,&#163;100, and makes it recoverable not only from the captain of a ship, but from the agent. </para>

                            <para>- That is for the majority, to say. Another matter came under my notice some time ago. I have taken a good deal of trouble in trying to secure the effective administration of the Immigration Restriction Act. My experience was this : A half-caste came to me in Western Australia, and gave me valuable information as to how Chinamen were being smuggled in by various boats coming to Fremantle. I passed that information on to the police authorities, and it led directly to five stowaways being discovered on one steamer. I afterwards took the same information to the Minister of External Affairs. In conversation with the police authorities, one of the detectives pointed out to me some of the practical difficulties arising under the Act. One of them was this : He got information that several stowaways had been landed, and were working in a certain vegetable garden in Perth. He was taken there by the half-caste informer to whom <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> have referred, and he saw the men working in the garden. He questioned them,. and found that they could not speak a word of English. He felt absolutely confident that they had escaped from a vessel ; but he had to go to get a warrant for their arrest, and in the meantime they became suspicious, and escaped. By the time he had obtained the warrant .for their arrest they had left the place, and were not to be found. In that way a few more Chinamen were added to the population. A difficulty of that kind would be remedied by the Bill now under consideration. Am I going to assist to reject this Bill when we can remedy defects of that kind bv means of it? &#39; </para>

                            <para>- In the cases I have mentioned the law provided that the police bad to have a warrant before making an arrest. This Bill, however, makes a policeman an officer under the Act, and gives him power to arrest a man on suspicion of being a prohibited immigrant. I draw attention to another flaw in the existing Act, which allows any Asiatic coming to Australia to make a claim on the ground of domicile. It does not matter how ancient the claim may be. He may claim that his great grandfather was here when the first Chinamen came to the diggings in Victoria. If he can by any means - and these Asiatics are gifted with a powerful imagination - prove domicile, no matter how ancient or flimsy may be his case, he may claim exemption from the test. I have been informed that some applications for admission on the ground of domicile date back to the eighties, when certificates were issued by the States Governments galore to any Chinaman who chose to ask for them. They were issued indiscriminately without photographs, and without the hand imprints under the Bertillon system, which we now have in operation. The original Act is altogether too far-reaching. We are drawing it very much closer by means of this Bill. We are making the provisions as to domicile very much more stringent, and preventing that abuse from being practised in the future. Then, again, there was another difficulty with which some honorable senators are quite familiar. When an immigrant had been convicted under the old Act, the captain of the ship which brought him to Australia was not compelled to take him away again. There was no power by which the&#39; captain of a vessel could be compelled to take away an immigrant whom he had improperly brought to this country. That flaw has been met in this Bill. I know that, in drawing attention to these valuable provisions of the Bill, I shall probably cause a loss to the Government of the votes of some honorable senators opposite. Some of them who have had their attention concentrated on what they thought to be a little bit of a concession to Japanese sentiment may have lost sight of the fact that there are in this Bill provisions which make our immigration restriction law far more effective than it has been in the past. It seems to me that, in all the instances which I have pointed out, there is absolute need for an early alteration of the Act. Many of these flaws have only been discovered during the last twelve months. But the stream of Asiatics who have been finding their way into Australia in consequence of these defects has been increasing, until at last attention has been directed to the weakness of our legislation. </para>

                            <para>- The number is decreasing because, notwithstanding the flaws which I have pointed out, the general provisions of the Act do not allow a sufficient number of Asiatics to come in to make up for the number going back to Asia, and the number who die. But still a considerable number of Chinese and other Asiatics have been admitted into the Commonwealth because of flaws in our existing legislation. The stream will increase, because Chinamen and other Asiatics are just as keen- as any European races to follow up the advantage when they have learned how to drive a coach and four through an Act of Parliament. The time has arrived when we should make this Act as. perfect as possible. I now come to the language test, and my opinion is that no alteration is necessary. I attach little or no importance to the attempt made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> and one or two others to work up a sort of Japanese bogy to frighten the people of the Commonwealth. I really think that the honorable senator has been trying to ingratiate himself with the Mikado, in the hope that he may be decorated with the order of the Rising Sun or of the Chrysanthemum ; if pertinacity meets its reward the honorable senator ought, at the least, to be decorated with a chrysanthemum. Any Japanese who were offended by the previous Act must, if he has any common sense, be just as much offended by the amending measure. <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> cannot think &#34;that a Japanese will be mollified because he knows that he is prohibited by regulation instead of by Act of Parliament. However, I cannot see that the suggested alteration will in any way weaken the test, or that it is more than an alteration of the verbiage of the Bill. The Government may think the amendment will mollify Japan or some other nation; but, if so, they give those nations credit for very little penetration. First of all, the whole secret of the success of the existing Act lies in the administration. If we had a Government prepared to say that they would not administer the Bill, and they had a majority prepared to keep them in office, Asiatics could be admitted wholesale. </para>

                            <para>- All that would be necessary would be to instruct the officers not to apply the test, and the Act would become a dead letter. But the success of the Act has always depended on the White Australia sentiment behind it ; in fact, the people, by a tremendous majority, are heart and soul in favour of its rigid enforcement. I am convinced that the amendment proposed will not allow this or any other Government to so administer the Act as to enable a solitary Asiatic to find his, way to our shores. A Government that dared to administer the Act in such a way, even with this amendment, would not have the pleasure very long of administering any Act; and, therefore, I am not much concerned about the amendment. If it mollifies Japan, well and good, but, if not, we shall have to take the consequences. I realize, however, the very great value of many of the other provisions of the Bill, and, for that reason, I shall vote for it. It will remedy faults which have been found to exist during the administration of the present Act, and, making our White Australia policy more effective, will enable us to exclude the few stray Asiatics who find their way through the hole which was unwittingly left when we first built the wall. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator said that the letter was sent by some one representing Japan to the Commonwealth Government, with regard to the necessity or desirableness, of making an alteration in the Act; but every official communication on. such a subject from a foreign power to the Commonwealth must come through the Imperial Government, because there is no other channel. As to there having been no official communication, I have proof in the fact that on the 14th November last the representative of the Government informed us that none had been received.

                            <para>- Any such letters written by a Consul are, so far as we are concerned, so many private letters ; and therefore the Government were perfectly right when they asserted that no official communication had been received. That not only disposes of the argument as to any official communication, but is also incidentally an effective reply to those who say that the Commonwealth Parliament, in passing the Immigration Restriction Act, flew in the faces of Japan and other nations. We did not do anything of the kind. The desire was to pass this legislation in a perfectly honest and straightforward way - to show on the face of the Act that the intention was to exclude all coloured people, without respect to nations. Instead, however, we were induced to insert an education test at the special request of the then Tory Government of the United Kingdom, which finds so much favour amongst honorable senators opposite, who are so loud-mouthed in denouncing this Act and its administration. I differ from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> in the view I take of the amending Bill. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> is of opinion that the good provisions outweigh the bad provision to abolish the European language test - that many of the amendments close up gaps in the existing law, and will tend to make the latter more effective. I admit that, from my point of view, there are some good provisions in the Bill, but my opinion is that these are entirely outweighed bv the widening of the language test. Although under the existing law there may be some gaps through which a few undesirable aliens may trickle into the Commonwealth, we must remember that if we widen the language test we shall create a gap through which they may enter wholesale. No provision which will enable us to prevent the entrance of the few will make up for provisions which may . bring about the admission of the multitude. It is the fixed desire of the people of Australia to keep the Continent white - to preserve it for a nation of our own race and colour. In that, the people of Australia are perfectly justified : and we have no right to weaken deliberate legislation in such a manner as to permit of a wholesale influx of Asiatics. It is admitted by both friends and opponents of the immigration- restriction policy, generally, that the Act mainly depends on administration for its effectiveness. Suppose, for a moment, that we had in power a Government, the leading members and the majority of the supporters of which were opposed to the White Australia ideal, and in favour of opening, the door wide to immigrants of all races and colours. </para>

It is simply in order that the will of the people shall not be lightly changed, but that full opportunity shall be given for discussion. Regulations laid on the table mav escape notice, and if they are not negatived within a certain time they have the force of law. There are no safeguards of first, second, and third readings, and so forth, as in the case of a Bill. </para>

                            <para>- Will the Minister consent to embody the regulation in the Bill, so that it can be fully discussed in Committee, and we can. vote afterwards either for or against the third reading? I have no particular fault to find with the present legislation. In my opinion, it is fairly satisfactory. If, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has pointed out, a few undesirable immigrants have been smuggled through in one way or another, it has been mainly through lax administration. &#34; All that we want to make the present law as effective as any one could desire is a little more watchful administration. If that is secured, I feel that the Act will be perfectly satisfactory and effective in achieving the object for which it was, passed. Again let me ask who has made a demand for an alteration in the existing law ? </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator holds caucuses with men who are not members of Parliament. He goes to little sectarian organizations outside, and holds, caucuses with them, and, dominated by their opinions, he comes here and wishes to dominate Parliament. Who has. made a demand for this measure? Honorable senators on the other side say that it is made by the Government to which I belong. The only Government to which I ever owed any allegiance was the one led by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watson.</inline></para>

                            <para>- Yes, and I hope that several of his followers in this place will vote against the Bill. The only demand for an alteration of the Act has been made by a few interested persons who mainly represent the wealth, the conservatism, and the reactionary principles advocated by honorable senators opposite. Over and over again there has. been a howl raised by honorable senators representing those opinions, both inside and outside Parliament, against this, class of legislation, although, as I have shown, it was enacted in its particular form at the request of the late English Conservative Government. What was the animating move? Was it a humanitarian feeling ? Was it a desire that absolute justice should be meted out to broad humanity, to whites and blacks alike ? Nothing of the kind ! A pretence of that kind may have been made, but the real reason was a desire to flood Australia with cheap labour, so that a little more profit might be squeezed out of suffering humanity. </para>

                            <para>- It is pretended by honorable senators opposite, and by the party outside whom they represent, that no one wishes to allow Chinese or Japanese labourers to come into Australia, but that all they desire is to remove from the present Act certain provisions, which are alleged to be offensive to Japan. That is not the animating desire of their party. Their desire is to open wide the gate, to let coloured aliens come in at their own sweet will, and the sooner Australia understands that the better it will be. Knowing that that is their desire, how could I, or any one else, be justified in assisting them to open that gate? </para>

                            <para>- If the Act is not intended to allow the Japanese to come in, it is only an aggravation of the offence in the original Act. We are pretending to remove a restriction from the Japanese, and yet the Minister, in his second-reading speech, and by frequent interjections, has told us that we are going to do nothing of the sort. Well, what is the use of pretending that we are going to do it ? </para>

                            <para>- I am going to vote against the Bill, because I believe that the sacrifice of principle which we are asked to make, and some of the concessions which it gives, is too great a price to pay for its one or two desirable provisions. Suppose that, in order to placate Japan, we were to remove the offensiveness of the provisions in the existing law, and that the Japanese were to come in under the <inline font-style="italic">cegis</inline> of a Government which was not in sympathy with the White Australia ideal, what would be the effect in the country ? It would be exceedingly bad for the country if the Japanese should come, here in any number, because our ideal, I take it, is to keep Australia white, and any admixture of coloured races would be exceedingly bad for that ideal. We want to keep our race pure, because the highest scientific authorities in the world are agreed, without exception, that the admixture of these races is bad. I intend to quote one of the authorities before I finish my speech. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator wants them in other portions of Australia. I wish he would forget his petty provincialism, and recognise that he is sitting in the Parliament of the Commonwealth, and that Victorian interests are not going to be allowed to prevail over those of the rest of Australia. If we are ever to build up a great nation here, it is essential that it shall not be a nation of Eurasians or a piebald nation of any other kind, but a nation of our own race and colour, who, in the hour of need, will be prepared to stand side by side and fight together as one united people. </para>

                            <para>- There is no member of the party to which I belong who is not prepared to welcome with open arms every white man who comes to this country as a free man. Another essential in the building up of a great nation in this Commonwealth is the maintenance of the standard of living of white people. We must maintain a high standard of living, and we know that if the great bulk of our people, the majority of whom are working people, have to compete for a living with coloured races of all kinds, it will be impossible for them to do so. I hope to see our standard of living raised higher and higher instead of falling lower and lower, as apparently some honorable senators desire. If we are to maintain a high standard, we must encourage clean living. We must have good moral and physical conditions, and I ask how we are to accomplish that if we allow the Japs and the Chows with their thousand and one stinks and abominations, to come in here? I use the words advisedly, because any one who has seen the Japanese and Chinese quarters in some of the towns of Australia - and we need not go further than Melbourne to see them - will know that there is nothing in them but stinks and abominations. Honorable senators need not go more than 300 yards from the building in which we are assembled to be assured of the truth of my assertion. From one end of the country to the other, Australia is overrun by immoral women, imported by Japanese bullies from Japan. From Thursday Island right round the coast to Western Australia, and even in the heart of the Continent, on the gold-fields of that State, they are to be found. </para>

I say that we want moral and clean-living in Australia, and if we permit these people, who have not the moral sense of white people, and none of the moral conscientious obligations of white people, to come in here, it will be impossible for us to maintain in Australia the standard of clean moral living which we should like to maintain. </para>

Of what use is it for us to blink at the facts ? There may be first-rate and good people in Japan, but they are not of the class who come here. If the honorable senator desires that the youth of the Commonwealth shall be tempted as they might be, by seeing Japanese women painted up and exhibited inside wire-netting, I wish him joy of his aspiration. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator must have been travelling around with his eyes shut. From a health point &#39;of view it is equally important that we should keep our race clean. The worst scourge in Northern Queensland at the present time is what is commonly known as the earth-eating disease, the technical name for which is <inline font-style="italic">ankylostomiasis .</inline> That is the worst pest which has been introduced into Queensland, and it has been brought into that State by these Asiatic people. It was absolutely unknown in the Commonwealth until these people came here. Apparently some honorable senators do not object to subject the little children of Northern Queensland to the contamination of that awful disease. </para>

                            <para>- Undoubtedly, they do condone it. There are people in this Commonwealth who are prepared to sacrifice its well-being in every respect if they can secure people to work for them at a low rate of wages, and under conditions which will insure them larger profits. I can produce a printed report of the proceedings of a conference held in Northern Queensland, from which it will be seen that one man went so far as to say that he believed that God Almighty created the South Sea Islanders, so that the planters of Northern Queensland might make profit out of them. </para>

These regulations mean nothing more nor less than semi-slavery. If we allow these people to come in here wholesale, the result of such a policy will ultimately be the dragging of our own people down to the level of these aliens. There is a point of view from which I do not think honorable senators have considered this question. If this Bill is not a mere subterfuge it will result in making the entry of Japanese into the Commonwealth more easy. If that be the result, we may find that we are permitting the entry into the Commonwealth of an advance guard of what may in the future be a hostile nation. We may be admitting an advance guard to spy out the nakedness of the land, in order to allow of the easy entrance of a Japanese hostile force, if in future Australia or the mother country should have any quarrel with Japan. </para>

                            <para>- I am not dreaming, and I say that officers of our Defence Force have been exceedingly lax in their duty, inasmuch as they have employed some of these people as cooks in the forts. They have been allowed to wander about the fortifications, and this has occurred right round Australia. It is possible that the Japanese have sent educated military officers here, and have induced them to take positions as cooks in this way in order to obtain just the information to which I have referred. Such things have been known before, and the matter is one which deserves consideration. </para>

We have heard a great deal from some honorable senators about the offence our Immigration Restriction Act has been to Japan, and have been told that we should not apply any such severe restrictions to the Japanese. But it is curious that those honorable senators have not said a word about the (restrictions which&#34; the Japanese imposed upon Australians visiting their country. They have not said that the Japanese will not permit a foreigner to take up and own a bit of land in Japan, or to engage in business except under special restrictions and in but a few places. We have not been told that the Japanese impose far more restrictions upon Australians going to Japan than we impose on Japanese coming to Australia. </para>

                            <para>- -They go there as visitors only, and the Japanese can come here as visitors without let or hindrance. Japanese have come here, and have engaged in business in Australia; though some of it is filthy business, I admit. Australians cannot go to Japan to engage in business there, and we have more right to be offended with Japanese legislation than they have to be offended with ours. I believe that the people of Australia generally are prepared to concede to Japan the fullest right to impose any restriction she pleases upon the immigration of foreigners into that country. I believe that the Japanese will be wise in imposing such restrictions. I believe that they will be found necessary for her well-being and national existence. One of the highest authorities who has ever expressed an opinion with regard to the future of the Japanese nation has advised them to impose severe restrictions upon immigration. I refer to a letter written in 1892 by the late eminent philosopher and scientist Herbert Spencer. I understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie has already quoted his letter, and that it appears in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> Herbert Spencer showed how dangerous it would be for Japan to allow unrestricted immigration of alien races. That advice, coming from such an eminent authority, is equally applicable to Australia. The same danger faces us with regard to allowing alien blood to mix with the white race. </para>

                            <para>- And she is quite right to do so. It is one of the wisest things which she can do. I believe, therefore, that Japan will readily concede to us the same rights as we concede to her. We have heard something concerning representations made to Australia by Japan, and I do not know that she has ever made any official representations to us concerning this matter. The official representations that have been alleged have been so much noise and bombast from the opponents of this sort of legislation in Australia. One or two isolated Japanese here and there may have written something which would give colourable support to the ideas of honorable senators opposite, but the Commonwealth Government has never had a line of remonstrance from the Japanese Government on the subject. If the Commonwealth has received such communications it has been deceiving this Parliament, because, in answer to a question bv me on the 14th November, the representative of the Government replied that no such representations had ever been made. It has been said that Japan has proved herself to be a strong Power, equal to any European Power. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> has been particularly prominent in putting forward that view. He argues that we should be careful how we deal with a strong Power of that sort, and that we must avoid offending her susceptibilities. </para>

                            <para>- I do not wish to misquote the honorable senator. He said, at all events, that Japan has proved her humanity and kindliness in different ways, and that we should treat her as we would treat any of the great Powers of Europe. I do not hold that view. If it be true that because Japan is a strong Power, and has proved herself equal to any of the great Powers of Europe, because she has conducted war in a civilized manner, because she has not outraged any of the canons of civilized warfare - though for my own part I consider that all warfare is an outrage upon all ethical canons - if it be true that these are the reasons, why we should not be offensive to Japan, I ask, is not that tantamount to asking us to yield to force what we will not yield to right? Is it not tantamount to asking us to yield to Japan because she is a strong Power, without considering the ethics of the question ? Why has riot <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> gone out of his way to ask us to make concessions to weaker Powers, such as he asks us to make to Japan, if he does not argue that we should yield to force? We should make the concessions, if they are right, whether the Power to which they are made is strong or weak. </para>

                            <para>-Why treat Japan differently from the way we treat the people of India? We should, in fact, be much more ready to placate the natives of India, to whom the nation to which we belong owes a certain amount of obligation, than to make concessions to Japan. I could not allow the second reading of this Bill to be passed without expressing the opinions which I strongly hold with regard to it. I believe that the highest duty that we who are charged with the destinies of this young nation, have, is to protect it against an influx of coloured aliens. The prosperity and well-being of this country depend upon the policy 06 this Parliament. A heavy responsibility rests upon us; and before doing anything which will have a tendency to cause a departure from the high national ideals which this Parliament has set mp for itself, we should be. convinced of the absolute and urgent necessity of making the change recommended. I am not convinced of it. Therefore, I shall vote against the second reading of the Bill, and shall do all I can, if the measure gets into Committee, to make its provisions more stringent rather than to widen the means of permitting the entry of coloured Asiatics into Australia. </para>

                        <para>- I may say at the outset that, while I am generally in agreement with my honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens,</inline> who has just resumed his seat, and with others who have addressed themselves to the question of the desirableness of strictly enforcing the White Australia policy, and while I would assist in every possible way to that end, at the same time I confess that I am absolutely unable to follow them when they declare their intention to&#39; vote against the second reading of this Bill. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce&#39;s</inline> position is the right one. And just here I should like to say that I believe that every member of the party to which I belong agrees to stick as closely as we can to the policy of excluding all undesirable immigrants, Asiatic or otherwise, from Australia. I did not understand <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> to say that he intended to vote for the second reading of this Bill, because it had some good provisions, in it, whilst admitting that it also contained bad provisions. I understood his position to be that he was not prepared to sacrifice the good provisions in the Bill because he did not like some bad ones. If an honorable senator adopts the principle that he will vote against the second reading of any measure because it has some bad provisions in it, he will find himself voting against the second reading of almost every Bill introduced in the Senate. Throughout my parliamentary experience, I have never seen a Bill of any importance submitted by any Government that did not contain some objectionable feature. The parliamentary method of getting rid of the bad provisions of a Bill is to adopt the second reading, then to deal with the measure in Committee, and to eliminate the objectionable features at that stage. For that reason, I intend to vote for the second reading of this Bill. It is unmistakable that since the Immigration Restriction Act was passed the administration of it has shown a number of loop-holes and blemishes which were not perceived when the measure was placed upon the statute-book. We now know from experience where mistakes were made, and we propose to remedy them. That is a common-sense way to proceed. But it appears that the whole discussion has centred around the language test. According to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens, Senator de</inline> Largie, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs,</inline> the bad provisions of this Bill relate to that point. I agree with them in that respect, and in Committee I intend to vote against any alteration of the test. But, at the same time, I shall vote for any provision of the Bill which effects an improvement in the principal Act. I need not delay the House bv pointing out what the defects in the existing legislation are. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has indicated them in a very effective manner. One of them is, I think, of very great importance. It is a defect which we ought to be prepared to take any amount of time to discuss adequately. If we have to come here at 10 o&#39;clock in the morning, and sit on Mondays . and Saturdays to do our work thoroughly, we &#39;should not neglect this part of it. We, who represent the smaller States, have had a great difficulty to contend with, because our States cannot stand a great strain upon their resources. They have been continually complaining of the expense to which they have been put. Under the present Act, some persons commit an offence every time they touch our shores, and the line imposed is an encouragement, rather than a discouragement, to break the law. The Bill provides, however, that an offending company, or those responsible, must provide a passage back for the undesirable immigrant, and deposit a stated sum in order to recoup the State for any expense that may have been incurred. That provision in itself is a great protection, and absolutely necessary in the smaller States. The variation of the language test appears to me remarkable, if not humiliating, to the Federal Parliament j and I must express my astonishment that the present Government should have introduced a provision which they declare will not relax in one iota the stringent provisions of the Act. The only reason given for the amendment is that a particular nation, which has proved its power on the water and in the field, is particularly sensitive, and that in order not to offend its pride it is desirable not to refer to it as Asiatic. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford,</inline> and those who support him - I refer particularly to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> - have not furnished us with a tittle of - evidence, or quoted any authority, to show that the test in a European language has worked any evil. No attempt has been made to prove that the proposed amendment will strengthen the While Australia policy ; there is only the one excuse, which I regard as, to a large extent, a pretence, that the Japanese people are extremely sensitive about being regarded as Asiatics, and that, therefore, it is necessary to alter a satisfactory law in order to meet their views. We have not been told that this is done at the request of the Japanese nation, as expressed in any official communication. As a matter of fact, a challenge to show that any such communication has reached Australia, has not been responded to. What is the reason for the break-neck rush with this measure at the tail end of the session ? One is led to believe that there is some justification for the suspicion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, that there is more in this matter than appears on the surface. Up to the present, the sensitiveness of the Japanese Consul is about the only fact which has been laid before us in support of the amendment ; but, apparently, that Consul did not speak on behalf of his Government, or, on behalf of the people of Japan, through his Government. If we are to take the touchy nature of the Japanese into consideration, what about the Chinese or the Indians, the latter of whom belong, to the British Empire? Honorable senators have said that the variation of the test means practically nothing ; indeed, one honorable senator described it as a farce, and the Minister declared that it was a subterfuge, and perhaps both are correct. The intention may be. as indicated by the Minister, but at the same time there is a very great danger in the amendment. Is it intended by the amendment that some other language, than an European, is to be used as a test? </para>

If the amendment is not to be acted upon, it might as wel I be put into the waste-paper basket, which is, perhaps, the best place for it, although I have no particular grudge against the basket. The wording of the clause conveys the idea that it is an intention to prescribe languages other than those provided for in the principal Act; and, before we proceed any further, it is the plain duty of the Government, if they have any particular language in their mind, to let us know what that language is. I quite agree with those honorable senators who hold that the proper course would be to set forth in the Bill what the other language or languages are to be, so that we may have an opportunity to discuss their merits. </para>

                            <para>- The clause, as presented to us, lends a very strong colour to the idea that this amendment is a mere pretence. If the Japanese language is contemplated, I should have a very strong objection. Some people may elevate Japan to a high pedestal of civilization, and place it on an equal footing with European Powers, but I, for one, do not. Personally, I view the influx of Japanese with a great deal more alarm than I should the influx of three, times the number of Chinese. It is very difficult to collect information of a satisfactory character as to the relative merits or demerits of Chinamen or Japanese. I have travelled from Thursday Island in a Chinese boat, the white officers of which all protested that Chinamen are the most trustworthy and reliable men possible, but that a Japanese cannot be trusted out of sight. On the other hand, the white officers on a Japanese boat gave a certificate of character to the </para>

                    <para class="block">Japanese with which nobody could quarrel, but declared that a Chinaman cannot Le trusted as far as he can be thrown by his pigtail. However, some friends of mine have recently been peregrinating in Japan and China, and they say that they are prepared to trust a Chinaman at any time, but that they button up their pockets very closely when they come into contact with a Japanese. As to regulations, my experience of some years leads me to the conclusion that it is much better to make all the provisions desired in a Bill itself. Regulations ore the most deceptive things imaginable, and are mostly a dead letter. Frequently, when they are brought into active operation, they are used for purposes for which they were not originally intended. Mention has been made of the introduction of Japanese into Queensland under certain regulations, and it is true that Japanese labourers were admitted to work on the sugar plantations. There was a regulation providing that they had to be under engagement for three years, and also an agreement that the Japanese Government should send out an inspector or overseer, who would be responsible for their return to their own country. The Japanese came, but they remained in Queensland, and absolutely flooded one of our best industries, namely, pearl -shelling, which is still in their bands at Thursday Island and thereabouts. Numbers of white men were previously doing very well in the industry, but the last time I was at Thursday Island the only white man employed in any way in connexion with the business was an artisan who supervised the repairing of the boats by Japanese. So much for regulations and agreements. The statement that Japanese workmen do not desire to come to Australia is all humbug. There would be no need for an Immigration Act at all if it were not for the fear, that Japanese would come here and work for less wages, and under worse conditions, than do Chinamen. We have no desire to see them here. They do not hold bur ideas of civilization or morality, of what is a living wage, or a fair standard of comfort. There is absolutely no possibility of any assimilation between either the Chinese or the Japanese and ourselves. We Have declared our determination to have a White Australia. We have a policy imprinted in concrete form on our statute-book, and I see no reason why it should be departed from at the invitation of this, or any other Government. </para>

                        <para>- Unlike some previous speakers, I think that this Bill is necessary in order to close up a number of loopholes in the Act, which have made themselves apparent to every one within the last year or so. I welcome the Bill, because it is a very fair attempt on the part of the Government to remedy defects under which more undesirable immigrants have got into Australia than was contemplated by the Parliament. The chief benefits of the measure may, I think, be classed under three headings. One of its chief benefits is that agents as well as captains will be liable. Under the Act, it is only the captain of a vessel who is liable if a prohibited immigrant gets into the Commonwealth. The Bill makes the agents also liable, and it provides, in clause 12, that the cost to which the Commonwealth may be put in keeping a prohibited immigrant until he is deported shall be borne by the master, owner, agent, or charterer of the vessel from which he has escaped. Another benefit must be apparent to those who are anxious to see our White Australia legislation kept intact, and that is the power which the police will have in the future to arrest undesirable or prohibited immigrants who have escaped from vessels. The Minister will also be authorized by the Bill to take greater, care in issuing permits to those persons who have been domiciled in Australia for some time. Hitherto, persons who have received permits have returned to their own country&#39;, where they have practised a fraud against the Commonwealth by giving them away or by selling them, and thus allowing undesirable immigrants to enter who otherwise could not have gained admission. I do not intend to speak at any great length, because I think that there is a general desire to make as good progress as possible with the Bill to-night. The main objections to the Bill seem to me to centre round the proposal to alter the language test by substituting for the words &#34;an European language,&#34; the words &#34;any prescribed language.&#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dawson</inline> has just made a very vigorous speech against this proposal, and has said that he intends to vote for the second reading, but would like to see that part of the Bill deleted. I am not particular as to whether it is deleted or not, because, in my opinion, it is absolutely harmless from the White Australia point of view. I confess that I cannot quite see why the proposal was ever made. I can understand the desire of the Government to close existing loopholes in our legislation, but I cannot see that, after all, there is any appreciable difference between the present test and the proposed test, because the Minister has said, and the Bill makes it clear, that no Ministry would have any power to prescribe regulations until the prescribed language which they wished to substitute for an European language was brought before both Houses. </para>

I would ask the honorable senator to consider whether, in view of the almost certainty that it would be disapproved bv the Imperial Government, it would not be dangerous to enact a straight-out colour test. </para>

                            <para>- We have had three or four years&#39; experience of the working of the education test; and, apart from certain irregularities which have crept in, if we pass this Bill, even without the amendment which has been most strenuously objected to, we shall make the law almost as perfect for our purpose as we should do if we were to enact a straight-out colour test. I do not think that there is very much danger to be feared from offending the susceptibilities or sensibilities of japan. I am not very particular as to whether that portion of the Bill is retained or deleted. The Government, I suppose, have good reason for proposing to take power under regulation to substitute at some future time a prescribed language for a European language. &#34; Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof &#34; is a very old saying, and I think it is sufficient for us to fight against a proposal of that kind when it is submitted. It has been made plain that we shall have an opportunity of discussing the regulation before it can get the force of law. We are face to face, however, with certain amendments of the law, which are absolutely necessary to put a stop to that small trickle of undesirable immigrants to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has referred. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> certainly put his finger on the weakest spot in the Bill when he pointed out what seemed to me to be an error in drafting : </para>

                            <para>- I think it would be better to say that intending immigrants shall write not less that fifty words, or, if the Minister likes, not less than thirty words, but the clause might prescribe a minimum and a maximum number of words to be written to dictation. In its&#34; present form, the provision is not satisfactory to me, and I think it will not commend itself to a majority of honorable senators. I welcome the Bill for the reasons I have given. I trust that the second reading will be carried, and we can deal with it in detail in Committee. Before I resume my seat, I direct attention to an amendment circulated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson,</inline> which I regard as very reasonable. I have looked at it somewhat hurriedly, but I do not see that it conflicts in any way with the principle of the Bill or the policy which I know the Government favour. I, therefore, hope that they will see their way to accept it. </para>

                        <para>- I have given this Bill very careful consideration, and I propose to support the second reading. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has pointed out, a large number of clauses in it are absolutely necessary to correct faults in the principal Act. It is purely on that account that I intend to support the second reading. The most important clause from the Ministerial point of view is undoubtedly clause 3. I do not think that any honorable senator, who has referred to this clause, has omitted to point out that it is a farce and a subterfuge. </para>

There is no doubt that it is equally a subterfuge, and this clause, which is proposed in substitution for it, will equally fail to give satisfaction to the Japanese, to whose feelings so much reference has been made. </para>

It is interesting to refer to the debate in 190T, when the principal Act was amended by the introduction of the words &#34; an European &#34; language. As originally introduced, the test was to be applied in the English language, and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Malcolm</inline> McEacharn, for some reason not apparent in his speech, moved that the word &#34;English&#34; be struck out, and the words &#34;an European&#34; substituted for it. </para>

                            <para>- That is so, and it is the proper word to use. Speaker after speaker addressed himself to the amendment proposed, and directed attention to the fact that it would be bound to create great dissatisfaction in the minds of Japanese, Chinese, and Indians. They pointed out also that if we adhered to the word &#34; English,&#34; no one could take any objection, because English is the language of this country, and in view of the trouble and expense to which we go in educating our people, we should Be perfectly entitled to object to any considerable immigration of persons ignorant of the language of the country. </para>

                            <para>- The Government supported the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Malcolm</inline> McEacharn, and the words &#34;an European&#34; were substituted1 for the word &#34; English.&#34; A reference to the debates will also show that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin,</inline> in speaking generally on the Bill, called attention to the fact that it was merely a tentative measure. He said that if it was found to be ineffectual to keep out the people we wished to exclude, it would be competent for us to introduce a much more severe measure. He also pointed out very properly that if we introduced a more severe measure in 1901, it would have to be reserved for the Royal assent, and a very undesirable delay would occur. He therefore asked Parliament to pass the principal Act purely as an experiment, to decide how far the education test would be successful ; and he promised that if it were found not to be successful he would be prepared to submit some more stringent measure. What is the position to-day ? We find that the Government desire an alteration. That alteration must be one of two things. It must be to make the measure more stringent or to relax the severity of its provisions. </para>

                            <para>- Or, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> suggests, it might be a subterfuge. I intend in Committee to move that we return to the verbiage of the principal Act as originally introduced, if we are going to make any alteration in the verbiage at all. I was prepared to vote against clause 3 in its entirety, but the Minister of Defence called my attention to the fact that there is a slight variation proposed in the verbiage of the original Act in reference to the fifty words prescribed as a test. In the principal Act, the absolute number of fifty words is prescribed; the test must consist of neither more nor less than fifty words... and obviously that has given rise to difficulties. It is proposed in this Bill that the test should comprise not more than fifty words. It has been suggested that we should say : &#34; Not less than fifty words,&#34; but either of those phrases would be acceptable to me. But when I come to the proposed alteration, providing for a &#34; prescribed &#34; language, I consider that that is most objectionable. As some honorable senators have pointed out, it removes from the Bill to regulation, the prescription of the language, and gives the Minister a power which I think we should not give him. There is, of course, the rider that Parliament is to have the right to veto any regulation proposed by the Minister, but that is a right inherent in Parliament. I shall in Committee move an amendment providing for a return to the words of the principal Act as originally introduced, and requiring the test to comprise not more than fifty words in the English language. No one can pretend that such an alteration of the principal Act will give any offence to the Japanese. </para>

                            <para>- I might back down ; but in any case;, I would prefer to go back to the use of the words &#34; an European,&#34; as in the existing Act as being infinitely superior to what is proposed in this Bill. My reason for desiring that there should be no alteration in the verbiage of the principal Act is that when I was in England 1 received a note from Lord Carrington asking me whether a report which had reached his ears to the effect that the Government intended to take steps to relax the restriction on the immigration of Asiatics was true. I told him that I did not think it was in the least likely that the Government would do anything of the kind, and, further, that it was not likely that the Federal Parliament would support them if they did. It is clear to me that, although, as honorable senators have pointed out, this Bill does not necessarily relax the restrictions which may be imposed upon the admission of aliens, it can be so represented, and I am certain that it will be so represented in England. We shall lie told that the Federal Parliament and Government have backed down in deference to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> and other pro-Japanese members of this Parliament, and that we have abandoned our policy of a White Australia. There is no doubt in my mind that that is the representation which will be made. </para>

                            <para>- I am perfectly well aware of that. That is absolutely the most objectionable part of both these measures. There is another Bill with which we shall have to deal shortly, and in that measure it is proposed to strike out entirely paragraph <inline font-style="italic">g</inline> of section 3 of the principal Act, which prohibits pers.ons coming into the Commonwealth under contract, unless proof is given to the Minister that they possess special skill which is required in the Commonwealth. The effect of striking that provision out is that if these measures are passed, the new provisions will apply to non-Europeans, as well as to European contract labour. I hold the very strongest views on this subject. I believe that in no circumstances, whatever should contract labour be admitted into Australia, where the people of these non -European races are concerned. I have no objection whatever to the proposed new Bill, in so far as it refers to contract European labour. The only way in which I can deal with the difficulty confronting me is by moving in this Bill an amendment to provide for striking out paragraph <inline font-style="italic">g</inline> of section; 3 of the principal Act. The amendment I intend to propose in Committee is to strike out the whole of paragraph <inline font-style="italic">g</inline> of that section, with a view to insert a provision under&#39; which we shall regard as a prohibited immigrant any person of a non-European race under contract or agreement to perform manual labour within the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- Whilst I yield to no member of the Senate in my desire to see Australia remain a white nation - and in that regard I was particularly careful to note the conditions under which Chinese and Japanese work and live whilst I was on a recent visit to the East - I see no substantial reason to vote against the second reading of the Bill. I believe that it is an improvement upon the principal Act. But when we get into Committee, I intend to exercise my right to vote against clauses making alterations in the principal Act which I think had better not be made. One of those has relation to the language test. But there are other alterations in the law made by the Bill which, in my opinion, are decided improvements. For instance, in the existing Act, captains of vessels landing prohibited immigrants in Australia are liable to be fined any sum from <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> to ^100. In the majority of cases, captains offending in that direction have been fined sums varying from <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> to <inline font-style="italic">&#163;5.</inline> This Bill imposes a fine of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;100</inline> for the first offence. Under those circumstances, captains of vessels will be very careful, when passengers embark in the East, to see that the provisions of the Australian Immigration Restriction Act are rigidly observed. During the time that I and a member of another branch of the Legislature were in the East, we were informed by various people that Chinamen landing in Australia were worth to those who took the risk of running counter to the law at least $1,000, or about ,&#163;100 per head. That risks are taken - I do not say by ships&#39; captains, but by some persons- is evidenced by the publication of information in the daily newspapers, to the effect that there is hardly a vessel trading between the Commonwealth and the East that is not found to have stowaways on board on the voyage to Australia. Evidently some persons hold out an inducement to </para>

                    <para class="block">Chinamen to come to these States. That is further proved by the fact that on many occasions numbers of Chinamen have been rejected by the Customs authorities. The Bill before us makes it compulsory for a ship&#39;s captain who brings a prohibited immigrant to Australia to pay for his keep while he is in the Commonwealth, and also compels those who are responsible for such persons coming here to take them away again, or to provide their passage money on some other vessel which will take them to the place from which they came. Under the present law Chinese and Japanese can come into Australia, and if they feel so disposed, can return to their own countries to-morrow. The present Bill provides that if they return within five years they receive no permit to come back again. That provision is a decided improvement upon the present law. Whilst I was in Hong Kong a peculiar case was brought under my notice. The firm of Butterfield and Swires, shipping agents for the China Navigation Company, was suspicious that certain Chinese merchants were trafficking in naturalization papers and certificates. They deputed a boy - all Chinese are called boys by white men in the East? - to go to a certain Chinese merchant in Hong Kong, and obtain from him, if possible, a paper which would enable any Chinese other than the one justly entitled to the document to come to Australia. The boy succeeded in obtaining the paper, and there was a prosecution before the Hong Kong Courts. It was disclosed in evidence that the Chinese merchant in question had his safe full of the naturalization papers - clearly proving that there is a large traffic in such certificates. I would suggest to the Minister that the alteration should be made in the issue of certificates. At the present time I understand that when a Chinese desires to return to China, or a Japanese to Japan, the authorities take a photograph of him with an impress of his hand. The certificate contains particulars of his height, any peculiar features, if any in his appearance, and generally a full description of him, as well .as his hand print. That certificate is given to the Chinese when leaving Australia, and the authorities keep a copy of it. If the certificate were not issued to the Chinese when leaving the country, there would be no chance whatever of his selling it when he arrived at his destination, and consequently there would be no possibility of illicit traffic in certificates. I understand that the United States Acts were similar to ours until about two years ago. They then ceased to issue to the Chinese a certificate containing a photograph, but kept that in possession of the authorities. If that were done here it would considerably minimize the difficulties the authorities experience in detecting persons who attempt to come in under various pretences. I suggest that the Government should look into that subject, with a view to adopt the American system. I do not wish to delay the second-reading stage of the Bill, but in Committee I intend to exercise my right in regard to certain alterations of the existing law, and especially in regard to the language test. The clause of this Bill is couched in such language that I think it leaves some doubt as to what is intended, and it is possible that the Courts may interpret it in such a way that it would not be palatable to those who desire to see Australia remain a. white nation. </para>

                        <para>- If there was a treaty at that time, the alliance was entered into after the discussion of the amendment. On that occasion it was suggested by the Imperial authorities that, in order to secure our object, it would be better to provide an education test, instead of drawing the direct colour line, and that was done. Subsequently Great Britain became more closely associated with Japan, and the alliance has recently been ratified in stronger terms. Under the circumstances, I ask, what chance would there be of the Imperial authorities now assenting to a Bill containing such a provision as that proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens?</inline></para>

                        <para>- The position is very much stronger in that respect to-day than it was then. The Imperial Government has entered into a stronger alliance, or treaty, with Japan than was in existence at that time. &#39; What would be the result if we were to pass this amendment? The Royal Assent would be refused to the Bill. Therefore certain improvements upon our existing legislation which are contained in its provisions would be lost. I intend to vote against the amendment, because I r&#39;.o not wish the Bill to be lost, and not because I should not like to see a straight-out colour test adopted. I hope, however, that the time is not far distant when we shall receive an intimation from the Imperial Government that they would not dissent from a measure in which that test was embodied. </para>

                    <para>- As a matter of common straightforwardness I intend to support the amendment. I would point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> that the alternative existing now is not the same as that which existed before. We now have legislation which will preclude the entrance of Japanese if it is rightly administered. The worst thing which could result from the defeat of the Bill would be that we should have to fall back on the existing law. </para>

                    <para>- I voted previously as I intend to vote tonight, s.imply because I hate sham and subterfuge. Feeling as I do, I often wonder if honorable senators have contemplated what the feelings of Australians would be if the Japanese Diet were to pass an Immigration Act similar to our own. I should at once say to the Japanese that it would be better to state in a straight-out clause that they wished to shut us out. </para>

                        <para>- I suppose every one is agreed that the education test keeps out the Japanese just as rigidly as wow: this amendment ; but, in my opinion, as I said four or five years ago, the one way is honest, and the other is dishonest. Some honorable senators who profess a desire to be honest have said that they cannot afford to run a risk ; but I would point out to them tha: the risk is very much less now than it was before, because the present Act would remain in full force. It may be said that the Act has not been entirely successful in its operation, but I venture to think that it has been quite as successful as could be expected. I defy any one to name an Act of Parliament which has been passed in any country, and which, within a short space of time, has not been evaded to some extent. Honorable senators opposite may think that the Act has let in persons whom we would wish to keep out, but I think they will also admit that it has been fairly successful in its results. I do not profess to say whether the Royal Assent- would be given to the Bill if it provided for a colour test. When we were dealing with the original Bill, in 1 901, I did not consider that question, and no one in that Parliament could have said with certainty that the Royal Assent would not be given. </para>

If the Royal Assent were refused the Bill would be lost, but if it were granted we should have an opportunity of showing that we are not afraid to say exactly what we mean. A large majority in each House has decided to keep out undesirable immigrants, so let us try to be honest and to keep them out, especially when the risk we run in an endeavour to be decently honest is almost nothing. </para>

                    <para>- The position to-day is very different from what it was in 1901. At that time we wanted a measure to keep out undesirable immigrants, and we were told pretty plainly that if we passed a Bill with a provision for a colour test it would not be allowed by the British &#34;Government. If we were to adopt a colour test now and the Bill were assented to, we should be able to exclude these aliens by direct legislation ; but if, on the other hand, it were not assented to, our legislation would remain in full force. </para>

There is absolutely nothing official. Responsible Ministers have been asked whether any official protest has been made on behalf of Japan, and the reply has always been &#34; No.&#34; I ask the Minister in charge of this Bill now whether there is anything of the kind ? </para>

                        <para>- I prefer to accept the statement of a responsible Minister of the Commonwealth. He is bound to give the Senate any information of the kind if the Government are in possession of it, but honorable senators heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> just now&#34; state that they are not in possession of any information of the kind. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> was a responsible Minister of the Commonwealth, he did not furnish us with any such information. 1 question whether the honorable senator has any now. I believe that he is merely repeating statements made by others, and submits no proof of the accuracy of those statements. </para>

                        <para>- There is this difference in the method of destruction : iri my opinion, &#39;the result of carrying the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> will be to destroy the whole Bill, and there is a lot of merit in this measure. If the other method is adopted, we shall destroy only a provision which is a danger to our White Australia policy, and will still be able to take advantage of what is meritorious in the Bill. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> took a responsible part in the establishment of the White Australia policy. He should be proud of it, and should be prepared to do all he can to see that it is not weakened in the slightest degree. There are certain limits beyond which they are not permitted to go by the Imperial authorities. Memories have been revived, and I can remember very well when an amendment in the very words now proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> was submitted in this Chamber, and we supported it. Every amendment- of the kind was also cheerfully supported by some honorable senators then in Opposition. Not because they were in favour of a White Australia, but in order to kill the Bill. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that I am. The amendment which he has moved will not attain the object which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> desires, but it is very likely that it will have the effect of killing a Bill of which advantage might be taken to remedy blemishes in the existing Act. The best thing we can do is to pass such provisions of this measure as we consider urgently necessary for the amendment of the principal Act, and we can strike out the reference to a prescribed language and adhere to the wording of the principal Act in this respect. The use of the phrase, &#39; &#39; a prescribed language,&#34; is, in my opinion, open to very grave danger, though it is apparently safeguarded in this Bill by the provision requiring the approval of Parliament for any regulation prescribing the language, and permitting any such regulation to be vetoed by either House. We might have an unsympathetic Administration prescribing a language in a regulation which, if it had to be approved by Parliament, might not be agreed to. </para>

Honorable senators are well aware that when the original Bill was being considered, I stated that I voted for the language test, not because I believed it was the best means to deal with the matter, but because 1 believed it was necessary that I should vote for it if we were to have any Immigration Restriction measure at all. I told honorable senators, in moving the second reading of this Bill, that I objected to the language test, and would prefer that the matter should be dealt with in a more straightforward manner.

                    (Tasmania).I objected to the original Bill, and voted against it, as I should do to-morrow. I have voted for the second reading of this Bill because I believe that it proposes an improvement upon the principal Act. I desire to point out why I believe that if the amendment now proposed is, agreed to we cannot expect that the measure will receive the Imperial sanction. On the 14th May, 1901,

                    <para>In the first place, it embodies a disqualification based on place of origin - practically a distinction of race and colour. Any attempt to impose disqualifications on the base of such distinctions, besides being offensive to a friendly power, is contrary to the general conceptions of equality which have been the guiding principle of British rule throughout the Empire. </para>

                <para class="block">The reference to &#34;a friendly power&#34; was at that time a reference to Japan, just as it is to-day. Nothing whatever has transpired to show that the policy of Great Britain in this respect has been altered, and there can be no doubt that if we accept this amendment the Bill will not receive the Imperial sanction. </para>

                    (Tasmania).- I desire to say that it is very much to be regretted that the settled policy of the Empire, the policy adopted by Natal, and also by the Commonwealth, should be characterised by the Minister in charge of this Bill as a subterfuge. I hope that the honorable senator will not, in future, speak in such terms of Acts which this Parliament has passed.

                    <para>- I wish to ask the Minister of Defence to take into consideration the advisableness of asking the Senate to meet on Monday. It is generally understood that we are likely to be kept here until Friday week. If it is possible, by meeting on Monday, or even on Saturday,&#39; to have the prorogation on Thursday of next week, that course would meet the convenience of a large number of honorable senators in preference to keeping them here until the Friday. </para>
