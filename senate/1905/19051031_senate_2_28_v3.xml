      <para>As the regulations are at present, because a man has been a number of years in the militia, and going on the reserve owing to being in a district where it is impossible to continue any connexion with his corps, he is handicapped from rifle shooting, for though he may join as an honorary member only, he cannot obtain the same privileges as regards ammunition as the newest rifle club recruit can. Serve your country for ten years, and you are penalized. There must be numbers of former members of the force who are debarred from keeping up their practice with the rifle, and to ask if he will kindly confirm the answer, because it is contradicted by the letter. </para>

            <para>- I am not finding fault, with honorable senators because they are absent. On a motion to dissent from a ruling, it is desirable to get the decision of a full Senate, because otherwise the vote given may not express its view. I am sure that you, sir, must be getting somewhat tired of a discussion which has largely hovered round one central fact. If the judgment rested entirely with you I should be quite content to resume my seat, but an appeal &#39;has been carried from the Chair to the Senate. Your previous decisions seem to me to have marked a very broad distinction, and that is that the Electoral Bill is a measure to amend the Electoral Act, but in one particular only, and that is the machinery provisions. By assenting to the second reading of a Bill we brought under review the machinery, but not the principles, Of the Act. I take it that any machinery portion of the Act, although it be not referred to in the Bill, comes under our review, and is capable of amendment. If that is the true meaning of your ruling, sir, I submit that my amendment is entirely in order, because it deals with machinery only, and not with a principle. What it seeks to do is to vary the machinery by which the State is divided into electorates. Honorable senators have spoken as if it involved a Question of vital principle to take from Parliament a work which hitherto Parliament has reserved to itself. What is the principle in issue? Throughout the Act the Parliament, in a dozen different ways, has divested itself of power which it has handed over to other persons. One work which it did not reserve to itself was (that of testing the validity of elections. That right was reserved in the mother of Parliaments and to most of the States Parliaments. No one has contended that it was absolutely essential that either House of the Parliament should deal with a petition against the return, of one of its members. In the Electoral Act the Parliament has shown that it can divest itself of that portion of the electoral machinery as easily as it can. of any other) portion, because it has been handed over to the determination of a Court. That was purely machinery, and not principle. The main principle of Part III. of the Act is set out in the provision that each State shall be divided into electorates as nearly equal <inline font-style="italic">iki</inline> the number of electors as possible. The Act went on to say who was to divide the State. It was to be divided by a Commissioner, and he was given certain indications as to the interests he was to consider, and allowed a certain latitude above and below the quota. The Parliament said that in the work of dividing the States into electorates, it would take a hand; but that did not introduce a principle any more than if it had said that the revision of the work should be referred to the High Court. It was merely a part of the machinery of the Act; It had nothing to do with the subdivision of the States. The whole of the other provisions deal not with that overshadowing principle, but with the official who is to design the scheme, and the directions which are given to him as to various factors to be observed in adhering to that principle. I do not wish to institute a comparison, sir, between your ruling on my amendment and that given in another case. </para>

            <para>- I do not know any argument so absolutely worthy of the honorable senator, and so little worthy of a Senate, as a suggestion that honorable senators will ignore an argument of this kind merely because it does not suit. I had another reason in my mind, and it was because I ventured to think that the honorable senator, and perhaps others, are prepared to give judgement, not with regard to the merits of this case, but because they are dissatisfied with a decision on an altogether different matter. Surely I have heard honorable senators speak of the principle of: plumping !

            <para>- The amendment, if carried, would have given a man the right to plump, and in order to enable the right to be exercised machinery would have had to be provided. My amendment, however, is designed to provide machinery to carry out a principle previously laid down. If honorable senators believe that your decision in this case is right, but are inclined to vote against it, because, in their opinion, it is not consistent with a previous ruling, their proper course is to support the motion, and! to take such steps as they may think necessary to rescind a resolution which they deem to be wrong. I have good reason to think that very many of them believe that your latest decision is entirely right. In that case honorable senators ought to vote for upholding the ruling, because, if they think it is correct, it is their duty to say so. If, on the other hand, they think a previous decision is incorrect, the ordinary forms of the Senate are open to them, and they may ask honorable senators to reverse the decision. I submit that honorable senators will stultify themselves and the Chamber if they give a vote by which a decision which they believe to be correct is made to appear to be wrong - that by such a course they will not do justice either to themselves or to the Senate. </para>

            <para>- I confess that the proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> while radical, is one which the Committee might well undertake to&#39; consider. While I am of that opinion, I do not agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> and others who think that there is no important principle involved in the amendment. It would be possible for the suggested Commissioners to absolutely take away from a certain body of electors the value of their franchise. The Commissioners who divide the State into electorates have to take into consideration community of interests - they have to take into consideration the pastoral, agricultural, dairying, mining, iron, and other industries, and group them as justly as they may, in order to secure fair representation throughout the Commonwealth. </para>

            <para>- I do not think so. I desire to show that the proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> is not a mere question of machinery, and, as I have said, that it is work which might be undertaken by the Committee. I do not very well see how any honorable senator could get a proposal&#39; of the kind considered without introducing a new Bill, if this amendment be ruled out of order. It seems to me, however, an important and radical alteration to take out of the hands of Parliament the powers now possessed by us, and hand them over to an outside body, over whom Parliament would have no control. The difficulty in the minds of honorable senators has been pointed out by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen.</inline> If honorable&#39; senators believe in your ruling, they must uphold it, and take other steps if they think the former ruling, with regard to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe&#39;s</inline> amendment, was wrong. The matter has presented to me considerable difficulty. If, for example, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen&#39;s</inline> proposal is not in order, now is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> to get it considered, unless he introduces a new Bill ? If the amendment is out of order, it is so because it does not come within the subject-matter of the Bill as passed at the second reading, and, therefore, he cannot move that it be an instruction to the Committee to consider it. I believe this is work the Committee might do under the circumstances, and I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens,</inline> after he replies, will withdraw his motion. </para>

It is a fact, whether you said so or not, that we are laying down a practice which will largely guide the future deliberations of the Senate. It is exceedingly important that in doing so we should as far as possible make sure that the practice is a correct one. I have not asked the Senate to disagree with your ruling on any other grounds than those mentioned in the motion, namely, that it is inconsistent with the ruling you previously gave on the amendment proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe.</inline> I propose to show, as briefly as I can, why I think your ruling is inconsistent.

          <para>There can be no doubt as to what the test is. Standing order 194 says : - &#34; Any amendment may be made to any part of the Bill, provided the same be relevant to the subject-matter of the Bill, and be otherwise in conformity with the Rules and Orders of the Senate.&#34; That is quite clear. We cannot get away from it. Therefore we must consider the subject-matter of the Bill, and whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe&#39;s</inline> amendment is&#39; relevant to that subject-matter.

            <para>- I am pointing out that you said the subject-matter of the Act had nothing to do with the question, but that it was the subject-matter of the Bill which our Standing Orders say shall be the test. The subject-matter of the Bill contains no reference to taking away from Parliament the power it now possesses to finally review and decide as to the electoral boundaries. I contend that an exceedingly important and far-reaching principle is. involved.

          <para>But it seems to me there is a great principle involved. That is this : On the second reading of the Bill we enunciated the principles contained in the Bill as drawn. Then the Senate goes into Committee to amend the Bill in detail. I do not agree with proposition that the Committee could not amend this Bill in any particular except the particulars mentioned in it. I never stated that, and I wish it to be clearly understood that I do not say so. But I do say this - that when this Bill was read a second time, it did not contain the important principle that is now sought to be enunciated in it. There was no discussion on that principle. Although <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe</inline> mentioned the matter, there was not, I say, any discussion on the &#39;principle of his proposed amendment at the second-reading stage. </para>

          <item label="I.">
            <para>contend that every word you said with regard to the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe</inline> is essentially and absolutely&#39; true with regard to the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen.</inline> The latter amendment contains the principle that an independent judicial tribunal shall be created to finally deal with the division of the States into electorates, and that Parliament shall have no power of control or interference. That is an important and far-reaching principle not contained in the Bill. It was not discussed on the second reading of the Bill by any- &#34; body save <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> and therefore I contend that, if your dictum in&#39; the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe</inline> be correct, undoubtedly <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen&#39;s</inline> amendment is out of order. A far more important and far-reaching principle is involved in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen&#39;s</inline> amendment than, was involved in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe&#39;s</inline> amendment. &#39; The latter proposed merely to remove from the original Act a direction to the voter; it did not propose to take away from the voter one iota of the power now exercised by him. </para>
          </item>
        </list>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe&#39;s</inline>amendment did not propose to compel the voter to do anything, but merely left him to vote for one, two, three, or more candidates up to the full number required - there was no interference with the exercise of the vote. If in that amendment a principle were involved, it was not a principle of very great importance, but was, as I have said, more in the nature of a direction to the voter as to how he should exercise his vote. But if there were a principle involved, then <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen&#39;s</inline> amendment involves a principle of much greater importance. What would be the effect if we took away from Parliament the power which Parliament already possesses in this connexion? I do not propose to discuss the amendment, or say whether or not I am in favour of it, I am now endeavouring to show the important and far-reaching effects which it would have if carried ; and that, according to the dictum laid down in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe&#39;s</inline> case, the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> ought not to be permitted at this stage. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen&#39;s</inline> amendment were carried, it would mean that Parliament would be shorn of one of the great powers and responsibilities it now possesses ; it would mean that the decision of the three persons&#39; named in the Bill would be final. It would further mean that sections 20. 21, and 22 of the principal Act would be repealed; and I may here parenthetically say that there is no mention of the repeal of these sections in the Bill. These sections provide, shortly, that the Commissioner, appointed to divide a State into electorates, shall make a report and prepare a map, which must be laid before both Houses within seven days after the next meeting; that if both Houses pass an approving motion, the Governor-General mav declare the names and boundaries of the divisions ; and that if either House passes a motion disapproving, or negatives a motion for approval, the Minister may direct the Com missioner to prepare a fresh distribution, The provisions which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mullen&#39;s</inline> amendment proposes to repeal -are among the most important provisions of the original Act. They give to the Parliament, consisting of the two Houses, the power to say whether any distribution of a State into divisions made by a Commissioner is a good one, and shall be allowed to stand. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen&#39;s</inline> amendment were agreed to, it would take away that power from Parliament, and I contend that it is consequently of such far-reaching importance that it should not be introduced into the Bill without the most mature consideration. Honorable members will remember that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> is the only member of the Senate who discussed this matter on the second reading of the Bill. In giving a ruling on <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe&#39;s</inline> amendment, the President said - </para>

          <para>What is the test by which a proper practice can be arrived at? It is - what was in the Bill when the Bill was read a second time. The Bill having been read a second time, can it then be radically altered in Committee by putting in some great principle of far-reaching importance not contained in the original Act itself? It appears to me that we ought not to adopt any such practice. If we did, no one would know what was going to happen. No one would know after a Bill had been read a second time what novel principle might be introduced into it in Committee.- </para>

          <para class="block">Teaching importance, and a novel principle which is not contained in the original Act. It involves a radical departure, not only from the principles of the Bill which we are now considering, but from the principles of the original Act which the Bill has been introduced to amend. From every point of view, therefore, if the President&#39;s ruling on <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe&#39;s</inline> amendment be correct, his ruling on <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen&#39;s</inline> amendment is not correct. One or the other is wrong, and should not be allowed to stand. Certainly, two inconsistent and contradictory rulings should not be allowed to stand. I do not in this instance ask honorable senators to vote against the President&#39;s ruling because it is wrong, but because it is inconsistent with the ruling previously given on <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe&#39;s</inline> amendment. I entirely dissent from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen&#39;s</inline> statement that, bv doing this we should stultify ourselves. I say that, if we do not disagree with the ruling in this case we shall stultify ourselves, because we will then have accepted one ruling in one case and a totally different&#39; ruling on a similar matter in another case. That is where the contradiction would come in, and I ask honorable senators not to consent to stultify themselves in that way. </para>

            <para>- I do not, in my motion, ask honorable senators to say whether the President&#39;s ruling in this case is right or wrong. I have carefully refrained from saying which of the rulings given is wrong, but I say that both cannot be right. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has said that the Bill is simply a machinery Bill, that his amendment is a machinery amendment, and should, therefore, be allowed. Incidentally, the honorable senator argued that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe&#39;s</inline> amendment was not a machinery amendment. I have tried to show that it was even more of a machinery amendment than is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen&#39;s. Senator O&#39;Keefe&#39;s</inline> amendment proposed merely to remove a direction binding on the elector, and to permit him liberty of action. The Bill, as introduced, proposes alterations in the method of voting, because honorable senators will see that the ballot-paper proposed under it differs from that provided for by the original Act. If, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> has interjected, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe&#39;s</inline> amendment, if carried, would relieve an elector of a duty imposed on him by the principal Act, and on that account would involve an important principle, I point out that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen&#39;s</inline> amendment proposes <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> relieve Parliament of a duty imposed on. it by the principal Act, and it, therefore, involves a principle of greater importance than any which can be said to be involved in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe&#39;s</inline> amendment. For the reasons I have given, I contend that the President&#39;s ruling in this case is not consistent with that given on <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe&#39;s</inline> amendment, and for that reason I ask the Senate to disagree with it. It is very unfortunate that members of the Senate, or of any similar body, should have to disagree with its President&#39;s ruling. It is only on rare occasions that advantage should be taken of the right to do so. I point out that the numbers in favour of and against the President&#39;s ruling on <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe&#39;s</inline> amendment were exactly equal, and, under our Standing Orders, the question that the ruling be disagreed with,., passed in the negative, and the ruling was therefore sustained. The fact that the Senate voted in that way does not prove that the ruling was absolutely correct. Honorable senators are well aware that members of the Senate will often vote to support a ruling of the President, even when they are not at all convinced that it is correct. It is only right and proper that they should do so ; but I point out that the fact that the result of the division confirmed the President&#39;s ruling is no proof that it is correct, and should be adhered to. My desire in submitting this motion is to secure that the ruling previously given, if correct, shall be adhered to, and that we shall not depart from a precedent previously laid down, without the gravest reason. I hope that honorable senators will agree with me that the ruling given on <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen&#39;s</inline> amendment is inconsistent with that previously given on <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe&#39;s</inline> amendment, and, for my part, I am not afraid to go to a division on the question. </para>

          <para>- I do not propose to reiterate the arguments I addressed to the Committee in support of my amendment. I remind honorable senators that they have already, adopted the first portion of my amendment, which provided for the substitution of three Commissioners instead of one, for the purpose of dividing the several States into electorates. I am now submitting the second portion of the amendment, to make the reports of the three Commissioners for each State final, without any reference to Parliament. I point out that whilst under my amendment parliamentary revision of the Commissioners&#39; scheme will be removed, the public will have the same opportunities as they now possess under the original Act, of making known any objections they have to the schemes sub - mitted by the three Commissioners for each State. </para>

            <para>- But all the facilities which are now given under the principal Act for making known objections to the schemes submitted by the Commissioners will remain effective under the amendment. The three Commissioners for each State will be under the same obligation to publish the details of their scheme as is each individual Commissioner under the principal Act, and any elector who has an objection to the scheme will have the same opportunity to make known his views to the three Commissioners as he has today to make them known to an individual Commissioner. The only point of difference is that under the present Act, when the individual Commissioner for a State has completed his scheme for a distribution it must receive parliamentary sanction, while the scheme as amended would be practically final, because it would only require a proclamation by the Governor-General to make it effective. </para>

            <para>- I am not dealing with that matter, but pointing out that under the present Act the public have two methods of expressing their views.-. Under the scheme of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> however, the Parliament would have no opportunity of checking a scheme of distribution. It would be absolutely powerless either to approve or to disapprove of a proposed division, which would become operative. I do not think that it is right that the Parliament should surrender its supervising function. We should be offered weightier reasons than we have heard before we depart from the present principle. I do not think that as regards this Senate one tittle of evidence has been advanced to influence the Committee to support the amendment. </para>

            <para>- It is an estimate which should be applied to every person in the exercise of a function. I do not take the view that members of Parliament are so exalted, and so free from the frailties of human nature, that they can safely be allowed to be the judges where they are personally interested. It is wrong, I main tain, for either House of the Parliament to have a power of veto with regard to a distribution which has been properly ascertained by independent persons. What , the amendment aims at is to remove from Parliament a corrupting influence of that sort, and to let it stand above suspicion. I admit that tEe&#34;* amendment has no application to the Senate. There can be no doubt that under the present system members of Parliament are at liberty to give way to personal prejudices or fears. Unless honorable, senators can say. that the machinery provided is inadequate or cannot be wholly trusted, I see no reason why we should go through the farce of having Commissioners. Unless we are prepared to accept their decision, the whole thing becomes useless. If we are going to take that attitude, we might as well omit all the clauses concerning their work. The present system commits to the majority for the time being powers far beyond those which ought to be given. While I believe; in majority rule in most cases, this seems to me to be a typical instance where it is unsafe to permit majority rule to reign,, because the rights of the minority have been absolutely ignored. It is undeniable that under the present system a majority in the other House can really make electoral divisions to suit their own interests. They could go on with the process of rejecting schemes <inline font-style="italic">ad. infinitum,</inline> until, as might happen some day, a Commissioner came  along  with <inline font-style="italic">st</inline> scheme which would suit the dominant majority. I think that no such power should be intrusted to a majority. </para>

          <para>- It would be a very extraordinary thing to take from Parliament so important a work as that of deciding ultimately the division of a State into electorates. It is a proper thing to provide for the best men obtainable in a State being employed to report on that issue. It is a. certainty that in ninety-nine cases out of one hundred his report would receive the assent of Parliament ; but it is possible that a report might be presented which would be so incongruous or corrupt as1 to involve a degree of gerrymandering that would be extremely baneful to the whole people. In the event of such a case occurring, the Parliament should have the power to reject the scheme of distribution. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> has suggested the case of the presentation of &#34;a report against which there might be no objection except that it did not suit the interests . of some members or some party in Parliament. Even that, I regret to say, is possible, but that could only happen in the full light of public scrutiny, and retribution would be sure to follow the offenders. It is much less dangerous to trust the Parliament with the final decision than to leave it in the hands of the best persons outside of Parliament who could be got for the performance of this duty. I, therefore, hope that the amendment will not be carried. </para>

          <para>- I am in favour of the amendment. I am surprised at the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> because it appears to me that every argument which was used in opposition to allowing either House to deal with a petition against the return of a member can be used in favour of this amendment. We need not fear that the members of either House will do a wrong, hut I have yet to learn that a member of Parliament is an exception to the rule, arid can be trusted implicitly to do what is right where personal and party interests are involved, in a scheme of distributing the electorates. I can quite conceive that a very important question might arise in connexion with the statistics, as we now know them. It might be found that Victoria ought to lose a member, and New South Wales ought to gain one. If an electorate in Victoria had to be obliterated, as may happen some day, a party question would be at once raised. If a scheme is perfect on the face of it, I have such faith in honorable senators that I believe that they would leave it alone, and accept the inevitable. But, supposing there were an alternative distribution by which it was proposed to obliterate a division in which the other party was interested, there would at once be raised a direct party issue. Is it not better to make such a state of things impossible ? We have to take into account,. &#39; not only our own opinion, but the opinion of the man in the street in regard to members of Parliament. The electors know that from the smallest Court to the highest, no Judge or magistrate, who is directly or indirectly Interested in a case is allowed to adjudicate upon it, and the question naturally arises : Why should members of Parliament be regarded as above those feelings and prejudices which influence other people? All the arguments which have been used for centuries against interested people acting in a judicial capacity are in favour of the present amendment. </para>

          <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles</inline> has a very high opinion of members of Parliament. I do not wish to detract from that opinion, and merely express the hope that it is deserved. But in proportion to the extent to which that good opinion is merited, will it be the. desire of members to so arrange electoral business that they may be above suspicion of anything of a corrupt nature, and avoid placing themselves in a position in which they may be called upon to decide questions affecting themselves. We are elected to deal with the affairs of the country, and it would be well if the electoral machinery were of an automatic character, so that interference by members of Parliament would be impossible. We all know what is meant by the term &#34;gerrymandering,&#34; and I suppose that as long as there are politicians, there will be a certain number ready to make use of the power they possess to extend their term of office. Any proposal which helps to take electoral arrangements out of the hands of members of Parliament is desirable, and for these reasons I support the amendment. </para>

          <para>- I could understand this amendment if Parliament were a similar, body to the Commission we have already decided shall control electoral matters. If members of Parliament were appointed for a life-time, they might be regarded as having a. decided interest in the <inline font-style="italic">modus- operandi</inline> of dividing the electorates. But when these matters come before Parliament every member will regard them from the stand-point that he is judging, not a position that affects himself, but one which probably will affect some other persons. Consequently, if we simply regard the question from the* selfish point of view, the argument that a member &#39;of Parliament would be the judge in a matter affecting his own interests falls to the ground. </para>

Even suppose it were possible to bribe the Commissioners, no one would have the faintest idea what the divisions were to be until they had been submitted, and thereby had become law.

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator MILLEN</inline>(New South Wales). - I wish to point out to honorable senators opposite &#39; some facts which&#39; absolutely destroy the very pretty theories they have been weaving this afternoon. I have no wish to affirm that members of Parliament are different from the ordinary run of human beings ; in my opinion, there is just as much human nature to the square inch inside Parliament as there is outside - no more, and no less. But those who affirm that members of Parliament would be unmoved in their judgment by any personal interests in these matters, ought to consider what took place a few months ago, when the scheme for the redistribution of New South Wales was before another place. I shall not make any statements against anybody who voted on that occasion. But I draw attention to the curious fact that the representative of every constituency which had numbers below the quota voted against the scheme, while the representatives of every constituency which had numbers above the quota voted for it. Was that all coincidence? Am I not right in assuming that consciously, or unconsciously, the judgment of those members of Parliament was swayed to some extent by the circumstances in which they individually found themselves? I could multiply instances to show that difficulty has always attended efforts to bring about a reduction in the number of members, or an alteration of electorates, in the States Parliaments. Such schemes have always been held back until the last moment. </para>

            <para>- I think that the method I propose is as nearly automatic as we can very well make it. A quota is given to the Commissioners, with a margin above and below; and if we stopped there the scheme would be absolutely automatic. The fact that the scheme is practically automatic is not disturbed by the following direction, which is not mandatory; but merely an intimation that, as far as possible, community of interests shall be taken into consideration. But considerations of community of interests are not to override the quota; the former is merely one of the matters to be considered. </para>

            <para>- Incompetent Commissioners might do some little injury to community of interests, but they could not get away from numbers. _ Ability would tell where one Commissioner was better able than another to adjust numbers with due regard to community of interest. I decline to believe that corrupt persons would be intrusted with this work. One argument in support of my proposal is. that unless it be adopted, it would be possible for another place to deprive a State of an additional member given to it under the Representation Bill. At present Western Australia returns five members to the House of Representatives, but the time will come when that number ought to be increased to six, and yet the scheme, providing for the increase, might be so delayed that at the next ensuing election Western Australia would be able to return only five members. On the other hand, New South Wales, for instance, might lose a member - and that is by no means improbable as time goes on - and yet the scheme for dividing the State into twenty-five electorates, instead of twenty-six, might not be presented by the Minister as promptly as it ought to be, with the result that at the next election that State would return one more member than it was entitled to. All these are grave reasons why this matter should be out of the reach of Parliament, or any persons who would be likely to have their judgment swayed by personal interests. For that reason, I trust that the Committee will support not only the amendment, but the decision already arrived at. It was clearly understood when the Committee adopted the first portion of mv amendment what it would lead to. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles</inline> shakes his head, but if I am not right, then I can only say that the Senate did what is very unusual, and voted in the dark. In outlining this amendment, I outlined the whole scheme, not once, but twice, and it seemed to me that honorable senators knew clearly the further amendments that were to follow. </para>

          <para>- Honorable senators will observe the distinction drawn by the clause. Surely it is not too much to ask that, in an electorate for which a man is enrolled, he shall be entitled to vote by form Q at an election for the Senate as well as for the other House. I submit that, unless some good reason to the contrary can be given, it is reducing the thing to an absurdity to say that a man should not be permitted to vote at the same time and in the same place for his representative in each House.

          <para>. - I think that the provision as it stands will give greater facilities for voting than would the amendment. We are dealing with the case of a man who wishes to vote at an election for the Senate. If he is out of his division on polling day, he is not entitled to vote at the election for the House of Representatives, because he cannot vote at his own polling place at a prescribed place in his sub-division, or at any polling place in a division, of his electorate. But under the Bill as it stands, at an election for the Senate he is entitled to vote subject to the regulations, even although he is outside his electoral division. </para>

            <para>- They are made the same. For instance, at every polling place in the division of Melbourne there is a complete copy of the electoral roll for Melbourne. If a man comes from another polling place, the officers can check his claim to vote for Melbourne at any polling place in the electorate. If, on the other hand, he wants to vote at the election for the Senate, and he happens to come from Port Fairy, the officers at Melbourne may be able to check his claim to vote by looking at the roll which would contain the names of the residents of Port Fairy. If, however; he happened to have gone to the North-Eastern district, the case might be different. So far as voting for the Senate is concerned, the place of voting outside one&#39;s division is prescribed by regulation, and where a man does vote in, his own division he votes by form Q. I think that the amendment would have the effect of restricting rather than extending the facilities for voting. It would be practically impossible to have the electoral rolls at every polling place, because that would involve considerable expense, and the advantage to be gained would be altogether out of proportion to the cost. </para>

It is only reasonable that an elector should have the same facilities for voting ini one case as in the other. If it were&#39; left to the will of the Minister to make the regulation, and he failed to do his duty, our good intentions would be defeated.

          <para>- I think there is a misunderstanding in regard to section 139 of the Act. Many ways of voting are provided for. No one can say that we have not endeavoured to extend to every elector the fullest possible facilities to vote, but a limit must be made at some time. If the amendment were carried, then, in the case of a Senate election, it would necessitate the provision of additional rolls for the whole State, at a hundred, perhaps a thousand, different polling places. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator MILLEN</inline>(New South Wales). - I understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie desires that my amendment shall be temporarily withdrawn in order to permit him to move a prior amendment. But, before acceding to his request, I desire to make a few remarks. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> has stated that my amendment would necessitate electoral rolls for the whole State being kept at every polling &#39;booth. It would not necessitate a single additional roll being kept anywhere, nor would &#34;it limit the facilities for voting which are already enjoyed. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> has admitted that the practice I seek to provide for by law is provided for by regulation. So that it is- quite evident that my proposal could not increase the work of the officers or the number of electoral rolls required. What I propose to do is to enable a voter who wishes to vote at an election for either House to vote either at his own polling-place or in his&#39; subdivision. W&#39;hen a man wishes to vote in the division, but outside his polling place, he has to use form Q. It is quite obvious that, in order to meet a case of that kind, every polling place in i a division must have a roll for that division. I wish to enable a man, when he votes at an election for the other House by form Q, to vote at the same time at an election for the Senate. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator KEATING</inline>(Tasmania- Honorary Minister). - I indicated the difficulties in the way of this amendment when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> was speaking generally on the clause. The position that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie takes up is that the greatest possible facilities should be provided for voting for the Senate, but the honorable senator will understand that it is not so easy to provide that an elector shall be able to vote at any polling place for the Senate, as it is to make a similar provision in the case of the House of Representatives. Under section 139 of the Act, regulations provide facilities to enable electors to vote, in an election for the House of Representatives, at other polling places within an electoral division, and if the amendment to which I have consented be adopted, an elector, within his own electoral division, will be entitled to exactly the same facilities in the case of either Chamber. We are now called upon to deal with the case of an elector who is outside his own electorate. Within the division there is a complete roll at practically every polling place, but at the minor polling places, there are not usually to be found the rolls of other electorates, and thus we are confronted with a difficulty. According to the present regulations, an elector, in the case of an election for the Senate, may vote at any polling place in the State which is presided over by the divisional returning officer or an assistant returning officer, and in addition he has the opportunity of postal voting. There must be some restraint when a voter is outside his electorate, because there is not that check which can be placed upon him when in his own division. To put it briefly, a man under the present Act may exercise his vote for the Senate in one of four ways: First, he may vote personally ; secondly, he may vote at any polling place within his electoral division under form Q, for either House; thirdly, he may vote at any polling place within the. State presided over by a divisional returning officer, or an assistant returning officer, on signing an absent voters&#39; ballot-paper, or finally, he may exercise his ordinary right of voting by port. I think that these are all the facilities that could be asked for, when we have regard to the practical aspect of the question, and to the fact that considerations of convenience, of economy, and of efficiency must operate largely in determining the extent to which the privilege shall be granted. I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie would be well advised if he accepted <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen&#39;s</inline> amendment, which will permit extensive power to make regulations to meet cases which do not come within sub-clauses <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">b,</inline> or in which an elector is outside his own division. </para>

          <para>- That is quite a different matter. That could be done under the practice which prevails in the Commonwealth to-day. An elector can vote at his own polling place, at any place within his division, by using Form Q, and outside his division at any polling place in the State presided over by a returning officer and an assistant returning officer. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie seeks to go further, and his amendment would require that copies of all the rolls for a State should be kept at every polling booth in the State. I am as keen as any one to give the widest possible facilities for voting, but with some regard to the safety of the electoral machinery, and to the economical use Of the public money. It is not as if an elector were unable to vote, because he would be entitled to vote at the polling booth near which he happened to be on polling day, and he would still have the postal vote to fall back upon. It appears to me that by these provisions we should catch the vast majority of absent voters, and the number who could not cast their votes would be so small that the Committee ought to pause before it subjects the Commonwealth to the enormous expense which would be involved, not merely in the printing and binding of the rolls, but also in the transport of them and the supply of forms. At the last election, owing to the scanty means of communication, there was some difficulty in getting the ballot-boxes, papers, and other paraphernalia to remote polling places. How much more difficult would it be to get the main and supplemental rolls for a whole State to such places? In view of the facts I have cited, I ask the Committee to refrain from inserting the words, with a view to reverse the decision at which it has just arrived. </para>

In New South Wales, where there are considerably over 1,000 polling places, it would be a work of immense labour to take the rolls for the State to every polling place. I do not know whether the ordinary stage coaches would be equal to taking all the rolls to some places. I believe that honorable senators will abandon the project as soon as they see an estimate of the expenditure it would entail. The advantages to be gained are most meagre, and in no way call for such a large expenditure of public money. </para>

It is practically making every polling place - even one which perhaps was only decided upon a day or two before the election - a centre to which a man might go and demand the right to vote, whereupon the officer would be obliged to say, &#34; I cannot allow you to vote, because I have no means of checking your claim or ascertaining whether the name you have given corresponds with the name on the roll.&#34; Do not honorable senators see how impracticable the amendment is? </para>

            <para>- In many instances there would be no means of determining how many supplemental rolls had to be issued. A polling place can be proclaimed up to the eve of the election. Under this amendment all the forms and rolls would have to be sent to each polling place, and the chance of an elector coming in to take advantage of the provision might be as 10,000 to 1. </para>

            <para>- We provide that certain polling places may be prescribed as polling places at which an elector for the Senate, when outside his division for the other House, shall be entitled to vote. No one has given an instance of the insufficiency of that provision. First, an elector may go to his own polling place and vote; secondly, he may go to any polling place in his own electoral division, and vote by the use of form Q; thirdly, he may go outside his electoral division to any polling place presided over by a divisional or assistant returning officer, and vote there by the use of form Q, under the regulation; and, fourthly, he may vote by post. How can we provide all the rolls for a State, and all the forms, in every remote portion of the State, where there is a polling place for twenty or thirty persons, in order to enable a stray elector to vote there? Surely the Committee ought to be satisfied with the enactment of a provision that the procedure which has been followed under regulations shall apply, and that, subject to the regulations, it shall be legal for a man to vote at any polling place, outside his own electorate if it be presided over by a divisional or assistant returning officer. </para>

          <para>- There is some force in the objection of the Minister to sending the electoral rolls for a State to small places. I understand that it would include every station where there was a polling booth. To my knowledge, some difficulties have arisen under the present system. Take a place called Anarchy, in the central district of Queensland, where sapphires are obtained. In the slack season a considerable number of men go down to this place from the stations in the back country, and may be working there at the time of an election. At the last election, in addition to the forty men who are always there, there were some men who had come from the Carpentaria, the Gregory, and the Kennedy, but not one of them was able to record a vote, because it was not a station at which there was an assistant returning officer. </para>

            <para>- In some cases it would have been necessary for the men to write to Charters Towers, or to send to Charleville. It must be remembered that, when he is living in a camp, a man has not the facilities to write for a postal ballot paper, and that he has to get some person to witness his signature. Again, take the Clermont gold-field. Sometimes there are 700 or 800 men employed, while at other times there may be 2,000 men. &#39; In the slack season the shearers go down to this place with the idea of making a living. If such men were enabled to get votes, there would be no necessity to send all the rolls for the State to every polling booth. I know of polling places where only four or five votes&#39; could be recorded. There is no possibility of any one getting within miles of a light-house in the Strait, or wanting to record a vote there. </para>

        <para class="block">I trust the amendment will commend itself both to the Government and to honorable senators. The proposal may be regarded as an innovation, but, after all, it is by way of innovation that steps are made to civilization. The old system of ballotting has been tried, and has been fairly successful, over a long term of years, but! it must, in process of time, give place to a more advanced method. Public attention is at the present day being directed to the necessity for some voting machine which will accurately record the votes given, and provide every possible precaution against fraud. The fact that an amending Bill is before us shows that the existing electoral methods have been found to be in some respects defective, and this amendment, which was circulated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> simply proposes to go one step further than the Bill, and provide that, on a resolution by both Houses, voting by machinery may be adopted. The proposed new clause 3bes not designate any particular class of machine, nor provide that voting shall be by machinery - the whole matter is left entirely to the will of Parliament. This clause, if adopted, will obviate the necessity for fresh legislation, if at any time it is thought desirable to bring about such a reform. It is contended that voting by machinery will not only give thorough satisfaction in the way of accuracy, &#39;but will very materially cheapen the cost of elections to the Commonwealth. The other day, a voting machine was on exhibition within the precincts of Parliament House, and it appeared to comply with every condition, recording the votes accurately, and in such a way as apparently to make imposition impossible. We were assured by the patentee, who, I believe, hails from Western Australia, that the cost of the Commonwealth elections would be reduced by considerably over 50 per cent, by the adoption of his method. </para>

            <para>- The Commonwealth, which has just been brought into existence, may, for all we know, last for 100,000 years, and df there be an election every three years, at the present cost of &#163;45,000, we have only to do a little arithmetic in order to appreciate the value of an effective appliance of the kind to which I am referring. It has been estimated by those who take an interest in the question that a general election for the Commonwealth could, with these machines, be carried out at a cost of &#163;13,725, as against the present cost of &#163;45,119- I do not know how much value there is to be placed on these estimates, but the fact remains that public attention is being called to &#39;this question, and it is quite evident that in the near future some machine will be tried, and, if found satisfactory, will be generally adopted.- </para>

          <para>- He would be a bold senator who would say that we will never have parliamentary elections conducted by means of a voting machine far the purpose of recording the votes. It seems to me to be perfectly possible that even in the near future an invention will be perfected for recording votes at elections without the possibility of making mistakes. It will not be denied that on some occasions under the present system of voting, mistakes, and sometimes roguery, occur. During the last Canadian elections, certain individuals, who were known to be voting against the Government party, had the votes which they put into the ballot-box conveyed to some other place, votes in favour of the party being recorded: in their stead. I fully believe that an automatic machine will be perfected which will&#34; lead to a saving in expense, and even to greater security. That being so, it will surely do no harm to insert in this Bill a clause to make the use of a voting machine permissible at elections, if at any time the Government, with the consent of Parliament, proposes the adoption Of such a machine. </para>

            <para>- No ; because when a machine tried at other elections, has been proved to be accurate in its working, and it is thought desirable to use it at a Commonwealth election, there may not be time to alter the Electoral Act to permit of it being so used. Surely honorable senators do not desire that, in order to enable us to make use of such a machine it should be necessary to pass another Bill amending the principal Act? If we insert the proposed clause, when the time arrives at which, by general consent of Parliament, a voting machine may be usefully adopted in conducting our elections, it can be. used without the necessity of passing another amending Bill. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator KEATING</inline>(Tasmania- Honorary Minister). - I see very little objection to the insertion of a clause of this character, and especially one drawn in the way in which this clause is drafted. It throws no obligation upon the Electoral Department. It is permissive in every sense. Before anything can be done under the clause, both Houses of Parliament must take the initial steps of approving by resolution of the use of a certain machine, which must be described in the resolution. Then the polling places at which the voting is to be conducted by means of the voting machine, instead of bv ballot papers, must be prescribed, and it is further provided under the clause that the Governor-General shall make regulations prescribing matters incidental to the use of the machine. Provision is further made that the regulations must be laid before both Houses of Parliament for thirty days before they can have force or effect, and they are not to have force or effect if, within that time, a resolution is carried in either House of Parliament disapproving of them. Honorable senators will see that the clause is permissive in every sense of the word. It is left to Parliament to take the initial steps, and bv resolution passed in both Houses to approve of the use of a voting machine, which is to be described in such resolution. The Select Committee of the House of Representatives made a reference to the use of voting machines, which will 1 be found at page 9, paragraph 18, of their report. They say - : </para>
        <quote>
          <para>In considering the complaints of delay in expediting the making up of results of elections, your Committee took evidence as to the use of voting machines. Several different mechanical contrivances were placed before the Committee by Messrs. King Hedley,, F. A. Peters, J. F. Higgins, and Horace Harding. It is apparent that such contrivances may be of great value in populous polling places in securing economy, expedition in the making up of results, and avoidance of informalities ; but for various reasons they are difficult to utilize in the outlying districts. Your Committee are not in a position to adjudicate satisfactorily upon the practical results of- the use of such contrivances in other countries, or upon the value of the respective machines submitted to them ; but consider that the Electoral Department should institute immediate inquiries to see if it is possible to adopt any of the machines in the large centres of population. The adoption would, of i course, need statutory authority. </para>

As I have pointed out, the clause throws upon both Houses of Parliament the responsibility of taking the init ial steps to give effect to the proposal. If those steps are at any time taken, it seems to me that the safeguards provided in the clause are sufficient to prevent the adoption of any machine, unless the general body of members of Parliament have been supplied with satisfactory evidence that it will be capable of doing the work iti is designed to do. </para>

            <para>- We have not the benefit of the result of those inquiries. And in the absence of such evidence as the Select Committee suggest, it appears to me that this is a somewhat unusual clause to adopt. The Minister has said that the clause is permissive only, and that it would be quite harmless to pass it. That is perfectly true, but I object to legislation of this kind, which practically says that if Parliament at some future time directs that something shall be done it can be done. </para>

            <para>- When the honorable senator does that he will no doubt be able to demonstrate that the machine can be properly worked,, and it will then be time to propose its adoption, not by means of a resolution, but by a Bill. Such a proposal should be adopted in the form of a Bill, passed through all its regular stages in the ordinary way, so as to give an opportunity, not only to members of Parliament, but to the public, to know what is proposed to be done. It is a matter of very great importance that public opinion on such a subject should find expression in Parliament. </para>

            <para>- We shall always be passing some laws. It seems to me somewhat dangerous to enact legislation of this character, under which, at some future time, when public attention was diverted, a resolution might be passed without receiving the attention to which it would be entitled. It is better that we should wait until we are in a position to say that a voting machine could be adopted1 at our elections, and we could then pass a Bill in the ordinary way authorizing the use of such a machine. By the adoption of that course we should be in a position to leave very much less to regulations than is proposed in this clause. While I am a firm believer in the use of voting machines, and consider that before very long they will be adopted, with a saving of time, money, and convenience to electors, I am not at present prepared to vote for a clause which conflicts so much with the ordinary procedure of legislation. </para>

        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator CLEMONS</inline>(Tasmania).- I do not care whether a voting machine is absolutely perfect or very faulty. It is verging upon the grotesque to insert in the Bill a solemn permission for the Senate, or the other House, subsequently to pass a resolution in favour of the use of the invention. I venture to think that there is no parallel in English legislation for such a provision as we are asked to pass. If it is not inserted in the Bill, it will be possible at any time for any one to submit a motion in favour of the use of a voting machine, and a test vote can then be taken. I could understand a private senator asking the Senate on a Thursday to consider a pro position of- this kind, or the Senate asking the Government to investigate .the working of a voting machine, with a view to subsequently submitting a motion for its adoption by the Commonwealth. </para>

          <para>- Would it not be better to let these voting machines be thoroughly tested at municipal or hospital elections time after time until one has been found which would answer the purpose sufficiently well ; whereupon the Government, acting upon the advice of their expert officers, could submit a proposal to use it at parliamentary elections? Suppose that, in the midst of an election for the Senate in New South Wales or Victoria, a voting machine were to go wrong, what an awkward condition of things it would create ! I do not know anything of voting machines; in fact I am rather prejudiced against machines since the recent exposure of the drawing for the prizes in the St. Vincent&#39;s Hospital Art Union. No one seems to know whether any voting machine is perfect or not. I do not see why we should legislate in anticipation of an event which may not occur for some years. I feel quite certain that the Parliament would not approve of the use of any voting machine until it had been thoroughly tested and proved a success. I have been told that in South Australia <inline font-style="italic">&#163;,$00</inline> or <inline font-style="italic">&#163;600</inline> was paid for the patent right in a totalisator which afterwards proved to be absolutely useless, and that large sums had <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> be paid away to people. Another machine for which ^150 was paid was, if possible, a greater failure than the original one. It will be time enough for us to legislate on this subject when a perfect voting machine has been made and approved of by experts. </para>

            <para>- That provision was the result of a compromise, and not a very satisfactory one eithe*r. We are asked to enact that if the voting machine should prove a success it shall be competent for the Parliament to sanction its use. It is absurd for us to attempt to legislate in advance in this fashion. It will be quite time enough when the voting machine has been proved a success for us to enact a provision that in view of that fact it shall be the means whereby the voting at elections shall be recorded. It is most inopportune at this juncture to contemplate the success of an instrument which may be a failure. Under these circumstances I&#39; ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> not to press the clause. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator HENDERSON</inline>(Western Australia). - I am somewhat astonished at the tone of the last three speeches. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> has described the act of passing the amendment as grotesque, while <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles</inline> has imagined the possibility of a dire calamity occurring if the voting machine be used. But it should be remembered that in the previous clause we have provided that if for any reason the polling be adjourned at any polling place, the electors who are enrolled for that polling place may vote on a subsequent occasion. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> has urged that to introduce a provision of this kind into our electoral law would be to do a farcical thing. I believe that he has been a party to the passing of legislation which was just as much anticipatory as this provision will be. Has not each State encouraged prospecting, with a view to induce men with knowledge and courage to unveil the hidden treasures of the earth ? By that means it has induced men of talent to make the country richer and happier than otherwise would have been the case. </para>

If the regulations are rejected by one House, the whole proposal will fall to the ground.

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator STANIFORTH</inline>SMITH (Western Australia). - The amendment, ir&#187; my opinion, embodies a simple businesslike proposal to provide for what I conceive to be a probable eventuality ; and, personally, I see none of the dangers which have been suggested. I examined with some care the voting machine which was on exhibition recently within this bul ding, and it seemed to me, as one who has no mechanical knowledge, to be a very useful contrivance. No one would be foolish enough to think of applying such a machine to a Commonwealth election, extending over the whole continent, without having first obtained expert opinion, and subjected it to the most exhaustive trials in municipal, shire council, and, perhaps, State elections. </para>
        <para class="block">There are mechanical contrivances of various kinds which do their work better than would be possible with the most careful human endeavour. The totalisator is a machine by means of which&#39; are invested tens of thousands of pounds, and the public have greater faith in it than they have in the older system of recording clerks. There are also turnstiles and similar machines, which register more carefully than could any human beings. If we have not at present a voting machine which does the work better than under the present method, we shall probably have one in the near future. I believe it is the opinion of many experts that there is at the present time a ballot-box which answers all the requirements of a properly conducted election ; but, as I have already said, nothing will be done in this direction without exhaustive trials. There is no harm, however, in inserting a clause which will remain inoperative unless there be forthcoming a voting machine in every way suitable for a Commonwealth election. The clause offers the. advantage that if an effective voting machine be invented, it can <inline font-style="italic">be</inline> brought into operation by a simple resolution of both Houses. The bane of. Federal legislation is the constant introduction of amending Bills, of which we already have a large number, and many others are proposed to rectify  hasty  or immature legislation. If we do not adopt the clause, and a machine is invented, it will be  necessary  to introduce a second amending Bill. </para>

          <para>- I view the introduction of voting machines with a great deal of suspicion, because I never yet knew a machine which it would not be possible to fi fake.&#34; The ingenuity which can invent a machine automatic, and sufficiently accurate to meet with the approval of Parliament, would prove equal to devising some means of &#34; faking&#34; that machine. It is quite time to make a provision of this kind when we are satisfied that there is an absolutely reliable machine at our disposal. Why should we lay down laws for a future Parliament, which will be quite able to look after its own interests, and those of the country? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> said he had no objection to this clause, and pointed out that if an efficient voting machine were invented it would be a great convenience, and result in much saving in the larger centres. But the pamphlet which was sent round to honorable senators pointed out that the saving would be effected in small and sparsely-populated centres. What is wrong with the present system? There is ample- time for everybody to vote, and ample means for insuring accuracy. </para>

If a voting machine were &#34; faked,&#34; there would be no voting papers or any other record by which a check could be exercised. This clause really asks us to take a plunge in the dark, and I regard it as a dangerous innovation.

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator CLEMONS</inline>(Tasmania).- The matter to which I wish to refer may not be very important, but I desire to avail myself of the present opportunity to lay it before honorable senators. Section 170 of the principal Act provides for certain authorized expenses, but makes no- reference to the cost a candidate may incur in regard to cab hire. Section 176, however, is as follows : - . </para>
        <para>Without limiting the effect of the general words in the preceding section, &#34; bribery &#34; particularly includes the supply of meat, drink, or entertainment, &#39;after the nomination has been officially declared, or horse or carriage hire for any voter whilst going to or returning from&#34; the poll, with a view to influence the vote of an elector. </para>
        <para class="block">I do not propose to alter that last section, but merely draw attention to it in order to intimate that the amendment I shall submit is not intended to enable a candidate to bribe or do anything to influence the vote of an elector. I shall, however, propose that horse or carriage hire shall be included amongst the expenses that are allowed. At present no candidate may employ cabs. I do not say that no candidate does so, because I know to the contrary, but it is unfortunate to have the law so lax that some candidates do employ cabs, while others are deferred by section 176. Wealthy men, who have carriages and motor cars, may employ these to any extent, and may thereby influence the vote of an elector. Many candidates have no such advantage, and I see no reason why if one may use his motor car for the purpose another may not hire a cabman - and cabmen in most of our cities are not so well off that we need hesitate - to take electors to the poll, not in order to induce them to vote for him, but to offer facilities in the conduct of an election in the cities. From personal experience, I am able to say that it is possible for a candidate to go to the expense of providing cabs to carry voters to the poll, and to find that they have carried voters to vote for his opponent. That has happened in my own case, and I am perfectly certain it has happened also in innumerable other cases, and it will be seen at once that the danger of these cabs being used in such a way as to wrongfully influence a voter is very small indeed. The provision would, of course, be safeguarded also by section 176 of the principal Act, which I do not propose to alter in any way. In the circumstances, if we allow a candidate to count amongst his electioneering expenses horse and carriage hire, he will still be prevented from expending money in this way for improper purposes, as under section 176 if he does so with a view to influence the vote of any voter he will be guilty of bribery. We know that it has been the custom for many years to permit the owners of cabs and public vehicles to look forward to election day as an opportunity for earning a little money, and I think we might allow candidates to openly expend money for horse and carriage hire at an election. Honorable senators will recollect that there is a limitation on the total expenditure with which I do not propose to interfere. If I thought that my proposal would lead to any sort of bribery or corruption, I should not make it. I move - </para>

I think it is necessary to state for what purpose horse and carriage hire is to be allowed, and the words &#34; for any voter whilst going to or returning from the poll &#34; should be added to the proposed new clause. Otherwise the clause might be construed so as to permit of vehicles being hired for the purpose of driving voters about an electorate. </para>

          <para>- I am opposed to the amendment. It is provided under the principal Act that the use of vehicles to convey voters to the poll with the intention to influence their votes, is bribery. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> is really asking us to permit candidates to bribe electors. That is clear from the honorable senator&#39;s own admission, because he has said that when a candidate sends his private carriage to an elector&#39;s house, he does so in the belief that the attention thus paid to the elector will induce him to record his vote in his favour. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> is perfectly well aware that cabs engaged for an election day are not engaged for any public purpose, but to induce electors to vote for the candidate who sends a cab or a carriage to bring them to the poll. In my opinion, it would be a step in the wrong direction to recognise in any way the hire of cabs or carriages on election day. </para>

            <para>- No. But I take the contingency <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> suggests, and I say that if in future candidates were to be allowed to hire cabs to carry voters to and from the poll, a conviction could not be obtained under section176, because it would not be possible to prove that that had been done &#34; with a view to influence the vote of an elector.&#34; It would be in accordance with the spirit of the Act to assume that if a candidate hires a vehicle for the purpose of conveying electors to the poll, he does so with a view to influencing them to vote for himself. But if we provide by this new clause that it shall be competent for a candidate to hire cabs for this purpose, it will be quite impossible to obtain a conviction under section 176. The mere doing of this act, according &#34;to the present law, is an act of bribery. It is assumed that it is done with the object of influencing the voter to vote for a particular candidate. We know that in past elections it was a great advantage to a candidate to have cabs flying about all over the place with his name on them. </para>

            <para>- That might or might not be so. A candidate for the Senate is limited to a total expenditure of &#163;250, and he might say that it did not suit his purpose to expend money on printing, stationery, and such items of expenditure, and that it would suit him better to hire every horse and vehicle to be had in a large centre of population, when he would spend his &#163;250 in that way. That is certainly not contemplated by our law, but it would be competent for a candidate to do that under the amendment. The spirit of the Act is to allow legitimate expenditure for the purchase of electoral rolls, printing, advertising, publishing, and distributing addresses by the candidate, and notices of meetings, stationery, expenses for committee rooms, for the hire of halls for public meetings, and for scrutineers. But what is here proposed cannot be said to come within the category of ordinary electioneering expenses. It would be competent for a candidate, under this amendment, to spend money up to the limit allowed on the hire of vehicles only, though that might, or might not, be a successful move. I rose chiefly to point out that if the hire of vehicles is to be included in the legitimate expenses covered by section 170, we should at once strike out section 176, because it would be totally inconsistent with what is here proposed. The amendment is totally at variance with the spirit of the principal&#34; Act, and I think it would be a dangerous provision to insert. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator CLEMONS</inline>(Tasmania).- In order to clear away some little misunderstanding, I might refer to certain facts that are within my knowledge, and I believe within the knowledge of other members of the Committee. I refer to Tasmania, with great modesty and diffidence, of course; but I may inform honorable senators that elections have been conducted in Tasmania for many years with a clear understanding that each candidate is at liberty to hire cabs. And I have never heard that they were more corrupt than those conducted in the model States of the mainland. I say that the use of cabs does not necessarily lend itself to corruption and bribery. It is notorious that they are used simply in order to increase the facilities given to voters to get to the polling booths. If a cab is being driven along the street in the direction of a polling&#93; booth any elector may get into it, and when he reaches the polling place he may vote for a candidate other than the man who has supplied the cab. </para>

            <para>- No. At one election the question of the hire of cabs was liaised, .and the three candidates met in a friendly way, and agreed to pool their cabs. No one could say that in that case there was an attempt on&#39; the part of the candidates to bribe a voter. The candidates recognised the facilities which the use of cabs or other conveyances would give to electors to get to the poll. It has never been looked at in any other way in Tasmania, where the practice has been in vogue for a long time. No one has ever imagined that a candidate derived great benefit from the employment of cabs. As a- matter of fact, the man who put on most cabs was thought to be the biggest &#34; softy.&#34; </para>

            <para>- He ought to be encouraged in the interest of poor, long suffering cabmen, who are thus enabled to earn money which they do not get too many chances to obtain. At the last Commonwealth elections the cabmen were absolutely staggered to find that no candidate dared to hire a cab. In the law, there is no direct provision that a candidate may hire cabs. On one occasion, in Tasmania, a great many cabs were seen taking, electors to the poll, and inquiry elicited the fact that the cabmen had been gratuitously plying their vocation in the interest of one candidate. It was very difficult for an ordinary man to believe the assertion ; but it was made; and it may have been true. If we do not make it lawful for a. candidate to employ cabs, underhand means will be resorted to, and cabmen will be prepared to assert that they gave their services gratuitously. </para>

          <para>- I do not think that this clause ought to provide for original receipted bills of particulars to be supplied by a candidate to the Commonwealth Electoral Officer for the State. When I sent in my receipted accounts they were retained. It is quite true that if there had been a mistake on the part of the printer, and he had sued me, I could have subpoenaed an officer in the Electoral Office. But I think that the proper course would be for the Government, through their officers, to take copies of the receipted accounts, and then return them. After some little trouble the Department consented to give me copies of my accounts; but of course these would not have been accepted in a Court of law, as they were not attested in any way. </para>

          <para>. - I must oppose the amendment. I think that the interjection of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> suggests a solution of the whole difficulty. I know that at the last election many candidates took the precaution of getting receipts in duplicate. It is very much easier for candidates to adopt that method than for the electoral officers to be required to copy the accounts, which are furnished by hundreds of candidates. If a candidate has reason to fear that he may be sued by any person, a duplicate receipt would be just as good evidence as the original receipt if the Court could be satisfied that the latter had been properly stamped. </para>

        <para class="block">A suggestion has been made as to the desirableness of imposing a definite term for the keeping of receipts by the Chief Electoral Officer. Ido not know that two months would be a desirable term. Reference has been made to section 94 of the principal Act, which provides that proceedings with respect to an election petition must be Instituted within forty days after the return of the writ. Section 172 of the Act provides that the statement and receipts must be filed within eight weeks after the declaration of the poll. There are a number of offences under the Act which may be prosecuted summarily, apart altogether from questions of disputed returns, and&#39; I do not find on reference to the Act any limitation of time imposed for the institution of proceedings with respect to such offences. But, as honorable senators are well aware, in these cases, by the operation of our Judiciary Act, proceedings can be instituted in Courts of summary jurisdiction in the various States. And I think I am correct in saying that, in the absence of any express provision as to the time within which proceedings shall be taken in any Court of jurisdiction for offences described by Statute, the period of six months is the usual term allowed. That is the period laid down in Jervis&#39; Act, which may be said to be the foundation for provisions with respect to summary jurisdiction &#34; throughout the States of the Commonwealth. If we did impose a limit, I think it would be desirable to say that it should be within six months after the declaration of the poll or the return of the writ. In such a case as that towhich <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles</inline> has referred, I think that the candidate should not be put to the expense of sending an officer from the Electoral Department to Hamilton to take up and down a receipt which has been placed in his custody. I have no doubt it could and would be transmitted without that expense, and I do not think it is necessary that we should legislate expressly to provide for it. </para>

            <para>- There would then be no opportunity to bring it before the Court, and secondary evidence of the transaction would have to be given. I think it is very much more likely that the receipt would be mislaid by a private individual than by a public officer. </para>

The amendment would put candidates to an immense amount of labour. It ought to be possible to arrange the matter in a very; simple way, and so long as it is understood that when an account ils wanted the Chief Electoral Officer will be able to produce it, that is all that is required. </para>
