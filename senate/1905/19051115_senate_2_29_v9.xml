                        <para>- I have not thought of the question myself. I expect that the New Zealand Government have seen the reports in the newspapers, and I have no doubt they will take steps in the direction indicated. I dp not know whether it would be right for us to send to them Captain Creswell's report. The New Zealand Parliament passed a Bill altering the provisions of the agreement to some extent, but I have not yet been able to secure a copy of it. </para>

                            <para>- It is with extraordinary regret and surprise that I find myself in the position I occupy to-day. The Commerce Bill is one in which I have taken special interest. I studied it carefully. I proposed a number of amendments in it, and I was prepared to propose other amendments. Yesterday being Tuesday, I arrived in Melbourne after a journey of nearly 600 miles. </para>

                            <para>- I point out that the Senate takes no cognizance of what takes place in Committee until the Committee has reported. The Committee on the Commerce Bill has reported, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> is now proposing a motion of urgency under standing order No. 60. It is not for me to say whether the question raised by the honorable senator is one of urgency or not - that is for the four honorable senators who rise in their places to support him. I therefore consider that the motion is in order. I have already ruled once or twice that it is not for me to say that a question raised in this way is one of urgency. It may appear to be a matter of very trivial importance, and yet, during the discussion upon it, it may develop into one of pressing importance. I have therefore ruled that the four honorable senators, who, under the Standing Orders, rise in their places to support a motion of this kind, are the judges as to whether the matter with which it deals is one of urgency or not. </para>

                            <para>- I was saying that I arrived in Melbourne yesterday after a journey of 600 miles. After sitting in this chamber for something like nine hours, I was fairly exhausted, and I went away on the complete understanding that the arrangement proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> last Friday would be faithfully carried out. The leader of the Opposition, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> knew that I was going away and also that I was" very anxious indeed1 to move certain amendments on the Bill prior to clause 10. I felt that I was unequal to the task, and must forego the opportunity to do so. My surprise this morning was unbounded when I found from .the newspapers that the Committee had gone right through the Bill. I direct the attention of honorable senators to the report of what occurred last Friday. First of all, I should like to say that there has been no undue time spent in the consideration of this Bill, certainly no expenditure of time warranting undue steps being taken to curtail the rights of honorable senators. Last week the Senate considered the second reading of the Bill on Wednesday, and again on Thursday night, so that a day and a half was devoted to the second-reading stage of one of the most important Bills ever introduced into any Parliament. To show how brief the time was; I may refer to the fact that on Friday morning <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> arrived" in Melbourne with the express intention and desire to take par* in the second-reading debate, and the honorable and learned" senator was exceedingly surprised to find that it had been closed on Thursday night. That is a fair indication of the view entertained by am honorable senator eminently versed in public affairs as to the rate of speed with- which the consideration of this measure has been conducted. We went into Committee on. the Bill on last Friday; the consideration of it in Committee was continued yesterday and before midnight the representatives of the Government in the Senate thought they were entitled to rush the Bill through in the absence of opposition. I have here the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report of what took place in this chamber on last Friday in connexion with the suggestion made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford. Senator Playford</inline> is reported to have said - </para>

It has been suggested' to me by some of my friends that it is not wise to express an opinion on such a matter until progress has been made; but I think it is only courteous to senators on both sides of the chamber to answer the question. </para>

                        <para>- All the more important features were discussed at length, though I admit that we did not discuss this particular clause, which I . regard as of little or no importance. The Bill naturally divides itself into three parts, and I think a fair proposal would be to devote a sitting day to considering each part in Committee. That would give honorable senators ample opportunity to express their views, which, of course, they ought to do as concisely as is consistent with clearness. If at four o'clock we have dealt with the first foul clauses, I think I could regard that as fair progress. The next part of the Bill deals with the inspection of imports and exports, and the third part relates to the prohibition of exports and imports. The whole of Tuesday might be devoted to the second part of the Bill, and the consideration of the measure concluded on Wednesday. I cannot myself make progress, because the Bill is in the hands of the Committee ; but I can rightly ask honorable senators to remain until a fair number of the provisions have been dealt with. </para>

                        <para>- I am exceedingly glad that we have reached the point at which I was striving when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe</inline> raised the point of order, and that we have received from the Minister an intimation, courteously given, as to the course he intends to take. T think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> has put the matter very fairly. As the honorable senator says, the Bill divides itself into three parts, and the clauses to clause 4 inclusive are as important and essential as any other part of the measure. I am afrai'd that, in those first four clauses, there are a great number of matters of a very controversial character, and, without arguing them further at this stage, I should like to say, in reference to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playfords</inline> very moderate, proper, and business-like statement, that under the heading of " trade description " there are many departures from the language of the Merchandise Marks Act, involving serious and grave questions. Under the heading of " false trade description " also there are departures, especially in the phrase " likely to mislead," to which I intend to call attention. Anything I have to say shall be characterized by brevity; and, while I 'frankly welcome <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford's</inline> statement, I point out to him that it is possible, before we reach clause 4. for him to be satisfied, on hearing the amendments which honorable senators mav desire to move, that the business done justifies him in asking the Chairman to report progress. In the meantime I shall ask honorable senators who sit with me on this side to assist the Minister, not overlooking amendments, or withholding or refraining from repeating, if necessary, arguments again and again, while confining their remarks within reasonable limits. </para>

                            <para>- If there was no promise, there was that which would be ordinarily regarded as a binding agreement amongst honorable men. The Bill received certain consideration yesterday, and, although there was some discussion, and a considerable number of amendments moved in the earlier part of the day, it must be recognised that very often in Committee the most important debate is on one clause, and that when that clause is passed the remaining clauses are more or less rapidly disposed of. It was not fair on the part of the Minister, because there had been considerable debate on important points early yesterday, to seek to have the whole of the discussion on the remaining clauses of the Bill concluded in one day, in face of the statement that he was quite willing to give two days to their consideration. The seriousness of the position lies in the fact that so many honorable senators were absent yesterday. I know that every honorable senator is on an equal footing, but by custom and courtesy, in all Legislatures, consideration is extended to any member who takes a special or prominent interest in a Bill, if he is unable to be present. In the majority of cases, that special interest is considered to be a sufficient reason for postponing the matter for a few hours, or until the next day, to enable him to take part in the discussion. The action of the Ministry yesterday looks too much like being ready to take advantage of the absence of honorable senators, in order to rush the Bill through. Not only did <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> commit himself to the Senate, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> more or less committed himself to me personally, in regard to one of the provisions. I had endeavoured to show that there were very strong reasons why some addition should be made to the Bill, in order to make clear to exporters and importers that they would not be called upon to include in the Customs entry numerous trade descriptions under the regulations of the measure; and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> while declining to give any promise to adopt an amendment which I foreshadowed, distinctly said that the proper place for such an amendment was among the miscellaneous clauses at the end of the Bill. </para>

                            <para>- Yes ; these were precisely the words the honorable senator used. Late on Friday afternoon, when the usual hour for adjournment was approaching, I, at <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon's</inline> suggestion, did not press the amendment, resolving to take a later opportunity. Both Ministers, more or less, committed themselves to an undertaking that there would be an opportunity afforded for the consideration due to the measure. Let me show one result of the undue haste which has been exhibited in regard to this measure. If honorable senators turn to the Bill, they will find that clauses 10 and 13 are identical, except that one deals with falsely-marked imports, whilst the other deals with falsely-marked exports. But in clause 13 the word " importer " appears in obvious error for " exporter"; and I had proposed, on reaching that clause, to draw attention to the blunder, in order to have it rectified. For all that I know, the Minister may have put that matter right in my absence last night; but, at any rate, that was one of the amendments which I proposed to submit, and the .absence of which renders the clause entirely stupid. It is a fact that all, or most, of the legislation which ul'timately proves to be bad, is passed in the early hours of the morning. Clause 15, which enumerates the classes of goods to be brought under the operation of the Bill, was inserted in another place at about 2 o'clock in the morning, and in this connexion, the Minister of Trade and Customs broke away entirely from his promise to the public. </para>

                            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> will see that that standing order, and, in fact, all the Standing Orders must be administered with intelligence. How is it possible for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> to discuss the question he has brought forward unless he does refer to a debate which has taken place in Committee? As a matter of fact, if we take the standing order literally, perhaps, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> is not in order, but there must be exceptions, as circumstances require. For instance, there is, or used to be, a rule of law that no wife or husband can give evidence one against the other. That rule of law, however, is broken when a wife charges her husband with assault, because no one else can give evidence. So in this case, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> cannot discuss the question which he has brought forward, and which four members of the Senate have said is urgent, unless he discusses what took place last night. But J do not think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> is in order in discussing what took place some time ago in another place. </para>

It has been shown that the measure largely affects our import and export trade, creates a mass of new offences, and brings into greater play very drastic sections of the Customs Act. </para>

                        <para>- I understood the Minister to say just now, in an interjection, that no promise was made. All I can say is that if tie repeats that statement it' will become a question of credibility. My knowledge of the matter amounts to this : Just before 10 o'clock last night, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> asked me if I would pair with him, so that he and I could go home. I reminded him of clause 15 ; because he had already told us, in the course of the debate, that when clause 15 came before the Committee he intended either to move or to support an amendment in it. I reminded him of that, and asked him upon what questions te wished to pair. He said that he was against any amendment up to clause 10, and that when that clause was reached, the Senate was going to adjourn. The consequence was that I paired with him. He left, and I left some time afterwards - at all events, before the time when the Bill was rushed through. The importance of the matter arises in this way. Senator Best arid I were both opposed to he ( Government on one point arising in clause 15. The Minister knew that very well from the debate ' which had taken place. Up to clause 10, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> and I were on opposite sides. I was therefore induced to pair with him on the assurance that 'the Senate was going to adjourn when clause 10 was reached. I have communicated with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> this morning by telephone, and he informs me that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> told him that the Senate was going to adjourn at clause 10. </para>

                            <para>- I heard the speech of the Minister of Defence, on Friday, and also some remarks which he made at the table yesterday. But I did not rely upon those. I went awa-y last night relying on the statement of " <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best.</inline> ' His opinion with regard to the Bill was perfectly well known to the Minister, and to every one, because he had previously said that 'he was inclined to agree with' some members on this side of the Chamber that an alteration was necessary. Indeed, on one point he voted against the Government. There was another division in which he voted with the Government, and he then said, on the floor of the Chamber, that what he proposed to do was to support or move for an alteration when we reached clause 15, so that clause 5 would not apply to any goods or articles except those mentioned in clause 15. That is to say. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> proposed to alter clause 15 so as -to make it agree with clause 5, as well as with clauses 7 and n. Clearly,  he would not have gone away had he had any idea that clause 15 was going to be dealt with. I am perfectly sure also that he would not have offered to pair with me, and would not have told me that it was safe to go away, had he believed that it was Intended to proceed further than clause 10. I think that this question is of far greater importance than any arising in connexion with the Bill, because it is a question of honesty of method in the conduct of the business of the Senate. Unless the Minister can show that he did not make any statement to honorable senators, to induce them to leave the chamber, I think it must be admitted that he has done an action which, as a representative of the Government in the Senate, he should not have done, and one which I do not think that the whole of his colleagues would have approved. I hope that we shall have an explanation from him, and that the matter will be cleared up. At present it presents itself, to my mind, in a very ugly light indeed. </para>

True, we must express our views in order to do that business; but there is no necessity to speak at length on subjects which really have no connexion with the measure, and only serve to waste time. I may reasonably be asked what I should consider to be fair progress. It has been suggested to me by some of my friends that it is not wise to express an opinion on such a matter until progress has been made ; but I think it is only courteous to senators on both sides of the Chamber to answer the question. The Bill on its second reading was discussed at considerable length. </para>

                            <para>- There is no quibbling about it. I ask honorable senators to consider what I must have meant by using that term. In an absolutely literal sense, I suppose a day means, up to 12 o'clock at night, just when the new day commences. Bur will any honorable senator say that when I used that phrase, I meant that we should continue sitting until 12 o'clock at night? Would they not imagine that what I meant was that we should sit until the ordinary time when the Senate adjourns? What is the usual time to which the Senate sits for the consideration of measures ? We sometimes sit until a few minutes after11 o'clock. </para>

                            <para>- I am coming to that. I am now dealing with the point as to what would be conveyed to honorable senators by my use of the phrase " a sitting day." I made a certain proposal which, however, was not accepted by anybody. Therefore I was not bound by it. But if extraordinary circumstances had not arisen, I 'should have considered myself honorably bound by that statement, and should have adhered to it. I said on Friday that it would be fair to devote a sitting day to each part of the Bill. I think that it might have been inferred that what I meant was that we should sit up till a little after 11 o'clock on Tuesday, but under no circumstances could it have been inferred that we should sit up to 1 <inline font-style="italic">2</inline> o'clock or anything like that.

Honorable senators know that what I meant was a reasonable hour - the hour at which we have been in the habit of concluding our business. The hour for adjournment has al way si been governed by the fact that there are a number of honorable senators who live outside the city bounds, and who have to catch late trams and railway trains. But those words " the whole of Tuesday," did not mean sitting up to 12 o'clock or anything, like that. No honorable senator can say that he considered that that was meant. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think that any honorable senator can fairly accuse me of wasting time. But I do not interrupt the honorable senator, and he himself is very "touchy" when he is interrupted. All that I wish to point out is that the proceedings of yesterday showed me unmistakably that it was not the intention of the Opposition to be concise, but that it was their intention to repeat their second-reading speeches and other; speeches which they had previously made <inline font-style="italic">ad nauseam.</inline> We started yesterday on clause 5. How far had we got by half-past 6 o'clock? , We had not passed the clause; I do not think we had even dealt with the first sub-clause. Did I not complain while <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> was speaking that he was simply repeating himself ? </para>

                            <para>- The result was that towards the time when they would ordinarily have had to leave to catch heir trams and trains, I asked my supporters to stay, as I intended, in all the circumstances, to go as far as clause 10. That was an understanding arrived at before that time had arrived, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> knew. " How far," he asked me, " do you intend to go?" I forgot the exact time he mentioned, but certainly it was not anything like half -past 11 o'clock. I said that I intended to go as far as clause 10. But I had to ask my honorable friends to give up the opportunity of going home in the ordinary way. The discussion was continued/ and before clause 10 was passed they found themselves in the position of having lost their trams. Very naturally they came to me, and said, " Now that we have lost our trams, we might just as well go on with the Bill." I replied, " I am not bound by any implied promise I have made, because the conditions' have not been kept by the other side." The discussion was carried on at inordinate length. Division after division was taken, when the Opposition knew quite well that they had not a ghost of a show to carry their proposal. They kept on wasting tome until my supporters had lost their trams, and them they said to me, Oh, you made a promise, and you must keep it." My promise was made contingent upon the measure being passed up to a certain stage within a reasonable hour. I never meant that wa should keep on sitting until 12 o'clock. </para>

                            <para>- Honorable senators have common sense. . When my supporters put the matter to me in that way, I felt that I was not bound 'by anything I had said - that conditions of the promise, if any, had been broken by the Opposition. By the way, they never made a promise to me. Not a soul on the other side said that they would do anything. I considered that I was perfectly open to go on with the Bill, and complete dts consideration. I should be the last <inline font-style="italic">man</inline> in the world to break a promise. I have never broken' a promise in my life. The promise .1 made regarding this Bill was always contingent, as my speech indicates, upon a fair amount of business being clone within a given day, and that day certainly was not to end at 12 o'clock at night. I am exceedingly sorry that honorable senators have been inconvenienced. If they had restrained their talking ability to anything like a reasonable extent, as I suggested in my speech, there would have been no trouble. It is not my fault that it has arisen. They brought the trouble upon themselves, and now they do not like it. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator bias shown a skill in casuistry and quibbling which, I think, would have been incomparable even in the days of the Inquisition. He has read a passage from the speech he delivered last Fri day, which, whatever form of words he may use in respect of it, was a distinct statement as to the course of public business. I call it a promise and a pledge of the most solemn character. What position shall we be in if we are to have statements made by the leader of the Senate, whose duty it is to intimate what the course of Government business shall be. so that honorable senators may know when to go home, and when they may fairly, in justice to their public duties, stay away, and that faith is not kept? Are we to treat such statements as mere breath? Is it not the grossest possible quibbling to say that such a statement does not imply a bargain? It is a statement by a Minister of the Crown of what the course of business is to be, and it is his duty to see that it is faithfully and honorably carried out ; unless he gives us notice that he intends, for an adequate reason, to depart from it, and thus affords us an opportunity to make fresh arrangements. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> did not do that. He said that pressure was brought to bear upon him by his friends. But they are not the keepers of his honour, although they hol'd the whip over him. We acknowledge the difficulty in which he is thereby placed. It was as obvious as possible last night that he was in -terror of his political life. He has told us to-day that he is very sorry that he acted inadvertently. There was no inadvertence on his part. His attention was called to his promise, made not merely on the floor of the Senate, but to indi.vidual senators, time after time, and his excuse was, " I have lost my tram." Was that an adequate reason for the honorable senator to play false to his promise? Loaded with years of political experience, he rose here last night, and actually said,. " I have lost my tram." But to-day it stands revealed that that was a sham and a subterfuge. He had provided not merely a cab for himself, but cabs for his friends to go home in. It was not a question of a train or a tram, or anything of that kind. It was the lash of his supporters which forced the honorable senator to break his word, a thing which, with pathos in hi? voice, he told us he had never done. AIT I can say is, that 'we know him now, and I shall hesitate long before I shall take his word again. It is well, I think, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> should have taken this opportunity to vindicate himself in respect of the amendments which he deemed it his duty to move. I feel that I am responsible for inducing him to abstain. Why ? In fulfilment of my part of the promise given to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Play</inline> ford not later than the tea hour yesterday, that I would move no more amendments until I got to clause 7, and would do all in my power to get as far as clause 10 within a reasonable time. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> never said to me, " We must get this business put through by 10 o'clock or11 o'clock." Did he say that? </para>

                            <para>- Was it fair dealing if the Minister had it in his mind to go beyond clause 10 if the Senate sat after 11 o'clock? To those on this side of the chamber it was double-dealing in the worst sense. The honorable senator was not bound to tell me what his intention was, but if he thought that there had been obstruction, why did he not rise at 10 o'clock and say, " I consider that this criticism has developed into obstruction, and I now intimate that we must get to clause 10 in half-an-hour, or in an hour, or by half-past 11 o'clock, otherwise I shall consider the course which I shall take ?" He gave us no notice, and we went on, believing that everything would be done in accordance with the reputation which he has hitherto held of being a straightforward and honorable politician, but which I am afraid is now suffering from a severe blemish. The higher question is not so much <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford's</inline> explanation as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake's</inline> statement. Are we to conduct this political warfare honestly or not? Good faith and honour are far higher than fifty thousand Commerce Bills, or any amount of political expediency. A Minister cannot safely sacrifice good faith in his political dealings, any more than can individuals in their private and business relations.

If you go on much longer in this way I shall ask the Committee to sit all night"? Some honorable senators went away, expecting that the export clauses would be dealt with to-day. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best,</inline> for one, went away under that impression. Without further elaborating the most painful episode which has yet arisen in the Senate, I say that it is deeply to be regretted that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford,</inline> of all men, should have fallen away from that position of political rectitude which he has always hitherto assumed, and taken' a part which if it were passed without notice, would redound to the discredit of this great Chamber. </para>

This- is but another instance of the attempts made to gag honorable senators, and to place them in fetters. Honorable senators opposite desire to prevent a man from saying honestly what he believes. I pity <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> on having been driven into such a wretched position that he has had to make this excuse for a gross, breach of faith with members of the Senate.

                            <para>- As, long as the Senate is prepared to swallow any dose given to it, at the instigation of their friends and supporters of the Labour Party, everything will, of course, go on comfortably. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator __Playford</inline> stated as distinctly as possible "that he would be satisfied if Tuesday were devoted to the second part of the Bill, and if the consideration of the third part of the measure were dealt with on Wednesday. On his own showing, the honorable senator is. proved guilty of a breach of faith, because he took up the third part of the Bill at the Tuesday's sitting. The Minister may quibble as much as he pleases with regard to the meaning of words, but he is well aware that a parliamentary day commences at the hour set down, for the opening of the proceedings, and continues until the business of the sitting is concluded. If honorable senators will refer to what is happening in another place, they will find that a sitting which was continued until mid-day on Wednesday was still regarded as Tuesday's sitting. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> knows that until half-past 2 o'clock in the afternoon he cannot make a move to take up the business set down for the Wednesday's sitting. The honorable senator has branded himself as a man who has been guilty of gross deception of the members of the Senate in connexion with the conduct of its business. Two or three honorable senators were got rid of last night. The Minister knew perfectly well that honorable senators who have taken a very great deal of interest in this measure were not present yesterday, and would in all probability be present to-day. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> left at the close of last week under the impression that no more than the second part of the Bill would be dealt with until Wednesday. </para>

The honorable senator has been deprived of the opportunity of expressing his opinion on certain clauses of the Bill, and no pair can make up for that. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> was not here yesterday, and I dare say that the Government considered it very convenient to get rid of the honorable senator, who is always keen in his criticisms and shrewd in his remarks, and who can generally make the force of any remarks he has to make felt by the Government. Then we are aware that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> was cajoled out of the Chamber' by means of false representations. I am prepared to believe that if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> had been free to act in accordance with his own judgment, he would have had some hesitation in committing such a breach of faith with members of the Senate. </para>

                            <para>- I should have been very sorry to have done so. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> had said that he intended to press the Bill through the Senate as Quickly as possible, he would have been justified, and we should have had no cause to complain. I admit that so long as the supporters of the Government are willing to remain to assist them, they have a right to prolong a sitting to get their business through, but it is a very different matter when the representative of the Government gives a promise that he does not intend to go beyond a certain clause in a Bill at a particular sitting. We cannot be taxed with any obstruction of this Bill. Do honorable senators know, how long the measure was debated in another place? </para>

                            <para>.- That is so. I find that this Bill was no less than five times before honorable members in another place on' the second reading. A motion was made to refer it to a Select Committee, and that was discussed on four different occasions. When it was negatived, and the Bill -was afterwards considered in Committee, it was dealt with on six different occasions, and on two or three other occasions in connexion with motions for the recommittal of the measure. This lengthy, consideration was due to the importance of the Bill, and the desire of certain honorable members in another place, if possible, to effect some improvement in it. Here, after a debate extending over two days on the second reading, we are charged with obstruction, though the second reading of the measure was debated for seven days in another place. When it was desired to devote three days to the consideration of the Bill in Committee, that is also considered obstruction, though in another place seven or eight sittings were devoted to the same stage. We have a far higher duty than that of supporting a Government in order to pass particular legislation, and that is our duty to the electors who have sent us here, and who have a right to expect us to- give our best attention to legislation submitted to the Senate. I am satisfied that the electors do not approve of the gag being, applied to honorable senators because one section in this Parliament desires to force certain legislation through. I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> whether the price of the Labour Party's support is the passing of this measure, with all its crudities and absurdities, and .the rank injustice attempted to be perpetrated upon the community under it ? I ask whether the Bill which is now being so earnestly debated in another place is to be pressed through for the same purpose? AVe know that the Government must kow-tow to the men by whose breath they live, and bv whose breath they could be blown out of existence to-morrow. Notwithstanding their declarations of independence and of regret at the harrowing way in which the previous Government were driven, members of the present Government are prepared to eat the dirt provided for them in order to retain the sweets of office. No Government ever placed themselves in a more contemptible position than has the present Government. How can any member of the Senate ever again accept the word or the promise of the leader of the Government in this Chamber after his gross breach of the promise he made on Friday last? Unfortunately, the honorable senator has placed himself in the contemptible and despicable position of being regarded by a large section of his fellow-members of the Senate as a man whose word is not to be relied upon. I believe in fighting a Government fairly, and in the Government fighting the Opposition fairly, and I am prepared to accept defeat when the business of Parliament is conducted honestly. When two men are engaged in open conflict, and a third, taking one at a disadvantage, tries to stab him, there is little credit in a victory so achieved. What is such a victory worth ? </para>

The position at the time meant that the Government would either have to stop at the clause then before the Committee - which was, I believe, clause 6. and not clause 10 - and thus the Minister would not accomplish what he had set out to accomplish, or his supporters would be kept here by the Opposition until the early hours of Wednesday morning. Judging by the number of clauses passed between half -past 2 and11 o'clock, clause 10 could not have been reached until 5 o'clock in the morning. </para>

There was no coercion or pressure of any kind exercised by the Labour Party, and, personally, I think that the action of the Minister was justified. The consequences' from which the Opposition suffer were brought about by their own action. They declined to allow any progress to be made until they had penalized supporters of the Government by making them lose their trains. </para>

                            <para>- We on this side noticed the chuckling amongst honorable senators opposite as midnight approached, and we realized that the late sitting was intended as a sort of punishment to us. If the Opposition had shown* a desire to make reasonable progress, and had, for instance, disposed of clause 5 within an hour or two, there might have been some ground for supposing that their acceptation of the offer which the Minister made was genuine. As a matter of fact, the Minister never told honorable senators on this side about any arrangement as to clause 10; all we had knowledge of was the undertaking he gave on Friday. </para>

When Ministerial supporters! realized that they had lost their trains in consequence of the obstructive tactics of the Opposition, they thought it only fair that they should be allowed to proceed with business. It was open to members of the Opposition to have also stayed and dealt with the Bill. I once more deny that any pressure has been exercised by the Labour Party on the Government in regard to this or any other measure. </para>

                            <para>- The words of the leader of the Senate were construed by his own followers to mean that no business would be taken after clause 10. had been reached. That was the understanding on all sides. Then, when the Minister of Defences was reminded of the construction that had been placed upon his words, and informed that certain senators had in consequence left the Senate, there was a courtesy due to the Opposition, even if there had been obstruction, though, as an impartial man. I do not think that there was a single amendment moved yesterday which would not have improved the Bill. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles</inline> wished to leave, and I promised to pair with him; but I then understood that when clause 10 had been reached no further progress would be attempted. I would not have paired with any one with regard to certain amendments which I desired to see made in clause 15, because I wished the people who sent me here to see that I was present to look after their interests.. But when the proceedings reached the stage they did, there was no alternative. The Ministry seemed to make up their minds not to allow even, a comma to be altered in the Bill, and I was amongst the honorable senators who left the Chamber, feeling that there 'was no other dignified course open to me. I should now like to reply to something in the nature of a charge which has been made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline> I have occupied my present seat since I entered the Chamber, and during that time there have been, I think, four Ministries' in power. I am not a " Vicar of Bray,"' and I have always tried to dissociate myself from party ties, and to support all measures which I believe to be to the benefit of the country. To say that I ever professed to be a follower of the Government is not correct. I am a follower of no Government; I support any Government who do what I think is right, and oppose any Government who do what I think i is wrong, even though the latter may include friends of my own. </para>

That was all arranged as part of a deliberate policy of obstruction. So far as one can see, the evident business of the Opposition is to prevent any of the measures now on the notice-paper from becoming law this session. If the Opposition have any doubt on that point, other honorable senators have not. If the Opposition are against this Commerce Bill, they ought to remember that a number of other honorable senators wish to see it passed, and I cannot discover the reason for the remarkable display of temper this afternoon. Have any of the best traditions of parliamentary procedure been outraged? </para>

                            <para>- If so, it has not been done by the Government, or by honorable senators supporting the Government, but by the Opposition. At one time of my career, I was as strong an opponent of the gag as it was possible for any man to be. My reason was that until every man and woman in the country was directly represented in Parliament, it was necessary that there should be the freest and fullest discussion. But now, when every man and woman in the country is directly and equally represented, I think the decision of every question might very well lie with the majority. </para>

                            <para>- And they thought the Government had no stomach ! Now that every man and woman in the Commonwealth is represented in this Parliament, after a minority has been heard, I think its duty is to abide by the will of the majority, and allow the business of the country to proceed. I hope that last night's proceedings will be a lesson to the Opposition. If it is not, we have a whole apothecary's shop of similar medicine which will be administered to them whether they like it or not. If the Government takes my advice it will push forward with every measure that is now upon the notice-paper, even if we have to sit day and night between now and Christmas. We ought to do something for our money. 1 feel ashamed at the end of every month, when I draw my "screw," and find that so little has been done. And all because the Opposition will talk and talk and talk ! I trust that after this lesson they will behave themselves, and be content to allow the majority to rule. If they like to go home, we will rush the business through. We will not grumble if they stay away. But, at all events, after making their protest, they ought to succumb to the superior force of the majority. </para>

I had a distinct impression last Friday that there was then an idea to have an all-night sitting, and I therefore telegraphed to Sydney telling my family not to expect me until Sunday morning. Subsequently, however, better counsels prevailed. My reason for rising now is not to join in this debate, but to "suggest that the leader of the Senate would do well, and would take up a dignified position, if he consented to a recommittal of the Bill. </para>

It is just as well that we should have it cleared up for our own satisfaction. There has been a tacit understanding amongst members of the Senate that when we speak of completing a certain amount of business in a certain time, it does not necessarily mean going on till 12 o'clock at night. It means continuing till an hour somewhat near the time at which we ordinarily adjourn. </para>

That allows the majority of the members of the Senate to get to their homes. If, however, the proceedings are carried beyond half-past 11, there is no possibility of many honorable senators who live in distant suburbs getting home. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> in his rather heated speech has asserted that he kept faith in respect of the arrangement made. He and his party may have kept faith in the letter, but they broke it in the spirit. Fortunately, I am one of those who live within ten minutes' walk of Parliament House, but others live at a distance ; and when honorable senators opposite talk about the courtesy which is due to them, they should consider the courtesy which they owe to others. Surely courtesy is due to those who support the Government and who live in distant suburbs. What <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> the use of keeping the paltry letter of an arrangement if the Opposition do not keep the spirit of it ? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> says that he feels grieved at this dispute. </para>

                            <para>- What was done was forced on the Ministry by the breach of faith of the Opposition in the first place. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> and his supporters think that there was any arrangement between the members of the Government and the members of the party to which I belong, they are entirely in the wrong. I believe that the leader of the Senate intended up to half-past 11 o'clock to adhere to his arrangement. No word passed between the party of which I am Whip and the Government. If there had been such an arrangement of course I should have known about it. There was no word of any kind between us as to continuing the consideration of the Bill beyond clause 10. But when we arrived at a period of the night when it was impossible to catch trains, several honorable senators, not secretly, but openly, called out across the chamber to the Government, " Go on, and carry the Bill; as we have been kept here, let us do more business." I say again that if there was any breach of faith it was on the part of the party led by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon.</inline> But the whole matter is an unfortunate one. I hope that such a thing will not occur again, and that in any future arrangement honorable senators in opposition, and who now pose before the country as the only members of the Senate who keep their word, will thoroughly understand that what is meant by finishing a certain amount of business in a day is finishing it at least before 11.30 at night. </para>

                        <para>- It is really amusing to hear honorable senators opposite say that what occurred yesterday was entirely due to a breach of faith. What are the facts? When the Senate met yesterday, and commenced the consideration of clause 5 of the Commerce Bill' in Committee, amendment after amendment was moved, and speech after speech was made. Those speeches were nothing but repetitions of other speeches - so much so that the Minister of Defence had to complain of second-reading speeches being made in Committee. It was admitted that clause 5 was not really contentious,, and not an important clause of the Bill But if honorable senators opposite had had their way it would not have been dealt with by the end of the sitting. We sat here patiently waiting for the Opposition to come to serious business, but there was no sign of their doing soft was only after about seven hours' delay that we got beyond clause 5, and commenced seriously to discuss the Bill. If honorable senators opposite had really wished to keep to the bargain which they allege was made, but which I say was never made, that we should get up to clause 10 before adjourning, would they have occupied seven hours in considering clause 5, which they admitted to be unimportant? Would they not have confined their attention to clause 7, which they say was most important? As they did not do so, we must regard the whole of the discussion that took place on clause 5 as obstructive. Now, what are the facts with regard to the alleged bargain? On Friday last the Minister of Defence made -a fair proposal. He said that it the Opposition would agree to go as far as clause 4 on Friday afternoon, he would consider that fair progress had been made; and that, ff on the following Tuesday, they would agree to go as far as clause .to, he would be prepared to adjourn. But it takes two to make a bargain. </para>

                            <para>- I withdraw the expression that the. talk was a mass of obstruction, and say that it looked like a mass of obstruction. When we found so much debate taking place on clause 5, which was not regarded as important, we could come to no other conclusion than that there was something like an organized attempt to obstruct business. With respect to the alleged bargain which the Minister in charge of the Bill made, I think that a fair proposal was submitted to honorable senators opposite. It was never accepted. If the Opposition had had their way last night, we should not have got to clause 7, let alone to clause 10. They kept us here until it was utterly impossible for the great majority on this side to get to their homes by the ordinary means. Was it likely that, after listening to a repetition of speeches for hours, we would agree to adjourn at .12 o'clock, and allow our opponents to go away laughing at us in their sleeves? In the face of the obstructive tactics which were exhibited, the Government were quite justified in proceeding with the Bill, and we on this side were justified in supporting their action. The Government would have been false to their trust to carry out important legislation if they had not, at the close of the session, taken strong measures to overcome the tactics of the Opposition, especially when there appeared to be in another place an organized system to obstruct all legislation, if possible. In various parts of Melbourne, and in the precincts of the Senate, I have heard honorable senators opposite say that they believe that no good legislation can emanate from this Government, and that therefore it would be well if they could be stopped from doing any work. That is the position with -which we are faced. When we know that honorable senators hold those views, are we who desire to see certain legislation passed, and which T may say has not emanated from the party to which I belong, to submit tamely to their obstructive tactics? </para>

                            <para>- I did not do any " stone-walling " on that Bill. The senators from New South Wales may be very anxious to adjourn on Friday at about a quarter to four; but those who, like myself, are compelled to remain in Melbourne have no desire to go to New South Wales, and therefore are free to devote to the consideration of Bills that amount of time and attention which their importance' demands. I hope that isa the future the members of the Opposition, when they are defeated, will take their beating like men, and not come down here on the following day and whine because they did not get all their own way. This discussion has been carried on for two hours, which could have been usefully occupied. </para>

                            <para>- But for the interjections, I should have finished what I have to say. I enjoy a good fight as well as any one does. Yesterday evening, when the Opposition believed that the Bill was one which ought not to be passed, they were quite within their rights in putting up a good fight. Possibly if I had been in their position, I should have fought just as vigorously as they did. But while conceding to' them their right to use the forms of the Senate, I think that the Government and their supporters have rights to be respected. Are we not to be allowed to fight? Are we expected to be quiet- </para>

                            <para>- It has been insinuated that the fight on the Commerce Bill has not been a fair one. We had just as good a right to fight as had the Opposition. It is not dignified, or, I think, in accordance with parliamentary custom, to renew a fight. It looks as if the Opposition were whining because they were beaten last night at their own game. We were perfectly entitled to carry on the fight when it was forced upon us. I hope that the Government will always insist upon business being done, notwithstanding any obstructive tactics which may be pursued by their opponents. </para>

                        <para>- It is absurd for any honorable senator to stigmatize the Opposition as a party who have deliberately wasted time on the Commerce Bill, when we recollect that last session, when the question of preference to unionists was under consideration, the Labour Party strenuously tried to carry their point by using the same arguments on each amendment which they submitted. I look upon yesterday's incident with considerable regret, because hitherto I have been able to tell the critics of the Commonwealth Parliament that, so far as I could judge, the proceedings of the Senate have been conducted in a creditable manner. My fear is that yesterday's episode will lower the Senate in the estimation of the public. The Minister of Defence distinctly broke faith with the Senate, and although he has indulged in equivocation, which, I think, only aggravates his offence, I feel certain that the readers of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> can come to no other conclusion than that he has created a precedent to which other leaders of the Senate may point as a covering for similar acts. It is most regrettable that any one should be able to adversely criticise the manner in which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> has conducted the Commerce Bill. Considering the great importance of the measure, the people of the States had a right to expect that their representatives would be allowed to criticise all its details. I feel sure that, upon calm reflection, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> will see that he has been led into creating a precedent which, if acted upon, must be hurtful to the best interests of the Commonwealth. Outside the Chamber I have reflected in very strong terms upon his action. I hope that it will be the last occasion on which the word of a Minister can be doubted either by the Opposition or by his friends. </para>

                        <para>- I am entirely in accord with the attitude which the Minister of Defence assumed yesterday. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould,</inline> who rose to a height of passion which almost caused sparks to fly from the pillars on this side, indulged in what appeared to me to be vindictive expressions as to the attitude which honorable senators on this side have taken up in respect of this Bill. He accused us of having applied the gag, and was particularly anxious that the public should have a knowledge of our methods in applying the gag. He instanced the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker.</inline> The public will certainly know that that honorable senator was aware that the Senate would sit yesterday to consider the Commerce Bill. </para>

What gag was applied to the honorable senator? We occupied no less than six and a half hours yesterday in dealing with a line and a half in clause 5 of the Bill. During that time the honorable senator who has complained of the gag must have spoken on six or seven different occasions, and honorable senator's opposite must have occupied five and three-quarter hours of the time in the speeches they made. When only the balance of the time was occupied » by honorable senators on this side, honorable senators will be able to discover by reference to <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould's</inline> statement is not within measurable distance of accuracy. </para>

But they will not turn round afterwards and complain that the gag has been applied to them. If they think the occasion demands it. they will talk for six hours, or for six days, but they will not afterwards come whining to the Senate because they have not been able to secure all they desire. They will light honestly, and, if defeated, will accept their defeat manfully. </para>

                            <para>- It is certain that the promise made by the Minister was conditional. Having disregarded every condition which the Minister attached to his promise, how could honorable senators opposite still think that the Minister should have done what they desired. If such demands were acceded to by Ministers, I am afraid there never would be any business done in the Senate so long as the present Government remained in power. A great deal has been said about honorable senators living at a distance, and having to get away in time to catch their trains. In this connexion I personally hold the opinion that no Minister, having the business of the country in his hands, should make any promise to honorable senators. We are sent here to represent the several States, and it is our duty to be in attendance in this chamber when business is to be done. </para>

                            <para>--Du.ring six hours yesterday, amendments were moved to omit word after word in a clause. There was neither end nor purpose to be served by the attitude assumed by honorable senators opposite. Their opposition was not fair opposition. If it had been, I should not have spoken on this motion. I sincerely congratulate the Minister of Defence on his determined stand. I hope that whenever any other such occasion arises, the honorable senator will display the same manly spirit. </para>

                        (Tasmania).It is but natural that some honorable senators on the other side should be inclined to crow over what occurred last night, but, to my mind, the proceedings were such as we should be ashamed of. I am ashamed to think that the Senate should have lost the confidence which it ought to be able to place in its leader. It is in. evidence in

At twenty minutes to 12 o'clock on Tuesday clause 10 was passed, and then the Minister said that the whole of Tuesday had expired, and he was not going to carry out his promise. Why ?

We were talking to empty benches, and, in the circumstances, it is very unfair to accuse honorable senators on this side of having obstructed the business of the Senate because they desired to ventilate matters which seemed to them to be of grave importance. I hope for the sake of the Senate that we shall have fair dealing in future. </para>

                        <para>- As one who regrets what took place yesterday, I desire to say a few words on this motion. I think it will be admitted that I was a very consistent supporter of the Government. I voted with them in every division taken, with the exception of that on the motion that progress be reported. I did not vote with them against that motion, because I believed, as I believe now, that there was an understanding, known to every member of the Senate, that after certain business had been done the Senate would adjourn. It is a matter of indifference to me how honorable senators opposite choose to conduct their business. If I were in opposition I should conduct the business in my own way. If in their view clause 5 was of most importance they were right in occupying time in the discussion of it. The fact remains that at twenty minutes to 12 o'clock last night clause 10 had been passed, and, as I understood it, the understanding with honorable senators opposite had been fulfilled. I naturally thought the Senate would then adjourn. We subsequently heard that honorable senators had missed their trains. I have no sympathy with the talk about the missing of trains when there is a question of adhering to an understanding. I live in the suburbs of Melbourne myself, and it does not matter to me whether a cab is provided to take me home or not. I have occupied a seat in the Queensland Parliament for a number of years, and I know that when we sat until 2, 3, or 4 o'clock in the morning on successive days, we got home in the best way we could or we camped on the seats in the chamber until the morning, when we could get home with some convenience. I think that is the best system to adopt. </para>

                            <para>- I do not claim that they are any more high-spirited there than are people in other places. I mention a mere matter of fact. For a very long time the party to which I belonged were in opposition, and they were prepared to carry out the work before them at all hazards. I admit that honorable senators opposite ran away last night. If I had been on their side I should have objected to that. I should have urged that they ought to go right on when there was work to be done. That, however, is a matter for their own consideration. The reason I took the course I did is that I object to play into the hands of honorable senators opposite by creating for them a considerable amount of sympathy in the minds of the outside public on the score that they have not been fairly treated. I know how this kind of thing reacts. When the party to which I belonged were treated unjustly they received the sympathy of the outside public, because they believed that we had not been fairly treated. I object to do anything which will play into the hands of honorable senators opposite by enabling them to go outside and complain that they have been unfairly treated, and that, in consequence, the Bill has been passed without sufficient consideration. I have camped in the Queensland Parliament House for two or three days and nights am end, without any adjournment, because the party to which I belonged believed that the work in which they were engaged was absolutely necessary. The majority in power thought we were wrong, and they put us down, or passed us out, until the business in hand was carried through, when they graciously permitted us to come back again and take up other business. I contend that the unfair action of the dominant party in Queensland was responsible in a greater degree than anything else for the building up of the party to which I belonged in that State. It is because I realize that this is the result of unfair treatment that I object to allow honorable senators opposite to pose as martyrs, as I believe they are now able to do to some extent. If in future there is any understanding between different sides in the Senate, I hope it will be adhered to in the letter and in the spirit. Personally, I hope that mo such understanding will be made, but that honorable senators will recognise their duty to give their attendance in this chamber, and to see that the business of the country is carried on in a straightforward way. </para>

                            has assumed an altogether mistaken attitude. The Minister, as Ministers frequently do, entered into an understanding with the Opposition; When these understandings are adhered to by both sides they ought to be rigorously observed. The understanding in this case was that an adjournment should be permitted if a certain clause of the Bill was reached during the day.

I could not vote on the question, because I had paired for a week with an honorable senator absent through ill-health ; but I was present in the chamber for about two hours, and had to listen to repetition after repetition until the Minister of Defence complained that he had answered one question so often that he was tired of it. </para>

                                several times. A promise was made by the Minister, subject to the condition that reasonable progress was made. As a matter of fact, so far from reasonable progress, there was unreasonable obstruction by the Opposition on clause 5 hour after hour ; and clause 10 was' not reached until, for the purposes of honorable senators, Tuesday had expired. That is to say, honorable senators at that hour could not avail themselves of the opportunities they expect to have offered to them to get to their homes on the same day.

                        <para>- I should not have spoken .but for the constant reference to the cabs 'which were provided for honorable senators last night. I candidly say that I availed myself of one of the cabs to take me home, but I may add that it was not until the Senate had risen, and I was leaving Parliament House, that I was informed that the Government had made any provision of the kind. I wish it to be clearly understood that there was no bargain or arrangement in this connexion between the Government and honorable senators. I understand that on similar occasions, in another place, cabs are provided for honorable members, and the fact has ceased to have any novelty. I am sorry to say that there are honorable senators on both sides, whose sense of good taste does not prevent them from making repeated references to a matter so trifling. </para>

It may have been with the object of reducing the number of honorable senator.", present, so as to secure a count-out; but if that were the motive I am glad it was defeated.

                            <para>- There is also an understanding, that the business on other days shall be concluded in time for honorable senators to catch their trains before midnight. The usual hour for adjournment is 10 or half-past 10 o'clock, and when discussion is continued beyond that hour honorable senators are put to considerable inconvenience. The majority of the honorable senators who pursued obstructive tactics, live within a short distance of Parliament House, and they seemed to be careless of the fact that other honorable senators would have to "reach their homes in the suburbs as best they could. Under the circumstances, it ill becomes, those honorable senators to sneer at the Government for providing conveyances. In the light of what has occurred in another place, and also in the light of our own experience of yesterday, the Government would, in my opinion, have been extremely unwise if they had not, in the interest of business, concluded the consideration of the Commerce Bill in Committee last night. </para>

                        (New South Wales). - The apologists of the Government have had a hard task, and I do not think they have been quite so successful as they were in the movement which they carried out last night. Some honorable senators have dealt with matters which have only tended to obscure what otherwise is perfectly plain. It is clear that on Friday last the leader of this Chamber made a distinct statement, which covered the conduct of business up to Thursday ; and it is equally clear that last night he repeated the statement to

I also went away with a similar impression ; and there can be no question that the Minister made up his mind to depart from the arrangement, and, using the opportunity presented, piloted the Bill through. I feel I have been perfectly justified in submitting this matter for discussion, and I am content to leave the question to the country. I beg leave to withdraw the motion. </para>

                    <para>- I am quite sure that it will be recognised as being perfectly fair that in considering the adoption of the report on this Bill, honorable senators should have an opportunity to address themselves to its provisions, especially in regard to those which did not receive full consideration in Committee. It will also be recognised that it is perfectly competent for us to address ourselves to the whole of the clauses, from the beginning to the end of the Bill. Possibly an amendment or amendments will be submitted later on for the purpose of securing the recommittal of the Bill for the reconsideration of certain clauses. I have no doubt that honorable senators will be prepared to consult the convenience of the Senate generally in allowing the first portion of the Bill up to clause 10 to go unchallenged, though, of course, some remarks may be made as to the desirableness of legislation of this character. But the latter portion of the Bill, commencing with clause 11, was put through last night under very peculiar circumstances, which have led honorable senators on this side of the Chamber to think that a very unfair advantage was taken, that would not have been possible without the force of numbers. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> is one of those who did his utmost to prevent a proper and full consideration of the measure. If the Senate had adjourned last night after disposing of clause to, the very long debate that we have had to-day would not have occurred, we should have avoided the angry recriminations which have been made, and should thereby have conduced to the more effectual conduct of business. A fair and honest fight put up against a Bill which we consider to contain provisions that are most objectionable and injurious to the welfare of the Commonwealth. We had a perfect right to take the course we did. The measure itself, as cannot be too often impressed on the mind of the public, is one that lends, itself to an administration that would be simply damnable, considered from the aspect of the interests of Australia. I admit that by noninterference on the part of the Minister, the Bill could be so administered as to work no very great injury to the country. But the only way in which danger could be avoided would be by a most careful administration, such as I decline to believe it will receive from the gentleman now at the head of affairs. </para>

                        <para>.- No doubt <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> considers that it would be perfectly safe to leave the matter in the hands of <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> present Government. Most Ministries suffer from the little weakness of believing that no evil can arise from their administration. I do not suppose that any Minister would say : " I am going deliberately to do an injury to the commerce of the Commonwealth." But there are Ministers and Ministers. Some Ministers think that the more interference there is with regard to every industry in the country the better. I do not share that view. I believe that we have gone a great deal too far in our legislation. I believe that we have over-legislated. This is a specimen of over-legislation that must do the country an immense amount of injury. Australia is at present almost a. by-word, in consequence of its restrictive legislation. Are we to continue that system, so as to become a still greater by -word? I am aware that some honorable members entertain the extraordinary idea that because this measure has been passed by another place, it ought to be looked upon as the acme of wisdom and perfection. But it contains provisions that a great many members of both Houses of this Parliament never believed to be within its compass. We learnt yesterday, though not until there had been a considerable amount of debate on clause 5, that that was an exceedingly dangerous provision. I doubt whether even the Minister in charge of the Bill was aware of its scope. Certainly he did not mention it when he moved1 the second reading of the Bill. He did not say that it was intended to hamper even' branch of trade and to apply to every article that might be exported or imported. If that had been known when the Bill -was before the other Chamber, most assuredly it would have been objected to much more strongly - and the opposition to it was strong as it was. It is most unjust to take advantage of a House of Legislature by getting legislation passed through having effects never contemplated by those who dealt with it in the first instance. Whatever we may do with regard to this measure in the Senate, if we send it back to the other House with two or three amendments the debate there will be confined to those amendments. Honorable members in the other Chamber will have no opportunity to discuss any provisions which they passed under a misapprehension. I trust that honorable senators will take the trouble to go into the measure thoroughly, and cease to treat it in a cavalier way. They talk of the Bill having been " stonewalled " from this side, because we made an earnest protest against many of its provisions, when there was a deliberate " stone- wall " on their part. We could get no information, or defence, such as we were entitled' to get, when a measure of vital concern to the whole Commonwealth was being considered. Whatever opinions they may hold in regard to the Bill they showed scant courtesy to this side when they did not respond to our appeals. When a' measure has been fought by an Opposition day after day, and it has been made clear to the Government that their opponents desire to obstruct its passage, and not to improve its provisions, I can understand them turning round, and asking their supporters to be "dumb dogs." But there was no such obstruction offered to this Bill. It was introduced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> in a speech which was very brief, and by no means comprehensive. I believe that he did not realize, and I doubt if he now realizes, the far-reaching possibilities of it. If he had realized! its ' grave importance, I cannot conceive that he. with his long parliamentary experience, would have consented to thrust such legislation down the throat of the Opposition. I dare say that he will not have much to say in defence of the Bill if he exercises his right to reply to the criticisms from this side. </para>

                        <para>.- Once or twice last night, when the honorable senator replied very briefly to speeches from this side, he led1 me to think that he did not realize the meaning of the words which he was asking the Committee to assist him to enact. He sard that we, on this side, were making second-reading speeches. There were three or four clauses which contained most important principles, and which called for second-reading speeches from this side, in order that every honorable senator might fully realize their meaning before he was called upon to vote. It was only right that those speeches should have been replied to at full length. Unfortunately, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> was not here to speak at the second-reading stage. </para>

If the debates of the other House be referred to, it will be seen that honorable members expressed a desire to do what was fair and just between importers or exporters and the public. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> has told us that the last Government contemplated the introduction of a measure of this kind because they left behind- them a draft.

                        <para>.- The Minister knows that the draft Bill which was found by the present Government in a pigeon-hole or cupboard had not been revised by the members of the late Cabinet. We have had the assurance of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> that it was not referred to him as Attorney-General for the purpose of advising his colleagues on legal points. How, then, can it be fairly said that the late Government if it had remained in office would have submitted a more drastic Bill to honorable senators for their consideration? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> knows that when 'the members of a Ministry take office they find a num-ber of Bills which have been drafted, but not considered by the previous Cabinet. If a Minister instructs an officer to draft a Bill, it is done by the latter on such, lines as he may consider most convenient and advisable. </para>

                        <para>.- A Minister of Trade and Customs would say to his. draftsman : " I want you to prepare a Bill to provide for the inspection of imports and exports, and to insure honest and fair dealing." Later on it would be his duty to see whether the principles which he had laid' down had been properly embodied in the measure. And at that stage he could elicit the opinions of his colleagues. Perhaps I am presuming too much in saying that the Commerce Bill was fully considered by the members of the present Cabinet before it was submitted to the other House. Is it not a matter of common notoriety that three Ministers differed there with regard to its; provisions? One Minister thought that it meant one thing ; a second Minister thought that it would provide effectually for grading ; while a third Minister thought that it would not provide for grading. The Ministers were not at one with regard to the effect of its provisions. There was a promise made that certain amendments would be submitted' in the Senate in order to clear up doubts and' difficulties which had arisen, but not one of them has been submitted here. </para>

It mav be urged that the Government desire that this notice shall be gwen in order to prevent mistakes bv people sending their good's to the Commonwealth from other countries. But if that be the objectt three months is too short a time to give to people in other countries an opportunity of determining whether they will, send their goods to the Commonwealth under the conditions prescribed by the Government. There will, in the early stages of the operation of the Bill, be no more &gt; fruitful source of difficulty in connexion with imports than that which will arise from these regulations. Dealing with exports, the Bill provides in clause 11 that - </para>

                <para>I should like the Minister to explain what articles of export there are that are not embraced in this clause. We have had a great deal of talk about apples, and about butter, but we have had no information as to the articles which, cannot be included under clause 15. We are asked to provide that if a man desires to export anything he must, in a trade description applied to his goods, specify their nature, number, quantity, quality, purity, class, grade, measure, gauge, size, or weight. We also provide that he shall state the country or place in or at which the goods were made or produced. What necessity is there for that? I could understand the Government of the mother country saying : " We desire to know where goods imported into this country have been manufactured or produced," but it is an utter absurdity for the Government of a country to attempt to place an embargo upon its own exports by requiring such descriptions to be applied to them. Further information must be given as to the manufacturer or producer of the goods, or the person by whom they were selected, packed, or in any way prepared for the market. </para>
                <para class="block">Will that give any guarantee as to the soundness of the goods? If the Minister grows apples and exports them to the other end of the world, what difference will it make to the man who eats them, whether they were grown by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford,</inline> or by Jones, Brown, or Smith? He will be concerned with the quality of the article, and not with the name of the producer. Again, the Bill provides that information shall be given as to the mode of manufacturing, producing, selecting, packing, or otherwise preparing the goods. During the second-reading debate it was pointed out that it is possible under this Bill to compel a man to say whether his goods have been produced by union or non-union labour. What does it matter to the people to whom we send our goods whether they are, or are not, the product of union labour? Do Ave, at the present time, take the trouble to inquire whether goods sent to us from other parts of the world have been made by union or nonunion labour? It is not part of the duty of the Government to make inquiries of this character. I can understand a man who believes in unions, and in union labour, telling a storekeeper that he will not buy certain goods unless he is assured that only union labour has been employed in their manufacture ; but I cannot understand a Government that is supposed to represent both union and non-union labour, and the sympathizers with both, requiring this information. It is utterly absurd, but the aim is clearly to play into the hands of .1 particular section of the community, and not to give a fair deal to all people in the- community. It is possible, under this Bill, for the Government to kow-tow, as I suppose they must do, to the minority of the workers of this country at the present time, and to enable them to secure what they desire. They hold their office by the breath of a particular party in the community, and I realize how dangerous it is to give them an opportunity to play into the hands of that party. </para>

                        <para>- It is mv purpose to show that the Government should ^ not be intrusted with such powers as are conferred by this Bill. I have already said that I would .not willingly intrust such powers to any Government. I say that under this Bill the present Government will be able to turn their backs upon their honest convictions, and I believe they will do so, because, unless they do, they know that they can be sent "packing," to-morrow. I cannot quote many remarks .of the honorable senator in charge of the Bill in connexion with this policy, but if it were in order to read speeches by the Prime Minister and by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest, I could disclose a pretty state of affairs, and could show the public how dangerous it is to intrust the present </para>

                <para class="block">Government with these powers. Under the Bill in connexion with a trade description, information will also be required as to the material or ingredients of which the goods are composed, or from which they are derived. There is only one safeguard, that provided by clause 16, under which trade secrets need not be disclosed. Again, information must be given as to the goods being the subject of an existing patent, privilege, or copyright ; and it is also provided that a trade description includes a Customs entry relating to goods, and any mark which, according to the custom of the trade or common repute is commonly taken to be an indication of any of the matters already mentioned. All these numerous matters can be prescribed in a trade description, and in this way the whole of the industry of the Commonwealth may be placed in fetters and materially hampered. In the circumstances, it is not too much to say that this Bill is calculated to do a great deal of injury to the Commonwealth. Can it be believed for a moment that the Government and their supporters are anxious that our export and import trad 3 should be extended? Before Federation, we heard of the higher atmosphere of politics, and of the broad-mindedness which would characterize members of the Federal Parliament ; but, the fact is, that we have passed a series of restrictive measures which place tyrannical powers in the hands of individual Ministers or the Ministry. We all agree that false descriptions should not be placed on goods, but, at the same time, we ought not to insist on descriptions which are unnecessary, and which may do harm to the community or to the producer. I remind honorable senators of the letters received by this Senate from a jam manufacturer of Tasmania, who pointed out that his export trade absolutely depends, riot only on his producing a good article, but on his placing it on the market without disclosing his name or place of manufacture. </para>

                        <para>.- I quite agree with' the honorable senator, and, indeed, I do not) believe that this manufacturer is ashamed of his own State or of his produce. But if a manufacturer of jam receives an order from South Africa, on the condition that his name shall not appear on the label, has he to decline the trade rather than comply with the condition? There are other places in the world where jams are manufactured. </para>

                        <para>.- I have no wish to decry the value of the jams made in Tasmania,' but, still, it is only right that a man who desires to buy jams without having the name of the manufacturer attached to them should be able to do so. Then, in regard to the trade with the East, there are special instructions as to what produce is to be sent, and as to how it is to be sent. Of course, if any goods are sought to be exported on false representations, the guilty person ought to be punished, because such practices have a serious effect on the export trade. If, however, unmarked goods are sent at the request of the buyer, it is for the latter to see that he obtains the quality stipulated for, and, in any case of fraud or misrepresentation, the Law Courts are open to him. The great complaint about British goods being supplanted in many parts of the world by French and German goods, arises from the fact that many British manufacturers are conservative enough to think that they know the requirements of their customers better than do the customers themselves. Until these conservative notions are got rid of, British manufacturers will find great trouble in retaining their trade. If the desire is to assist commerce, let us remove all undue restrictions. One reason urged by the Minister in support of clause 5 is that it gives a power not exercisable under the Customs Act, namely, the power to take samples as well as to inspect. Such a provision, however, should be made in a Bill to amend the Customs Act. Another argument in favour of the clause is that an offender may be punished by the publicity given to his offence; and as an illustration, we were told of the case of the Victorian leather merchant who exported inferior leather. All these offences, however, are provided for in clause 15, coupled with' clauses 7 'and 11 ; and therefore clause 5 is not required in order to cover cases of misrepresentation. Under clause 7, which deals with 'imports, a period of three months is allowed before the regulations take effect', but there is no such provision in regard to the regulations which deal with exports. But, whatever the faults of the Bill may be, the Government and their supporters object to any amendment. Honorable senators from Tasmania, and the President himself, have told us how these hard-and-fast rules prejudice the export trade in apples ; and yet it has been found impossible for the Opposition to effect any improvement in this connexion. Perhaps, if an amendment had been proposed from the Government side, it might have had the same chance of success that attended another amendment from the same quarter. I would again point out to honorable senators </para>

                        <para>.- In the best interests of the Commonwealth, these provisions ought not to be agreed to without full and ample debate, though, I suppose, even if they had been postponed until today, amy discussion would have been quite without result. I ann not very sanguine that much success would have attended the efforts of honorable senators om this side to impress their views on the Committee. Under the circumstances, I think it is a reasonable request that there should be a recommittal, and I shall be quite prepared to support a motion to that effect in regard to clauses n, 14, and, certainly, 15. [ do not think that any good object will be served by reconsidering other clauses, because they contain principles with which we can all agree. Let me point out that the clause with regard to exports would place upon every exporter of goods from this country an embargo that would operate much to the advantage of competitors in other parts of the world. Is it not fair that we, who had no opportunity of discussing those clauses last night, should have an opportunity of placing our views before the Senate and the country to-day? </para>

Why should he not have that opportunity today? If the Minister would be prepared to accept an amendment of that character a great many of our objections to the Bill would be removed. I am quite satisfied that the majority in the other House did not realize when it passed the Bill that it was assisting outside people in the way we shall assist them by means of this measure? </para>

                        <para>D- I had not read the debates that took place in the other House, but I had seen the reports of the deputation that waited on the Minister. It was not, however, till the Bill came to the Senate that I saw how widely the clause extended. If the Minister will give us an opportunity to reconsider the clauses that were rushed through last night, I can promise him that I will not give him any more trouble with regard to the adoption of the report. Let us give fair consideration to the clauses in question - in the light of the criticism of those who wish to see them amended. Will the Minister agree to take that course? </para>

                        <para>.- If the Minister had treated us fairly, the Bill would have been debated fully. He would have found that when we discovered that it commanded the support of a majority of honorable senators, we should have accepted our defeat. He may rest : assured that whenever the Opposition feel that it is their duty to fight any measure, they will act quite irrespective of the wishes of either himself or his supporters. I believe that if honorable senators who sit on the other side had been placed in a position similar to that which we occupy, they would have discussed every clause to which they were opposed, just as fully as they could. I urge them to treat us with fairness and consideration. I ask the Minister to take care in the future to carry out to the very letter any promise, expressed or implied', that he makes, and not to allow any irritation which he may feel, because the trams and trains have been missed, or the debate has lasted longer than he anticipated, to cause him to do an act which would justify any one on this side in saying that he had broken his word. I ask the Government to give us a much better opportunity to consider their measures in the future than they have done on this occasion. The Senate is asked to pass this Bill in an incomplete form. It is one which every merchant and producer will regard as a curse, and which will give us a worse name in the old country than we have at present. I do not propose to say much more on the motion. Some honorable senator* who feel that they have been deprived of an opportunity to submit certain amendments, may propose to recommit the Bill' generally, or, if fair treatment be not extended to them, may consider themselves justified in discussing the Bill in detail at this stage, and if necessary, on the third reading. But I trust that the Minister of Defence will reconsider the position, and consent, without further pressure, to a recommittal of the Bill. </para>

                        <para>- Owing to what they regarded as a <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> misunderstanding, six senators, including three supporters of my amendment, left the chamber before the crisis arrived, and when it did arrive, the rest of my supporters left. In those circumstances, it would have been futile for me to' remain and move the amendment. I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> to give me an opportunity to do my duty to my constituents. There are one or two phases of his conduct in connexion with this Bill which I think are fraught with very great danger. This is not a question between the Government and the Opposition, but a question between the Senate and the citizens of the Commonwealth. If the Minister intends to deny me an opportunity of discussing, my amendment on its merits, I shall have to tell my constituents that the representatives of the great apple trade of Tasmania were not allowed to have expression given to their opinions on account of his inexcusable misunderstanding. If he makes a promise with a condition, he has no right to keep back the condition and hurl it at our heads after the mischief has been done. It is now in his power to undo the mischief which has been done. We do not want to reconsider every clause of the Bill. To show the frame of mind the Minister is in, let me mention that when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> pointed out that in clause 13 the expense of doing certain things is placed upon the importer, when it is perfectly plain that the exporter is meant, he laughed, and said that the Clerk could alter the word. I should like to see the Clerk alter a Bill which has come from the other House, even if it be to correct a mistake. Are we to allow the clause to leave the Senate in its present disgraceful state? Is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> to be influenced only by the consideration that he does not want the other House to get an opportunity of discussing a single provision of the Bill. If he were to take up this attitude in regard to every Bill, what would become of the rights of the Senate? Because the Ministry want to close .the session as quickly as possible, and do not wish to send down to the other House any amendment which would require a minute's discussion, is the honorable senator to  belittle the Senate by sitting there like a stone and. declining to ask the Senate to correct a  palpable mistake ? Is that a reason why he should rob us of our rights and privileges? </para>

So far as clause 15 is concerned, I feel that last night, about jo o'clock, I did lead <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> to believe that we would not go beyond clause 10.

                    (Queensland).- I do not intend to oppose the recommittal of the Bill, seeing that the Minister has consented to it, though I must say that I disagree with the honorable senator as to. the wisdom and policy of the course he has adopted. I say plainly that politics is war. We have the Senate divided into two parties - one in favour of the Bill, fighting for it all they know, and the other opposed to it, and fighting all they know to prevent it becoming law.

                        <para>- Most honorable senators opposite voted against the second reading of the measure. Did they believe in it then ?I say that there has been a fight between the two sides as to whether the Bill should become law or not. We have captured a position from honorable senators opposite; we have reached a certain stage in dealing with the measure, and in my opinion it is pure bunkum that we should now be asked to recede from the position we captured, and allow honorable senators opposite to resume it for the mere pleasure of belting them off it again. That is simply playing at politics. We are being asked to allow <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> to pose before his constituents as the man who has fought and succeeded in securing a recommittal of the Bill in their interests. We come here night after night to keep a House in order that practical legislation may be passed, and not that our time maybe wasted. With all due respect to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best,</inline> I have very little sympathy with him in this matter, because he is a supporter of the present Government, and belongs to their party. My colleagues of the Labour Party and I do not, yet we are to sit here night after night to keep a House for the Government. How often will <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> sit here for that purpose? </para>

This measure was fully considered last night, and if it had been thought desirable to move further amendments upon it there was ample opportunity afforded to do so, but honorable senators turned tail and left the chamber. I do not propose to offer any factious opposition to the recommittal of the measure, but I do enter my protest against this method of doing business. I can assure the leader of the Government in the Senate that on future occasions, when measures have been given lengthened consideration by the Senate, I, for one, shall not be content to come here day after day to do the same business twice over. </para>

                    <para>. - I opposed this amendment yesterday when the matter was fully discussed. The argument has been that the House of Representatives really intended that clause 5 should apply only to the articles mentioned in clause 15, and that, as there are no penalties provided in connexion with clause 5, it gives the Minister power only to take samples, so far as the articles prescribed under it are concerned, and is, therefore, of little or no use. I have been informed that the majority of honorable members in another place were under no such impression ; they were under the impression that although no penalties are attached to clause 5, power would be given to the Minister to examine and inspect prescribed goods, and that that power, with the possibility that the result, of the examination might be made public would be beneficial. In the circumstances, I think it better that this clause should be left as it stands. I see the point made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best,</inline> and it appeals to me to a certain extent. But I also see the force of the contention of the other side, and I believe there are classes of goods not included in clause 15 which it is desirable should be examined. None of these goods can be prescribed by regulation, unless the regulations are laid before Parliament, and given every publicity, and I feel quite certain that the Department will never suggest regulations unless there is reason to believe that certain goods ought not to be exported. Under the circumstances, I ask honorable senators to support the clause. </para>

                            Lyne, I fancy, unintentionally, misled the deputation that waited on him, because there is no doubt that on that occasion he did state, without any limitation, that the Bill would apply only to a certain list of articles. It is, a question whether faith ought not to be kept with the commercial men and others who take a deep interest in the Bill, and whose opposition was, to some extent, allayed by the information then given.

                    <para>- If clause 5 be brought under the control of clause 15, it will be necessary, in order to make the Bill sensible, to recommit the whole and strike out certain clauses. Clause 12, for instance, provides a penalty for applying a false trade description to exports ; and I do not see how an offence can be proved unless there is power to inspect and take samples. All goods which bear a false trade description, and not only the classes of goods enumerated in clause 15, come within the scope of the measure, and it will be manifestly impossible to administer the Bill, unless there is power to take samples. There is no doubt that the desire of all of us is to deal with all goods which bear a false description. </para>

                    <para>- I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> is under a misapprehension when he expresses the opinion that if the amendment were carried, it would be necessary to deal with other clauses. In any case, in view of the understanding on which these two clauses have been recommitted, we are not at liberty to interfere with other clauses. Clause 9 very distinctly declares that no person shall import any goods to which a false trade description is applied. </para>

                    <para>- This little discussion has made it abundantly clear that the Customs Act applies to all imports, and the only difficulty is in regard to taking samples of goods intended for export. But, after all, is it a matter of such serious moment that we need refuse to assent to the proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best?</inline> I should say that there are but few articles of export not embraced in the classes enumerated in clause 15 ; and, under the circumstances, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> might very well forego his opposition to the amendment. </para>

                        <para>.- There may be goods outside those enumerated in clause 15 which require inspection, but they are so few that I question whether there is any necessity to confer the power. After all, it is a matter of policy; and we have practically arrived at an understanding in that regard - an understanding which has a tendency to satisfy, in a small degree, the many doubts and scruples entertained in regard to the measure. I urge <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> to withdraw his opposition to the amendment, and allow it to be made. </para>

They are produced by the skill of man and the operations of nature. There is all the difference in the world between goods of that description, which cannot be adulterated or tampered with, and goods like butter, cheese, bacon, and meat, which can be. Meat may be diseased, or may not be put into the refrigerating -chamber in. time. I can quite understand the necessity of insisting upon honest trading, and upon wholesome food being exported.- But I cannot see how those considerations can apply to fruits like apples, pears, oranges, and lemons.

But such arguments cannot be applied to the fruits mentioned in my amendment. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> pointed out some days ago that the fruit-growers of Tasmania, doing their very best to open up a trade with Great Britain and Europe, now and then found themselves somewhat injured by the operations of one or two growers, who either carelessly packed or carelessly graded goods, or dishonestly sent home inferior fruit. They sent a large petition to trie Tasmanian Premier, asking him to bring in a Bill to provide for the inspection and marking of fruit before it left the wharf at Hobart. They asked that the Bill should be made as " watertight " as possible. A Bill was passed, but from the moment it was placed upon the statute-book it became a dead letter. My honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> quoted a communication from the Prime Minister of Tasmania to show that it was on account of expense that the Bill was not put into operation. But there is another reason for it. The measure was found to be utterly impracticable, and it was further discovered that to administer it a host of inspectors would be required on the wharfs and on the rivers, where the fruit is shipped, and sometimes in the orchards where it is packed alongside the trees. That was the reason why it was too expensive to carry out the measure. I suppose honorable senators will admit that, although Tasmania is described as a 'very small place - <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne has dubbed it as a little fruit orchard - its experience in fruit-growing is considerable. We are proud of Tasmania as an orchard. We have had the honour and glory of opening up this fruit trade with Great Britain and Europe, of which the other States of the Commonwealth are now taking advantage. We know our own business. We have tried to put into operation such a measure as this, and it has been a failure. Is not that a good reason for asking the Minister to except fruit from the Bill? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> started off in a happy frame of mind by stating what was done in South Australia. I admit that he knows a good deal about fruit-growing. But in the "model State " there is no drastic measure of this kind. </para>

                        <para>- It is extremely difficult to get any idea into the head of mv honorable friend. He has tried to bluff me over and over again, but he has not a leg to stand upon. Here is a drastic Bill, which every fruit-grower in my State thinks will do harm to the trade. I have already pointed out that Tasmania found such a measure to be a failure. I find that in South Australia they have never attempted to pass such a law, but have confined themselves to a harmless practice under which a fruit grower may, if he likes, get his fruit marked with the Government brand. I find that only about 9,000 cases out of 80,000 were so marked last year. Is that fact in favour of my argument or against it? It is emphatically in favour of it. What better evidence can we have than that a similar law has been attempted tote applied in one State and has been a failure, - whilst in another State there is merely provision .for marking fruit under <inline font-style="italic">st</inline> voluntary system? Mv. honorable friend the Minister said : " It is quite a simple matter. Here are 100 cases of rip stone pippins, marked 'prime.' The inspector opens one case, and if he finds that the fruit consists of prime rips(tone pippins, he will mark the lot." Of what earthly benefit can that be? Before the fruit is purchased in England, the buyer will open up, perhaps, twenty cases -out of 100. Furthermore, what guarantee can the Government brand be that fruit will land in England in good condition? It has to travel 12,000 miles. It may be perfectly 'good when it is inspected at this end, but when it arrives in England it may be absolutely rotten. In the early days of fruit exportation there were scores of cases of failure. One client of mine lost ^2,000 in one year in shipping fruit to England. In one case, perhaps, the engineer did not properly regulate the cooling chambers, and the fruit was spoilt. In another case the cooling chambers would be too cold, and the fruit would be frozen. In a third case the cooling chambers would be allowed to get too warm, and the fruit would be over -ripe on arrival. The English purchaser will only buy after inspection. In the case of butter or cheese a buyer cannot tell merely from inspection whether the article has been adulterated. He may think that butter is not. very good in colour, or he may not like the aroma; but in order to tell what is in it, the stuff must be analyzed. There is all the difference in the world between goods of that description and fruits. The way in which the trade is conducted renders any system of grading and inspection absolutely hopeless. The great mail-boats call once a week. Months beforehand the exact number of cases of fruit which they will take, away is arranged for. The contractor for space has to pay for that which he engages, whether he ships the full quantity of fruit or not. If a contract is made with a White Star boat to take away 45,000 cases of fruit, as was done last year, and the contractors, Jones and Company, or Peacock and Company, find at the last moment that they are a certain number of cases short of the total, they send round in a hurry to make up the necessary quantity. The fruit is picked and packed in the orchards in the Huon or New Norfolk district, and within forty-eight hours is put on board the steamer. What time is there to do justice to grading and marking under circumstances like that ? We are not cultivating on the part of our people a spirit of self-reliance. It was not until after so much wealth was produced by the gold diggers that Australia began to be known as a rich country. During the last half -century, we have built up a trade in minerals, wool, timber, grain and fruit, and other commodities, which is a credit to us. It has not been built up by means of aids and bonuses, but with that free-play for enterprise which must prevail if British commerce is to hold its own in the World. I submit my amendment with confidence to the Committee. </para>

Some times the buyer will knock the lid off a case, and see a sample which may represent a shipment of 30, or 100, or 500 cases, but the apples are bought on their reputation. The reputation which the South Australian apples obtained from being sent through the Government depot was such that they realized 3s., 4s., and 5s. a case more than did Tasmanian apples, which never underwent any inspection. The producers in South Australia derived a benefit from the inspection. </para>

                        <para>- All the fruit which came through the Government depot to me, as Agent-General, to arrange for its sale, realized the best possible price, because the buyers could depend upon its quality, if it were known that the shipment had arrived in anything like sound condition. If the ship had not destroyed the apples either by freezing them, or by keeping them in too hot a chamber, and the shipment was recognised as a good one, there was no trouble in effecting a sale. The buyers in London knew exactly the condition in which the apples had arrived.- A wire would be sent to Adelaide, saying that a ship had arrived with apples in splendid condition, or in poor condition, or in very bad condition. When the apples are sent through a Government . inspector the buyers on the other side of the world know that they are of the quality stated. It is also a guarantee to the buyer that the fruit is not full of codlin moth, or other pests. Fancy a shipment of oranges going from Sydney at the present time to London. When I went to the Parramatta a short time ago, the whole country was smothered with red1 scale, and the oranges were in a dreadful state. Occasionally, the growers) brush off the red scale. In the . Central Cumberland district the same condition prevailed. I can imagine that if fruit, like apples) and oranges, had not to be inspected, unscrupulous shippers might send away fruit which was covered with red scale on the' off-chance of getting a fair price in London, and thereby damage the reputation of Sydney fruit in "that market. </para>

                        <para>- If any Tasmanian shippers send away apples riddled with the caterpillar of the codlin moth, will that be likely to add to the reputation of Tasmanian fruit ? There is codlin moth all over England, Europe, and America, but Tasmanian fruit-growers must take care that there are not too many caterpillars of the codlin moth in the apples they export. If they wish to establish a reputation they must send home clean fruit. The Tasmanian Government have recognised that fact by passing a very drastic law. </para>

                        <para>- I have not misled the Committee. I have been relating my personal experience. During my residence of four years in London, I saw the advantage which accrued to the grower from the grading of his fruit, and the sending of it home in decent-looking deal cases, instead of stringy bark paling cases. Very often a case that attracts the eye of a buyer helps to secure a satisfactory price. I believe that the unsightly cases which came to Covent Garden from Tasmania had a certain effect upon the sale of the fruit. My opinion is that it will help a grower to realize a good price if he will pack his fruit in a nice looking case. For instance, the chocolates which come out from England are out up in beautiful boxes, with floral and other embellishments, in order to catch purchasers. I have often seen theatre-goers give is. to a boy for a box of nicely -packed chocolates. I would advise my Tasmanian friends in the future to pack their &lt; fruit in more artistic-looking cases than they have hitherto used. Why should <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> single out apples, pears, oranges, and lemons ? I have never seen any oranges grown in Tasmania, but, of course, apples and pears are grown 'there. Why did not the honorable and learned senator include plums, grapes, and a variety of other fruits? From Adelaide we send to England a good many packages of grapes., which are called leather-jackets. Why should the honorable and learned senator require those grapes to be inspected, and allow the apples of Tasmania to escape scot-free? </para>

                <para class="block">There is no necessity to single out a particular class of horticultural produce. All fruit should be inspected prior to shipment, and the package should indicate the quality of its contents. We have had quoted to us a letter which was sent to the Comptroller-General of Customs from Tasmania by a gentleman named Jones, who evidently knows a great deal about these matters. His trouble is not that apples will be inspected, but that the little ones will not be allowed to be exported. A little apple is not necessarily a bad apple. French ladies are in the habit of scenting their dresses by carrying little apples in their pockets. I have grown1 a very small apple called api, which is most sweetly scented. I can imagine the ladies of Tasmania inducing there husbands and brothers to plant the api apple, in order that they may add to their many charms. After the apple has been grown, and; its sweet scent has been appreciated, I can imagine that the growers will want to export it. I can assure honorable senators that if a shipment of this little apple arrived in London in good condition, it would realize a good price. There are many kinds of small apples which are of most excellent flavour. It is simply absurd on the part of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jones</inline> to suggest that the export of apples would be objected to on account of their size, because we all know that some of the most valuable articles are done up in little parcels ; at least, I have been so informed on many occasions when allusions have been made to my size. I shall read what <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Wollaston</inline> says on the subject of little apples. Speaking of jam, he says that we should not allow the people of Tasmania to send away Tasmanian apricot jam made from carrots or swede turnips, and he goes on to say - </para>

                    <para>As to apples, the same thing applies. There will be no objection to good apples, though small, being sent away properly marked, but we desire to prevent their being branded " Finest Tasmanian," and so damage the reputation of the State. </para>

                <para class="block">In the same way we do not want pastry butter to be described as " best Victorian." Of course, inspection is necessary to prevent this kind of thing.

                <para class="block">It must not be forgotten that our regulations must be of such a character that they will stand the test of parliamentary criticism. "Unscrupulous as Ministers are sometimes supposed to be, no Minister is likely to injure his reputation by submitting regulations to Parliament which will not stand the test of fair criticism. In the framing of these regulations, the advice of experts will be obtained. I can assure honorable senators that there is no necessity to exclude apples, little or big, from inspection, any more than other kinds of produce. I ask the Committee not to agree to the amendment. </para>

                    (Tasmania).I have been rather amused at the honorable senator from South Australia attempting to teach Tasmanians, how to conduct the fruit export trade. The best answer to the suggestion that South Australian apples are better than" those produced in Tasmania is that South Australia does not do one-third of the trade done by Tasmania. A feature in connexion with the industry which
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline>
                    does not understand is, that a number of English buyers now come to the Commonwealth to buy, and it must be clear to honorable senators that if the producers are compelled to brand their cases of fruit as " inferior " or " e.mall " the price will be depreciated. There can be no doubt about that. I propose to offer two good reasons why the amendment should be agreed to. One is, that not only Chambers of Com.merce, but all the fruit-growers we know of in New South Wales and Tasmania, ask that the industry shall be excluded from the operation of this Bill. That is the opinion of men who mav be assumed to know their own business, and the reason is, therefore, a strong one. The other reason why the amendment should be agreed to is that it will be quite impossible to carry out the provisions of the Bill, as applied to this trade. When we consider the enormous quantity of apples that are brought together for shipment in a few hours, it must be admitted that an adequate inspection would be absolutely impossible. The Minister made some reference to scale on fruit, but how is an inspector looking at the fruit on the top of a case to know whether there is scale on the fruit at the bottom? How is he to tell from the fruit exposed at. the top of a. case, the quality of the fruit in the middle ? Is he to turn out the whole case? I might say that that is, what is done by the buyers in England.

                        <para>- They may buy some cases of apples on the mark outside the case, but they do not regard the mark as a guarantee of quality. The cases are marked merely S.T.P. or N.Y.P., as the case may be. There is very rarely any other mark on the case, except, perhaps, the initial of the producer, in order that the goods may be identified. I say that it will be found impossible to administer this Act in the present condition of the trade. I hope that honorable senators will give some consideration to the two reasons which I have advanced before they record a vote against the amendment. </para>

                    <para>- I hope the Committee will be impressed with the seriousness of this matter to Tasmania. The apple trade in that State is now assuming national importance. The industry affords a means of livelihood to a very large number of people in the southern part of the State, whilst people in the northern part of the State are now entering into the industry, finding that they can produce fruit as well as some of those in the south, and in some cases a little earlier in the season. The trade has grown in a few years from comparatively insignificant dimensions to one of magnitude. We have undertakings for the shipment of about 750,000 cases of fruit next year to the home markets. That will involve an enormous amount of hand-, ling, which must be done expeditiously and cheaply, for when the cost of sending the fruit home and preserving, it on the voyage is considered, it will be seen that there will be but a small margin of profit left. It must be remembered that we shall only be able to get rid of our increased quantity by making our apples available in England to the poor man as well as the rich man. The industry has all these difficulties to face. </para>

                        <para>- Apples form one of the principal articles of export from Tasmania. I may tell the Committee that the growers themselves came to the Government in Tasmania and asked for legislation of the kind we are now discussing, and it was by conversation with them that we found out how absolutely impracticable such legislation would be. I am able to inform the Minister that it will be quite impossible to have anything like an adequate inspection of certain shipments of Tasmanian fruit. The whole of our shipments of fruit are crowded onto about six weeks. The big ocean liners - 12,000-ton ships - come alongside the wharfs, and have only forty eight hours, or less, to stay. One of these vessels may ship 40,000 or 50,000 cases of fruit. Hobart, unlike Melbourne, has its limitations with respect to the labour available to Handle the enormous quantities of fruit that have to be shipped. A fleet of small steamers are engaged, and every effort is made, in the very short time available, to load the vessel. </para>

                        <para>- They are working night and day, and I may tell honorable senators that the appliances for the loading of this cargo have bean brought to such a state of perfection iri Hobart that they cannot be approached in any of the other States. Fruit can now be handled on the wharfs at Hobart without bruising, it or injuring it in any way. The leader of the Senate has been discoursing on the apple question as if he knew something about it. The honorable senator was in the old country some years ago, and saw Tasmanian apples in the London market, when they were shipped under arrangements that, I admit, were very defective. If the honorable senator had visited London in recent years he would have found that the trade is now conducted very differently. Grading, packing, and everything connected with the trade is now carried out ora first-class lines. The producers have been compelled to improve their methods, and the Tasmanian State legislation provides for the identification of the fruit, so that the shipper of falsely-marked fruit may be punished. </para>

                        <para>- I confess that I do not like invidious legislation, but this matter is of so much importance to Tasmania that I think we are justified in asking for spe.cial treatment. I wish the amendment had been confined to apples and pears, and if it were thought desirable to include fruit from other States, representatives of those States could have made out a case for that proposal. If we proceed under the Bill as it stands, our fruit-growers will take fright. This year they have been encouraged to come together, and have appointed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jones</inline> as a sort of agent and manager of their co-operative industry. They are putting, the business in his hands to secure the most economical transport of the fruit. I point out that the inspection of fruit must take time, and it will be almost disastrous to Tasmania if this industry is harassed or handicapped In any way. </para>

                <para class="block">That lis practically the law at present in Tasmania. General Inspection is, of course, impracticable, but there is power given under the Tasmanian law to punish a man if the description on his cases does not tally with the goods inside of them. It seems to me that all that Is necessary to bring about a healthy condition of the trade can be accomplished under clause 12. If a shipper brands his apples what they are not, there is ample power under that clause to punish him by the imposition of a penalty of .£100. Surely that should be sufficient. The industry is carried on by a large section of the population, and I venture to say that if a poll could be taken of the apple producers of Tasmania, 95 per cent, would vote against any such legislation. If we desire to legislate for their benefit, as I am sure we all do, we ought to allow them to be the judges in their own concerns. </para>

These apple producers will probably feel the effect of the measure more acutely when the regulations, whatever they may be, are prescribed.

                    or any other honorable senator, because I had experience of the trade for a considerable number of years. I have seen from 50,000 to 100,000 cases of fruit sold in one day, .and sold on the quality of the fruit, and not on any microscopic examination of marks on the outside of the cases. I can assure the Committee that it is very desirable, in the interests of the fruit trade, that it shall be left alone as far as possible. There are no goods exported that are as liable as fruit to alteration in quality and condition between the port of shipment and the port of landing. A description which may be quite correct and useful in its way when goods are shipped is altogether misleading when the goods arrive, and it does not enable the importer to forego the necessary work of examination. As the result of a wide and complete knowledge of business, I feel sure that it would be advisable to leave the matter entirely in the hands of the producers and exporters, who kno'w best how to serve the interests of the trade. For the Government to take charge of the trade and try to dogmatize as to grades, qualities, and marks is a mistake; and I shall be glad if

                <para>It will be seen, therefore, that not only the fruit-growers and exporters of South Australia and Tasmania, but also a large body of growers in New South Wales, feel the importance of this matter. I suppose that from the district of Parramatta a larger quantity of oranges is exported than from any other part of Australia. The association which sent the petition has existed for many years, and has directed its efforts to learning the best means of preserving fruit in sending it to the English market. The experience has been somewhat sad in regard to seasons; and it would be rather hard if, in addition to those troubles, the members were obliged, by reason of this legislation, to suffer further inconvenience.

My anxiety, like that of every other honorable senator, is to offer the utmost facilities for our export trade, and to put that trade on the soundest possible basis. Honorable senators from Tasmania have entered the strongest protests against the compulsory inspection and grading of fruit for export; and the arguments they have adduced undoubtedly possess very great force.

My difficulty has been intensified by the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker,</inline> who pointed out undoubted facts in connexion with the export trade. He told us that a large number of small producers are employed, that their profits are exceedingly small, and that if they are put to the expense of storing their small shipments for proper inspection, the probability is that they will not be able to export, and must allow their fruit to go to waste. These are serious difficulties. But at the same time, on full consideration, I am impressed with the fact that it will be the duty of the Minister to accommodate the regulations to the exigencies of trade. If the regulations for one moment embarrass, or have the result of discouraging, the export trade, they will not be tolerated for any length of time. </para>

If I thought for one moment that this Bill would in any way injuriously interfere with the development of the apple export trade in Tasmania, no honorable senator, or no member of this Parliament, would oppose it more strenuously. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> desires to have apples, pears, oranges, and lemons eliminated from the operation of clauses 7 and 11. Clause 7 deals only with imports, so that, so far as the apple trade is concerned, it may be dismissed from consideration. Clause 11 - the only clause the operation of which can be affected by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson's</inline> amendment - applies only to the branding of goods for export, and has no reference whatever to the inspection of them. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy,</inline> I gather from his interjection, thinks that no one objects to the branding of goods ; but that it is to compulsory inspection that objection is taken. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson's</inline> amendment were carried, it would not affect in one iota any of the provisions of this Bill, so fax as they relate to inspection. Clauses 7 and n are circumscribed by the clause now under consideration. Clause 7 deals with the branding of goods for import, and clause 11 with the branding of goods for export. </para>

                        <para>- If my honorable friend had confined his remarks to the effect his amendment would produce upon the brands, and had not referred to inspection, he would have been much briefer, and more to the point. But I am not now dealing with inspection at all, because I have shown that it is not affected by the amendment in one iota. All that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson's</inline> amendment will do is to leave fruit still open to the inspection clauses of this Bill, and, at the same time, prevent the Minister from prescribing that fruit shall bear a brand, if it is found necessary to put that provision in operation. We are not providing in this Bill that fruit shall necessarily be branded. Every honorable senator who has proposed to support this amendment seems to assume that we are absolutely providing here that fruit must be branded in a certain way. That is the whole basis of their argument. But we are simply taking power to compel fruit to be branded if it is found to be necessary. The provision of clause 11 is that - </para>

                        <para>- This may happen : The Minister may find when he takes over the administration of this measure that the fruit export trade of the Commonwealth is going on in a satisfactory manner, and that there is absolutely no necessity to exercise the powers conferred upon him by clause 11. But three, five, or seven years hence the Minister may find that a small number of dishonest persons are engaged in the fruit industry, whose improper practices are causing a great deal of loss to the great majority of honest persons engaged in the trade. He may find it very desirable to prescribe, under the powers conferred upon him by this measure, that a certain trade description shall be put upon packages of fruit. He may prescribe that the trade description shall be the name of the grower or packer of the fruit. Would there be any objection to that? "Trade description" under this measure includes any indication or description relative to - the nature, number, quantity, quality, purity, class, grade, measure, gauge, size, or weight of the goods ; or </para>

But it might be found, with regard to some other State - I will- not mention one, even for the purpose of illustration - that a number of instances had occurred in which exporters had sent away consignments which were not all they should be. The Minister might exercise the powers conferred upon him by' this Bill to prescribe that the trade description to be placed upon packages of fruit should be the name of the State from which the goods were consigned. That would be a warning to those who bought outside the Commonwealth that if they purchased fruit from Tasmania it would be all right, but that if they purchased fruit from the other supposed State they would have to be wary. </para>

                        <para>- It would be in that case. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson's</inline> amendment eliminates from the Bill that power of the Minister. I have already shown that the amendment does not affect inspection. Ii only affects the branding of fruit going forward for export. That branding is not compulsory. It is merely optional, and may lie prescribed by the Minister. It will be prescribed clearly, as all experience shows, in the way that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> suggests - when the Minister finds from experience that it is desirable in connexion with a particular trade or commodity to exercise the power. Now let me show what took place in Tasmania, and what led to putting on the statute-book the Act which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane</inline> says nobody engaged in the fruit trade knows anything about, and which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> says is discredited. </para>

                        <para>- The Act was called into existence by the circumstances which I am about to narrate. When the South African war was on Tasmania, in common with the other States of the Commonwealth, received a large number of orders for consignments of grain. I do not know what was the practice in the other States, but in Tasmania shipments of grain very often had to go forward at very short notice. It was found not only desirable, but actually necessary, that those shipments before they left Tasmania should be inspected by the Government. My honorable friends who come from Tasmania know that. That was one of the immediate factors that led to putting upon the statute-book the Exported Products Act, which has not been repealed. When the Bill was before the Tasmanian Parliament a debate upon it took place on the 26th September, 1901. I have here a report of that debate. It shows, that while clause 6 was under discussion, the marginal note of which is - </para>

It was done to protect the honest exporter. </para>

                    the present Premier of Tasmania, who represents a fruit growing district of Tasmania, said that he - favoured the name being put on the case. The Bill was calculated to make a few honest who were inclined to be dishonest. There were a few here and there who sent out rubbish with the hope of being able to sell and get a fair return. Brands would be a greater hardship to smalt consignors than the placing of their names on the case, which could be easily done with a stencil plate.

The way out of the difficulty would be not to allow anything to leave the State unless branded according to its quality. The efficiency of the Bill would depend very largely on the nature of the regulations framed by the Governor in Council.

                    <para>It was known to the Government that very large consignors used a fresh trade-mark or brand every year. Under the clause a man might change his brand as often as he liked, but his name must be on the fruit. If a producer or exporter continually forwarded good, sound fruit or other produce under a certain brand, that brand became valuable to him, and his good name was established ; but if a man sent bad stuff, his name would be known, and he would be taught a lesson if his name was on the fruit case. The Bill would certainly help the honest man, and would help to prevent the good name of Tasmanian produce being lowered. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that the amendment would affect the exportation of Tasmanian fruit to the extent of one case in five years. I should not have to wait for my honorable and learned friend to lead the way in opposing any legislation which would have the effect of retarding the development of that trade, which has increased so rapidly during the last few years, owing to the industry and ability of the men engaged in it. Seeing that the amendment could effect no desirable object, but would simply be a sort of placard on the Bill, making its provisions absolutely anomalous, I hope that it will not be received by the Committee. </para>

                    <para>- I do not think that any honorable senator has the slightest desire to take any step which would endanger a prosperous industry in Tasmania or any other State. I feel quite satisfied that we would do all we could to assist the senators for Tasmania to prevent the passage of a measure which was designed to do any injury to its industries. But this Bill, instead of injuring, will assist to preserve the good name of Australian and Tasmanian fruit in the markets of the old world. We have heard a great deal about inspection in connexion with this amendment, and also about the small producer shipping small consignments. But I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> has entirely demolished any arguments which have been advanced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson.</inline></para>

                        <para>- Exactly. I am afraid that the small producer has been made a stalking horse for the benefit of two big shippers. It is well known that about nineteentwentieths of the fruit which is exported from Tasmania is shipped by two big firms, who buy up all the space in the steamers, and charge the small producer what they please for the carriage of his small consignment. </para>

For instance, it was pointed out in one communication that certain exports would be prohibited. There is not a line in the Bill which prohibits the exportation of any goods. Under its provisions a man can export or import anything he pleases, provided that it is truly described. </para>

                        <para>- I freely admit that. For a great many years I have lived at Cairns, from which, I believe, as large an export trade in fruit is conducted as from any port in Australia. Frequently I have seen 60,000 bunches of bananas - and each bunch weighs1/2 cwt., which is heavier than the weight of an ordinary fruit case - shipped in one steamer. Every bunch has to be inspected prior to shipment. As the fruit is unloaded from railway trucks or drays on to the wharf, it is inspected by a Government officer, and passed on. The fruit is continually going along the wharf without interruption. Not the slightest trouble is experienced by the shippers. Why then should any trouble occur in a Tasmanian port? </para>

                        <para>- If a fruit-grower gives notice of his intention to ship a number of cases of fruit at a certain time, and the Government officer is satisfied by an examination of one or two cases, taken promiscuously, that the shipment is correctly described, he will pass the case for export. If, however, they are found not to bear a correct description, he may be empowered to see that a correct description is put on the shipment. It has been pointed out that a serious injury has been done to the trade of Australia in the markets of the old world by a few unscrupulous persons shipping inferior goods. Suppose that a consignment of fifty cases of Tasmanian fruit has been distributed amongst fifty towns in the old country, and found to be of very inferior quality. Tasmanian fruit has got a bad name in those fifty towns, and the whole fruit trade of the State has received a serious injury. No unscrupulous shipper or grower, merely for the sake of making an immediate profit, should be allowed to inflict such lasting damage upon a promising industry. From the quotations read by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> it is clear that that fact was recognised to the full extent in the Tasmanian Parliament, and that some members who were particularly interested in the fruit industry went so far as to contend that the fruit trade could not be protected and nourished without an effective system of Government inspection. I also am of that opinion. I am astonished at the amount of factious opposition which has been offered to a Bill which is designed to compel men to tell the truth, and to prevent cheating and fraud. Now that the clause has been fully debated, I hope we shall proceed to come to a decision. </para>

                    <para>- In view of the fact that certain honorable senators have been very anxious that this question should be fully' discussed, it is rather a fortunate circumstance that the Bill has been recommitted. I brought a perfectly open mind to the consideration of this question, and I have listened carefully to the arguments on both sides. I purposely refrained from expressing my views until I heard those .'arguments. Until <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> showed that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson's</inline> amendment would be ineffective to achieve the object for which it has been moved, I felt inclined to vote for it. I think it is only fair to my honorable colleagues from Tasmania that I should be willing to accept their advice on questions on which they should be better informed than myself. Senators Dobson, Mulcahy, and Macfarlane, although they represent, as I do, the whole of the State of Tasmania, may, perhaps, be said to represent in a special manner the fruit-growing districts of the State. Whilst for that reason I should be prepared to give special consideration to their views, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> has pointed' out that the amendment will be quite ineffective, and it appears to me that, keenly as Senators Dobson and Mulcahy may feel on this question, the fears they have expressed are ill-founded. I have listened to a recital of the provisions of the Tasmanian Act, and Senators Macfarlane and Dobson will be able to say whether any request for its repeal has ever been made by those interested in the fruit industry. </para>

                        <para>- It has transpired during the course of the debate that the State -Act provides for what is proposed to be provided by this Bill. The difference between the legislation to which the fruit-growers of Tasmania are subject now, and that to which they will be subject if this Bill is passed as it stands, is very slight. Under the Tasmanian Act, the exporters are compelled to put their names er registered Brands on their cases, in order that each may be identified, and in the event of their applying a false trade description to their goods, they are liable to prosecution. We are told that this law has never been put into operation. I suppose that is because there has been no necessity for it. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly; and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson,</inline> by his interjection, has answered his own objection to the legislation here proposed. I admit the sin'cerity of the desire of my honorable colleagues from Tasmania that the great fruit trade of that State shall not be harassed or interfered with by this legislation. They are afraid that under this Bill an inspector may be able to say to a shipper, "You shall grade your fruit." It must be admitted that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> has had something to do with the exportation of fruit, and with its sale in England. We have that honorable senator's assurance that no sane man occupying the position of the Minister administering this law would frame such a regulation as would permit his inspectors to unduly harass any shipper. We must come to that conclusion, because we know that if it could be shown that a regulation resulted in injury to shippers, it would be at once swept away by Parliament. In this, as in every other case, the Minister must be given some discretion in the framing of regulations. I do not believe that there will be the slightest danger that the fruit industry of Tasmania, or any other portion of the Commonwealth, will be unduly harassed, if we permit this Bill to pass. Even if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> could include clause 5 within the  scope of the amendment, I do not believe it would provide any greater safeguard for the shippers of fruit. Honorable senators must conclude that no inspector will be so utterly foolish as to do anything that will unduly harass exporters, unless he has reason to believe that an attempt is being made, by means of false trade descriptions, to foist an inferior article on the consumer. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane</inline> will admit that where that is done, it can only result in injury to the interests of the honest exporter. I have come to the conclusion that I can fairly vote against the amendment. I feel satisfied that, after the discussion, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> does not now believe that any great injury is likely to be clone to the fruit growing industry of Tasmania by this legislation. I am as anxious as any honorable senator can be, that this fruit industry shall attain the proportions it promises to attain in the near future, not only in my own State, but in every State in the Commonwealth. I am as deeply sensible of the value of the industry to Tasmania as any other honorable senator can be. I do not propose to vote against the amendment out of any consideration of loyalty to the Government, but because I feel that I can safely do so without the. slightest risk of danger to the producers of fruit in Tasmania. </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline>
                    has referred to the Tasmanian Act, and I have said that it is virtually a dead-letter. The honorable and learned senator spoke of branding as being compulsory under that Act, but I can inform honorable senators, from personal knowledge, that, in nine cases out of ten, the branding consists merely of the initials of the shipper of the fruit. He requires to have a mark on his packages, just as a man requires to mark his luggage, and this marking is not done because the law requires it.

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline>
                    that, as we have not coupled clause 5 with clause 15, my amendment will not achieve all that I intended. I desire to acknowledge my obligation to
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline>
                    for permitting the reconsideration of the clause. I am prepared to take a division on the amendment at once, if no other honorable senator desires to speak. I think, however, that
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane</inline>
                    is quite right in saying that, to all intents and purposes, the Tasmanian Act is a dead-letter. I feel somewhat aggrieved that
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford,</inline>
                    whenever he attempts to reply to any arguments of mine, should make use of statements which are inaccurate. The honorable senator said something about desiring to prevent hundreds of cases of apples alive with the codlin moth being exported to the old country.

                        <para>- Then the honorable senator referred to the red scale in oranges, which, he said, did enormous harm to New South Wales growers, which this Bill will prevent. When I asked the honorable senator whether there are any Pest Acts in force in England, he admitted that there are not. After leading honorable senators to suppose that there is some danger of codlin moth apples and red-scale oranges being rejected when exported to the old country, the honorable senator admits that there is nothing in his argument at all. </para>

                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator PULSFORD</inline>
                (New South Wales). - I desire to effect a little improvement in the wording of sub-clause
                <inline font-style="italic">a,</inline>
                which I regard as not very satisfactory. In the other sub-clause the articles themselves are mentioned, but in paragraph
                <inline font-style="italic">a</inline>
                there is the possibility of the intention being misunderstood. By the use of the words "used in the manufacture or preparation" the subclause is not confined to the raw material used, but may be read as including, for instance the machinery required in the preparation of food or drink. Owing to the looseness of the wording, a number of articles may be included which there is no intention to include. I shall therefore submit an amendment more in accordance with the clearer expressions used in paragraph
                <inline font-style="italic">d.</inline>
                I move -

                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator PLAYFORD</inline>
                (South Australia- - Minister of Defence). - I shall have to oppose the amendment, which I do not regard as any clearer than the words already used. The amendment is certainly briefer, but it is liable to the same objection which the honorable senator raises to the subclause as it stands, inasmuch as it affords the possibility of including machinery, I certainly did not consent to the reconsideration of the clause for the purpose of making purely verbal alterations, but in order to enable some of my honorable friends to submit really important amendments.

                <inline font-style="italic">d</inline>
                he will see that the word "from" is used, and I adopted the same word in drafting the proposed new paragraph

In place of the word " certificate, " which we inserted, it substitutes the word " notification." The amendment has a less technical signification, and is, I think, a desirable one. I move -

                    <para>- On- the whole, I agree with the Minister in what he has said, but' for all that I think that the word "certificate," under the circumstances, would have been more suitable than the word "notification." The word substituted by the House of Representatives is' rather a poor one. The Chief Electoral' Officer may write a post-card or a note to the Minister giving the results of the inquiry, but in the Bill sent by us to the House of Representatives he was required to send a certificate, which is a much more important document. The alteration may not be sufficiently important to warrant us in dissenting from what the House of Representatives has done, but still I think that the substituted word is weak. Though I am willing to agree to it, in my judgment it is a mistake. </para>

                <para>That the Bill be now read a second time. </para>
                <para class="block">This -is a Bill which, though small in its dimensions, is of very great importance. It will npt require more than two or three minutes to explain it. The intention is that in the printing of our Statutes, any amendments made by means of amending Acts shall be incorporated in subsequent prints. That principle was followed in connexion with the amending Defence Act last year. It will be remembered that we passed a Defence Act a couple of years ago, and subsequently amended it. For the purpose of facilitating reference to the law as it stands,' the Government Printer has printed the original Act, and with it the amending sections, so that the whole law appears continuously in the one document. Where sections have been deleted by amending legislation, they do not appear in the subsequent print. Of course, however, steps of that kind might be misleading in some instances, unless proper precautions were taken. Accordingly </para>
                <para>Ave provide in this Bill that where any Act has been amended by the repeal or omission or substitution or insertion of words or figures, then, in the reprint of the Act, the Government Printer shall print it accordingly. But to guard against any misconception or misleading that might be occasioned in reference to any reprint of an Act, the Bill provides that references shall be made in the margin or in the foot-notes to the enactment by which each amendment is made. So that if any one, in reading the Act, wishes to know whether the particular section which he is reading appears in the original Act, or is the result of an amending Act, the marginal note or footnote will show him at once. We have also provided in a subsequent provision, in which I shall have to make a verbal amendment, that -  </para>
                <para>On all copies issued by the Government Printer of any Act which has before or after the commencement of this Act been amended a short reference to every Act by which it has been amended shall be made on the first page of .each copy issued. </para>
                <para class="block">So that anybody will be able to take up the copy of an Act and see at once the original provisions of the Act, together with amendments and additions, without the provisions which have been deleted by subsequent legislation. On the face of the Act itself there will be an indication to the reader, either in a marginal note or footnote, so that if any individual wishes to consult the piece of legislation which formed the original of the print before him, he will have an opportunity to do so. This will facilitate reference and make our law more easily available, not only to persons who are not engaged in the legal profession, but to those who practise the law or are engaged in the work of legislation. I think it is very desirable that a measure of this kind should be placed upon the statute-book. I may mention that in 1903, in Queensland, it was found desirable to make provision of this character, and that was done in an Acts Interpretation Act. Honorable senators may notice that the Bill before them contains a reference to that Statute. I think that the experience of honorable senators in consulting, Acts will have convinced them of the desirableness of such a measure, so that when any amending Act is passed the Government Printer may. in subsequent prints show the amending sections with the original provisions. I may mention that in the Electoral Bill which we recently had before us, we passed a provision enabling the Government Printer to incorporate the amending sections in any new print of the law. What has been done in connexion with the Electoral Act, and also what has been done without statutory direction, by the Government Printer in connexion with the Defence Act, will, under this Bill, be done in connexion with. all. our legislation. </para>

                    <para>- The Bill is undoubtedly entitled to the praise given to it. I only wish it went a little bit further. I point out that in connexion with a measure which we have been discussing for some days past there is a clause incorporating it. with the Customs Act. We have in the two measures provisions which to some extent are counterparts one of another, but which nevertheless vary in some respects. For instance, the clause of the Commerce Bill relating to aiding and abetting offences is nearly word for word the same as a section of the Customs Act, except that the word " knowingly " has been added. That is an important addition to the law. There are, therefore, in two measures which are incorporated two provisions, one more drastic than the other. It would be desirable, in reprinting those Acts in the future, to make references to show that the two measures taken together are really one. I could give the Senate several illustrations of the differences between the clauses of the Commerce Bill and the sections of the Customs Act. As those measures are incorporated, I think that point might very well be considered bv Ministers, who are responsible for simplifying our legislation. </para>
