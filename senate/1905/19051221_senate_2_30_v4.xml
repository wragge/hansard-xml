                        <para>- I wish to ask you, sir, whether you have noticed a paragraph in yesterday&#39;s Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> stating that the Refreshment Rooms are being closed owing to the supply of inferior meals at high prices, and to their being ill-cooked, &#38;c. I also desire to know if any effort will be made by those in authority to prevent a recurrence of these cowardly attacks on defenceless servants, who have performed their duties to the satisfaction of honorable senators. Further, I desire to ask you whether there is a special tariff for the press, whether they enjoy the use of rooms, telephones, and other conveniences which are provided here at the expense of the general taxpayers; and, if so, whether in future the enjoyment of such privileges will be made contingent upon good conduct. . </para>

I am not at present in&#39; a position to say what privileges will be enjoyed in the future by the press. </para>

We are a long-suffering body, and really some steps should be taken to put an end to the circulation of the lies which have appeared in the press day after day ? </para>
