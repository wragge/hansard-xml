                    <para>- My reason for seeking that these papers should be laid upon the table, and also, if I may say so, for congratulating the Minister in moving that they be printed, is that they relate to the first appointment to an office of great importance and of great significance. It is desirable that there should be on the records of Parliament the conditions of the appointment in question, and the papers showing that the intention of the enactment, which was passed last year, has been faithfully observed, and carried into effect, by the Government intrusted with the inauguration of that tribunal. It is the more important in view of, as honorable senators will recollect, recent inconveniences which occurred in New South Wales. It will be a source of gratification to all of us that care has been taken to insist upon the mandate of Parliament, with regard to the duty of a Justice of the High Court, to undertake the office, and that it is recognised that, under the enactment of last year, a Justice is neither entitled to decline to accept the office, nor to resign before the term of the appointment is at an end. </para>

                    <para>- The reason why the production of these papers has been called for is in order that an act of simple justice may be done to an excellent and efficient officer in the Public Service, against whom this charge of neglect was made. I think every one occupying a high and important position ought to be specially careful that charges involving imputations of dereliction of duty should not be lightly made against a subordinate who is not in a. position to publicly defend himself. I shall always endeavour to see that justice is done in that respect, and that it is recognised that every officer, however humble - the humblest doorkeeper in this Parliament - is entitled to the same degree of justice and fair play as the highest personage in the land. In this particular instance, the officer accused is a most faithful and efficient officer, who passed through a considerable term of public service in South Australia. He was the Judges' Associate for some years, and the right-hand man of the Crown Prosecutor's Department in that State for a number of years, discharging all his duties with faithfulness and loyalty. </para>

                        <para>- It will be an act of simple justice, because the charge of neglect of duty against this; officer was publicly made, and at a time when his explanation and defence was actually in the hands of the high judicial officer who made the charge. It was made without any intimation that that explanation and defence was then in the possession of the accuser, but was not made public at the same time as the accusation, And in the absence of that vindication on the occasion when the charge was made in the High Court, the least we can do is to see that it is made public through the High Court of Parliament. </para>

I am afraid that the rule laid down last session as to alternate Thursdays has not worked well, and that in future it will be better to lay down this interpretation of the sessional order, that alternate Thursdays shall be counted as if the 'Senate sat on each Thursday. I am afraid that honorable senators have had some difficulty in ascertaining when notices were to come on, and if we lay down a rule that each Thursday shall be considered as a Thursday under the sessional order, it will be a convenience to the Senate. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, I will do so. It is a Bill that was left over by the late Government. It deals with a very important subject, and one which, if the Senate is to do justice to it, will demand a very great deal of care and thought. Steps for fresh legislation on the subject have already been taken in England. The whole subject of copyright is, in fact, in a very unsettled condition. Therefore, the more time the Government can give the Senate for the consideration of the subject, the better. Even if the Minister moves the second reading next week, I would ask him to consider whether it would not be better to engage that the Government will not attempt to force a debate upon it then. </para>

                        <para>- I do not intend to delay the passage of this Bill, because it, in common with the two succeeding Bills on the noticepaper, is a measure that was left by the preceding Government, but was not revised by them. Therefore, the object of it is good. But I am sorry that the Government of which I was a member had not an opportunity to revise the Bill, because then it would have been perfect. I wish to call attention to one point. It seems to me to be very undesirable that legislation should be thought necessary to exempt the Governor-General from serving on juries. I never saw such an exemption before in a Bill. It is like exempting the King from serving on juries. I am not going to suggest that the Bill should be recommitted in this House for the purpose of making the amendment, but, nevertheless, it does appear to me to be undignified, and not in conformity with usage that we should introduce the Governor-General in an exemption of this character. </para>

                    <para>- I wish to call my honorable and learned friend's attention to a matter that he has already dealt with, namely, that this Bill requires a great deal of revision. The point, to which I daresay the attention of the Government has been directed, is involved in clause 4. My honorable and learned friend took considerable pains the other day to explain away the ambiguities and difficulties in the language of the Bill, which goes to an extent that, I think, honorable senators will see would be ridiculous. A Court might so construe it as to impose limitations. I do not like the provision. It is better to attempt to limit the clause before passing the Bill than to have language in it which requires the interpretation of a Court. This is a difficulty which the Minister felt, and, very properly, tried to show would not be so troublesome and inconvenient as I fancy it would. The clause provides that the signature " of any person who holds or has held " any of these offices is to be taken as proved without the necessity of oral evidence. The result would be to patent the signature of a person who holds the office, quite irrespective of the office - not to merely patent the signature of the person who holds the office, but the signature of any person who has ever held the office. This might afford a very convenient and facile method of committing forgery. For instance, the signature of the President of this Chamber is one which is to be taken notice of, if affixed officially ; and that is right and proper. We hope that the event may be deferred, but the President may vacate the office; and at some future time his signature may be taken judicial notice of under the Bill. The Minister laid his finger on this blemish, for discovering which I claim no merit. But I differ from the 'Minister as to the method by which this difficulty should be met. It is extremely desirable not to send a Bill from this Senate susceptible of such a construction, if we have the means, by the use of a word or two of common-sense English, to put the matter right. What is desired is to enable the Court to take notice of the official signature of the officer whose name is attached to any document which may be tendered as evidence in a Court of Justice. I suggest that the provision should be simply that a Court shall take judicial notice of the signature "of the Governor-General, every Minister of State, the President of the Senate," and so forth ; that means, of course, the signature of the person at the time holding the office. </para>

                <para class="block">The Minister admits that what I have stated is the case, but he proposes to leave it to the Court to place a limited construction on the provision. My opinion is that we ought to put the matter right now. In the same paragraph we find provision made for judicial notice being taken of the signature of the " President or Deputy-President " of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. Is there a Deputy-President of that Court? </para>

                    SYMON.- At ' present there is no other Court of the kind, and these words are unnecessary. The Bill goes on to provide for all subsequent appointments by giving power to the Governor-General, by order published in the
                    <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Gazette,</inline>
                    to declare the section to apply to any other officers on the creation of their offices ; and' it is a pity to mention an office or officer at present unknown to the Constitution. Then I call attention to the fact that sub-clause
                    <inline font-style="italic">c</inline>
                    is really a limitation, of the present law. I allude to the provision that the signature of a person who "holds or has held" such office shall be taken judicial notice of, if it purports to be appended to an official document. That is the law at present, as the Minister knows. Anybody acting in an office is deemed to be properly appointed, until the contrary is shown; and that applies to the highest officer in the land, as well as to the humblest police constable. The provision is altogether inapplicable, and might lead to great inconvenience ; and all that is necessary is to show that the officer has been acting in a particular capacity or office. I also desire to point out that, under clauses 8 and 10, the mere production of a paper purporting to be the
                    <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth</inline>
                </para>

                    <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline>
                    shall in all Courts be evidence; and it ought to be made perfectly clear that it is onlyprima
                    <inline font-style="italic">facie</inline>
                    evidence, and that the Court is not left to say whether it is conclusive. It is not likely that a paper of such moment as the
                    <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline>
                    would be forged, but still I think it necessary to submit this point.. Then it should be provided in clause 9 that the production of a document purporting to be printed by the Government Printer shall be only
                    <inline font-style="italic">prima facie</inline>
                    evidence that the paper was printed by the Government Printer, or under authority ; otherwise there will be a premium placed on imposition. Clause 11, which deals with proof of judicial proceedings, ought to be limited to the Court we have at present. As I have said, the only Federal Court we have now is the High Court, though we have Courts exercising Federal jurisdiction, and if we establish a facile system of proof of judicial proceedings, it ought to be limited to the High Court or any Court exercising Federal jurisdiction. I propose to move the recommittal of the Bill, with a view particularly to setting right clause  4,  which is the one most likely to cause inconvenience, and also to move the other amendments I have indicated. I should also like to submit whether, by clause 2, which gives a definition of "Courts," we can make this Bill apply to States Courts. My view is that we cannot legislate with a view to establishing a code of evidence affecting States Courts, because to do so would be to attempt to regulate the procedure of tribunals over which the Commonwealth has no jurisdiction. Laws of evidence are as much part of the procedure of the States Courts as are the ordinary rules. The amendments I have indicated ought to be made in order that this Bill may provide what is intended. I move - That the Bill be recommitted.

                        <para>- I do not agree with the construction which the honorable and learned senator has placed on that clause. In moving the second reading of the Bill, I said that at first glance it might be thought that if clause 4 were passed it would give to the ordinary private and unofficial signature of any one of the persons named, a value that we did not intend. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> suggests that if the Bill be recommittedthewords"ofanyperson who holds or has held the office of " should be left out, and the clause simply provide for judicial notice being taken of the signature of the holder of an office. If we did that, the Courts could only take judicial notice of the signature of the then existing Governor-General, Minister of State, and so forth. </para>

                        <para>- These are the reasons why the words objected to were inserted. If the words were struck out, the Court might feel restricted to taking judicial notice of the signatures of persons then presently occupying any of those particular offices. I think the honorable and learned senator must have misunderstood my remarks. I wished to point out especially to laymen that the last two lines save the clause from creating any such dangerous position as that which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> is contemplating. He has ventured to throw doubt upon the existence of such an officer as the  Deputy President  of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. But section 15 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act reads - </para>

                        <para>- I interjected that I presumed that there was. I have just picked up the copy of the Act, and have had time only to notice a provision for a Deputy President taking the necessary oaths of office before entering upon his duties. The Act which brings into existence the Court, and the President also, clearly contemplates the appointment of a Deputy President. We shall be safer in including :in this Bill a Deputy President when he is specially mentioned in section 15 of the Act, and probably in other sections. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline> Symon  has criticised the drafting of clause 8 because the words " <inline font-style="italic">prima facie "</inline> are not used before the word " evidence."

                        <para>- After all, it is only evidence for what it is worth. It is not conclusive evidence, and if other evidence in rebuttal, either oral or written, can be produced, it can be given. The same remark applies to the honorable and learned senator's criticism of clause 9. With regard to clause 11, he has pointed out that it is scarcely correctly worded, because there is no other Federal Court than the High Court. In its judiciary provisions the Constitution contemplates the establishment of not only a High Court, but such other Federal Courts as Parliament may from time to time create. Such Courts may. be established at any time, and we wish to avoid the necessity of bringing in a small amending Bill, or of exercising too frequently the power which is given in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> of clause 4. </para>

                        <para>- We can instruct a State Court that if it is to take evidence relating to an official document of the Commonwealth, it shall be taken in the way prescribed in this Bill. The honorable and learned senator has expressed some doubt as to our right to pass this provision, but I understand that other learned gentlemen, after very careful consideration, have come to a totally different conclusion. I think that the reasons which have been advanced for a recommittal of the Bill are not sufficiently strong to warrant the non-adoption of the report. </para>

In the Customs Act we were perfectly entitled to declare what shall be evidence, either <inline font-style="italic">prima facie</inline> or conclusive, or upon whom the onus of proof shall lie in respect to any offence. But this is simply an Evidence. Bill. Under the Constitution, it is not competent for this Parliament to legislate with regard to the procedure in States Courts, whether, by way of evidence or in any other respect. We all. know how susceptible the States are as to any encroachments upon their rights. I take a very strong view that we are not entitled to declare to the States Courts what shall be evidence,; generally speaking, in their code. </para>

If I thought that it would cut the painter from the High Court, I should not support the amendment. In framing the Customs Act the Parliament clearly had a right to say what kind of evidence should be required in order to prove an offence,' or in what way 'documents should be admitted. I hope that honorable senators will see their way to omit what I regard as a very serious blot on this measure. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope that the amendment will not be agreed to. The object of the Bill is to provide for an easy, safe, convenient proof of official documents, seals, and signatures. A similar law is to be found in practically every part of the British Empire. Under the operation of the Commonwealth Constitution new offices have come into being' with their seals and officers, and it is necessary that we should have the means of proving any official document or signature when it is required. In this clause we provide that the term " Courts " shall include " the Commonwealth Courts, the Inter-State Commission, and all Courts of the several States." I think it is straining the position very strongly to suggest that we have not power to provide that the States Courts shall take official or judicial notice of signatures and seals in the cases .mentioned in the Bill. In the covering sections of the Constitution it is provided, in section 5, that - </para>

                <para class="block">Commonwealth Courts or State Courts. To say that the argument is not parallel is not correct, because an individual might be summoned by a process, of a State Court to serve as a juror in that Court, and he might say that he claimed to be exempt under Commonwealth legislation. Are we not then interfering with a State Court in the exercise of its jurisdiction, and with the legislation of a State which has not already provided to exempt such officers? What we are now doing is to add ito those cases which already exist in every State where judicial notice is. taken, of certain officers, seals, and signatures. We add another list of officers, seals, and signatures, which every State Court should take notice of. The reason why we add1 to them is the reason why we added to the list of exemptions from serving on juries - .because these officers, seals, and signatures did not come into existence until the establishment of the Commonwealth. I venture to submit to honorable senators that we have the fullest power to legislate in this way, and to ask them not to accept the amendment. </para>

                    SYMON (South Australia). - My honorable and learned friend has referred to two things. One is that we have just passed' a Jury Exemption Bill. In the first place, I think it is a little doubtful whether even in that respect we have power to legislate - whether we can say that a State which has the control of its own Courts and the right to say who shall constitute its juries, should be disentitled to say that certain persons whom we, the Commonwealth, seek to exempt from serving on juries, shall not be exempt. A State regulates its own affairs in that respect, and I doubt whether we have power to say that certain persons shall be exempt from serving on juries in State Courts. I have no doubt that the States will make their exemptions co-terminus with ours, but that is quite a different thing from issuing our own exemptions with regard to juries in States Courts. But that is not parallel with this matter at all. What we are doing is to say that a State shall not impose the duty on an instrumentality of the Commonwealth, which may interfere with the exercise, by that instrumentality, of Commonwealth functions. That is analogous to the highly-debatable income tax decision.

                        <para>- It may be. I do not express any opinion upon it. There is grave difference of opinion as to the force of that particular decision, which is1 now under appeal. It is doubtful whether we have the power to say that a State must not impose the liability on Commonwealth officers to serve on juries. Even if it is not doubtful it is not analogous. It would be analogous if we sought to exempt State officers from service. There the parallel would be, perhaps, complete. But I do not think that even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> will say that it is a very forceful argument for passing this Bill as it stands, that we have just passed the third reading of another Bill which contains that provision. The fact that State Courts are included in that Bill is no strong argument why we should include the States in this. The second argument to which I wish to direct attention is that section 5 of the covering sections of the Constitution enables us to pass a clause of this kind. That section provides that all laws passed by the Commonwealth shall be binding on the Courts and people of every State. This is the first time I ever heard it suggested that that should apply to a law which we are not competent to pass. It applies to laws which we are competent to pass, and an argument based upon that section begs the whole question, which is whether we have power to pass a law regulating the procedure of a State Court. If the Committee decides to pass this provision we shall have done our duty in seeking to eliminate it. </para>

It is very desirable that it should be made clear that the Courts must take judicial cognizance of the signature of the Governor-General. If that is not done, the position! will be that, in some of the Courts of the States, when a case comes on, if the signature of the Governor-General is produced, it will require to be proved'. So it will be also with the seal of the Commonwealth. If a document bearing the seal of a State is produced, that is accepted; but the seal of the Commonwealth will require to be proved. </para>

                        <para>- The ordinary law of evidence is absolutely silent, as regards the seal of the Commonwealth or the signature of the Governor-General. In this Bill it is not proposed to provide any rules of procedure for State Courts beyond those relating to particular officers who have been brought into existence under the Commonwealth Constitution. The officers mentioned in this Bill have been created under the Constitution;. That being so, I think that the Constitution gives us the power under section 5 of the covering sections, to require that the signatures of those officers shall be accepted by the Courts of the States. </para>

                    <para>Evidence of any proclamation, commission, order, or regulation issued or made by the Governor-General or by or under the authority of a Minister may be given in all Courts - by the production of the documents mentioned in the four subsequent paragraphs. If we have not the power to legislate to compel the Courts of the States to take as evidence of any such proclamation, commission, or order, proof given in one of the manners prescribed in the clause, we are in this position: That the Commonwealth administration of a Department may be subjected to all the harassing inconvenience that a single recalcitrant State may see fit to impose upon it. It might be necessary to prove in the Court of a State a certain proclamation, commission, or order. That State might in effect say, "We will not take notice of any form of proof under the Commonwealth Evidence Act; we require that the original commission or document shall be produced here." When the original commission was produced the attendance of some one who knew the signature to the commission or document might be required to prove it. Is it reasonable to suppose that the Commonwealth Parliament, vested with all the powers contained in the Constitution, is not in a position to legislate so that the ordinary machinery of our government can be carried on without the greatest danger of harassing and inconvenience? We have power to bring certain officers into existence under the Constitution. We have done so; and now we are entitled to require by our legislation - not in any high-handed fashion - that judicial notice of the existence of these officers and of their signatures when attached to official documents, shall be taken not only in the Courts of the Commonwealth but also in the Courts of the States. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> has argued that our powers are limited by the Constitution. So they are; but honorable senators will be aware that in paragraph)  39,  of section  51,  it is provided that we have full power to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth, with respect to - </para>
                    <para>Matters incidental to the execution of any power vested by this Constitution in the Parliament or in either House thereof or in the Government of the Commonwealth or in the Federal Judicature or in any Department or officer of the Commonwealth. </para>
                </quote>
                <para>That provision clearly covers this clause, and gives us power to legislate in this regard. Speaking for myself, the more I think over the subject and argue upon it, the more confident I feel that we have full power to legislate so as to obviate the possible necessity for any Federal officer being taken from head-quarters to some Court in a State, because the law of that State does not provide that judicial notice shall be taken by its Courts of official signatures to Commonwealth documents. We have power to legislate to obviate the necessity for officers of the central Departments of the Commonwealth being compelled to relinquish duty to go with original records to distant places in States in consequence of the failure of a State to legislate, or in consequence of the recalcitrance of a particular State which might be at loggerheads with the Commonwealth. I appeal to honorable senators to oppose the amendment, which, if carried, may lead to the difficulties and dangers I have indicated. </para>

It is necessary that judicial notice shall be taken of documents bearing the signature or seal, not merely of the present occupant of an office, but of the person -who may, as the occupant of the office, have attached the signature twenty years or mote before. This Bill does not merely apply to present holders of offices. </para>

                        <para>- That is the reason I advance for the" retention of the words. It might be necessary to produce a document bearing, for instance, the signature of Lord Hopetoun, and, therefore,, the words were inserted, " who holds or has held the office of." A Court would not take judicial notice of Lord Hopetoun's signature attached to a private letter; but it might be necessary to prove his official signature to an official document years after he had passed out of existence. So long as Lord Hopetoun had held the office, his official signature would be taken judicial notice of for what it was worth, and the Court would take judicial notice of the fact that he had held office at the time the signature was attached, and also of the seal if any on the document. It would be safer to leave the clause as it stands, because the amendment would practically confine the proving of documents of this character to cases where the person whose signature was in question, would be then occupying the office. </para>

                    SYMON (South Australia). - Of course our desire is to make the clause a credit to us by its intelligibility. It seems to me that if we say that the signature of the Governor-General shall be taken judicial notice of when attached to any official document, it will not matter whether the Governor-General be the present occupant of the office or any previous Governor-General. If a document be presented in a Court bearing a signature purporting to be that of the Governor-General, or any of the high officers mentioned, it will be accepted as the signature of the person as the holder of the office, and he need not be the present holder of the office. This clause, which has the intention of facilitating the proof of signatures, is very cumberously expressed; and, no doubt, it is difficult to draft a provision of the kind simply. If we retain paragraph
                    <inline font-style="italic">c,</inline>
                    and also paragraph
                    <inline font-style="italic">d,</inline>
                    the amendment will simplify the provision,! and make it less susceptible ' of doubt. The first doubt is raised by the words which it is proposed shall be left out, and which, as
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline>
                    has admitted, would seem, at first blush, to extend to signatures attached after the person had ceased to hold office, so long as the signatures purported to be attached to official documents. But if we limit the clause by using the words "official signature," the whole provision is complete in one sentence. Even if we leave out the word "official," the clause is still clear, because what is meant is not the signature of a person who "holds or has held," but the signature of the actual occupant of the office, even though it may be twenty years since the signature purports to have been attached.

                        <para>- It is rather hard that no provision should be made. The Bill makes every justice of the peace a commissioner of the High Court for taking affidavits. Ordinarily the commissioners for taking affidavits in the Supreme Court of a State are appointed by the Chief Justice. I never saw any reason why justices of the peace should not act in that capacity. It is only fair that they should be able to charge for the performance of this duty the same fees as a commissioner for taking affidavits who has been appointed by the Chief Justice of the High Court. I have not a copy of the schedule of fees before me, but I would suggest that a justice of the peace should be entitled to take such fees as may be prescribed by rule of Court. </para>

                    <para>- Since I called attention to this point at an earlier stage I have looked into the matter, and certainly my impression has been strengthened that a justice of the peace should be entitled to charge a fee for taking an affidavit. It is quite clear that a justice of the peace will be put to considerable inconvenience by the clause, because the tendency of a person will be to go to a man who can charge no fee, and not to a commissioner who is entitled to make a charge. The matter of attesting signatures causes serious inconvenience to justices of the peace who are engaged in business pursuits. It is desirable if it is possible to put justices of the peace on the same footing as the commissioners of the High Court. </para>

                        <para>- That may enable him to take these affidavits without requiring a fee. Commissioners are appointed by the Chief Justice of a Supreme Court, because they are supposed to be particularly fitted by education and position to attest documents of this character. So far as my experience goes, the Commission of the Peace is very frequently recruited from gentlemen who have proved themselves to be very successful electioneering agents. While there are many justices of the peace who are eminently suitable to act as commissioners, still, in country districts, there are a large number of justices of the peace who have not the necessary education ro enable them to attest these documents, unless they have some person to guide them. I think it is better not to make the amendment. </para>

                    (Queensland).When I first read this clause, I considered it a most excellent one. I thought that the Government intended to cheapen legal proceedings, but I was foolishly sanguine in hoping that it would pass without great opposition, because, undoubtedly, it strikes at the privileges of one of the strongest trade unions in the world. In this case, the objection is not to the justices of the peace being appointed commissioners, but to their working for nothing. At the present time, affidavits can only be taken by professional gentlemen, who are specially appointed to do the work, and they take very substantial fees for merely attesting signatures. I trust that the Government will not abandon the provision.

                    that justices, of the peace ought to be allowed to take a prescribed fee. If it is thought that it should not be a large one, then let it be small. In South Australia, a justice of the peace collects a fee of is. for taking; an affidavit. I speak feelingly, because my office happens to be in the neighbourhood of five lawyers, and every day I have an application to take an affidavit or a declaration. I think it would cheapen legal process if the great unpaid were allowed' to charge a small fee for doing this work.

We do not wish to establish a scale which may be found to differ from the scale fixed by the High Court for its commissioners. Perhaps, if the Bill is passed with this clause, the High Court may see fit to prescribe a scale of fees which shall be paid to justices of the peace.

If I could only induce the Minister of Defence to get rid of " that tired feeling," and to fight for his Department, I think he would' support me. The position in which the clause puts the Defence Department is not satisfactory. The forces are made entirely subsidiary to the Postmaster-General's Department, and are obliged to content themselves with working under regulations made by the postal officials.

                    <para>. - In opposing this amendment on a former occasion I gave reasons why the control of wireless telegraphy should be in the hands of the Postmaster-General Since then I have had the opportunity to consult with some of the heads of the Departments, and I feel more strongly than ever that it is absolutely necessary that we should not pass the amendment. The1 object of the Bill is to invest the Postmaster-General with a monopoly in wireless telegraphy in Australia. All military and naval rights are duly preserved. We do not attempt to touch the King's ships of war which may come into Commonwealth waters. But with regard to the" Military and Naval Forces of the Commonwealth the position is different. In time of war no Act upon the statute-book could in any way impede the officers of the Naval and Military Forces from doing what they consider to be necessary in connexion with wireless telegraphy, or. with our established telegraphic and telephonic systems. But in time of peace the Naval and Military Forces have no need to use wireless telegraphy, except, perhaps, for experimental purposes, and then it can be used under regulations. It would be dangerous to give the power to any officer in time of peace under cover of exemptions granted to the forces to establish another wireless telegraphy system, which, either designedly or otherwise, might tap or intercept messages transmitted through the system under the control of the post-office for ordinary commercial purposes. To show how messages might be intercepted, I may mention that the instruments on board the <inline font-style="italic">Times</inline> steamer while off Wei-hai-Wei, in China, during the war, recorded messages sent by the Russians in Port Arthur and by ships of the Japanese Navy, although long distances intervened, and both nations were probably using their best endeavours to keep their messages secret. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Maskeline intercepted a message sent by Signor Marconi in London, although it was sent by a special instrument designed to prevent interception. It is very easy in the present stage of development of wireless telegraphy for one system to intercept messages sent by means of another. If we do not have a single system in Australia the commercial value of wireless telegraphy will be liable to be very seriously impaired. There is no question about the right of the Military and Naval Forces to use wireless telegraphy in time of war. Indeed, they have practically unlimited powers. They can use wireless telegraphy or anything else public or private which is necessary for the defence of the country. They can even go so far as to lay waste any private property. They can not only set up what telegraphic installations they please, but can seize and make use of any existing installations. Under these circumstances, I submit that the Defence Force are amply protected', and that there is no need to pass the amendment in the interests of the defence of the country. It would be very awkward if the Defence Department were able to use wireless telegraphy under its own regulations, which might conflict with the regulations of the Post and Telegraph Department, and if different systems of wireless telegraphy existed side by side and in possible conflict. If the Military Forces desire to use wireless telegraphy for experimental purposes, an arrangement can be made for that purpose, but it is desirable that in time of peace they should be confined to working under regulations in regard to the use of a monopoly which belongs to the people of tne Commonwealth. Under these circumstances, I urge that the amendment is not necessary, and that if passed it would be a possible source of danger and trouble. </para>

The whole four of those authorities have to concur. Here it is only the Postmaster-General who has to grant his consent. </para>

                        <para>- The power in Australia is to be concentrated in the hands of the Postmaster-General. The Minister of Defence seems to be content to say nothing and do nothing in the interests of his Department. I hope that at some time a more active Minister of Defence will come forward and represent its interests. I emphatically reassert that it is to the interests of Australia that the Defence authorities should have the right of initiative in regard to wireless telegraphy not only in time of war but also in times when they have to prepare for war. Therefore I shall press the amendment. </para>

                    <para>- I am sorry that the Minister in charge of the Bill finds it to be necessary to oppose the amendment. Judging from the feeling of the Committee, his opposition will be supported. I am afraid that it is another instance of the supineness of the people of this country with regard to defence. One rarely meets with a man in public life who is prepared to take up the cudgels in the cause of the defence of Australia with the view of putting the country in a state of preparedness for an emergency, when we may have to defend our hearths and homes. </para>

                        <para>.- If we wish to be able to defend our country we must learn to defend it, and our troops must be exercised in whatever appliances may be necessary. While it is perfectly true that in time of war the demands of the Military and Naval Forces will override all other considerations, yet we must have our men trained in times of peace. Why do we have camps of instruction, and why do military men set great store by having opportunities for bringing troops together for training? In order that they may be prepared to defend the country when an emergency arises. It is equally necessary that the men who have to use wireless telegraphy in time of war shall have an opportunity to make themselves acquainted with it in times of peace. </para>

                        <para>- I never opposed any proposal to put the defences of Australia on a sound and adequate footing. Although I recognise that the honorable senator who interjects did give a good deal of attention to the subject, and was desirous to improve the defences, I say that no Government has yet arisen that has devoted sufficient attention to the necessities of the case. I am sorry that the Defence Department does not take up this matter and point out the necessity for the opportunity to be given to the forces to make themselves acquainted with wireless telegraphy. Of course, the Bill does not interfere with the King's Navy. It would be most unwise to attempt to do so even if we could. But if we recognise the necessity of giving these powers to the King's Navy, why not also give them to our Military Forces? Whatever was done would have to be done under regulations which would have to be approved of by Parliament. </para>

If, on the other hand, it appears, in the course of the evidence, that the offence is one that might warrant a more severe punishment than that I have already mentioned, it will be competent for the Court of summary jurisdiction, instead of dealing with an accused, to commit him for trial. </para>

                    <para>- Having, already spoken for some time on this measure, it is not my intention to occupy honorable senators at much further length. I shall endeavour to make my remarks in a tone of fairness and in a Federal spirit - in a tone and spirit to which no objection can be raised by the supporters of the measure. I am, from conviction, after considerable thought on the matter, an earnest opponent of the Bill, which I believe is absolutely unconstitutional, and therefore improperly before us. The Bill, in my opinion, seeks to do what would be grossly unfair to every other State, and I find it  mv bounden. duty to oppose the proposed survey. All honorable senators will agree that it would be far better if we had the consent, by Act of Parliament, of the State of South Australia, as we have the consent of the State of Western Australia, before we proceed with such a measure. I am very glad that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> has an amendment dealing -with this important aspect of the matter. It will be remembered, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> that I brought the question before you on a point of order, but you ruled against me, on the ground that it is not the place of the President to construe the Constitution. I notice, however, that in a ruling which you, sir, gave a few days ago, you said there was an exception to that view of your duty, namely, when a ruling had to be given connected with the business of the House. As the Constitution lays down a very simple condition precedent to this matter being, dealt with by the Federal Parliament, I submit, with all respect, that it is the duty of the Minister leading the Chamber, and the duty, I think, of the President, to see that that condition is complied with. I do not take the view that, when I raised the point of order, I was asking you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> to construe the Constitution, but that I was asking you to take notice of the fact that the simple and usual conditions precedent to giving us jurisdiction had not been complied with. </para>

                        <para>- -That is so. I was about to point out that South Australia had not agreed as to the route which it is desired the railway shall take, nor has South Australia agreed that a railway is wanted by the State. Through many public men and citizens, South Australia has said that such a railway would detract from the power and influence of Adelaide, and that, therefore, it is not wanted. This is not only a question of constitutional law, but a question of commonsense - a question of doing our business in a proper manner, by obtaining the consent of the State concerned before a shilling is spent on the railway. </para>

                        <para>- South Australia has not consented in any way of which we can take notice. When the present South Australian Government was -a few hours - or a few days - old, the Premier of that State sent a telegram to the Prime- Minister to the effect that the State Government consented to the passing of the present Bill, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> replied in a very fulsome message that he was delighted to receive the assurance. Are we to be put off with such stuff as that? Do we not know that the moment we commence to survey a route through South Australian territory - the moment we send any men, horses, or camels there - we may be proceeded against for trespassing, in spite of the telegram of the State Premier and the extraordinary reply of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> ? </para>

                        <para>- The interjections of Senators Playford and Matheson show me that they would use any argument their ingenuity could suggest' to force this unjustifiable measure through the Federal Parliament. Is it not an argument that I have a right to dwell on, that we ought to commence to do our business in a constitutional manner? Have I not a right to urge that, because the rich State of Western Australia was blocked by the poor State of South Australia bv the latter withholding consent, the idea was conceived of pitchforking the proposal into the Federal Parliament, and using all the influence possible to get it passed? I use those words advisedly, and I say distinctly that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid</inline> have both gone out of their way to get parliamentary representatives to vote for a measure which otherwise they would have voted against. Every device, every art, and every effort has been made to carry the Bill - to get parliamentary representatives to vote for it, notwithstanding what their own opinions or honest convictions may be. I believe that when the proposal was first made there "was an absolute majority of both Houses against it. But when men in high places, who have great influence both politically and privately, use their power in a certain direction, it is not surprising to find that in the end they get what they want, no -matter how unjustifiable that may be. I have said that I desire to make my remarks in a tone which cannot be objected1 to. I should like now to say what I think is the alternative policy - what is the fair Federal and constitutional policy. The two States which are directly and absolutely concerned more than any of the other States should agree between themselves, first of all, that they want a railway. That these two States have not yet done. The two States should then make a searching inquiry into the question of all others which lies at the root of the matter, namely, the question of water supply. This is a Bill to provide ,£20,000 for the survey of 'a route of a railway line, and I undertake to say that it will cost fully £20,000 or more to ascertain whether there is sufficient water to supply the reasonable requirements of the men, horses, and camels which must be employed to carry tools, tents, and other supplies to the spot before a single mile of railway can be surveyed. After that full inquiry, the two States should be able to decide whether the project is feasible for them, or feasible for the Federal Government. Until we have all this information before us it is absolutely futile to talk about a Survey Bill. When the Bill gets into Committee, if ever it does reach that stage, I shall move an amendment to the effect that not one shilling be voted until the two States concerned are satisfied that the survey party, when on the ground, will be supplied with sufficient water to keep life in them. Having proved that a railway is feasible, what should be the next thing for the two States to do ? The two States concerned ought to construct their trunk lines themselves,. J?ut inasmuch as the Federation is indirectly concerned, they ought' then to ask what we are prepared to do in the way of a liberal subsidy for the carriage of the mails. They ought to ask us in what way we are prepared to help them. This should be the course pursued in face of the fact that 8o&gt; or 90 per cent, of the advantages of such a railway would be enjoyed By the two States, as compared with the rest of the Commonwealth.. We could then make some fair, honest, and Federal proposal. The fact of the matter is that these two States are directly concerned in the construction of this line. It will go through South Australia for a distance of 625 miles,, and through Western Australia for a distance of 480 miles. The two States will benefit most enormously from having their territory opened up and rendered available for settlement and inspection as regards minerals, for I understand that some good land is to be found along a part of the route. The States will benefit from the increased settlement which must take place. It is idle to compare the direct advantages which they will get with any indirect advantages which can possibly accrue to the other States. To ask us to treat this proposal as if it were a Federal concern is an act of unfairness which I regret and' deprecate. I find it most difficult to carry out my desire to deal with the question fairly, because my friends from Western Australia, who are so deeply concerned' in this matter, have been unjustly accusing every opponent of it with showing -an un-Federal spirit. I pass by the suggestion of one honorable member in another place, that we were vile and contemptible because we opposed the project,, and fall back upon the oft-repeated statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest, with a sneer, that any man who voted against the proposal was showing an un-Federal spirit. I come to a passage in the speech of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> in which he regretted the fact that its opponents approached the discussion of the project with prejudice. Is it unnatural to suppose that the honorable senator cannot understand that the representatives of the two States concerned are those in whom the prejudice exists? It may be called conscious or unconscious prejudice, but it is idle <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> talk about men who are only indirectly concerned being prejudiced. The opponents of the proposal have a duty to perform to the general taxpayers. We have a right to ask our honorable friends to get rid of their prejudice, to drop this Bill, to search for water and prospect the land, and to submit a reasonable proposal to the Federal Government. Let them take upon their own shoulders the construction of these enormously long trunk lines, and do for' themselves what every other State has done. All the world over the survey of a railway line is regarded as part of the construction. </para>

                    <para>I wish to have an opportunity of saying that I have a very strong objection to the whole of this sub-section, unless it is restricted to railways for defence purposes. Any confusion in connexion with the powers of the Federal Government, and any exceptional powers, would be likely to create great mischief in the future. In this Constitution we have left the control of the railway systems of the States to the States, and this power to construct railways on the part of the Federal Parliament is an entirely new departure from the structure of the Bill, and a most extraordinary one. We have just said that the railway systems of the States shall be kept absolutely free from interference by the Commonwealth, and for good reasons. All these reasons lead me to inquire why, in the next breath, we should give the Federal Parliament, even with the consent of a particular State, the power of undertaking the task of railway extension and construction. For defence and military purposes that is perfectly justifiable. For any other purpose it is absolutely unjustifiable. If we study the history of America, where such powers are so persistently abused, we can see that it might even become a question in the Federal Parliament that would exercise a malign influence upon the public life of the Commonwealth. For instance, take my friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest. No more upright public man exists in the world than <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest ; but if a Federal Government should tempt him with a transcontinental railway to Perth I should tremble for the public virtue. </para>

                    spoke of a time when we might need to have trunk railways, and then
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid</inline>
                    interjected, " In other words, Colonies which have trunk lines will pay for the Colonies which have not " ? Is there anyway of getting round or explaining away those simple words? In Tasmania we are paying an annual loss of £80,000 a year on our 430 miles of railways, whereas in Western Australia the railways, after returning the working expenses and interest, yield a profit of -27 per cent. Yet the people of that State ask us to build their trunk line, to open up their territory,, and to enrich them at the expense of those who have no interest in the project. I now desire to point out that in the Federal Convention of 1891 the great objection to this clause was the system of dual control which it would involve. If this Bill is ever passed, and the railway is ever built, we shall have in existence the very thing which I believe 90 per cent, of those who framed our Constitution dreaded and tried to avoid. Here we shall "have a Federal Government starting off on its own railway ventures, not for the purpose of building a line which will benefit the whole Federation, nor for "defence purposes; but building' 1,100 miles of railway, and creating an enormous Federal Railway Department on the top of all our other expenditure.

                        <para>- I think that Major"General Hutton did what perhaps would have been "done by any bigwig who was asked by his Minister to furnish a report on the subject. His report bears upon the face of it evidence of having been written a little bit to order, when he said that this railway " might " be required for defence purposes, but at the present time we had not an army to transport over it if it were built. Does not <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> see that not once in a century shall we require to transport our troops from this side of the Common wealth to Western Australia?' My honorable friend is a great believer, as I am, in the Naval Forces. I venture to think that, so long as the British Navy is victorious at sea, we shall never require this line for defence purposes; and if the British Navy is not likely to be victorious, and to: retain the command of the se'a, we had certainly better not incur expenditure of this kind. There is nothing from the defence point of view which could possibly justify the expenditure of the seven or eight millions of money which this line must inevitably cost. The Federal Government is being blamed, and to some extent rightly so, for the increase of the "other," or new expenditure. That expenditure will be shown to have increased when <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest brings forward his Budget next week. If we have to go to the English people for three or four million pounds to build a capital in the bush, which no one will require for a generation or two, or to build miles of railway, all I can say is that our credit at home will be seriously damaged. The people at home scrutinize our doings most carefully. </para>

                        <para>- "Home " is Great Britain; that. is what I mean by "home.-' It is my home when I am not in Australia. I think that the people of England who have lent us money - we cannot get on without them; we have already ^230,000,000 of public debt - will" naturally conclude that "it is extravagant on the part of this young Commonwealth to launch out into such enormous expenditure. Some time ago my honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline> Mathe=son, was airing his eloquence in London on this very topic. He told the good folks who were listening to him that the people of Western Australia were very much aggrieved on account of the action of certain members of this Parliament, and of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> in particular. I believe that he gave the unfortunate senator from Tasmania a good dressing down. If I could have bad fifteen minutes to reply to the honorable senator's criticisms I believe I should have done more to settle this Bill than I can do by talking for a long time in this Senate I could have shown the people in London, who are our bankers, that we really cannot afford this railway ; that, though in time to come the Capital and the Transcontinental Railway may be required, they are not necessary now. I. could have shown those unprejudiced men in a very few minutes that this is as grossly unfair a proposal as could possibly be made to this Parliament. I should like to know what our expenditure will be when we have established a Federal Railway Department, and have a general manager, an engineer of lines, construction engineers, and all the rest of the paraphernalia. If the line is built, what is its gauge to be? In the State of South Australia they have 225 miles of railway, with which the transcontinental line will connect,  part' of which is 5 ft. 3 in., and part 3 ft. 6in. Who is going to incur the expenditure involved in an alteration of one of those gauges? I understand that the Parliament of Western Australia says that it is ready to make the gauge on its State lines conform to the gauge of the transcontinental line. I should think they would, if they could get the Federal Government to build the line for them. </para>

                        <para>- After all is said and done, there is a gleam of conscience, a spark of national righteousness, in our Western Australian friends. ' When they found that the railway scheme was not to pass without a little honest and justifiable criticism, they at once said, " We will give you twenty-five miles of territory on each side of the line, to be vested in the Federal Government as a guarantee against loss." When they found that this was not enough they said, " We will give you a guarantee for ten years against any loss that the railway may create." Why should the Western Australian people step out' of their way to give us so' many millions of acres of land and such a guarantee if this is really a Federal matter? They covered up their conscience in asking the Federation to build this line for them, but under the influence of honest criticism they have revealed their conscience again, and have asked us to take this territory and a guarantee against loss. I desire to see the railway constructed some day, but I wish to seek built on fair terms, and if the two States immediately interested will make a proposal based upon community of advantage, and which does not ask people who get little or no advantage to bear the whole of the cost, we may be willing to consider the matter. </para>

                        <para>- I understood that the debate on the subject in the House of Representatives showed that the leaders in Western Australia were prepared to vest land on each side of the line in the Federal Government, and to give a guarantee. I was immensely amused by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest, or <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid,</inline> or some one else, saying in the other House, " When the Bill is passed, of course, we may rely on our friends in Western Australia doing the fair thing." I never read such rubbish as ari argument in favour of a proposal of this sort, in my life. The only way to impart to this proposal even the appearance of fairness, is for a definite guarantee to be given ; and we should abstain from taking any steps in regard to it until some scheme of that sort is laid before us. I find from the- reports with regard to the line, that it will traverse, what is described as some "exceedingly good grass land." I understand that some efforts have been made to settle squatters upon it. But such attempts have all ended in absolute failure. </para>

                        <para>- I have seen it stated* that some flocks of sheep have been driven across. But <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest records that he travelled 400 miles, and found no sign of water whatever. I should like to know from the man who drove the sheep across, how he managed to do it. We should' probably find, if inquiries were made, that while he was there it happened to rain in the place where usually there is not more than six inches of rain per annum. Let me read some of the headings of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest's account of his expedition. He relates that he " found the country destitute of water " ; he found " neither feed nor water, and no chance of a permanent supply " ; " absence of permanent water is a great drawback " ; " water could not be procured by sinking, except at great depths, as the land is 300 feet above the sea " ; "I have not seen a gully or water-course of any description for 400 miles " ; " there 'are no» emus, which are a certain sign of water " ; " there does not seem to be a drop of water." That term, "not a drop of water," seems to have stuck in <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest's mind. When I was dealing with this matter last session, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie interjected with the question, " Has the honorable senator read <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Castella's</inline> report " ? I thought, when he mentioned it, that it was a document which had escaped my notice. </para>

                        <para>- I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Castella</inline> put down bores in the most difficult part of the country for finding water. He says that one bore was put down 430 feet, and they found water good enough for stock and " even fit for human consumption." It seems to have knocked him almost S iii to find that there was water "even fit for human consumption," bearing in mind <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest's evidence, that he did not believe that it would be possible to find permanent water. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Castella</inline> next put down a bore 2,101 feet. It took twelve months to do it, and he found water which was fit for stock only. This is the wonderful evidence which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie asked me to read ! It corroborates all the other evidence, which describes this country as waterless. Any body who describes it as not being a waterless country must be fit for Yarra Bend that is all I can say about him. May I remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> that to put down a bore to a depth of 2,000 feet, and to find no water fit for human consumption is not solving the water problem, which the honorable senator admits is an obligation that devolves on Western Australia? I say that it is the duty of the State to send out another expedition to try to find water, and to prove to us in a reasonable way that there is water enough to keep the survey party supplied. </para>

                        <para>- No, I would not vote for the railway at all, unless my honorable friend could submit a proposal to make the Federal Government and the States concerned, pay for the whole undertaking, including construction and maintenance, in something like a proportion to the advantages received. Is not that Federal ? If I ask, as I do, for an undertaking which will put upon the Federal Government the obligation to pay for any indirect advantages to me, whilst my State and other States concerned pay for the immediate advantages which they get, is not that Federal ? Of course it is, and anything that is opposed to that is un-Federal. The reason why Western Australia is charged with this obligation is that the five engineers' representing the whole of the Railway Departments of the States, except Tasmania, said in their first report that they had not sufficient evidence with regard to water supply, and wanted more bores to be put down, as the whole thing depended upon water. Then this other report was issued. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest, in his anxiety, got the matter pushed forward, and asked the engineers for a second report, and they all regretted that the information about the water supply had not been supplied, and that the test bores and! wells had not been made. They are still without information on this important question, which lies at the very foundation of the whole matter. Therefore I have a right to point out that this Bill is prematurely before us, and that we are not really able to deal with the matter. When these five engineers tell me that 'they want more evidence I have no business to be satisfied, without, at least, such evidence as would be sufficient to satisfy them. </para>

                        <para>- I can understand that the engineers made the best -report they could from the evidence available ; but no one can make any reliable estimate until further evidence is obtained with regard to the water supply. This Bill, on the face of it, "is a farce. I must not call- it a fraud, but I must say that it does not deal fairly with the matter, or with the Senate. From the evidence before us, it is perfectly certain that the great bulk of the £20,000 will have to be spent in ascertaining that there is water sufficient to keep the men, horses, and camels alive before a survey party can be sent out. Will any honorable senator from Western Australia contradict that ? </para>

Instead of £20,000 being spent from the start on the men using the surveying instruments, the whole amount will go in the search for water. </para>

On behalf of my State, I have a right to inquire whether I am being asked to vote for the survey of a railway in country where water can be found, or whether there will have to be added to the estimated cost of the line some £1,200 or £1,500 per mile for water? </para>

                        <para>- I shall look forward with some pleasure to the answer which the Minister will give to the question I asked to-day. It appears to me that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest has done a very wrong thing. We may read in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> of the 7 th of this month some remarks by Mr. John Gwynneth, ' who happens to have been secretary or clerk to the five engineers, on whose report we are asked to place some credence. Two years after the report of the engineers is made, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest gets hold of this secretary or clerk, and from him obtains an opinion, which is published broadcast, that if the ballast and sleepers be reduced, and the Western Australian Government carry the sleepers at a cheap rate, the cost of the line will be  £3.700,000. </para>

We were assured by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> when he introduced this Bill last session, that any honorable senator who voted for it would not be in any way bound to vote for the construction of the railway. That, of course, goes without saying ; but I am perfectly certain that if this Bill becomes law, and if, after the survey, it can be shown that the railway may be constructed for anything near ^5,000,0100, we shall be told that, having voted for the survey, we ought to vote for the Bill. I have here <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest's opinion on that point, expressed when he was. speaking on the Bill in 1903, as reported in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> for 1903, page 6365- </para>

                    <para>I do not consider that we should incur expenditure merely for the sake of making people believe that we are going to do something in this direction unless we really intend to do so. . I am not in favour of making surveys for any proposed railway unless the project is entered upon in a <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> way, and unless those who are prepared to support the necessary expenditure are ready to follow up their action in this respect by supporting the construction of the line. </para>

                    Forrest is in every conceivable way trying to push this Bill through. While it may be evident that those who vote for the Bill are not bound to vote for the construction of the railway,

                    Forrest in those few remarks has a sentence or two which a few years hence he may hurl ar our heads.

                        <para>- When previously speaking on this matter I dealt with a. phase of it which was then said 'to have nothing to 'do with the proposal. But only one reason could possibly justify trunk lines being undertaken at any time by the Federal Government, and that would be the divi - sion of the Customs revenue <inline font-style="italic">p-er capita,</inline> doing away with the bookkeeping system - one purse and a Federation in every sense of the word. But the Premier of Western Australia, when he attended the Conference at Hobart a few months ago, said most distinctly that Western Australia would not: consent to a division of the Customs revenue <inline font-style="italic">per capita,</inline> but that he would not object to the other States adopting that course,, provided an exception was made, and Western Australia allowed to keep its enormous Customs revenue. According to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir JohnForrest,</inline> the Western Australian people,', who, from beginning to end, have been so anxious to keep their large Customs revenue, are quite able to construct this railway for themselves, provided they get the neighbouring State to agree to their proposals. If the people of Western Australia show a provincial spirit, and will not share their Customs revenue, because it is greater than that of the other States, let them build! a railway for themselves, and not ask the poorer States to contribute. </para>

                    <para>- - I may be allowed to compliment <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> on a speech which* is at least remarkable, beginning as it did' in December, 1904, and being brought lo a happy conclusion in August, 1905. Bur, having said that, I feel I cannot felicitate Senator Dobson any further on his remarks. In the course of his speech, which he has taken nine months to deliver, hardly a valid reason has been mentioned why this railway should not be constructed. The honorable and learned senator commenced.' with some legal quibbles as to whether or not there should be a survey - as to whether South Australia had given a legal consent or only a consent. Then the honorable and' learned senator concluded with a statement that there is no water in the territory, and ' : clinched his argument on that point by reading a report which showed there is not only water, but drinkable water, to be obtained along the route. The object of" this Bill is simply to make an investigation,.. on the results of which it may be decided whether this line is advisable or inadvisable from a Federal point of view - whether its -construction is justifiable as a Commonwealth undertaking. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> himself has said that those who vote for this Bill will be in no way bound, either individually or collectively, to vote for the carrying out of the construction work. Honorable senators will recollect that Western Australia was the last State to come into the Federal union, and in that State was waged one of the biggest fights between federalists and non-federalists. It was felt that Western Australia had nothing material to gain from Federation for some years to come, with the exception of an InterState railway. </para>

                        <para>-SMITH. - I do not wish to enter into an altercation. It may be urged by Federal members that the statements and the "promises made by Federal leaders before Federation are not binding upon them. They may urge that they are pledged to their constituents and to no one else. There may be a good deal of truth in that claim, and they may consider that there is no moral obligation upon the Commonwealth to even survey the route of this line as a matter of investigation. But I fail to see how they can escape from some moral responsibility when the recognised leaders of Federation held out the construction of this line as one of the advantages which it would confer upon Western Australia. </para>

It would be unfair to ask them to vote for an investigation of the route and before it is made to pledge themselves in favour of the construction of the line. If, in spite of the belief which was entertained in Western Australia, they refuse to undertake an investigation, they will stultify the leaders in that State who fought for Federation, and by whose act a union was consummated which has been beneficial to the Eastern States, as the imports therefrom to Western Australia testify. </para>

                    SMITH.The special duties, being of an ephemeral nature, have practically ceased to exist. I have always regretted that they were ever imposed; but that provision was inserted in the Constitution at the request of a delegation which was not elected by the people of Western Australia, but which was selected from a Parliament not representative of the people. However, these duties will have ceased to exist by the time this investigation is finished. Honorable senators, I think, ought not to make that a strong reason for voting against the Bill. If they will not even authorize an investigation, their action will create a feeling of bitterness in Western Australia. Those who desire to see federation a success, as I believe we all do, will regret that such a condition has been brought about. Another House has by a very large majority passed this Bill, and thereby expressed a desire that an investigation of the route should be made. Surely that fact ought to influence honorable senators to some extent !

                        <para>- If the popular House desires that this project should be investigated, surely the States' House should not withhold its consent. The true spirit of Federation necessitates sacrifices on the part of individual States in order to obtain something that is for the benefit of the Continent. Continually such cases are submitted to us. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> said he was aware of no case in which a State had tried to get an advantage at the expense of the others. If on these great matters we do not think " continentally," as some one has said, the result will be that, the various States1 will vote for legislation which would primarily benefit themselves. If we. arrive at a stage of provincialism that will necessitate honorable senators voting in such a manner, it will be a sorry day for Australia. It will be a reproach if, when a question is submitted* honorable senators are to ask, " Is this going to benefit my State ?" instead of asking, " Will this be in the. larger interest of the Commonwealth ? " Since Federation Western Australia has made sacrifices by voting for legislation which, I believe, has been beneficial to Australia, but which certainly has been only indirectly beneficial to that State. Take, for instance, the question pf the sugar bounty. It amounted to £60,826 in 1902-3, £90,806 in 1903-4, £121,406 in 1904-5, and the estimate for 1905-6 is £150,000, of which Western Australia bears her <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> share. </para>

                    SMITH.Yes, and I think we had a great object in view when we passed the Immigration Restriction Bill, and when we said we would encourage the growth of sugar during the transition stage. The annual subsidy to Burns, Philp and Company amounts to £8,400, and the annual contribution towards the administration of British New Guinea is £20,000. From all these expenditures Western Australia can only benefit in an indirect manner. It is probable that the expenditure on the Vancouver mail service will be classed as other, or new expenditure. This amounts to £26,626. The naval subsidy amounts to £200,000 a year, and we are told that the navy itself expends in Australia about £300,000 a year. Although we contribute a certain amount towards the Auxiliary Squadron, yet Considerably more is spent in the Commonwealth bv the Squadron. The payment of the naval subsidy, which is borne equally by the people of Australia, simply results in a large advantage being given to Sydney and Hobart. In King George's Sound, Western Australia, we have a harbor which, for naval ships and as a strategic base, is equal to any harbor in the Commonwealth. Although Albany is one of the three strategic bases in Australia., still a vessel of the squadron has never been seen in that port. I hold that a squadron which is subsidized to protect Australia should, at any rate, visit annually the various ports where it can get proper anchorage and ' protection. Roughly .speaking, £800 or £900 a week is spent by the squadron in two ports of the Commonwealth. There is no reason why it should not annually visit the port of Albany, and benefit it to a very considerable extent. It would enable the naval authorities to understand the conditions of that important strategic base.

                    SMITH.While we have a port which entitles us to a considerable share of the expenditure that is disbursed by the squadron, we have never had any of it. That is my point. Now I come to another question: It is proposed by a Bill before another place to grant iron bonuses. That will involve an expenditure of a quarter of a million. I do not suppose that there is any likelihood of Western Australia gaining amy direct benefit from that large expenditure, though she will have to contribute equally with the other States, if the Bill is enacted. If a protective duty follows as a corollary, the result to Western Australia will be a greater expenditure by our metal trades in the purchase of their raw material. I see from this morning's newspapers that it is proposed, and that the Government have under consideration, to grant bounties on agricultural exports. As Western Australia has not reached the stage of an exporting country, except in the matter of gold, bounties on agricultural exports would not benefit her, at any rate for a considerable time to come.

                        <para>- I hope he did not, but he certainly used language which indicated, to my mind, that he thought that we were adopting most improper tactics, in order to foist upon the Commonwealth something distinctly Western Australian. I am proud to think that Western Australian representatives have voted for the various services involving Commonwealth revenue, knowing that their State would receive no advantage. I may add that I do not mention these matters in any possible sense of log-rolling. Neither I nor any of my colleagues has ever discussed with other members of Parliament questions involving expenditure by saying, " We will vote for this if you will vote for something of benefit to us." These subjects have been discussed by Western Australian representatives purely on their merits, and in voting for them we have been actuated by a Federal spirit. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> seemed to labour the point as to whether Western Australia should bear more than her <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> share qf the cost of the construction of this line. We are not now considering the cost of construction. This Bill is one involving an investigation of the probable cost of the undertaking. But when, we have data as to the cost, when we have full information as to the route, and everything that is necessary to create such a service - 4.. Western Australia will be prepared, L believe,' to bear more than her <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> hare of either construction or maintenance. Indeed, we have it on the authority of the ex-Premier of Western Australia hat such would be the case. Writing to the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth in May, 1904, he stated - </para>

If the railway is to be built, it must receive the assistance of the Commonwealth. What that assistance shall be, is a matter to be considered when we know the probable cost. Whether -we give a subsidy, or agree to bear a certain proportion of the cost of the construction of the line, cannot be discussed now. But I say, without fear of contradiction, that there is no example in the history of the world of one State constructing a line across a Continent from its own resources. </para>

                    SMITH.The honorable senator will find that I am right; but even if the amount were $28,000,000, it is more than the whole cost of the construction of the line now under discussion. Then we will turn to the United States. " If honorable senators will look up the Acts of Congress of the 1st July, 1862, the 3rd March, 1874, and other amending Acts, they will find that the money subsidies amounted to $64,000,000 for the great line across the United States; and that land subsidies were granted amounting, to 220,000,000 acres. Further than that, heavy bond subsidies were given. That was a privately-owned railway, but the United States Government recognised it to be a national matter. They recognised that if theirs was to be a true Federation, it was necessary to have that line, even at the cost of the people as a whole. The reasons which actuated the United States and Canada are exactly the same reasons as actuate us in advocating this line. Those reasons were - first, the isolation of the Western, or Californian, and British Columbian States from the Eastern States; secondly, the necessity of having a railway across the Continent in order to complete their national defences ; and, thirdly, that for mail purposes the line was highly advisable. Every reason that we can adduce for this line seems to have been used as a reason for the construction of the great railway across the United States and Canada.

Then, take the Trans-Asian railway through Siberia. That line was not built by the Siberian people, but by the taxpayers of Russia, to secure some great national end. My object in pointing out these examples is this : thai there has been no trans-continental railway that has not been recognised as a great national work, and that has not been either built, or largely subsidized, by the national Government. It may be said that South Australia is connected with Victoria, and that Victoria is connected with Sydney and Brisbane. But the conditions are not analogous. In those cases, the railway lines pass through rich agricultural country, much of it already settled. The lines link up one hamlet with another, and there was almost an immediate return for the money expended. </para>

Until an investigation be made, we have to rely on the estimates given by competent engineers, who have been paid to report, and who show that 'the different estimates coincide to a remarkable degree. The late Chief Engineer of Western Australia, a man who was justly held to be the highest authority on the subject, stated that the cost would be £4,400,boo </para>

                        <para>- Not that I am aware of. The chief engineers of the Railway Departments of the various States made an exhaustive report on the subject. It is true they did not travel over the route, but they went to Port Augusta, and there collected all the data possible, obtaining the testimony of an engineer who had been over the route. They then went to the other terminus at Kalgoorlie; and, in spite of the quidnuncs in this Chamber, who have estimated the cost from £8,000,000 to something like £6,000,000, I say that those engineers represent the highest authority we have up to the present time. </para>

                        <para>- We will not quarrel about £ per cent. I should now like to speak of the advantage that would accrue from the construction of this . railway. In the first place, it would mean the acceleration of the mail service by two and a half days, or sixty hours. At the present time we are paying a subsidy of £120,000 per year for the carriage of our mails by the Oriental boats, and statements have been made by Ministers that those mails could have been carried at poundage rates at £40,000 a year. We are therefore paying £80,000 a year in order to have a more regular service, which is accelerated by one day. It is a question, however, whether the service is accelerated, because unsubsidized boats of other nations do the voyage just as quickly. Would it not be better to subsidize the Australian section of the mail route by £68,000 a year, which would mean a service accelerated by two and a half days, or a saving of five days in the answering of a letter from Europe or the United Kingdom, instead of paying £80,000 a year to accelerate the service by . one day ? The Panama Canal . has been mentioned, but the route would be very little shorter by that canal than by. the Suez Canal ; it would certainly be no shorter for. South </para>

                        <para>-If we went back to poundage rates between Fremantle and Europe, and had a transcontinental railway, we would have a better and less expensive service. To use a protectionist argument, I do not see why we should not spend the money in the country, and subsidize Australians, instead of a shipping company which belongs to one of the greatest rings in the world. Surely some of this £68,000 could be debited to the increased mail service. I have already stated that some of it may be debited to the Treasury of Western Australia. Then we come to the question of military defence <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson,</inline> I am sure not intentionally, made some misstatements with regard to Major-General Hutton's remarks. The honorable and learned senator inferred that Major-General Hutton was not' in favour of the transcontinental railway from a military point of view. But Major-General Hutton in that speech was urging that it was useless to have a railway to Western Australia unless we had arms for the men who are to defend the country. An analogous argument would be that it is useless to have soldiers unless they have arms; but, in expressing that opinion, one does not say that soldiers are useless. Major-General Hutton was not saying that the railway line was useless, but that it was useless unless we had properly armed troops, and I shall read an extract from his remarks which will put the matter on quite a different basis - </para>

                    <para>No general defence of Australia can be undertaken unless its distant parts are connected with the more populous Colonies in the south and east of the Continent. If an enemy were established in Western Australia you would be powerless to act against him. . . . The interest of the whole Continent, therefore, demand that railway to connect Western Australia with other Colonies should be made as soon as possible. </para>

                        <para>- When I was at Port Pirie, there were men carting ore over 100 miles, right into Port Augusta, and making a profit. We have the right to assume that if this railway passed through Mount Gunsen copper-field a payable industry would be established there. Then 200 miles further on we come to the Tarcoola gold-field, which is being worked, and in which the Government of South Australia is working a mine at a profit. That is the centre of an auriferous tract of country extending over a distance of 100 miles. At the present time it is 300 miles distant from the nearest railway. Any honorable senator who is conversant with the conditions of gold mining knows that no field which is 300 miles distant from railway or water communication can have a fair chance. The prospects and the assays of the ore at Tarcoola would justify us in believing that it would be a payable field if it had railway communication, and would employ a large number of men. When we cross the South Australian border we come to a stretch of country which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Muir</inline> states is some of the finest pastoral country he has seen in Australia. He went across this country for a distance of 250 miles. He saw 3,000,000 acres, and he estimates the total area at 10,000,000 acres. When <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest came across from Perth to South Australia about thirty-six years ago, he passed through that very country. He reported then the magnificent pastoral country which he had gone through, although there was no surface water ; and you, sir, who I believe met the explorer on that occasion, can bear me out in that assertion. Therefore, the country which he passed through" is not of that arid nature which would justify any one in calling it a desert. The rest of that country in Western Australia is salmon gum country. Much of it is auriferous land, which, if provided with proper communication, might become mining fields. We can estimate very roughly what the profit from the traffic 'on the line would be, even assuming that it would pass through an absolute desert. It is undeniable that live stock, such as cattle and sheep, could be sent from Port Augusta to the gold-fields - to the great consuming market - much more cheaply by a direct railway than by sea to Fremantle and thence by rail to Kalgoorlie, a distance of 370 miles. </para>

                        <para>- Any estimate is based on an " if," and we ask for a proper survey to be made so that definite information can be obtained. We are discussing this project in the light of the report of the highest tribunal we have been able to get so far. The cost of sending cattle by rail from Port Augusta to .Kalgoorlie is estimated at ^,3 4s. 6d. per head; the freight by sea to Fremantle is £4 per head; and the freight by' rail from Fremantle to Kalgoorlie is £1 3s. 6d. per head. So that the trucking of cattle to the gold-fields, with a population of about 80,000 persons, would cost about £3 4s. 6d. per head, and the cost of sending them by sea and rail, as at present, is £5 3s. 6d. per head. If the cattle I have mentioned were sent bv the proposed railway, that in itself would create a very large revenue. Since Port Augusta would be thirty hours distant by rail from the goldfields, the people of South Australia could supply immense quantities of butter, eggs, fruit, and vegetables. It would open up a magnificent market for that State. </para>

                    SMITH.We do not advocate a policy of monopoly. If the people of South Australia can compete with the growers of these commodities in the south-west of Western Australia, by all means let them do it. The carriage from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie would be less by direct railway than by sea to 'Fremantle and thence by railway to Kalgoorlie. The passengers who travel to and from Western Australia average 1,000 per week each way. A second-class railway ticket from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie is estimated
                    <inline font-style="italic">to</inline>
                    cost £3 8s., while a second-class ticket by rail and sea costs £4 19s. 10s. Most of the persons who land in Western Australia go to the gold-fields. Many persons travel bv rail in preference to going by boat, even if it costs more, because, perhaps", they are not good sailors or because time is an important factor with them. The construction of this "line would provide an absolutely cheaper route than the present one by sea and rail to the goldfields. I do not think I should exaggerate if I said that two-thirds of the people who go to and from Western Australia would travel by this railway, seeing that they could travel more cheaply and quickly than they could do by boat and rail. But if that is an over-estimate, we can add the large number of passengers who go to and from Europe, and some of whom would travel by railway to and from Fremantle. If two-thirds of these passengers were to travel by the railway, assuming that 1,000 passengers travel each way per week, that would bring in a revenue of £100,000 a year.

                    SMITH.Honorable senators are making a great point of the fact that there is no water on the route of this line. We know that the country has a fair rainfall, because splendid grass has been found on a great portion of the route. The ground is porous, and, therefore, the water sinks in. A boring plant was sent over to put down a bore at a place called Madura,_ and the water is sub-artesian. It rises to a certain height, is easily pumped, and is not only good for stock, but suitable for human consumption. Going on to one of the routes of the pro- posed line, the party struck good' stock water. That being the case, 1 think
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline>
                    will admit that it can be called artesian or sub-artesian country.

                        <para>- I regret that I have taken up so much time in discussing this question. I assume that all honorable senators have a perfectly open mind, and, holding that belief, I desire to put the case plainly before them. I hope I have said nothing which is offensive to any one, and I trust that I have not exaggerated. We ask honorable senators to recognise that Federation, if carried out in a proper spirit, must mean sacrifices by the various States in order to carry out national works. We ask honorable senators to say whether this is a national work, and, if so, to sanction an investigation, at a cost of £20,000, to be expended in two years, which they can do without committing either the Senate or themselves individually to the construction of the line. We have pointed out that Western Australia has received no material benefit from Federation, and that the only material benefit it can hope for is from the construction of this railway. If it be proved that its construction was not justified from the national point of view, let it not be built.' After investigation was made negotiations could bc entered into as to what proportion Western Australia was prepared to pay above her ordinary <inline font-style="italic">-per capita</inline> contribution. We could then consider whether the construction of the line was justifiable from the Federal point of view, and if so, what amount we should be willing to pay, or what subsidy we should be prepared to give in order to secure its construction. When the inquiry was completed, we believe that an overwhelming case would be made out in favour of the project. If it should be found that it was premature to construct the line - and that is the only argument used by honorable senators - then that sum of £20,000 .would not have been wasted, because the survey would remain ; and the railway will be constructed, either now or later on, as surely as the sun will rise to-morrow morning. There  would  be no waste of public money. Perhaps there .would be no immediate return from the expenditure.  But for Federal reasons, we. ask that an investigation should be made.  If  as a result of the investigation it could be said that this was not a national work, or if difficulties should be discovered which rendered its construction inadvisable, then let it not be built. </para>

                    <para>- I do not propose to occupy the attention of the Senate very long, because, unfortunately, I am suffering from influenza, and I am physically incapable of doing justice to so great a subject. I wish to compliment <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> upon his very able exposition of this project. He certainly put the case as in offensively as he possibly could to those who are opposed to the Bill, and I think his speech must commend itself to its supporters as being a most capable one. I am sorry that I cannot agree with those representatives of Western Australia who are so anxious to see the Bill, passed. It is not pleasant at any time to have to differ with honorable senators with whom one is in daily,- perhaps hourly, friendly intercourse. I hope that in anything I have to say I shall not be offensive to any one, and that I shall" not say anything which may create a feeling of soreness on the part of the friends of the Bill. For various reasons I am not in favour of the Bill being passed at the present time. The main reasons which animate my opposition to the measure are not concerned with the merits or demerits of the line. At present I shall only refer casually to the .merits of the project. In the first place, we are told that, if constructed, it would be of enormous benefit to Western Australia. I take leave to differ from that view. I believe that it would not be of enormous benefit to the whole people of that State. I admit that it would be of enormous benefit almost immediately to a portion of its people, but as to being of ser- ^ vice to its whole people, that is a pro position which I absolutely deny, because we have the experience of Australia to guide us. We know that railway carriage, as regards either passengers or goods, cannot compete with water carriage. Although in going through the eastern States we find a perfect line of railway communication, duplicated in some places between several capitals, still the great bulk o"f the passenger traffic between the States is done by steamers. We also know that the great bulk- of the carrying trade in goods is done by steamers, notwithstanding the existence of these railways. In view of these facts, is it reasonable to expect that an entirely new condition of things would spring up when this_ transcontinental railway was built, as regards the carriage of goods and passengers between the east and the west? It is not reasonable to expect that it would happen. There is one thing which the advocates of this line entirely overlook. If the Government of Western Australia really desire to build a railway which would be of immediate and lasting benefit to its people, which would cheapen the cost of living and enhance the means of communication with the eastern States, there is a very easy way to do it. If a line were built from the gold-fields to Esperance Bay it would shorten the distance to the coast by 120 miles, and would bring Western Australia nearer to the eastern States by two days' steaming. That fact is undeniable. I was over in Western Australia a little while ago- I have to thank the people and the Government of that State for an exceedingly interesting and instructive trip into its territories - and while there I talked to many old 'friends, mates of mine on the gold-fields of Queensland, about this and other matters. They are people who are thoroughly in touch with Western Australian affairs. It must be remembered that the gold-fields of Western Australia practically represent the whole State. Fully one-half of the population of Western Australia reside there, and a very large proportion of the inhabitants of the' remainder of the State draw their sustenance from the gold-fields. Take the gold-fields away, and what would be the population of the coast towns? It would immensely cheapen the cost of living to the people of the gold-fields if a railway were built to Esperance. Why is not that railway built? It is only a small task for 0 the people of Western Australia to undertake. Other States have undertaken enormously greater works than that in the way of railway construction. That line would be of immediate and lasting service to Western </para>

                <para> Australia. It would be a paying line, and not one such as that which 'is now contemplated, which would be too long, too costly, too expensive to work, and too difficult to be used with economy and benefit to the people. I hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie behind me say that a man who has been five minutes in Western Australia is apparently able to speak with greater authority on its affairs than those who have lived there for years. I do not think that he has been in Western Australia very long, and I may state that I derived my information from people who have lived there many more years than he has done. </para>

If the Esperance line were built instead of being a drag on the people of Western Australia as the proposed line would be - because they would have to pay a very large proportion of its: cost - they would have a railway which would serve every purpose which they have in view. What advantage would be derived from this transcontinental railway ? It would only achieve two great objects. First, it would enormously enhance the value of freehold land owned by people in Fremantle and Perth. The second object is the glorification of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest. I maintain that it would be a crime to expend so large a sum of money for the mere purpose of increasing the value of property in Perth and Fremantle. </para>

                            Forrest acted very cleverly when he originated the idea. At that time there was an agitation for the separation of the gold-fields from the remainder of the State of Western Australia unless they got a railway to Esperance.

I have 110 intention to vote a large sum of money for the glorification of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest. Why was it that the people of Perth and Fremantle secured the calling of the mail steamers there instead of at the beautiful port of Albany? The influence of the property-owners of those towns has practically killed that port. Now the mail steamers pass it by, and have lengthened the time that it takes to bring the mails to the eastern States by so doing. The same policy is being pursued in the agitation for the transcontinental railway. The object is to put money into the pockets of the property owners of Perth and Fremantle. </para>

                        <para>- I am pleased to hear it, because when that line is built it will entirely remove the necessity for the construction of this line. The proposed transcontinental line would be absolutely useless if the Esperance railway were constructed, because we could not have a hope of competing for passenger and freight traffic of any kind with that railway. We hear a great deal about the Federal spirit. A Federal spirit which wants a material advantage for itself does not commend itself to my mind. We heard much when we were in Western Australia about there being no Federation unless the west is linked with the east by bands of steel. I suppose that if the railway were built, and if by any accident a' pair of fish plates were missing, the Federal spirit would be destroyed ! If that is the way to build up a nation, I do not think much of the spirit of federalism that is animating the people of these States. But I have a much better opinion of the Western Australian people than to believe anything of the kind of them. I believe that they are just as much concerned for the building up of an Australian nation as are the people of the eastern States. Certainly, if my assistance is to be given to this project, .it will have to be secured by the adducing of more logical reasons than I have heard up to the present. </para>

                        <para>- It is. all part and parcel of the same policy. We are told that Western Australia has reserved 25 miles of land on each side of the proposed route until the line is built. But that is no guarantee so far as the Commonwealth is concerned. Western Australia has reserved that land for her own use and benefit, and if there is any unearned increment accruing in consequence of the building of the line the value will' be pocketed by Western Australia, and not By the Commonwealth. But the great question that should influence our minds is whether the line, if built, would pay. </para>

                        <para>- We have the best proof possible with regard to' the possibility of the line paving in the fact that we already have a line of railway running continuously through four States. It traverses the four principal cities of" Australia, and runs without interruption through the' finest land in the. continent, and through om busiest towns, apart from the four capitals. When that line does not pay, is it to be supposed that a'line running through what is at the very best comparatively poor country can possibly pay? </para>

Now, what is the character of the country in question ? We have heard statements from both sides. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> has put his views before the Senate, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> has made copious quotations from all the reports available. There is no necessity to go into those reports at all. All that we have to do is to consider the absolute fact that this line will never be more than 150 miles from the coast, and in many places not sixty miles from the coast; that the climate is the most temperate in Australia, and yet the land is absolutely uninhabited^ </para>

                        <para>- At other places it is not more than 40 miles distant. What is the reason why all the rest of the territory of Australia even reaching up to the tropics is inhabited whilst this stretch of country is absolutely without population.? If land is worth a straw it is occupied. There is land in the far north of Australia, in the tropics, that has been occupied forty years. Right round Australia, even in the north-west, where the climate is far more uncongenial than it is along the route of this line there are settlements! That fact is conclusive as to the character of the country in question. </para>

                        <para>- This is the only part of Australia that is favorably situated as to climate that is not occupied. That fact . speaks volumes for the character of the country, showing that it is very poor indeed, and that the possibility of railway traffic being developed is extremely remote. Another consideration is that the most arid portions of Australia have not deterred prospectors. Kalgoorlie and some of the other great gold-mining centres are' situated in the midst of arid country. Is it reasonable to suppose that if there were not greater disadvantages in the country to be traversed by this line than there are in any other portions of Australia, the land would be prospected? If there were any prospects of fair encouragement, it would' be traversed from end to end. But there is no reasonable ground for expecting that any great developments in gold-mining or in any other industry would result from building a railway through it. Another great objection which I have to the building of the line is that it would immediately usher us into an enormous borrowing policy. If the country agrees to build' the line it means borrowing £5,000,000.. I do not suppose that anybody, at this time,, proposes that the £5,000,000 should be provided out of revenue. But £5,000,000- will not be all that we shall have to bor- ' row, because it must -be remembered that there are other transcontinental' lines on whose behalf our consideration will be claimed. Supposing that we built this transcontinental line with a view to defence, there is another large portion of the continent which is much more helpless in this respect than is Western Australia, and to which it is even more necessary to build a railway with that object in our mind. I refer to the Northern Territory, which is much nearer to the East, where many people look for the enemies of Australia. The Northern Territory is a large empty country, which forms a tempting bait for the invader. If we desire to maintain Australia intact, and defence railways are necessary, surely the claims of the Northern Territory are equally strong, if not stronger, than those of Western Australia. </para>

                        <para>- It is an open question whether the Northern Territory is less valuable than Western Australia. In the latter State there is a considerable population, who would almost be able themselves to repel any invading force, whereas, as I have said, the Northern Territory is unoccupied, and, therefore, more attractive to an invader. If, following on the transcontinental railway to Western Australia, a line is built to Port Darwin, the other States of the Commonwealth will certainly put in a claim to have their railway systems connected with the great trunk lines, and possibly Queensland will desire to have direct communication with the Western State. Every State will have a good claim if we once initiate such a policy, and we should be launched on a borrowing scheme of£30,000,000 right away. As a member of the party which has, so far, set its face against public borrowing by the Commonwealth, the possibilities I , have mentioned are, to me, a very strong argument against the construction of the proposed line. </para>

If the object of building this railway is the defence of the country, the money could be applied to much better purpose. The sum of£5,000,000 would provide a swarm of torpedo boats, which would be a much better means of defence than any transcontinental railway. </para>

                        <para>- It would be quite easy for an invading force to go into an uninhabited part of the country and cut the railway communication. As to the carriage of mails, we expect the Panama Canal to be constructed in a very short time, when the mail route will be entirely diverted. The Panama Canal will provide a quicker means of communication than we have at the present time, and, therefore, the argument as to the acceleration of the mails by means of a railway does not seem to carry, much weight. It is quite possible, indeed, that the Panama Canal may be ready almost as soon as the railway would. </para>

My contention is that we have no right to build this railway, and therefore have no right to incur the proposed expense. </para>

                        <para>- The Commonwealth has to incur all the responsibility and expenditure, and South Australia may insist on the line running right up to the centre of the country before it turns to the west. It has been very seriously proposed in South Australia, that the line should go as far up as Tarcoola, in order to serve the interests of that State. This Bill is to authorize the expenditure of £20,000 only, but does any honorable senator, who has any experience of the cost of railways in other States, really suppose that a permanent survey will cost no more? It is nonsensical to maintain that such a survey can be made for £18 per mile, when we know that in favorable country the average cost is over , £20. Without making any allowance for the character of the country through which it is proposed to build this railway, a permanent survey, on the basis of the cost of surveys in other States, will cost, at least, , £60,000. </para>

Of course, if the honorable senator means that a flying survey consists in a man riding over the country, it is a different matter.

                        <para>- That does not matter, because the cost is there, and the interest has to be paid. If we vote for the Bill with this preamble, we must vote for the construction of the line, and we shall certainly not be justified in constructing a railway in the absence of the consent of South Australia. South Australia consents <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> a survey only on condition that that State is consulted in regard to the route. </para>

                        <para>- I do not care what was said to private members; what we have to regard is what is contained in official communications. In order to meet the difficulty to which I have directed attention, I have given notice of an amendment, because I did not wish to take any honorable senators by surprise. Under the Constitution, we have no right to build a railway, and therefore we are not justified in incurring so large an expenditure as £60,000 until we have the formal consent of South Australia to the carrying out of the work. If we had that consent it might have the effect of altering my attitude towards the Bill. But no honorable senator is justified in playing ducks and drakes with the taxpayers' money in the way proposed in the Bill. I move - </para>
