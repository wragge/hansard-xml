                        <para>- The honorable and learned senator is right, as far as that aspect is concerned, but is the application of the standing order to be extended to matters of a personal nature which have no reference to any debate in the Senate, or any matter which took place in the Senate. I do not think it ought to be so extended. Of course, the Senate is the ultimate judge in these matters. Perhaps I have not yet heard the honorable and learned senator sufficiently to give an opinion.. </para>

                        <para>- I do not wish to enter into a discussion as to the intention of this standing order, which is safeguarded by the phrase, " By the 'indulgence of the Senate." I think that the Senate would be slow to withhold that indulgence from any honorable senator who in relation to any matter of business personal to himself feels it to . be due to the Chamber and to himself that there should be an explanation in so far as it concerns public business. The subject-matter of my personal explanation is the Judiciary Bill, and the circumstances of my absence at the period when the incident to which I shall allude occured. I am quite sure that the Senate will feel that it is due to me and to the Senate itself that there should be an explanation from any honorable senator who brings forward business, and whose duty it is to take care to see that it is dealt with in the ordinary way. A fortnight previous to last Thursday the debate on the second reading of the Judiciary Bill was adjourned on the motion of the Honorary Minister, who, of course, was entitled to resume the debate. On Thursday last I was very unexpectedly, and, apparently, unfortunately called away. I was called away literally in the middle of the debate in relation to the proceedings of the previous evening, and a debate which was occupying the very animated attention of many honorable senators. That being the position, I, as is not unusual, I think, had recourse to the good offices of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> with reference to my Bill, on which I know that, as to some points, there may be controversy, and in which I take a- deep personal interest, because it proposed to make changes in our judiciary system, which I, although others might differ from me, believe ought to be made. I availed myself of the good offices of my honorable friend to arrange for the postponement of the Order of the Day. I knew that the Ministry, through the Honorary Minister, were desirous and entitled to lay before the Senate their views on these important matters which- I had opened. I had' been informed that several honorable senators on this side intended to debate the second reading of the Bill. I also knew that there stood before the measure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens'</inline> very important motion in regard to the sugar monopoly, and I was under the impression, rightly, as the facts have shown, that the debate on that subject would occupy a very considerable time. </para>

Feeling that it would be impossible to conclude the debate, on the Judiciary Bill that afternoon, however long or short <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens'</inline> motion might be under discussion, I suggested to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> that it might be wise to postpone the Order of the Day on the rearrangement of the business on the notice-paper. He tells me he communicated with the Honorary Minister, who refused to assent. I do not take exception to that refusal, because he was entitled to continue the debate if he thought that an opportunity would be available for that purpose during that afternoon, </para>

By request, as I understand, he discontinued his speech, and asked leave to resume it on another occasion. To that course I take no exception. It was done im order to enable the amendments made by the House of Representatives in the Life Assurance Companies Bill to be taken into consideration. But what I venture to say is, that any honorable senator was entitled to expect that in the rearrangement of business- </para>

                        <para>- Surely I have a. right to state them. The Senate knows many facts that an honorable senator may mention in the course of a debate. What I desire to say is, that in the rearrangement of business it might have been expected, in accordance with the usual practice of the Senate, that care would be taken not to disarrange other business. In saying that, I am merely making a statement to which every other honorable senator will assent, and am not reflecting upon any one in particular. I am entitled, I think, to say how it is that the Bill to which I referred! was discharged from the notice-paper in the absence of any one being in charge of it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> was out of the chamber at the time. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford,</inline> who was prepared to move the adjournment of the debate, was, unfortunately, not in the chamber at the moment. </para>

The effect has been that my speech only has been left on record in, <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> in relation, to the Bill, and no other honorable senator has had an opportunity to address himself l:o the subject.

I can always expect that treatment from the Senate. Therefore it is due that I should say that I have considered whether I should, as I am entitled to do, move that the second reading, of the Bill be taken at a later date. But having regard to the period of the session, I feel that it would not be treating honorable senators as I should expect them to treat me if I were to bring on the Bill again in a fortnight or three weeks in its initial second -reading stage. Therefore, I can only offer this consolation to my honorable friends. - whether they are with or against me is a matter of indifference - that I propose to take the earliest opportunity next session to re-introduce the Bill, so that honorable senators will be able to debate it to the fullest possible extent. I assure honorable senators that the delay occasioned by the unfortunate events which I have described was unexpected so far as I was concerned. It surprised me exceedingly when I saw it in the newspapers on Friday morning. But it is not likely to affect the full consideration of the measure which, as I have said, will be re-introduced next session. The delay itself is not in any way vital, but I regret the circumstances under which it was brought about, which may or may <inline font-style="italic">nol</inline> - I express no opinion on the subject - inflict an injury upon the ordinary courtesies of the Senate which may be irreparable. </para>

I naturally assumed that some one was in charge of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon's</inline> Bill, and that it would be called on and the debate adjourned. I asked <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane</inline> to request the Senate to grant leave for him to continue his speech on another day, in order to enable me to have the Life Assurance Companies Bill passed into law. But I had no intention whatever to bring about the termination of the debate on <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon's</inline> Bill. </para>

                    </talker>
                    <para>- In debating the Appropriation Bill, I desire to place in the forefront the subject of Customs administration. Honorable senators must be more or less aware that there is something very like an attempt to throw discredit on commerce, be- cause of certain small occurrences, and that, almost of a certainty, there is at the back of all this some political intention. I desire, therefore, to cite a few facts in regard to the general position of our commerce, and the alleged undervaluation of goods. A week ago I asked in the Senate for a return showing the total importation of goods subject to <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duties for the last four years, and the total amount in regard to which charges of under-valuation or fraud had been made. I was then told that a return would be presented, but that its preparation would take some time. A few days afterwards I communicated with the Comptroller-General of Customs by telephone, and was informed that the return was not ready, and that I could not be supplied even with the approximate figures. Under the circumstances, I put myself to considerable trouble, with the result that I have here Figures showing that the total imports of goods subject to <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duties in 1904 amounted in value to £17,000,000. I am not aware whether the. imports last year were over or under the average for the period in regard to which I desired information, but I am content to take £60,000,000, or an average of £1 5,000,000 a year, as representing the total imports for four years. And I think I am well within the mark when I say that the total value of goods of which under- valuations have been made, or in connexion with which charges of fraud have been alleged, db not exceed ,£500,000 within that period. According to the figures which I have prepared, in every £1,000,000 worth of goods subject to <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duties imported -into Australia in that period, £991,670 worth were admittedly correctly valued, leaving a balance of only some £8,000 odd in regard to which allegations of un'der-valuation or fraud were made. These figures put a very different complexion on the position of our commerce and the honesty of our merchants from that which' is sought to be as? on them by persons who seek to discredit the latter. Then, again, a large quantity of our imports is subject to specific duties, and, taking these together with the imports subject to <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duties. I estimate that the total, in the period I have mentioned, represents about £100,000,000. Thus, allowing for £500,000 worth in regard to which allegations of fraud were made, we find that in every £1,000,000 worth of imports, no less than £995,000 worth has been correctly passed at the Customs, and only £5,000 worth more or less inaccurately valued. </para>

                        <para>- As the honorable senator says, there is not always an intentional wrong ; and I think that the position disclosed by the figures I have quoted is very satisfactory. It may be said that there is a large amount of undervaluation of which no notice can be taken, because it is not always discovered; but to that I have a very simple answer. <inline font-style="italic">Mulhall's Dictionary of Statistics,</inline> and other authorities, give the imports and exports of the whole world; and, from page 660 of the work just mentioned, I find that in the year 1896 the value of the world's imports exceeded the world's exports by £256,000,000, notwithstanding the fact that a large quantity of goods are lost at sea, and, of course, do not arrive to be included in the returns. Imports are naturally more valuable than exports, because the former include freight; and we find throughout the world that the value on arrival is immensely higher than that on departure. That indicates at once that the margin of possible error or fraud is very small. </para>

                        <para>- On page 129 of the same work, it is shown that in twenty-six years the world's imports were valued at £3,367,000,000 in excess of the world's exports, or an average of £120,000,000 or £I3°;000&gt;°°o worth every year. That, again, I suggest, indicates the untruth of the inference that there is any general under-valuation, or attempt to defraud the Customs. I may point out that there is a great difficulty in the way of the perpetration of such frauds. The bulk of our import business is in the hands of large firms ; under such circumstances, the invoices pass through many hands, the knowledge of value is shared by many people, and it would not be safe, even if the principals desired, to seriously attempt to defraud the public. On this point, I should like to quote some remarks made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> when we were discussing the Commerce Bill. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> on that occasion said - </para>

                    <para>Taking a broad view of all the information obtained, whether verbal or written, we are at once struck by a very real distinction between large and small traders, or between principals and their subordinate agents. This distinction of course is by no means absolute. But, speaking generally, the men who transact business to a fairly large extent, or who enjoy a practical monopoly as owning a well established trade with an assured amount of custom, are more or less distinguishable from those who occupy various positions in the descending scale. Obviously, the former would be less likely to be tempted to indulge in tricks of trade or to condescend to petty meannesses. </para>

The subject-matter of this Bill includes the schedule which opens up a discussion on any item of expenditure mentioned therein. I was looking over the questions on the business-paper, and was not listening closely to the honorable senator's remarks, but, generally speaking, the honorable senator must not go beyond the Bill at this stage.

                        <para>- I am strictly doing so. I am now debating points which I have brought forward before on similar occasions. It will be obvious to every; honorable senator that the simple statement which I have made, that the amount of fraud or under-valuation of goods that takes place in the Commonwealth is of a very negligible quantity, is proved beyond! question. The Minister who has charge of this Department of Trade and Customs should be very careful how he makes use of any small matter to cast a slur on the commerce of Australia. I think I shall be in order in referring to the action taken by the Minister in regard to the importation of harvesters. I do not know that steps have ever been taken in any Department which are more calculated to bring discredit on the community than those which have been taken by the Minister of Trade and Customs in connexion with the harvester industry. I have before me the minutes of evidence taken before the Tariff Commission, and I find that something like 2,000 questions were put to gentlemen interested in the manufacture of harvesters in Australia. It has been repeatedly and openly stated that the Massey-Harris Company are still awaiting an opportunity to refute the statements made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> and other persons who have attended before the Tariff Commission. So far, they have been afforded no such opportunity. In these circumstances, one would naturally have thought that the Minister of Trade and Customs would have held his hand. Not only has the honorable gentleman not held his hand, but he has taken steps by which the valuation of imported harvesters has been arbitrarily and extraordinarily raised. The Massey-Harris Company have had to pay a very large sum of money to the Customs Department as a result of the action taken by the Minister. They have paid this money under protest, and are now proceeding against the Minister for a refund of the amount which they claim to have paid in excess. Notwithstanding these facts, we have an agitation of the keenest character, and warmly supported by the Minister of Trade and Customs, for the introduction of abrupt and arbitrary legislation, to affect the valuation of imported harvesters before the firm in question, or. other firms similarly interested, have had an opportunity to state their case to the Tariff Commission, and before the case to which I have referred has been decided by the High Court of Australia. If any steps can discredit a public department, surely they would be such as those I have indicated. In a considerable number of cases of disputed valuations of goods the difficulty has arisen in respect of what are known as proprietary goods, which cannot be bought in the open market, which are the property of separate firms, and therefore represent values which may be varied in different countries and to different people. Consequently there is in the case of such goods the greatest possible room for differences of opinion as to what their true value is. It is a lamentable thing in the circumstances that a Minister of Trade and Customs can be found ready to make use of a difference of opinion in respect of the valuation of such goods on which to found a charge of fraud. I suggest that it would be well if members of Parliament and Ministers also understood a little more than they evidently do of the position of the merchants of Australia. The merchants of Australia regularly advance to the Commonwealth millions of our revenue. The amount is no doubt ultimately paid by the consumers, but the merchants advance the money on importation. I suppose that the majority of imported goods are not consumed for at least four months after they arrive. That means that about one-third of the Customs and Excise revenue of the year is advanced to the Commonwealth by the merchants of Australia. It is probable that not less than £3,000,000 is always under advance to the Commonwealth in this way by the merchants of Australia. This fact should be borne in mind;, and the people who advance this money might well be treated a little more handsomely than they are. Another reason why our merchants should be better treated is that they are really only completing the work of the producers of Australia. It is of very little use for any set of men to produce goods and have them exported if the value for them cannot be imported. It is only when importers bring in goods which the exported goods are sold for that it can be said that the producers reap their reward. For that reason also' I hold that there might be a little more thought given to the importers. I also think that the Minister of Trade and Customs should give the very closest attention to the outcry which his action in regard to imported harvesters has raised in Canada. There seems to be no doubt that his action in fixing an arbitrary valuation on . the imported harvesters has resulted in diverting a considerable amount of the freight ordinarily carried by the Canadian line of steamers through the United States instead of through' Canada. I have here a letter, which was published in&gt; the Sydney newspapers by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ross,</inline> the Canadian Commercial Agent for Victoria and1 other States. He says - </para>
                    </talk.start>
                </continue><para>The Vancouver mail, which arrived here on the 10th instant, brought forward official letters from the Canadian Department of Trade and Commerce relative to the decision of the Commonwealth Customs, whereby the cost of railway transportation from the manufacturing centres of Ontario and Quebec, has to be added to the value of goods shipped at Vancouver to Australia. When the letters were written - August 31st - the matter was under departmental consideration, and I can therefore express no opinion in regard to the news cabled from London on the 7th' instant, as in any way reflecting the opinion of the Canadian Government. </para><para>The enforcement of the decision of the Australian Customs upon shipments made at Vancouver will result in a practical cessation of imports of Canadian goods from that port, to the injury of the freight-earning power of the subsidized " All Red Route," and further it will be of considerable benefit to the rival San Francisco steamers. </para><para class="block">Not long since, the Senate voted a subsidy to the Vancouver line, and it is very strange that we should be voting money to support that line, and should at the same time permit the Minister of Trade and Customs, by means of a simple regulation, to make an arrangement which results in that line losing a large amount of its freight. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ross</inline> goes on to say - </para><para>The manufacturing districts of Canada are nearly 3,000 miles distant from the Pacific Coast, and the railway transportation from, say, Montreal to Vancouver, is, on account of the long haul, quite a serious item in making up the amount of the f.o.b. value of goods shipped to Australia. </para><para class="block">T do not propose to read any more of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ross's</inline> lengthy letter. Honorable senators will see the point made. The Minister has issued a regulation which requires that the valuation of agricultural implements shipped to Australia shall be taken at the port of shipment, Vancouver, instead of at the market of manufacture, as originally arranged. This means that the amount paid in railway freight from the place of manufacture to the port of shipment must now be added to the value of the goods, and, consequently, increases the sum payable as duty at this end. This increase of cost has a natural tendency to divert shipments of these goods for Australia from the Vancouver line of steamers to vessels leaving New York or Quebec for this part of the world. The speech to which we listened from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> on Friday afternoon was almost entirely devoted to the subject of Defence. I think we were entitled to expect from the honorable senator a fuller exposition of the finances of Australia. In point of fact, beyond the few bare figures, all of which were more or less known to us, the honorable senator gave us nothing new. As I dealt at some length with the question of Australian finance, in speaking on the Appropriation Bill in September last, I do not propose to go generally into that matter to-day. But, clearly, trie position of our finances is anything but satisfactory, and it might have engaged the attention of the Minister a little more than it did. I fail, however, to understand his reference to the sugar duty when he said - </para><quote>
                    <para>It is anticipated that there will be an additional falling off in the sugar revenue of about <inline font-style="italic">£21,000,</inline> owing to the increased production of Australian sugar. Of course, that amount may be increased or decreased, as the result of any action which this Parliament may take in extending the term during which the sugar bounty sholl be operative. If, as has been suggested, the Excise duty is increased to <inline font-style="italic">£4</inline> per ton, we shall receive an additional revenue. But whether the Treasurer's estimate is realized will entirely depend upon the legislation which we enact. </para>
                </quote><para class="block">I am. quite at a loss to understand what the Minister of Defence means. I know that legislation has been proposed for increasing the Excise duty in the year 1906-7, but no increase of Excise duty in that year could affect the revenue from this source in the current year. I presume that the Minister has made a mistake, and has not been quite aware of the legislation which is being introduced by his colleagues. There are certain matters which the accounts do not make as clear as they should do. In the first place, the Minister told us that the receipts from the special Tariff of Western Australia this year will probably show a further decline of £65.000. I should like honorable senators to notice to what extent the inclusion of the figures for that Tariff has misled us in making a comparison. I would suggest to the Government that the revenue from this source ought not to be included in the ordinary receipts of Australia. This revenue of £'300,000, or thereabouts, was to diminish at the rate of one-fifth per annum, and of course to cease at the end of five years. As the amount has been decreasing year by year during the period, the falling off for the year misleads us. The Minister also informed the Senate that new steps had been taken with regard to cable messages, that the money paid for foreign and cable messages was now being taken into the revenue, and refunded. He pointed out that the refunds for this year would be .£48,000 more than they were last year. The accounts under this head are very indistinct. If £48,000 is received for cable messages, and added to the receipts of the Post and Telegraph Department, why are not the refunds debited to it ? I observe that in the Treasury accounts a total sum of £80,000 is debited as refunds. Obviously, this is altogether wrong. If the Post and Telegraph Department is receiving £50,000 with one hand and paying it out again with the other the amount ought to appear on each side of the account. What course the Government are adopting in the matter is not clear from the accounts, and it certainly ought to be clear. We are liable to mistake the addition which is now being made for an increase of revenue. It may be remembered that two or three weeks ago I asked what amount of rebate or discount the Post and Telegraph Department was allowing to those who bought postage stamps for resale, and I was told that it was £13,920. In the departmental accounts I cannot find any indication of the payment of these moneys. How or out of what item they are paid I do not know. It may be that after the commissions have been deducted the net receipts are given. On this point, the Minister should give us the information when he replies. If the ordinary and proper trade course is not being followed out it should be. and that is to show the gross amount of the sales of postage stamps, and the amounts paid in commissions. There are a number of points on which the Minister should have given us information. We are now approaching the end of the fifth month of the financial year, and we ought to be able to form a fair idea as to the position of the finances at the end of the year. The Minister might well have given ys some information on that point. We might also have expected to receive information as to what was being done in regard to the transferred properties and the transfer of the States debts. These and many other points might well have occupied the attention of the Minister. I listened with considerable surprise to his statement with regard to a secret despatch. It seems that the Colonial Defence Committee, in England, sent out a secret memorandum of their views in regard' to the defence of Australia. </para><interjection>

                        <para>- I believe that all the world over communications marked "confidential," are treated entirely as private, and are not made public. On this occasion, the Minister took an extraordinary course. He said that the despatch was a secret one, and that, therefore, he could not publish it. But what did he do? He gave the despatch to his officers, and asked them to write a reply ; he read the reply which they had dictated ; and then he said : " From the character of the reply, you can understand what was in the despatch." That is not quite the sort of thing which we look for from a Minister of the Crown. If a Minister of the Crown cannot be trusted to respect a private communication, then private communications are likely to cease to be sent to Australia. </para>

                        <para>- It is not rubbish at all. Any honorable senator knows very well that if he were to fail to treat as confidential a communication marked " secret " or "confidential," it would show that he could not be trusted with a confidential communication, and then he would cease to be the recipient of such documents. I do not profess to speak with authority on matters of defence. I do not claim to be a military expert, but I have some general ideas on the subject. While the Commonwealth is subscribing with fair liberality towards the cost of naval defence generally, it should also do something for the defence of its own coast. The suggestions made by the Director of Naval Defence are worthy of consideration. I d'o not know that they are exactly what the Commonwealth should adopt, but they are framed on lines which, I think should be followed out. We should have some fair and reasonable protection for our coast line. We ought to have vessels of the torpedo and destroyer type, which would at least warn the fleets of foreign powers to beware. We should keep our Military Forces within moderate bounds. We ought to take care that while the army is a small one, it is efficient ; that it should be capable of working up to its full strength, and so disciplined and officered as to be in a position to render service of a valuable character. I do not know how Australia can take any steps which are more likely to be advantageous in regard to its defence, than by trying to make good neighbours of countries by which it is more or less surrounded. It is very desirable, I think, that it should be on friendly terms with its great neighbours <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> the East - China and Japan - who should feel that they have at least friends and well-wishers here. </para>

                        <para>- I am quite sure that Australia does not think as much of them as it ought to do. As a simple matter of defence, it is desirable that we should be om good terms with those great countries. There is another matter which I should like to bring under the notice of the Senate before concluding. I refer to the case of British New Guinea. I know that there are some even, in the Senate who are inclined to throw blame on the British Empire for not 'having at an earlier date taken steps to annex New Guinea, and who think that if Great Britain had done her duty, we should have forestalled Germany in taking possession of New Guinea and a great many of the islands of the Pacific. There are also some gentlemen who, I believe, are inclined to throw blame on Great Britain for not doing more than she does even to-day. It is partly for those reasons that I wish to direct attention to what took place with respect to New Guinea something like thirty years ago. I shall be able to show that, had Australia exhibited anything like a generous spirit of willingness to bear the expense, seeing that she was to receive the benefits, the whole of New Guinea would now have been under the British flag. In October, 1873, the British Admiralty sent a letter to the Colonial Office intimating that Captain Moresby had hoisted the Union Jack an the eastern portion of New Guinea, and making inquiries on the point. It was also said that, in the year 1849, Lieutenant Yule, of Her Majesty's ship <inline font-style="italic">Bramble,</inline> had formally taken possession; and also that, even so far back as the year 1793, certain East India traders had taken possession in the name of the British Crown. Upon that the Colonial Office sent circular letters to the Governments of the Australian Colonies, inquiring what were the wishes of Australia, and what could be done. The replies received from Australia generally expressed approval of annexation. In 1895 the Royal Colonial Institute memorialized the Earl of Carnarvon, then Secretary of State for the Colonies, urging him to annex New Guinea. This memorial was signed by several representative Australians amongst others. In June, 1875, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Hercules</inline> Robinson transmitted to the Earl of Carnarvon a minute by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Robertson</inline> - afterwards <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Robertson, Premier of New South Wales - advocating the immediate annexation of - </para>

In June of the same year, Governor Musgrave, of South Australia, wrote to the Earl of Carnarvon, forwarding a letter from James P. Boucaut, Commissioner of Crown Lands, in which he urged the Secretary of State for the Colonies to take immediate possession of New Guinea. Governor Cairns, of Queensland, on 6th July, 1875, sent to the Earl of Carnarvon an address from the Legislative Council of Queensland, and another from the Legislative Assembly of that State, both urging annexation. In sending the address from the Legislative Assembly, Governor Cairns wrote - </para><quote>

It is as well that we in Australia should bear in mind that our parsimony1 in the past has stayed the hand of Great Britain, and that in monetary matters in which the Empire as a whole as concerned, we should now be prepared to take up a more generous attitude than was taken up some thirty years ago. </para></speech>

                    <para>- There is a matter in connexion with the Defence Department to which I should like to address the attention of Ministers and the Senate. It is a matter which I have raised on previous occasions, and to which I understand the Minister has been giving some attention - the case of what are known as the military clerks. Two classes of clerks are employed in the Defence Department. Seventy-nine of them are serving under the Public Service Act, and are called public service clerks; thirty-seven of them are serving under the Defence Act, and are called military clerks. Prior to the proclamation of the Commonwealth Public Service Act, the then Minister of Defence, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest, raised the question whether military clerks should be brought under its provision. Major-General Hutton --who was then Commandant of the Forces - strongly objected to the proposal. It is a singular fact, however, that at this very time the naval clerks, occupying a precisely similar position in the Department, but in a different branch, were brought under the provisions of the Public Service Act. The effect of this distinction is that the public service clerks have the whole Public Service open to them for advancement. The military clerks have no opportunity of advancement beyond a maximum of £260 a year, except in the case of two positions allotted to first clerks. It must he obvious to honorable senators that, however energetic and diligent in the performance of their duties these clerks may be, they are placed at a disadvantage when compared with their fellows who are fortunate enough to have been brought under the Public Service Act. A further disadvantage is that the age limit is controlled entirely by regulation, which may at any time be altered1, so that these clerks have no security of tenure. The age has lately been extended to sixty, but there is no certainty that it may not be reduced once more to fifty-five, or even fifty, in which case the clerks will be subject to all the disabilities which previously attached to the limitation. The military clerks, prior to appointment, are subject to a strict medical examination, and are sworn in under the Defence Act for five years. That medical examination and test is repeated every three years, and if any man is found physically unfit he is liable to be discharged from the service. While 'a medical examination of the kind is very necessary in the case of the active members of the Defence Forces, it cannot be regarded as indispensable in the clerical branch ; but, simply because these clerks happen to be brought under the Defence Act, they have to submit to the same conditions as do the soldiers. In this regard, they occupy a very disadvantageous position, as compared with that of their fellow clerks, who happen to be brought under the Public Service Act. I have here the classification of the military clerks, as arranged by the late Minister of Defence, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McCay,</inline> and, according to section 51A, the following is the scale of salaries, inclusive of all other allowances, other than travelling, from the 1st July, 1905: - First class, minimum salary, ,£285, and maximum, £335 ; second class, minimum, £2 2b, and maximum, £260; third class, minimum, £170, and maximum, £210; and fourth class, minimum. £70, and maximum, £160, with increments of £15. There is a foot-note to the scale, as set out for the first class, providing that salaries between the minimum and maximum shall be fixed by the Minister of Defence from time to time in accordance with the work done. There are only two positions for military clerks which carry the maximum salary of £335. The classification for clerks of similar class and grade under the Public Service Act is as follows: - First class, minimum, £520, and maximum, £600; second class, minimum. £420, and maximum. £500; third class, minimum, £310, and maximum, £400 : fourth class, minimum, £185, and maximum, £285 ; fifth class, minimum, £40, and maximum £160. Some of these military clerks work in the same office, side bv side with clerks who are under the Public Service Act; and yet there is in the salary this disparity, which will become more accentuated as time goes on. The clerks under the Public Service Act have the whole road of advancement open to them - they have scores of positions to which they may attain, where the military clerks have only one. During the discussion on the Defence Estimates last year the late Minister of Defence, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. MoCay,</inline> in referring to the exclusion of the military clerks from the operation of the Public Service Act- </para>

                        <para>- I am not quoting from a debate; indeed, I do not know whether the remarks of the late Minister of Defence were made in the House. I am merely desirous to show the reasons he gave for the exclusion of military clerks from the operation of the Public Service Act. The late Minister said that there were a great number of technical matters, which, if war were to break out, these clerks would have to attend to on the field, and that if they were brought under the Public Service Act, men would have to be introduced from other Departments to do this work, which they could not be expected to perform. Furthermore, the late Minister of Defence intimated that in the case of some breach of discipline, military clerks, instead of being dealt with by military officers who have control of them, could, under section 50 of the Act. ask for an Appeal Board. But when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McCay</inline> made that statement he could not have g,iven the subject much consideration. Had he read section 50 of the Public Service Act he would have found that there are only certain classes of offences which can be made the subject of inquiry bv an Appeal Board. Those offences are provided for in sections 3T. 46, 49, 65, 66, and 73, and comprise negligence, inefficiency, drunkenness, improper conduct incapacity, conviction for any indictable offence, and so forth. In no case can an Appeal Board deal with the class of offences which the late Minister contemplated would lead to a breach of discipline, or to interference with the efficiency of the Defence Forces on active service. Such offences would be dealt with under the Defence Act of 1903, section 73 of which gives military officers full power to dp,il with the whole of the men who come within their control, as would these clerks on active service. It will be seen, therefore, that the objection raised by the late Minister of Defence is not a valid one, and that it cannot be raised as a reason why these military clerks should continue to be excluded from the operation of the Public Service Act. But even if it were a valid reason, it ought to apply to clerks who are performing exactly similar work in the Naval Department, who are under the Public Service Act. and also to the other seventy-nine clerks in the Defence Department who are exempt from the operation of the Defence Act. I understand that the Minister has taken this matter into consideration, and I trust that he will see the advisableness of departing, from the course laid down by his predecessor, and not leave these military clerks marooned on an island, as it were, away from their fellows. We listened with great interest to the speech of the Minister of Defence last Friday,, though most or us, I think, would have liked him to be a little more definite in regard to the proposals for the future. </para>

                        <para>- Parliament must eventually indorse the policy. My point is that the Minister should take into consideration the various policies which have been put before him, and shoulder the responsibility due to his office of proposing some action for the future. Amongst the other items mentioned by the Minister of Defence, outside his own Department, was one of £5,000 for the establishment of a Statistical Bureau. The Census and Statistics Bill which we recently passed renders this vote necessary ; but I sincerely trust that the Department of Home Affairs, in establishing the Bureau, will approach the various States Governments, and ascertain whether, in relieving them of any work of this kind, we cannot also relieve them of some of their officers. This is a class of work which has been undertaken in the past by the States; and, if each State maintains the present organization, the Commonwealth Bureau will mean the addition of a seventh Department. There are very valuable officers employed by the States in doing, this work, and they might well be transferred to the Commonwealth for the purposes of the proposed Statistical Bureau. During the visit of the Old-age Pensions Committee to Western Australia, I was very much impressed by the capacity of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wicken,</inline> who laid before us some valuable statistical information. The Commonwealth Statistical Bureau may be started on a small and modest scale, but the men we select for the work will probably be at the head of it when it becomes a gigantic and important organization. They ought to be capable men of experience, and not men transferred from other Departments, simply because they happen now to be in the Commonwealth service. The Government will be well advised to ascertain from the States Governments whether their Statistical Departments are over-manned or fully manned, and if there is any possibility of obtaining the services of efficient men to organize the bureau. </para>

We all appreciate <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coghlan's</inline> work, and recognise it as Commonwealth work, which has greater value than the separate information collected by the States. It should be our endeavour to prevent any overlapping in this statistical work. At present we have the information collected by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coghlan,</inline> and at the same time each State is producing a more or less efficient copy of thai information as affecting itself. As to the military expenditure, the first point that struck' me in the Minister's speech was the expected saving of£44,000. The Minister, quoting from a statement which he had prepared for the Vice-President of the Executive Council, said - </para>

                    <para>For the financial year 1904-5, the appropriation for the Defence Department amounted to £592,127. The expenditure was£558,503, showing a saving of £33,624. A saving of £30,000 was anticipated on the Defence vote, and £14,000 on the vote for Additions, New Works and Buildings under the control of the Department of Home Affairs, and this total saving of £44,000 was, by permission of the Treasurer, utilized to purchase special Defence material, making the expenditure on that vote, Division 6/1, £174,000. </para>

                <para class="block">I should like to ask the Minister whether the alteration of the vote has been sanctioned by Parliament, or is brought before us in any way for approval in this Appropriation Bill. It seems to me highly inadvisable that the Treasurer or the Minister of Defence, or both together, should be able to divert a vote, and to use the savings on a particular vote for some entirely different purpose. </para>

                        <para>- What the honorable senator calls a saving might be described as parsimony by Parliament. We might say that he should have spent more money on the branch of defence for which the amount was voted. I hope the Minister will make a note of the point, and will inquire whether parliamentary sanction is asked for these diversions of this vote in the Appropriation Bill. The Minister has claimed to have effected a saving in the vote for artillery ammunition of £8,5x4, and of .£9,470 on warlike stores. All of Major-General Hutton's reports during the time he occupied the position of General Officer Commanding the Military Forces of the Commonwealth were emphatic that in connexion with these matters we had not sufficiently provided for the defence of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- We have more than twenty-one guns. When, those which have been ordered are landed we shall have eighty field guns. These savings in ammunition and warlike stores make me suspicious, in view of the fact that only twelve months ago it was represented that in, this respect we were very inadequately supplied. Last year we were told that the money we were being asked to vote for these purposes was not sufficient, and that for a number of years we should be required to vote a certain sum of money in order to create a sufficient reserve. We are now told by the Minister that on the first vote for the purpose he has effected a saving of £8,000 in one item, and £9,000. in the other, and presumably this has been done without impairing the efficiency of our defences.. "I should like the Minister to explain how this saving has been effected, and whether it was not necessary that the full amount voted for these purposes by Parliament should have been expended. </para>

The sum of £9,470 was the saving on that vote. Of artillery ammunition, we have a full supply, up to present requirements, for 200 or 300 rounds per gun. </para>

The vote for artillery ammunition last year was £8,000, and it was all spent, and provided sufficient for the artillery we have. The vote for small-arms ammunition was also spent, and it has provided sufficient for all the small arms we have.

                        <para>- The statement as to the number of rounds per gun is misleading, because we have a large number of guns on order. There were only twenty-four effective guns, but the Minister has told us in his speech that when those that have been ordered are landed we shall have eighty effective field guns. </para>

                        <para>- I thoroughly enjoyed that portion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford's</inline> speech in which he made a comparison' between the Defence Forces of to-day and the Defence Forces we took over from the States. If ever there was a speech which justified the action of the Labour Party in cutting down the huge vote for defence proposed at the inauguration of the Commonwe':tt it is that delivered by the honorable senator on the second reading of this Bill. When I speak of the cutting down of the expenditure on the Defence Forces, I refer to the expenditure for drill and for keeping up a big Head-Quarters Staff. The honorable senator exposed the fact that when we took over the Defence Forces of the States we had an Army without rifles and field guns and without ammunition. In order to give the Senate full information, the Minister dealt with the matter in so much detail that it was a little difficult to follow the comparison made. I have grouped the facts more closely so that the comparison may be brought within closer range. In 1901 we took over forces numbering 29,622 men, who were armed with 1.3,005 magazine rifles and 32,688 single-loaders. Of magazine rifles, the modern weapon, we had not one for every two men. On the 30th June, this year, we had force numbering 23,750 men, and we had 35,913 magazine rifles and 30,945 single-loaders. We have now more magazine rifles by 1.2,000 than we have of men on a peace footing, and 30,945 single-loaders in addition. </para>

                        <para>- With an intimation that we were willing to vote any reasonable amount for the supply of rifles and ammunition. Then as regards cartridges. When we took over the Forces we had 9,038,761 ball cartridges, and now we have 30,800,865. If I were a military officer, and were asked which army I would sooner take the field with, I should say that I would sooner take the field with 20,000 men under the conditions of 1905 than with 30,000 men under the conditions of 1 901. Under those conditions we should have had to arm the men with pick-handles, as I think <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest suggested at one time. In the matter of field artillery, when we took over the Forces from the States we had 125 field guns, 101 of which were obsolete, and twenty-four of which were then spoken of as defective. In 1905, including those. to be landed, we have eighty effective field guns, as against twenty-four described as effective in J901:, though I understand they are not considered effective now ; and, in addition, the 101 obsolete guns which we took over in 1901.' What is more to the point, we now have ammunition for them. Dealing with our fixed defences, we must admit that the Commonwealth has done absolutely nothing. The fixed defences are in the same, if not in a worse, state than when they were taken over by the Commonwealth. So far as the land forces are concerned, we can claim that they are in a better position ; they have more and better rifles, there is a bigger reserve of ammunition, and I believe we have a more effective force. </para>

                        <para>- Yes; and it was that act which led to this resolution. I venture to say that, if we had continued to vote the sum which was then asked for, and which has since been spent on armament, it would have been spent on drill. The Government would have continued to bring down Estimates providing for the same useless expenditure on drill, although their military advisers had told them - and I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> was Minister of Defence for part of the time - that the men wanted rifles and ammunition. </para>

                        <para>- Our militia are better fitted to cope with an, emergency today than they were before the Defence Departments were taken over, simply because of the attention drawn by Major-General Hutton to the want of armament, and of the action taken in another place to cut down the expenditure on drill until the men were armed. Let me state the reason why I make this comparison. When I arrived in Sydney, on the day after the Minister of Defence had made his speech, I was disgusted to read the reports in the Sydney press. If ever there was a deliberate misrepresentation of a speech, it was in that case. The newspapers pointed out the position of the Defence Forces now, and quoted all that the Minister said about the loss of 5,000 volunteers, the loss of so many men in the Naval Forces, and the deficient state of the fixed defences ; but they left out every statement he made as to the obsolete guns taken over by the Commonwealth, as to our purchase of magazine rifles, as to there not being enough rifles to arm the militia, and as to the want of ammunition at the time of transfer. They left out every figure which would have enabled the people to see that the infantry and field artillery were in a better position to-day than at the time of transfer. They came out with leading articles headed " The Commonwealth Death-blow to Defence," and "The Commonwealth Mismanagement of Defence," and a long diatribe, in their endeavour to show that the Commonwealth had not only failed to make the Defence Forces any better, but had made bad worse, by quoting only so much of the official figures as would suit their case! It convinced me that the morning newspapers of Sydney are determined that the public of New South Wales shall be told everything which is calculated to discredit Federation, and shall get to know nothing in its favour. If ever there was a communication which should stir this Parliament it is the memorandum of the Colonial Defence Committee, so far as its contents have been revealed by Captain Creswell's criticism, which reads as follows : - </para>

                    <para class="block">This memorandum raises one of the most serious questions with which the Senate has yet had to deal. It involves more than the question of whether we should continue our contribution to the British Navy, or adopt Captain Creswell's proposal for a torpedo fleet. It involves a question of policy, and that is whether Australia is to leave to the British Government the determination of all questions of policy where our interests are in touch with those of other countries. </para>

                        <para>- That is what it involves, as I shall proceed to prove. The British Parliament has given us a Constitution which enables us to deal with emigration and immigration, trade, and commerce with other countries, and quarantine. The power to legislate on those subjects involves the power to execute the laws. For instance, we are given the power to say whether or not the people of a certain race shall come to our country. If the recommendation of the Colonial Defence Committee were indorsed by tins Parliament, in what position should we find ourselves in that regard ? The British Government have reserved to themselves the right to conclude treaties on matters affecting the Empire, without asking, whether we should be affected thereby. I do not mean to imply that they would knowingly enter into a treaty which would have the effect of practically nullifying any provision in our Constitution. But if we are to be a self governing country, legislating within the limitations of the Constitution, we should have full power to carry out our will. On the question of immigration, the British Government have already entered into a. treaty with Japan, and that may be carried to an even greater length in the future. One subject to be dealt with by a treaty might very well be the question of emigration and immigration between the high contracting countries. </para>

If we are to have no naval force, if the British Navy is to be our sole protector on the seas, then unless we pass laws which meet with the good-will . of the British Government, we shall have no means of enforcing them, and our immigration policy must be shaped, not to suit the opinions of the people of Australia, but to suit the views of the British Government, and incidentally of Governments with which treaties on this subject have been made.

If we entertain that hope, we must remember that we still live in an age when that result can only be achieved and retained by force of arms ; and that, therefore, Ave must have a navy. Many years ago. Japan set out with a defined plan which included the creation of a naval power, and started in a modest way. In Australia we cannot too soon commence to lay down a definite military policy, and that will be incomplete unless it provides for defence on water as well as on land. Whilst we must continue to hope that the British Empire will always be able to with stand all assaults, we should not disregard the old motto, " Trust in God, and keep your powder dry ;" and then if at any time, by a combination of Powers or other means, the British Navy were rendered incapable of defending Australia, we should have taken the first step to be in a position to defend ourselves. Of course, the reply will be : " Oh, but we, could not provide a fleet which could defend Australia in the absence of the British Navy." At the present time Ave could not; but there was a time when it could be said of -Japan : " It is useless for you to think of standing up against "the Russian Navy." There was a time when Japan was utterly helpless, and at the mercy of any Navy which liked to raid her shores. In the future, however, Australia may be in a position to acquire and man a fleet which would be just as able to defend her shores as the Japanese have shown themselves to be to- defend their country. Notwithstanding our belief that the British Army is unconquerable, our duty is to make provision for the defence of Australia by sea. I was pleased to read Captain Creswell's sturdy statement of his belief that Australia should make a commencement in a small way ; that it should begin to provide adequate naval defence, at any rate, for the chief ports. Here is a scheme which is well worthy of the Government's consideration. When it is contrasted with the proposal of the Colonial Defence Committee, there is only one position for an Australian to take up. Is there an Australian here who is prepared to say that we should never contemplate the beginning of an Australian Fleet? </para><interjection>

                        <para>- From a layman's idea of strategy, it does appear that even by the modest expenditure that is proposed by Captain Creswell, we could, within a very few years, have a fighting force which would make it at any rate exceedingly dangerous for a raiding cruiser to visit our shores. But I am surprised at the position put before us by Lt. -Col. Bridges. He practically says : " You have to choose whether you are going to make provision to' meet the case of a raiding, cruiser or to resist territorial aggression by a land force." I. consider that if we are to continue our land forces at all we must meet both those possibilities. I think, personally, that we have very little, or nothing, to fear in the way of territorial aggression from any European nation. But is it not common in the history of nations that where at one time two people have been at amity, and have even entered into treaties of offence and defence, within a few years they have been at each other's throats? </para>

                        <para>- Great Britain is at present at amity with. Japan. A treaty has been signed between the two Powers. But should we not be foolish if we took that to be a, guarantee for all time? Japan has shown that she is an aggressive nation. She has shown that she is desirous of pushing out all round. What has always been the effect of victory and of conquest upon nations? Do we not "know that it stimulates them to further conflict ; that it creates that earth hunger which induces them to endeavour to obtain fresh territory ? Has not that been the history of our own race ? Was there not a time when the English people were content to be circumscribed in the little island in the Northern seas? But we know that when England first experienced the sensations of conquest, when she first tasted the fruits of the acquisition of valuable territories, her appetite grew. She was not satisfied until she had engirdled the globe. And we may expect that similar results will follow from the recent history of Japan. She has, for the first time, tasted the fruits of conquest and territorial aggrandizement. And is there any other country that offers such a temptation to Japan as Australia does? I say that we should be, ostrich like, hiding our heads in the sand, if we refused to recognise that there is a possibility of territorial aggrandizement in our direction from some Eastern nation. And if that be the case, considering that it took Japan from fifty to one hundred years to work up to her present position of defence, are we not foolish if we do not commence, even in a small way, to make provision to meet both territorial aggression and raids by cruisers? Therefore, I commend this subject to the serious consideration of the Government. I tell them that I, for one, shall be prepared to vote any reasonable sum to carry out a scheme on the lines indicated by Captain Creswell. My vote will readily be given to this or any other Government which takes steps to provide for such a fleet as is sketched in his recommendation!. I trust that the Minister will energetically consider the subject during the recess, and will come forward before the next Appropriation Bill is introduced with a-definite proposal ; so that instead of our having a few useless and obsolete boats such as we now have, we shall have some vessels manned with our own sailors on the Australian coast which' will be of effective use in time of war. </para>

                        <para>-The alternative to using a larger proportion of the Customs revenue ourselves is to resort to direct taxation. Personally, I think that that is a more manly course. I think that it is unmanly to shelter ourselves behind the skirts of the States Parliaments, and put upon them the obligation of imposing obnoxious taxation. We should shoulder that responsibility ourselves. I am aware, however, that such conditions are beside the question before us. </para>

What is the use of spending money on the two Queensland gun-boats, which would be absolutely useless in time of war ? Let us make up our minds to hand over this money to the British Government to increase the Naval Subsidy, or spend it in forming the nucleus of a Navy of our own. I earnestly trust that the Minister will spend his recess in thinking this matter out, with a serious view to taking practical action, so that when we have the Appropriation Bill before us again there will be a prospect of something definite being done. </para>

                        <para>- Hear, hear; and that is by no means beyond the bounds of possibility. It should be possible to build such boats as we require in Australia. It may not be possible to manufacture the armament, and some of the more intricate portions of the machinery in Australia, because the cost of doing so might be too high. But surely this country could build the hulls of such ships as we need. I have no doubt that it could. Therefore I. indorse the Minister's remark. I have another point to make before I resume my seat. We have the Appropriation Bill sent up to us at a time when there is a prospect that the session will close within a fortnight or three or four weeks. </para>

                        <para>- But it is so. Whenever there was a halt in reference to other business the Government brought forward the Estimates. There was a few hours' discussion upon them, nothing was passed, and they were put on one side until another suitable opportunity occurred. The present Government is not singular in this respect. Every preceding Government has done the same kind of thing. But it leaves the Senate in this position : that we are practically made an assenting House. The House of Representatives .apparently regards itself as having the sole control of 'the purse, and it sends the Appropriation Bill up to us at such a time that we have very little choice but to agree to everything that is contained in it. </para>

                        <para>- Possibly there is not ample time at our disposal. I understand that, as the Appropriation Bill has left the other House, no Supply Bill can be introduced to meet the month's expenditure. Consequently we must pass this Bill before the 28th of the present month. </para>

                        <para>- It has a great deal to do with the Appropriation Bill, because by this measure we provide the money. This is the only opportunity we have to discuss such questions of policy. . If this practice is continued, and if the Senate is to be regarded as no better than a mere recording chamber, we shall have to assert ourselves. Next session I promise the Government that if the Appropriation Bill is not brought forward at an earlier period, if I can give them any trouble over it I will do so willingly. I will join with honorable senators of any party - whether they are supporters of the Government, opponents of it, or members of my own party - to obstruct business, and to prevent the Government from carrying on until the Senate is given a better opportunity of dealing with the Appropriation Bill at an early stage of the session. </para>

Each Government has acquiesced in the position that so long as the Senate gets the Appropriation Bill in time to dispose of it before the Governor-General enters the door to prorogue Parliament, that is all that is necessary. But I enter my protest, and? I warn the Government that next session I intend to join with others - and it will be a non-party move, assisted by honorable senators on all sides - in taking such steps as will compel the Government, either to adjourn this Chamber until the Appropriation Bill is .ready, or submit it at an earlier stage. </para>

                    <para>- I agree cordially with the concluding remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline> The Senate ought to have an opportunity to deal with this Appropriation Bill at a much earlier period of the session. It has always been my experience, not only here but in the State Parliament of Queensland, that the most important business - the business of finance - is usually dealt with at the very close of each session, when every parliamentary representative' is anxious to get to his electorate. Any movement of the kind hinted' at by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> will have my most cordial co-operation if I am here next session. The subject of finance is the most unfortunate that the Senate could be called' upon to debate. It is admitted on all hands that there is need in Australia for a verv much more pronounced defence policy, and. further, we are pledged to the electors to adopt some national old-age pensions scheme. There are a number of other administrative matters which very shortly. I believe. wil be brought within the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth authorities. In connexion with every one of these subjects, we are continually brought face to face with the fact that no one seems to know where the necessary money is to come from. If we talk about establishing a proper system of defence, or laying the foundations of an Australian Navy, we are told that we are too poor, and that there is no way to raise the money - that if we want more revenue, we must impose taxation sufficient to raise four times the necessary amount. As matters stand at present, all that is very true, but, in connexion with this subject, we ought to begin at the beginning. It is always best to begin, if we can, at the foundation of a matter. We ought to start the discussion by asking ourselves whether the present system of finance is a false or a sound system. If, on examination, the system is found to be false, the sooner we change it the better. In my opinion, the present system, which has been carried on from the inception of responsible government in Australia, is a false one. An exceedingly large proportion of the taxation levied throughout Australia is derived from the Customs. Probably, I suppose, about three-fourths of the entire taxation of Australia is drawn from the people through the Customs. That is to say, the people are not taxed in accordance with their capacity to pay, but upon what they eat, drink, wear, and use. I submit that that is altogether an unsound system of taxation. What is taxation? Why do we raise, money by means of taxation ? In order to defray the cost of Government. Why have we a Government ? To maintain order - to see that the laws are fairly and equitably administered, in order to protect life and property. As a matter of fact, taxation may be placed in exactly the same category as insurance money. When a man pays his taxes, he is paying insurance ; he is contributing to a fund which is spent in the defence, so to speak, of his life and property. What should we think of an insurance company which, when taking a risk,, did not hold the value of the property to be insured as the basis of the risk, but subjected the insurer to an examination as to what he ate, drank, wore, and consumed generally. The whole thing would be ludicrous from that point of view ; and yet that is exactly the position we are in with regard to taxation. When an insurance company accepts a risk, it charges very much more for a ^3,000 policy than it does for, a ,£100 policy ; it differentiates according to the risk. The premium is large or small, as the risk is large or small '; and I submit that that principle ought to be adopted with regard to taxation. If a man's property, within the Commonwealth, reaches the value of, say, ^10,000, he ought to contribute very much more largely towards the cost of government than does a man whose property amounts to only £100 in value, the risk of the former in the Commonwealth being very much larger than the risk of the latter. </para>

                        <para>- I shall be as brief as possible; but I think the subject of so much importance that a little time devoted to it ought not to be grudged. We have spent hours and hours on many occasions in discussing subjects of really no importance. The Federal Parliament ought to endeavour to put the finances of the Commonwealth on a sound basis. We are in the position that we raise a certain amount of revenue annually through the Customs, and three-fourths of that revenue we are compelled under the Constitution to hand back to the various States. The Commonwealth expenditure is strictly limited to one- fourth of the revenue ; and, that being so, when Ave propose to establish proper defences for Australia, we find ourselves without funds. And so with the establishment of old-age pensions, we find the one-fourth of the revenue reserved to us insufficient for the purpose. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> suggests that the Commonwealth ought to impose direct taxation. I have no objection to direct taxation, but I think that, for some time at any rate, that method ought to be left to the States. </para>

                        <para>- I shall give the honorable senator a number of good reasons for my opinion. In the first place, it is extremely desirable that Commonwealth finances shall be entirely separated from State finances - that the authority which levies taxation shall be responsible for spending the money. I know that that is a position which cannot be attained for a very considerable time yet; but I think every honorable senator will agree with me that it is a most desirable position to arrive at. We find that, even now, the States Treasurers complain bitterly of the fact that, while the Commonwealth raises as much or as little revenue as it pleases, the States have the responsibility of spending the money - that they incur the odium of spending it. </para>

                        <para>- I was just about to say that the States never know whether they will receive sufficient revenue to meet their demands, or whether they will be faced by very large deficits. As a matter of fact, the whole position bristles with difficulties for both Commonwealth and States. However, the present position must continue fora given period, and may and will continue after that, unless Parliament otherwise decides. That is to say, the Braddon section will continue to operate up to a certain point, and, unless Parliament otherwise decides, it will continue to operate. When the operation of the Braddon section expires is the time when the Commonwealth authority may lay the foundation of separate financial systems for Commonwealth and States. </para>

I find that the Government have no financial policy whatever, if it is not one purely of drift. One would have thought that before now some arrangement would have been made with regard to the transferred properties. Nothing, so far as I have been able to ascertain has been done.

                <para class="block">Department, but it is extremely desirable that we should know exactly how much, and we cannot get that information until some arrangement has been made with the States in connexion with the transferred properties. The matter should be one easily solved, that is if the States and the Commonwealth are each actuated by a spirit of fairness. But if the States wish to impose upon the Commonwealth, as I am afraid some of them do, the matter becomes one of very much more difficulty. I think it could easily be settled by the States submitting a statement of the cost to each of them of the properties transferred. The actual cost of those properties would be a very fair Oasis, and one which should be satisfactory to both parties. I understand that the States, or some of them, wish to value the properties as they stand now. To my mind, that is an exceedingly unfair method. In most cases, the land on which our post-offices, and other public buildings which have been transferred to the Commonwealth, have been erected, cost the States nothing, and it would' be exceedingly unfair on their part to charge the Commonwealth with the present values for that land. The only result which an arrangement of that kind could possibly have would be to increase unduly and unfairly the expenditure of the Commonwealth and circumscribe more and more our one-fourth share of the Customs revenue. I trust that the Government will try to come to some arrangement at an early date with the States upon this matter, so that we may be in a position to learn exactly how our Post and Telegraph Department stands, how much it loses every year, and whether we are able to adopt the system of penny postage which has been advocated in many quarters. </para>

                        <para>- We can see how much the Department is losing so far as the difference between ordinary expenditure and revenue is concerned, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> must be aware that a very large amount of the money borrowed by each of the States, has been invested in post-offices, the building of telegraph lines and such works, and the Commonwealth ought to be liable for the interest on that expenditure. Before we can ascertain how much we are actual I v losing every year in connexion with this Department that interest ought to be charged against the Department. It would be so charged in the case of any ordinary business. Not only that, but there should also be something allowed for depreciation and other charges. I trust the Government will endeavour to bring the' matter to a conclusion at an early date. It is extremely' desirable also that the Government should formulate some policy with regard to the taking, over either of the whole of the States debts or of a portion of them. We know that a conference held some time ago in Hobart dealt with this subject, and perusing- the reports of its proceedings. I came to the conclusion that the Treasurers of the various States were trying all they knew to get the better of the Treasurer of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- No, I think that the Treasurer of the Commonwealth was exceedingly fair in his proposals. Indeed I must say that I was astonished at his moderation. To my mind, he made very equitable proposals, which I am very sorry indeed the States Treasurers could not see their way to agree to. But, unfortunately for all concerned, each one of the States Treasurers seemed to be overpowered by a desire to " get at " the Commonwealth. I am very glad that they did not succeed. The Government should have some clear ideas on this question, and should take Parliament into their confidence at the very earliest opportunity. I can quite understand the little scheme which is in the minds of the States Treasurers. They wish us to take over the States debts, or a proportion of them, and so make the interest on the debts a perpetual charge upon the Customs. I hay that that would be financing of the most unsound character. What have the Customs to do with the interest upon States debts? A very large proportion of the money borrowed has been spent in the improvement of the public estate, in building railways, in making roads, and in developing, our resources, and the interest on that money, to my mind, ought to be made a charge, not upon the Customs revenue, but upon the works on which the borrowed money has been expended. That is the view of the question which I take, and I submit it with! all deference to the Senate. The various States Treasurers desired that the Commonwealth should take all responsibility, so far as the payment of the interest on the debts is concerned, whilst they appear to be anxious to retain full control over the assets. I appeal to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker,</inline> as a banker, to say whether any banking or money-lending institution would carry on business on those lines? If a banking institution advances money to a private individual, it secures some hold upon the assets of the individual, and places itself in the position of having some control over his business. But here we should have practically no control whatever if the States Treasurers' proposals were carried out. I trust that if the States insist upon their debts being taken over the Commonwealth Government will also insist upon securing a reasonable control over the assets which should be held responsible for the payment of the interest on those debts, and ultimately for the redemption of the indebtedness. </para>

                        <para>- I do not see that it is a question of trusting at all. It is purely a matter of business. Does not <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> see the involved condition into which the Commonwealth finances might get unless a policy of this kind were pursued? Of course the Commonwealth has always power to impose direct taxation, but I set. out by saying that, to my mind, it was absolutely essential that Commonwealth finance should be separated from State finance. If we have the Commonwealth levying Customs taxation and also land taxation, States and Commonwealth finance will become inextricably mixed up together, and the present state of confusion will become worse confounded. One thing which we should try to bring about in connexion with the relations between the States and the Commonwealth is the entire separation of their financial transactions. I wish now to refer to the question of the Federal Capital. I am sure that we are all disappointed that something definite has not been done. Of course, we realize that the Government of New South Wales has taken up a most un-Federal attitude, and placed every obstacle in the way of a settlement of that most important question. So far as I can gather from the correspondence on the subject, the Government of New South Wales takes up the position that it has the right to choose the territory within which the Capital city shall be situated. That, I am sure, never entered the minds of the people of the Commonwealth. If it had been mentioned for a moment that New South Wales would have the privilege of choosing the territory, they would not have agreed to federate. I may be right, or I may be wrong, in regard to my reading of section 125 of the Constitution. Its wording is rather obscure. When we reflect that some of the brightest men in Australia were members of the Federal Convention, we must confess to a little astonishment at that obscurity. </para>

                        <para>- If the High Court should read the Constitution in the same way as the Government of New South Wales, the evident duty of the Commonwealth Government would be to take steps to secure an alteration thereof. In any case, I think that something definite ought to be done at an early date. Individually, I am not in a hurry to leave Melbourne; but I recognise that the longer a final settlement of this question is delayed, the greater will be the danger of something happening, for which probably we have not bargained. The Government ought to press for a solution of the difficulty as early as possible. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know. The climate of Dalgety is probably better than that of Melbourne. In any case, the former place has been deliberately chosen by this Parliament, and New South Wales, if she were governed by what is known as the Federal spirit, and not by a narrow-minded selfishness, would accept that choice. The subject of defence is pressing itself upon the attention of the people of Australia more forcibly every year. We realize that we cannot afford to live very much longer in a fool's paradise. We hear of war going on in various quarters of the globe. We recognise that the pressure for territory is becoming greater and greater every year, and that our only safety lies in an adequate system of defence. I am disappointed that the Government has not come down with a clearcut and definite policy. Evidently, it does not know its own mind on this subject. It has been said bv an honorable senator that, as it is now constituted, there is really no hope ofl the Government ever formulating a definite defence policy. I hope, for the sake of Australia, and of the Government, that that is not the case. </para>

                        <para>- I do; because I believe that the present Government is very much better than the one which the honorable senator would like to see in power again, and which, when it was in power for some months, did not formulate a defence policy. Each Minister looked upon every colleague as his sworn brother. There were no differences of opinion. We know how very much more uncertain the support of the third party was to that Government than it is" to the present Government. The party which is supporting the present Government is at least politically honest. I question very much whether that can be said of- </para>

The people believe in a citizen army - not in professional soldiers, but in men who, from patriotic motives, qualify themselves for defence purposes. I do not find that the Government has been encouraging our volunteers. </para>

                        <para>- They ought not to get much money. It is not possible to work the volunteer and partially-paid system side by side. One or other must go. The volunteer looks at the partially-paid man and sms " Why should I give my time to this business of defence and get nothing out of it. when my friend over there does not give any more of his time or' energy to defence than I do, and yet is paid ?" That aspect of the question must, I think, be clear to any one who sees how the Volunteer Forces have dwindled during the last year or two. The Government might very well do a great deal more to encourage the Volunteer Forces. It might foster rifle shooting by giving free ammunition and' offering prizes, and also encourage rifle clubs and cadet corps. </para>

                        <para>- With reference to our defence by sea, we are not in a position to establish a Navy. As has been pointed out already, we are hot in the possession of sufficient revenue to establish a large Navy. But we ought to do all that is possible. We ought to begin by providing for harbor defence, and by placing all our capital cities and the larger 'ports in as complete a state of defence as is possible for us with our limited means. That would be a very good beginning. We should then establish a small Navy of our own. I have no sympathy with those who think that we ought to leave our naval defence to Great Britain. That is an entirely mistaken line of policy. If we really love Great Britain we ought to relieve her of some share of her very great responsibilities by providing for our own sea defence in as large a measure as we can. I am not prepared to enter into this aspect of the question at length, but I think that if we examine the whole subject we shall find that the question of cost after all is not so serious as it appears to be. Victoria alone is paying as annual tribute to the landlords about ,£7,000,000 per annum. If we could divert half the annual tribute that is now being paid to the owners of land all over Australia to the purposes of defence, we should be able to put Australia in practically an impregnable position. </para>

Unfortunately, I am not permitted to discuss this question as I should like to do, but I hope some day to have an opportunity to place my views fully, freely, and fairly before the Senate. I can assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> that if I thought there was the slightest semblance of confiscation, or anything of that kind, about my proposals, I should be the last man to put them forward. Hitherto certain individuals have been permitted to draw huge revenues, which in all fairness and equity ought to have gone into the public Treasury. </para>

                        <para>- I was merely proceeding to point out how the money for a system of defence might be obtained. Our great trouble is the lack of cash. We want an Army. We want a Navy. We want an old-age pension- scheme. But we cannot get the money, simply because our system of financing is unsound from top to bottom. I think I have said enough to indicate what my views are - at least, in a limited way. I trust that we shall very soon have some definite declaration of policy with regard to the transferred properties and the State debts. We should like to know what the Government means to do as to the taking over of the States debts, and also what is proposed with reference to " the Braddon blot." The Treasurer in making his Budget speech .said that he was prepared to wipe out that section of the Constitution. Very well ; we should like to know whether the Government supports that view or not. In short, we should like to have a declaration of policy upon all these matters. T trust that we shall have it, if not this session, at least early in the coming session. </para>

                    <para>- I hope, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> that you will give me a. little latitude, such as the last speaker has had, if I allude to one or two matters that are not actually contained in the Bill before us. I intend, however, to make my remarks apply particularly to three Departments, namely, the Department of Trade and Customs, the Postmaster-General's Department, and the Defence Department. With reference to the Department of Trade and Customs, I notice that the border Customs officers are still continued. I was in hopes that by this time we should have been able to dispense with their services. Nevertheless. New South Wales is charged with <inline font-style="italic">£1.694</inline> f°r border Customs officers, and Victoria is. charged with £1,225 f°r similar services, together with contingencies. That- is to say, the two States will lie charged with .£2,919. I hope that the time is close at hand when there will be no  border officers whatever. The bookkeeping period comes to an end, I believe, in the year  1906.  With regard to the Postmaster-General's Department, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> is, I think, quite correct in saying that in order to enable us to form an opinion as to whether it is a paying Department or not the interest on the cost of telegraph lines and other works should he taken into calculation. Some people, I am aware, are anxious to see the system of penny postage introduced in this country. But I understand that that reform would entail a loss of £240,000 a year </para>

                        <para>- Penny postage is, I think, a luxury for which we can afford to wait for some time, and I shall support the Government in their policy of not extending, that privilege until we can afford it. 1 notice some figures which are very suggestive in connexion with this Department. We are paying to the Railways Departments of the various States for the conveyance of mails the following sums : - To New South Wales, £78.000 a year; to Victoria, ,£57,000; to Queensland, £50,000; to South Australia, £17,250;' to Western Australia, £21.000; and to Tasmania, £13,100, making a total of £236,350 a year. I am not saying that we are paying too much or too little in that direction, but those figures are suggestive, especially to those honorable senators who are in favour of federalizing the railway systems. Capitalized at twenty years' purchase, the sum that we are paying amounts to something like £4,720,000. </para>

I should not have been sorry to see in the Appropriation Bill provision made for the establishment of the office of High Commissioner in London. T should not have objected either to see expenditure proposed for taking over Quarantine and lighthouses. I should have liked to see proposals made for the appointment ot a Commission to consider the consolidation of the debts of the States, and the best way to pay for' the transferred properties. Those matters, however, remain for future consideration. The most important of the Commonwealth Departments, from my point of view, is that of Defence. I remind the Minister of Defence that we have in Australia at the present time an officer, in the person of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> French, with whom it might be advantageous to consult. He is here on family affairs, but he is a well-known artillery officer who has been Commandant in New South Wales and Queensland, and has also had considerable experience in Canada. <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> know that he has views on the subject. </para>

                        <para>- I am in favour of the, cadet system being thoroughly organized and encouraged in every possible way. In connexion with that, we must all recognise the splendid work that was done iii Victoria by the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Sargood. The State of Victoria also deserves credit for the way in which her cadet, corps have grown. T should like the Minister to listen to a statement .published by a correspondent of the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald,</inline> with regard to a mounted cadet corps, whose operations he witnessed in a part of New South Wales.

                    <para>Noting that many advocate through your columns citizen soldiers, I think much could be done to train the future defenders of the land in the Public schools. I was present at a school sports meeting on King's Birthday at Cranbury, a bush school 10 miles from Cudal. The teacher had a group of 16 school boys, ranging in age from S to <inline font-style="italic">16 years,</inline> drilled as mounted cadets. These lads went through the mounted drill and handled their horses in a manner creditable to any mounted corps. At cutting the Turk's head they showed skill and good horsemanship. As 1 dismounted squad they went through various firing, sword, and physical exercises, also first-aid drill. Each boy is the possessor of a pea-rifle, and I was informed that any lad could make a certainty of killing " bunny " at a 50 yds. range. If, when these lads grow up, their services should be required in their country's defence they would only need arming with up-to-date weapons and a few drills to equal the famous Boer soldiers. Their training has been thorough, and they would, in conjunction with others similarly trained, be the best and cheapest defence a country could have. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">That is an object lesson as to what may be done with a country corps. The Australian boy, especially the bush boy, is a good horseman, and is fond of showing-off his skill in this respect. Of course, we all agree that it is very desirable to have our harbor defences in an efficient state, and, to that end, expenditure on torpedo boats is perfectly justifiable ; but I should like to see more attention paid to training ships. In Sydney we have a really good training ship, the <inline font-style="italic">Sobraon,</inline> which was originally intended for a reformatory, but is now turning out boys who are remarkably well drilled, and who, it is believed, will make excellent sailors in an Australian Navy, if ever we have one. The statistics in relation to the <inline font-style="italic">Sobraon</inline> show that only 5 per cent, of the boys turn out unsatisfactory, and, though many of them are taken from the streets, it is marvellous how the discipline they undergo renders them full of promise as good citizens in the future. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> referred to Japan and its Navy ; but we must remember that Japan,, although only recently in the forefront, has an enormous population of 47,000,000, as against 4,000,000 in Australia. It is not difficult for Japan, under the circumstances, to afford a large Navy, but for us to attempt to provide an adequate defence of the kind on our own account would be a piece of extravagance. We ought to be a great deal more grateful than many of us are to the mother country for what she has done, and is willing to do, in this connexion ; and I, for one, say that if we can afford it, we ought to increase our annual subsidy to the Imperial Navy. Then, I should be willing to see a certain amount of money spent in the establishment of an ammunition factory, because it would be an extraordinary state of affairs if, in time of war, we were to find ourselves without the necessary powder. To revert to the question of an Australian Navy, I wonder if it .has been considered how soon large ships of- war become obsolete ? We have heard a good deal on this subject from the Home authorities ; and just now I believe <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Fisher is re-organizing the whole Imperial Navy, and it is possible that many ships, which cost I do not know how many hundreds of thousands of pounds, may be sold for a trifle. If we were to establish a Navy of our own, I am afraid that it would necessitate the raising of a large loan, because I do not see how we could go on providing new vessels with an annual contribution of £300,000 or £400,000. I shall keep my promise to be brief in speaking on the second reading, but, of course, there will be something more to be said by myself and others when the details are discussed in Committee. </para>

                    <para>- I propose to make a few remarks on the speech of the Minister of Defence in proposing the second reading of the Bill. Before doing so, however, I should like to recall to honorable senators a document entitled " A Ministerial Statement," which was read by the Minister of Defence on the 26th July of this year, and which we then understood to contain the well-considered programme of the Government for the balance of the present session. Amongst the questions which the Government at that time proposed to deal with was that of defence, and paragraph number 29 in that programme, as read by the Minister of Defence, was as follows: - </para>

                <para class="block">That was read to us over four months ago, and yet we now find that the Minister of Defence is absolutely without any policy. The honorable gentleman made a long and most interesting speech on Friday, and I, for one, certainly expected that he would have given an indication of some sort of policy in connexion with the very large expenditure he is asking this Chamber to vote. But all the Minister could say was that the money is to be spent in certain channels ; he never in the least attempted to convince us that they were proper channels. The Minister, so far as I can judge, is not satisfied in the least degree that the expenditure of this vast sum of money is properly applied to the defence of Australia. </para>

                    <para>This difference of opinion is not confined to writers of leading articles in the newspapers, or lo newspaper correspondents. It exists among ray own officers. Even they are not at one with regard to these very important details, and if we do not lay clown a definite scheme of defence, and determine upon a certain objective, the happy-go-lucky system that has prevailed ever since the establishment of the Commonwealth is sure to continue. </para>

                <para class="block">Do not those words thoroughly justify my statement that the Minister's own military advisers are at loggerheads as to the proper expenditure of the large sum of money we are asked to vote - that they are not prepared to advise him that the money is being spent to the best purpose, so as to attain efficient defence for Australia. Under circumstances like these, it is marvellous that the Minister should ask us to vote even a penny towards a system of defence which has been criticised by the Colonial Defence Committee, so far as one can judge from Lt. -Col. Bridges' comments, in a very unfavorable manner. I propose to deal with that question later on, and shall not further refer to it at the present moment. The position simply is that in the! Defence Department there prevails nothing but chaos. </para>

                        <para>- It is a most extraordinary situation, indicative of absolute chaos in the Defence Department, when we find one or more military officers going out of their way to advise the Minister on an exclusively naval matter. Naturally, the Minister referred the question to Captain Creswell, who then made a report to the best of his ability. I do not intend to deal with that report now. I merely call attention to the fact, as indicating the chaos that prevails in the management of this Department.

Every honorable member makes a specially of a certain class of legislation. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens,</inline> I fancy, is specially interested in white labour, and the development of the sugar industry in Queensland; I am specially interested in defence matters, and, perhaps, pay less attention than I should to a consideration of the extravagant bounties paid for the production of sugar, and to the price we are paying for the development of the sugar industry, perhaps without adequate results. I advocated an efficient Council of Defence, which would meet frequently, and which, including Members of Parliament, would look into these matters, and would not permit them to drift in the way they 'have been drifting. We find on <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford's</inline> own statement that, although the Council of Defence was authorized last session, and constituted at the beginning of this year, it has met only once. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator should not have said that it had met only once, unless he was sure of it. I could wish that he would not contradict me when I repeat what he has said, because that makes it a little difficult to continue my speech. I am assuming all along that what the honorable senator said is strictly accurate. The Minister said that the Council of Defence had met on only one occasion, and even then, arrived at no conclusion, The honorable senator further drew a most entertaining picture in which Captain Creswell, the one representative of the Naval Board, was shown on the one hand with two. three, or four representatives of the Military Board on the other, and all engaged in a heated controversial discussion as to whether or not it was necessary to have a military or a naval force. </para>

                        <para>- I am afraid <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> has not acquired the art of using words to conceal his thoughts. The honorable senator always says exactly what he means. However, it is really most serious that this body, from whom we anticipated such great results, should have proved to be such an , absolute failure. We expected that the Council of Defence would take very deep interest in the question of defence, and would call upon responsible officers to prepare schemes for putting the defence of Australia on a proper basis. But they have apparently done nothing of the kind. They held one meeting, at which nothing was done, and the defence organization has been left entirely as it was left by Major-General Hutton. " The officers are practically without any control but that of the Minister, who is a tyro at the business, and admits that he has not had any previous experience of questions of defence. Each officer would appear to do practically as he pleases in his Own branch of the Department. </para>

                        <para>- I am not aware of the routine followed, but it is obvious that the responsibility must lie with the Government, and primarily with the Minister of Defence. At the present moment the honorable senator is apparently engaged in trying to make up his own mind as <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> what would be a proper scheme of defence for the Commonwealth. I fancy that at the present moment, owing, to a very large extent, to the report of the Defence Committee in England, he is himself absolutely confused in his views. At one moment I gather from the honorable senator's interjections that he is in favour of basing our defence on the establishment of the nucleus of an Australian Navy, and at another moment I find him advocating brigade organization. </para>

                        <para>- I am very glad to have elicited an opinion from the honorable senator. I am to understand, then, that he is not in favour of the brigade organization suggested by Major-General Hutton? What it all comes to is that we now have a definite expression of opinion from the honorable senator that the inauguration) of a naval policy is the right scheme for us. to adopt. But as I pointed out to the Senate only two or three days ago, I would ask what possible chance has such a scheme of finding favour with a Cabinet containing <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ewing?</inline> Honorable senators may laugh, but this is no laughing matter, because we can never have any scheme of defence adopted until there is unanimity on the part of the Cabinet. </para>

                        <para>- I have no desire to use any offensive words whatever. I recognise fuMy the right of the honorable gentlemen to whom I have referred to hold their individual opinions. I do not even say that their opinions are wrong. I desire to say nothing offensive; but I say that, while they hold those opinions, they are an absolute bar to unanimity in the Cabinet. Every member of the Senate must be prepared to agree with me in that. It appears that in August of last year, the' Government appealed to the Colonial Defence Committee for a report on Colonial defences, and that, through they medium of the Governor-General, they were favoured with what is apparently a secret document. We are? unable to press the Minister of Defence to furnish us with the report <inline font-style="italic">in extensor ;</inline> but, in order to meet our very natural desire to know the gist of it, he appears to have asked Captain Creswell, and certain members of the Military Board, for a report. <inline font-style="italic">En passant,</inline> I may say that I entirely disagree with the remarks which fell from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> in this connexion. My own impression is - and it is one which is prevalent in England, and which I have seen quoted more than once - that if the defences of a country are in a thoroughly satisfactory condition, and the forces are able to give a good account of themselves in time of war, it need not hesitate or fear about publicity. It is only when there is something to conceal ; it is only when our forts are shell-traps, and when our guns are, to a very large extent, thoroughly out-of-date and inadequate, that secrecy becomes desirable. . </para>

                        <para>- I agree with the honorable senator, that if there is anything which concerns other people, it should be kept secret, but nothing which has been placed before the Senate by the Minister can be said to concern anybody but ourselves in any sense. I have read very carefully the reports of the officers to whom he referred, and 1 do not find that they allude to matters of British interest, as apart from matters of Australian interest. All we know about the Colonial Defence Committee's report has to be gleaned from the reports of Captain Creswell and Lt. -Col. Bridges. Captain Creswell was asked by the Minister to say in what way the opinions expressed by the Colonial Defence Committee could affect the existing or proposed organization of the naval branch of the defences, and what would be the) result, if their views were concurred in. Oi» Friday last we heard the opinion of Captain Creswell. Shortly, it was that if the views of the Colonial Defence Committee were concurred in, there would be no necessity to frame any Naval Estimates, that the entire Naval Force of the Commonwealth would be swept away. It is evident that that was the object of the Barton Administration. . After adopting the Naval Agreement, they very reluctantly left the germ of a Naval Force still existing in Australia; and, as somebody outside expressed the situation to me, they had not the pluck or the- energy to cut down the tree, but they ring-barked it, leaving it to perish from want of sustenance. That is apparently the position at the present moment. The naval side! of our defence system can hardly be said to exist, and in spite of very . great pressure which has been brought to bear upon the Government, in spite of the Prime Minister's avowed opinions as published in the press, we find no provision made on the Estimates of the current year for the extension of our naval defences. The object that the Colonial Defence Committee have in view is very apparent. One can read between the line's quite easily, and see that they believe that the British Government should have entire control of every class of naval defence. They are unwilling that we, as Australians, should have even the nucleus, the nursery, of a Navy independently of the British Government. They believe that every naval officer throughout' the British Dominions should be in the British Navy, and not in a Colonial Navy of any description. We can hardly be expected to agree with their finding. It is on a question of accepted British policy that they have condemned Captain Creswell's scheme. It can hardly be maintained by any speaker that <inline font-style="italic">H</inline> is unacceptable in itself.  His  proposals, brought up to date by the 13gh.fi of experience in recent wars, have been placed before the Senate by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford.</inline> They embrace the provision of three cruiser destroyers, sixteen torpedo-boat destroyers, and fifteen torpedo-boats, first and second class. I do not propose to go into details, because I am not in a position to criticise the scheme. We are only entitled at the present moment to deal with the question on the broadest possible issue. Nobody can possibly take exception to Captain Creswell's proposal, because, as I pointed out on Thursday last, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Balfour,</inline> the British Prime Minister, has laid it down as one of the chief, features of the defence of Great Britain from invasion, that they have a fleet of torpedo craft of various sizes ; that it would be. almost impossible for any transports to land troops close to Great Britain while the 119 torpedo-boats remained effective and able to attack ; that the feeling of insecurity would almost demoralize the enemy's fleet ; that they would be unable to anchor at night for fear of a torpedo attack ; and that any fear of invasion on that coast would be almost nullified. That is exactly what we want to effect in connexion with the defence of Australia. We wish to nullify, as far as possible, any chance of a fleet coming down with transports and landing troops. We do not want to have a large field force with which to attack an expeditionary force after it has landed on our coast. What we desire to do is to produce such a feeling of insecurity on the part of the enemy that they would never attempt to land. </para>

                        <para>- On the contrary, I. think that, from the trade point of view, the enemy would undoubtedly attempt to occupy a harbour like that, because Great Britain has just taken steps to turn Singapore into a naval base. A glance at the map in my hand will reveal to any one the immense importance of that base, because it occupies a position from which the British Fleet could absolutely bar the passage of enemy's ships from the Pacific to the Indian Ocean, or <inline font-style="italic">vice versa.</inline> There is a string of small islands lying between Asia and Australia, and only a very few surveyed passages between them. Under these circumstances, ah enemy's fleet, situated with a base at Port Darwin, would be a very great menace to all Australian trade, and a very great source of inconvenience to British naval operations in, time of war. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> can see that for himself. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator forgets that the assumption is that such an expedition would only be possible after the supremacy of the British Fleet had been destroyed. The British Fleet itself would still remain, but it would have been broken up, and the supremacy of the sea would have been lost. Those would be the circumstances under which such an invasion would be possible. The peculiar point is that in the Naval Agreement no provision is made for such a class of defence as that advocated by Captain Creswell. We are asked to believe that the British Fleet of battle-ships is quite sufficient for our defence, without any coastal or harbor defence such as he advocates. </para>

But owing to the influence of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest and other members of his Cabinet, he took no steps to give effect to that idea. He, like <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin,</inline> knew perfectly well what ought to be done: </para>

The working population of Australia who have to live by their brains instead of by their inherited wealth are sufficiently sagacious to understand that it is not all right. I am satisfied that the bulk of the people of Australia are dissatisfied with the present state of affairs. We have had Prime Minister after Prime Minister in Australia thoroughly imbued with the sense of what is right and necessary for the country, but always hampered by the octopus clinging around their necks and stifling the decision of the Cabinet. </para>

But the Senate knows perfectly well to whom I refer. The class of vessels which I have described are necessary as a reasonable defence for Great Britain. They are equally essential for Australia ; and if the Admiralty opposes Captain Creswell's scheme it does so simply because it desires to have the whole control of naval matters in its own hands, not on its merits as a defensive scheme. </para>

If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> has secret sources of information, well and good ; but I doubt whether they are as reliable as was the information given to the Senate by the Minister of Defence. I do not wish to particularize as to the details of Captain Creswell's scheme, but in general terms it seems to supply exactly what Australia calls for. The theory upon which it is based is undoubtedly sound. No one can deny that. The details of course would require to be worked" out carefully. I do not propose to discuss them now. Captain Creswell lays particular stress upon the absolute necessity of having torpedo craft for the defence of Torres Straits. He points out that one enemy's cruiser could enter the STraits and hold the entire Northern trade of Australia absolutely at its mercy. because the guns at the Thursday Island fort do not command vessels at sea. They are" simply for the purpose of defending the coaling station. But he says that if we had these ships no enemy's cruiser would dare enter the Straits at all. Our shipping, therefore, would be absolutely protected by the mere fact that we owned these torpedo boats. The Minister of Defence represents Captain Creswell .as having said, in the course of conversation - </para>

But if she knew that we had a torpedo boat or two, and a few destroyers cruising about, she would never dare to put her nose inside. </para>
                <para class="block">The point is that the mere knowledge that we had these means of defence would deter an enemy's cruiser from interfering with our commerce. But there is another point with which it is necessary to deal, and that is that a few boats of this class are absolutely necessary to police our own waters. -The pearling fleets have to a large extent, I believe, altered their head-quarters, and now <inline font-style="italic">rendezvous</inline> at some foreign port. There is nothing to prevent them from .coming down and fishing for shell in our territorial waters with labour that is prohibited by our laws. We are absolutely powerless to resent such an incursion upon our rights. We have no ships of any kind to protect our own fishing waters. </para>

                        <para>- I now come to the report of Lt.-Col. Bridges upon Major-General Hutton's defence organization. It is a most interesting document. The gist of it appears to be this : That we have nothing to fear from territorial aggression; that is to say, from a large scheme of invasion of Australia. What the Defence Committee says is that territorial aggression would be impossible, because the difficulties and risks would be so considerable that it is inconceivable than an enemy would take them. Therefore the contingency of territorial aggression by a large force need not be taken into account in considering the requirements of Australian defence. The deduction is that the Military Forces o'f the Commonwealth as at present organized do not meet our war requirements at all. The Defence Committee goes on to point out that the existing organization can be made use of to a certain extent. That view Lt.-Col. Bridges confirms. The Committee recommends alterations in the constitution of the field force : but what it particularly lays stress upon is the system of brigading, to which I . called attention on Thursday as absolutely useless. It is urged that the brigading should be carried out on the lines of military districts. What is meant is not quite clear. </para>

                        <para>- No, Colonial Governments consult the Committee. I suppose it represents the best expert opinion we can get, making allowance for the natural bias of the members of the Committee in favour of Great Britain. The Committee urges that the Defence Force of Australia should be created in districts, and, Lt.-Col. Bridges goes out of his way, as I think, to translate the word "district " into " State." It seems to me. as a civilian, that the organization ought to be arranged in reference to the possibility of attack in the immediate neighbourhood where the forces are located. </para>

Under this absurd system of brigading, Western Australia is" denuded of nearly all her troops, except 800 men, and the troops which go are taken to much more populous States, in order that the brigade system for foreign aggression may be successfully carried out. </para>

                        <para>- And South Australia. Those troops have to go to the head-quarters of their brigade directly a state of war is declared. That is the meaning of the word "brigade" - they have to be brigaded together. We cannot have a brigade with one half of the troops and an officer in Queensland, and the other half, without an officer, in some other part of the Commonwealth. </para>

If it is not so, it only shows the absurdity of the scheme under which, for some red-tape purposes, the brigades are constituted in this way.

It is a system, however, that every Minister of Defence of the Commonwealth has been perfectly satisfied with. Those gentlemen, to whose care we have intrusted the defences of Australia, have cared so little about going into details, that they are absolutely ignorant of this vital blot on the system. </para>

                        <para>- How can I criticise it? It is simply because I have read up the matter, and they have not. A Minister of Defence sits and signs a few documents which are thrust under his nose, and then goes and has a parliamentary lunch. I acquit the present Minister of Defence, but some Ministers believe that they are simply in office for the purposes of entertainment. </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable and learned senator had only been in his place last Thursday he would have heard the difference explained at length. The brigade system means that a certain cavalry brigade of Tasmania will be carried away to Victoria, and Tasmania left without any cavalry; that the cavalry of Western, Australia will be taken round to Adelaide, and brigaded with the cavalry of South Australia; and that, in the case of the infantry brigades, the foot regiments of Western Australia, South Australia, and Tasmania will be carried away to Brisbane. That is Major-General Hutton's much vaunted brigade system, which was arranged for the purpose of dumping those troops down on some foreign port for aggression. Major-General Hutton set out the whole scheme perfectly clearly in his report, which was placed before Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- All I can say, then, is that it is a pity to have a red-tape organization which is to go for nothing in time of war. If the honorable and learned senator would take the trouble to consult Major-General Finn, or any other authority, he will find that it is the general opinion that nothing is more disadvantageous than a military organization which has to be swept away directly war is declared. That is the very point on which one always finds military experts laying particular stress in private conversation. They point out that it was that system which was fatal to the British Army in the Boer war, when the peace organization had to be swept away and an entirely new system adopted on the spur of the moment. </para>

                        <para>- Does the honorable and learned senator consider that an attack could be itemized like that? Captain Creswell, in his report, pointed out that signals would be given at some spot that the enemy's fleet was approaching. Doubtless, the fleet would go down the coast, and nobody would know where they were for some time. The whole coast would be in a state of alarm, and the troops would be mobilized to defend their respective districts, not because the attack would necessarily be, but in anticipation that it might be, delivered there. At the last moment, when the attack was delivered, it would be too late to mobilize at any given spot. Surely <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> understands that? At the last moment, say, twenty-four hours before the attack, when the signal was given that the enemy was off Cape Howe, or some other part of the coast, how could the troops be mobilized there? This discussion has arisen out of my comments on  Colonel Bridges,  and his apparent incapacity to see that State boundaries have nothing to do with defence. This is Australian defence, and not State defence. These petty, little boundaries, which exist between State and State, should, in the matter of Australian defence, be swept from our consideration. </para>

                <para>SenatorMATHESON.- It is quite accidental that Western Australia is in that position, which arises from the fact that she is cut off from the rest of Australia by a line drawn from north to south. That is why Western Australia can be dealt with as a whole district, though, in my opinion, that State will have to be divided into two, if not three, sub-districts for the purpose of mobilization. The Minister appears to believe that it is a recommendation of the Defence Committee that the Military Forces in each State should be kept quite distinct, but I find no justification for that belief in the report. </para>

My position, therefore, is a troublesome one. The first man you meet in the street, who fancies that he knows everything about defence matters, will at once unfold a plan to you, but the very next man you meet has quite a different scheme to propound. </para>

                        <para>- Does the honorable senator expect us to vote the same sum of money next year, to be spent upon what has been admitted apparently by every person who has reported upon it as an inadequate provision for defence? That is what I should like to know, because that is what we are being asked to do to-day. </para>

                    <para>Another suggestion of the Colonial Defence Committee is that the establishments (peace and war) should be revised. If effect be given to this suggestion, the peace establishment of the Field Artillery Batteries would be increased, and the war establishment of the Light Horse would be reduced by some 1,900 officers and men, and consequently a smaller quantity of equipment would have to be provided. </para>

                        <para>- I am showing that I am not unreasonable, because I have been directing the attention of successive Governments to the state of affairs that exists. They have paid no attention to the criticisms which have been offered, and I do not expect that any attention will be paid to them next year, or the year after that. To return to the Appropriation Bill and the report laid before us by the Minister, the most astonishing thing is that while the Government advisers admit that it is impossible to frame any policy until the attack to which we are likely to be subjected is defined, we find them in the frankest possible way prepared with a cut-and-dried scheme for arming our fortresses. </para>

According to the honorable senator's statement, there are to be four 9. 2 -inch guns, which will cost £122,000; eighteen 7. 5-inch guns at a cost of £324,000; and thirty-four 12pounders at a cost of £76,000, making a total of £522,000.

                        <para>- Then what was the good of mentioning it? Of what use is it to say that we require 9.2-inch guns unless the Minister is satisfied that a certain class of attack will be developed? Why should the Minister mention 9.2-inch guns at all until he has decided the class of ship that is going to attack our forts? As a matter of fact, I believe that his advisers have made up their minds to get 9.2-inch guns for certain favoured harbors. </para>

                        <para>- Fort Forrest is not yet built, as a matter of fact. It is particularly amusing to find Lt.-Col. Bridges laying down 9.2-inch as the highest calibre of gun which it is necessary to put in any fort, because I presume that that is his opinion, otherwise it would not have been put in print. If that is not his opinion, it was absolutely unnecessary to bring it before the Senate. When he was asked by the Minister to demolish my speech he said, " Why stop at 9.2-inch guns ? If we are going to deal with an armoured cruiser, why not have 12-inch guns?" He was perfectly aware of the folly of his remark, as may be shown by the fact that he does not advocate a 12 -inch gun for any fort in Australia. That in itself is the bes.t possible answer I could give to his comment in ridicule of my proposal. I now come to the question of arming the fort at Fremantle. The Minister referred my speech to two military experts, namely, Colonel Owen and Lt. -Col. Bridges, and in my defence I wish to deal very shortly with their remarks. Colonel Owen's theory is that to shell the shipping at Fremantle the enemy's ship would have to come inside a certain! zone, which would' be within a range at which' the 6-inch gun could penetrate the armour. If we believe that a ship is deliberately going to run into that zone without first taking step's, to silence the fort, his arguments are reasonable. But "I and1 many other persons do not believe that the enemy's ship would do anything of the kind. If the ship be an armoured cruiser, such as, the Colonial Defence Committee indicated we might expect attacks from, I believe that with its 9.2-inch guns she would silence the 7.5-inch guns in Fort Forrest. Lt.-Col. Bridges goes into elaborate calculations about the penetrative power of shell, but unfortunately he does not give a single range from which we could check his calculations. He simply gives the penetrative power at an unknown range, and, in addition to that, he points out that there is no reason why we should not have a 12 -inch gun instead of a 9. 2 -inch gun. ' Personally, I am content with the latter. But the point is that if it is expected that only unarmoured cruisers will attack Fremantle, I do not consider that there is the least justification for saying that anything stronger than unarmoured cruisers are likely to attack either Melbourne or Sydney. In these circumstances, if a 9.2-inch gun is quite unnecessary for Fremantle, it is equally unnecessary for either Melbourne or Sydney. On the other hand, if the Military Department is satisfied that those guns are wanted in either Melbourne or Sydney, they are equally wanted at Fremantle, and that opinion is borne out by everybody who is not solely interested in the defence of either Melbourne or Sydney. I now come to the question of field artillery. I cannot help thinking that the Minister makes a very grave mistake - of course at the instigation of his military advisers - when he says that we have eighty up-to-date field guns. His estimate is that we have twenty-four 18 pounders; these guns are under order, and will shortly be in the country. I give him these. Then he says that we have forty-eight 15 pounders. From a return furnished to the Senate on the 28th July, 1904, we gather that at that date there were thirty 15 pounder guns in the Commonwealth, and that six 12 pounder guns were in England to be converted, bringing the total number up to thirty-six. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> be right, twelve more of these guns must have been converted since that date, in defiance of a statement made to the other House last year by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McCay</inline> to the effect that after looking into the matter, he stopped the conversion of any more of the 15-pounder guns. At an early date last year I called the attention of the Senate to the fact, and it became apparent from the figures which were then submitted, that it was most reckless extravagance to have these guns converted, instead of purchasing, 18-pounder guns. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McCay</inline> looked into this question, and, so far as one can gather from Hansard, he apparently thoroughly agreed with that point of view, and stated that the conversion of these guns would be stopped. It never made the guns efficient or up-to-date. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford's</inline> figures are right, twelve guns have been converted since that time. As his military advisers are not present, it is not fair to expect him to give an answer at the moment, but I trust that he will look into the matter, and give us further information. I now come to the analysis of twenty-eight of these guns last year. Only sixteen of the twenty-eight guns had a modern breech arrangement, and twelve had an old mechanism, and were at that date practically obsolete. So that, at any rate, twelve of the guns with which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> is so pleased have what is officially described as an "obsolete breech mechanism." If these twelve guns have been converted in spite of what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McCay</inline> said, all I can say is that it is simply scandalous. One point, however, on which we can thoroughly congratulate the Minister is the provision of military education. What he said on that subject was by far the most satisfactory statement he made during his whole speech. I gather that an arrangement has been made with Sydney University for the establishment of a Chair. It is not perfectly clear what the Chair is to be, but I understand that an arrangement is being made by which officers can be educated in Australia to a standard at which they cart receive commissions in the British Army. </para>

                        <para>- To my mind, it is extremely important and desirable that a similar system should be introduced in connexion with the naval cadetships. It is considered a very great hardship that pare'nts who desire to participate in the naval cadetships, which are offered to Australian boys, should be obliged to send their sons to England when they are extremely young, and perhaps have no friends or homes there to go to during rh holidays. It is not right that parents should be expected to practically lose touch of their sons during the most interesting stage of their career, when they are most susceptible to all sorts of influence, and when it is most necessary that they should have the influence of home. If the Minister could turn his attention to that state of affairs, and endeavour to get a similar arrangement made in connexion with the naval cadetship, it would be a very desirable thing. I do not know if he has thought about it at all. </para>

                        <para>- There ought to be some method of training the boys in the country to which they belong. It ought not to be necessary to send them to England for that purpose. If it is possible for the British Government to make an arrangement in connexion with' commissions in the Army, it seems to me that it would be equally possible to make an arrangement in connexion with cadetships in the Navy. When the Minister was making his speech, a question arose in. connexion with volunteers and militia, and he took exception to my statement that Major-General Hutton's view was that all the troops should be turned into militia, and that there should be no volunteers, as I stated, in order that he might be able to send them abroad in time of war - a thing which he could not do <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> the case of volunteers. I have taken the trouble to look up <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> The original Defence Bill contained a clause under which every person in the Defence Forces could be sent compulsorily abroad, including the members of rifle clubs. After the Bill was read a second time, it was withdrawn bv <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest. At a later date, he introduced a Defence Bill containing this clause - </para>

                <para class="block">That was Major-General Hutton's object in turning all the volunteers into militia. On the 5th August, 1903, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Higgins</inline> moved to strike out the clause. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest s.poke strongly in favour of its retention. He contended that it was perfectly absurd to maintain any forces if the Minister of Defence might not send them wherever he liked. He spoke of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Higgins'</inline> idea as a " little Australia " idea. He did his very bes.t to prevent the clauses from being eliminated, but it was rejected, and so the most objectionable feature of his measure was removed. I merely call attention to that, because it seems to be thought by some honorable senators that I was mistaken when I interjected on Friday that the militia had been organized simply to avoid having any volunteers, whose services could not be made available outside Australia. As to the special appropriation of the Minister, in which he has cut out the cost of making saddles, accoutrements, and saddle-trees,, I have nothing to say. I cam only express the hope that the alterations he proposes to make will turn out to lie all right. It is impossible for us to criticise departmental arrangements of that sort. We must accept them as they come before us. But I trust that the Minister has given these matters his personal study in a way that he maintains previous Ministers were not called upon to do with the scheme of organization. Now, I have done with defence, and I propose to call attention to the vote for the Vancouver mail service. I have already stated my opinion on that matter, but as a vote appears in the Appropriation Bill, I must criticise it as a waste of money. It is not a mail service, nor is it in any other way of advantage to Australia. The position appears to be this : I gather from the English newspapers that the action of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne in adding railway freight to the invoice value of goods for Customs purposes, has rendered it almost certain that Canada cannot ship goods to Australia by this subsidized line. Therefore, we find exactly the same position brought about as exists in regard to the Pacific Islands. We subsidize a line of steamers to the Pacific, with the object of encouraging and developing trade with the islands, and we bar all the products of those countries, by prohibitive duties, from entering the Commonwealth. We deliberately take steps by our protective Tariff to prevent the successful operation of the bounties which we pay to shipping companies. Exactly the same kind of thing happens in connexion with the Vancouver mail service. We pay a large subsidy to a steam-ship company to promote trade between Canada and Australia, and then bv our ridiculous protective Tariff, we render it absolutely impossible for that trade to develop. Can anything be more absurd ? Could there be a more ridiculous waste of money than to persist in such a policy? </para>

                        <para>- The facts are these : An application was apparently made by the Australian Government to the Colonial Secretary to allow the picture to be brought out to Australia, because it was said that it was of public interest. The picture was apparently sent out by the Victorian Agent-General, who particularly interested himself in the matter, at the expense of the Commonwealth. It was exhibited in Parliament House at the expense of the Commonwealth, and I believe that it has been circulated from State to State at the expense of the Commonwealth. I have the strongest objection to that picture as an historical representation of what took place at the inauguration of this Parliament. There are people represented in the picture who were not present at the ceremony. There are the portraits of persons amongst the senators who were not at that time senators. There is a certain <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Saunders,</inline> who was not a senator at that time, and yet I can assure honorable senators that his face may be seen rising like a full moon over the faces of other Members of Parliament. Is that a sort of painting that any one would call an historical painting? I have no personal knowledge concerning a number of statements which have been made to me by other members of the Senate ; but I trust that when the matter comes up again they will personally make the statements in the Senate that they have made to me in connexion with the methods employed by individuals for securing the insertion of their portraits in the picture. </para>

You, sir, agreed that the picture should stand in the hall for fourteen days, but, as a matter of fact, it . stood there for sixteen. I consider it most objectionable that these things should be done and Parliament kept in the dark. </para>

If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce's</inline> suggestion be adopted, business, instead of being expedited, will be retarded. There is not the slightest doubt that honorable senators would have addressed themselves to the second reading but for the desire which I have indicated. I do not suggest to the Minister that he should either accept or decline to adopt the suggestion made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> But the Minister ought to know exactly what has happened. If progress be reported now, honorable senators will, as I say, have refrained from speaking without gaining the object they had in view. </para>

I had not anticipated that the debate on the second reading would have terminated until, at any rate, late to-night. I recognise the force of what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has said on the one hand, and also what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> has said on the other, and I. only wish I could agree with both. There is no doubt that some honorable senators who have left the Chamber may desire to address themselves to some of the items in the early part of the schedule; and if we were to proceed, the Government might be asked to recommit certain items. </para>

I may begin by saying that this proposal was carried in another place. The first reference which I can find to the question of a national memorial to Queen Victoria is in a despatch signed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain,</inline> and dated from Downing-street on 10th June, 1901. It is addressed to the Governor-General of Australia, and is as follows : - </para>

                    <para>You are doubtless aware that a. Committee was, in February last, appointed by His Majesty the King to consider the best means of giving effect to the desire which is so universally felt that a memorial of Her late Majesty Queen. Victoria, Imperial and not local in its character, should be erected in London as the metropolis and centre of the Empire over which she ruled for more than sixty years. The recommendation of the Committee was in favour of a memorial of a strictly personal and monumental kind, in which a statue of her late Majesty should form a most prominent feature ; and the King expressed his approval of this proposal and of the site in front of Buckingham. Palace which has been selected. The general idea of the scheme is to place in front of the Palace a group or groups of statuary, of which the statue of Queen Victoria will form the central figure, and; if funds admit, to form an imposing architectural and processional approach to the main group, of statuary and to the Palace, with statues at intervals representative of the Colonies and Dependencies of the Empire. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">The subject was also considered at an Imperial Conference relating to Colonial affairs, and there an undertaking was arrived at that New Zealand and other portions of the Empire would each bear a certain proportion of the expense. As to her late Majesty, we are all aware that during her long reign she endeared herself to the whole of her people. In all her relations of life - as girl Queen, wife, mother, widow, and constitutional monarch - her conduct won the admiration and respect of all her subjects. It is somewhat appropriate that a motion of this kind should be submitted in the State in which we are met. Victoria was named after the late Queen, and the capital city of the State was named after her first Prime Minister, Lord Melbourne, who directed her when she, as a mere girl, ascended the throne, and instructed her in those lessons of constitutional government which she remembered and followed for the rest of her life. To Lord Melbourne a deep debt of gratitude was owing, not only by the Queen, but by all her subjects. It may be said that Queen Victoria saw the growth of Australia from the time when it consisted of the three Colonies of New South Wales, Tasmania, and Western Australia, until it developed into the Commonwealth. She granted or approved of the constitutions that were conceded to the various divisions of this continent by the Imperial Parliament, and her crowning work, just before she died, was to sign the Constitution under which we live. Thus, the late Queen survived .to see the Australian Commonwealth firmly established. One virtue of Queen Victoria, of which we are justly proud, is that she was content " to be .throughout a constitutional monarch. She governed on- precedents that were established partly in the reign of William and Mar)-, and partly in the reign of the first and second Georges, and, subsequently, under the influence of Whig traditions. I have no recollection of her late Majesty ever having shown the slightest feeling of antagonism to any of her Prime Ministers. Of course, we know that in the case of Lord Palmerston she on one occasion objected very strongly to his dealing with despatches without her knowledge, and the result was that he had to retire from office. However, in the course of about- eighteen months Lord Palmerston was again Prime Minister, and the Queen gave him her unbounded confidence, although I have no doubt she felt rather keenly that he had treated her some- what unfairly. The Queen always .recognised that the man who had the confidence of the Commons was the .man who ought to be entrusted with the formation of die Ministry, and the Prime Minister, whoever he might be, always had her loyal support. As to the proposed memorial, it is, estimated tq cost £1,000,000, of which the Colonies will, it is believed, contribute £100,000. To quote a statement made in another place - </para>

                    <para>The improvements which have been taking place in London in recent years have altered great portions of that old city almost beyond recognition, and this memorial is intended to be the crowning part of 1 one of these .great schemes of improvement and beautification. The idea is that the contribution of the mother country - as far as I am aware it has not been voted yet - will be about nine-tenths of the total sum. The remaining portions of the Empire which have acted already are Canada, which has voted ^30,000, Cape Colony, which has voted ^20,000, New Zealand, which has voted .£15,000, Natal, which has voted ,£10,000, and Newfoundland, which has voted <inline font-style="italic">£2,000.</inline> Measuring them roughly by order of population, it has been estimated that on this scale a grant of ,£25,000 on the part of Australia will represent its fair contribution to the fund. That means that the outer Empire, so to speak, is expected to contribute about <inline font-style="italic">£100,000</inline> of the <inline font-style="italic">£.1,000,000,</inline> almost the whole of which will be devoted to the provision of a statue of the Queen, surrounded by statues or other emblems representative of all parts of the Empire over which she ruled. </para>

One honorable senator has given notice that he intends to move the addition of the following words - provided that such memorial be a public hospital to be erected in an Australian city chosen by the Commonwealth Parliament. </para>
                <para class="block">If before she died Her late Majesty Queen Victoria had been informed that some memorial was to be erected in her honour, and had been asked whether it should take the form of the memorial to which I have alluded, or that indicated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> I have my doubts as u&gt; the answer which she would have /given. Knowing as we do how charitable she was, it is -possible that she would have said, " Erect some institution which will be at the same time a memorial of me and useful to the poor and needy of my kingdom." But it must <inline font-style="italic">he</inline> remembered that in this case we have not a determining voice. We must to some extent follow others, since we are contributing a mere moiety of the large sum which it is proposed to expend.

In the circumstances, I hope <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> will not press his amendment. No doubt the honorable senator and many other persons believe that it would be better that the memorial should take the form he has suggested ;; but as we are contributing only so small a proportion of the amount to be expended, and as. the proposal has been elaborated, considered, and practically decided, I hope the amendment will not be pressed. The honorable senator suggests a further amendment to the following effect : - </para>

                <para>The idea of erecting a national memorial to the late Queen was mooted before the inauguration of the Commonwealth, and it was then suggested that the proposal might be given effect to by means of private subscriptions, and in other ways. My own idea is that there is not a man or woman in the Commonwealth who has any knowledge of the late Queen Victoria wEb, no matter how poor he or she might be, would begrudge contributing what would amount to something like ijd. each for the purpose of erecting a memorial to a Queen who was so much beloved. I think that the people of the Commonwealth would prefer to contribute in this way than that the rich of the community should be asked for subscriptions. They would prefer a national' memorial, to which every member of the community could contribute. The motion I ' have moved has been agreed to in another place. The .£25,000 amounts to a very small sum per head of the population of the Commonwealth, and under the motion rich and poor will contribute alike. The only way in which that can be arranged is by taking the money required for the purpose from the Consolidated Revenue, to which all the people of the Commonwealth subscribe. This must be admitted to be preferable to any proposal to ask for private subscriptions, under which a few rich people would possibly advertise themselves to a considerable extent by having their subscriptions paraded in the newspapers. It is far better that we should all subscribe the very small sum per head involved in the vote towards the memorial of the good Queen, who kept her Court so pure. Those of us who have any knowledge of the Courts of George I., George II., George IV., and even of William IV., who preceded the late Queen, and who have read in Greville's <inline font-style="italic">Memoirs</inline> of her early days as a Queen, must hold her memory in high regard on account of the way in which she purified her Court. I have very much pleasure in moving the motion. </para>

                    <para>- I am sure we all agree with what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> has said about the late Queen Victoria. There can be no doubt that she filled the position of Sovereign very worthily much more worthily, I believe, than did some of her predecessors. It is only natural, probably, that the people of the Empire should desire to signalize in some way a reign which was so momentous from the social, industrial, and political aspect. I find no fault with the central idea of this motion. The Victorian era has probably been one of the most wonderful in history, and it is fitting that it should be signalized in some way. The Minister of Defence, in introducing the motion, stated that the memorial is to take the form of an avenue with a number of statues in London. The honorable senator also said, and I agree with him, that if the late Queen herself had had an opportunity of choosing in what way her memory should be perpetuated, the probability is that she would have decided in favour of the amendment I propose. It is perfectly well-known that Her late Majesty was a sincere sympathizer with suffering of . every kind, and that she disliked show and ostentation was proved by the comparative privacy in which she spent her long life and her long reign. I repeat that I have no objection to the leading idea of the motion, but what I do object to is that the memorial should take the form proposed. I ask honorable senators to say what good a number of statues on a fine street in London will do to any one ? It is proposed to spend a very large sum of money. Of course, we have nothing to do with how the people of Great Britain, of Canada, and other portions of the Empire spend their money. That is their business. What we have to do is to say that the memorial proposed is not one that would be an effective expression of our feelings towards the late Queen. In the first place, any Australian memorial to Queen Victoria should be situated in Australia. I think also that the. memorial ought to be such as would express in living fashion the life and works of the late Queen. It is very generally admitted that a hospital, an institution devoted' to the amelioration of those suffering from disease, would be a much more effective tribute to "the life of Queen Victoria than any statue however nobly planned and designed it might be. We have surely got beyond the barbarous ideas of the ancient Roman Empire, when vast sums of money were spent in mere marble or stone and lime, while tens of thousands of people were permitted to live and die after suffering the greatest hardship? If we must signalize the memory of the late Queen, and I think it is desirable that we should do so, let. us adopt the means suggested by the amendment of which I have given notice. I propose to add to the second paragraph of the motion the words - </para>

                    <para>- I do not think that there is any honorable senator who will fail to recognise and appreciate the entirely sympathetic character of the remarks made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart.</inline> At the same time, I think he will be inclined to recognise that it would be a pity for Australia, at the last hour, to pass a resolution which might prevent the carrying out of a great Empire memorial. T believe I am correct in stating that the whole of the money which is wanted for this great memorial of our departed Queen has been obtained, except that which Australia is asked to contribute. Of the entire cost of  £1,000,000,  Australia is expected1 to contribute  2J  per cent. To me it is exceedingly regrettable that the idea should be entertained that there should be a great Empire memorial in which Australia is to <inline font-style="italic">be.</inline> conspicuous by her absence, although it might be that we have a memorial of our own in Australia. I do not fail to recognise the force of the remarks made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart.</inline> If, at the outset of this movement, it had been suggested that each part of the Empire should have its own memorial, then his suggestions would have come in very well, and we should have been able to discuss them with freer minds than I fear we can db to-day. It would be very regrettable if Australia should decide to stand out of this Empire memorial. T do not think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> would wish to press it, if he felt that it would in any way detract from the significance of the grant. The great thing is to do that which is best to attain our object. As we are united in a desire to make the most effective use of the money, and to do that which will most effectively and. conspicuously show our appreciation of the great and good Queen Victoria, I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> will see his way to complete our indebtedness to him by withdrawing his amendment, so that the motion may be carried by a unanimous vote. </para>

                    <para>- I think we all agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> that it would be a splendid thing if it were possible to have a big hospital erected in a cit, to be chosen by the Commonwealth Parliament, as a memorial in honour of the late Queen. But if seems to me that his proposal is not altogether practicable. Suppose that it was decided to have a large hospital erected in a city to be chosen bv the Commonwealth Parliament. It would immediately cause considerable dispute, perhaps, much ill-feeling, throughout Australia, as to the city in which it should, be erected. As we do not seem to be within measurable distance of the time when we are likely to commence the building of the Federal Capital, probably it would be some years before we could make a start with the erection of a memorial in that shape. After all, it is not a very large sum for Australia as a whole, to contribute. While. I recognise that the State I represent is. through its Parliament, always complaining that it is not retting as much revenue from the Federal Treasury as it expected to receive, and that, it is in rather an impecunious condition, still I consider that its proportion of this grant of ^25,000 - ,£1,250 - is a very small sum for its people to . contribute. Holding that the amendment is not practicable, and believing that the people of my State would not like Australia to hold aloof from this national memorial, I feel that I shall be quite justified in voting for the motion as it stands. </para>
