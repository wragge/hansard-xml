                <para class="block">Now, if we are to conform to that standing order, , and to carry it out, we cannot have another discussion on a matter which is not formal ; and I understand that the leader of the Senate desires to move that the Standing Orders be suspended, after which he will move for the printing of one of the papers which have been laid before the Senate, in order to enable him to expound the policy of the present Government. That seems to me to be a proper method of pursuing business. Because otherwise - unless another motion is made which would lead to discussion - the motion which the Minister desires to move not being formal, it could not be considered according to the Standing Orders. I understand from the leader of the Government in the Senate, that all the papers which he has laid on the table, with the exception of one, have been printed, and therefore there is no necessity for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> to move in that matter. The position is, of course, one of an extraordinary character, owing to circumstances which have supervened. I think that the leader of the Government is pursuing a proper course in moving the suspension of the Standing Orders to enable him to introduce some matter which is not formal before we have adopted the Address-in-Reply to His Excellency&#39;s speech. </para>

                        <para>- Under ordinary circumstances the Minister who has to announce the policy of a Government upon a change of Ministry, lays a paper on the table, and moves that it be printed. In submitting that motion he makes a statement to the House as to the policy of the Government, and what they propose to do in the way of work during the session of Parliament. Discussion can then take place. But we still have the Address-in-Reply to His Excellency&#39;s speech before us. </para>

                    <para>- Will my honorable friend allow me to say a word or two in order to&#39; assist him? I merely wish to suggest that we should make an end of the discussion upon the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply. My honorable friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> moved the adjournment of the debate on the last occasion. As he is not now in his place we may take it, I think, that in all probability he does not propose to proceed with the debate. But in any event the statement which my honorable friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> is to make will not prevent further debate. Therefore I think that, instead of establishing a precedent by discussing the policy of the new Government whilst we have an incomplete debate as to the policy of the late Government upon the paper, the simplest plan would be to let the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply be passed, and. then to proceed with the consideration of the policy of the new Government. </para>

After we have suspended the Standing Orders I can make my statement; then the debate will be adjourned ; then we can take up the question and finish it ; after which we can dispose of the Address-in-Reply. I may say that as far as the Government is concerned we propose to approve of the Address-in-Reply. It contains only two clauses. The first says that we are loyal people and the second clause is to the effect that we thank the Governor-General for his speech. I move - </para>

                        <para>- A statement from the Cabinet may be above a statement from the head of a Department, but it is on the same plane as other statements which are made to the Chamber. I am aware of the standing order which prohibits the reading of speeches. It must be remembered, however, that I am not making a speech, but making a Ministerial statement ; and even if I were to read a speech the Standing Orders have been suspended, and, under the circumstances, I should be at liberty to do so. That is why I declined to accept the suggestion made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon.</inline> I moved the suspension of the Standing Orders, because I foresaw the trouble which) might arise. </para>

The Minister for Defence has deliberately told us that he proposes to break that standing order, and he proceeds to break it. I ask your ruling, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> as to whether the Minister is entitled to do so. </para>

                        <para>- It has always been the practice, however, to allow honorable senators to read extracts. They can also read statements made to them, and this is a statement, I understand, in regard to matters on which the Cabinet have decided. I do not think that the standing order contemplates that extracts and statements shall not be read. I quite agree that speeches may not be read, and I do not understand that the leader of the Senate proposes to read his speech. However, at present, I do not know what the Minister proposes to do. He proposes, I think, to read some extracts. </para>

I submit that it is not competent -for the Minister of Defence to read the statement under the suspension of the Standing Orders, which has been granted to enable him merely to reverse the procedure of the Chamber in the order of business, and not to reverse the methods of transacting the business. </para>

                        <para>- I have already given my ruling, but I shall give it again if desired. Undoubtedly the leader of the Senate is not entitled to read his speech. But the question arises - Can he read a statement containing, the decision of the Cabinet in respect to the policy of the Ministry? I think the Minister can read that statement, and that he ought to be allowed to do so. I do not think we should strain the Standing Orders to the extent suggested. </para>

I do not know <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> length of the document, or what it contains, but I am not going to stop the leader of the Senate from reading, a statement of the policy on which the Ministry have decided.

                        <para>- Perhaps <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dawson</inline> will allow me to proceed. I shall not discuss the point of order, but simply point out that every honorable senator must agree - at least I do - with the limitation you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> have suggested in regard to the interpretation of the standing order. The whole difficulty has arisen from the fact that the Minister of Defence stated, with considerable emphasis, that he was going to read his speech - that he would read his speech. </para>

                        <para>- I moved the suspension of the Standing Orders to enable me to make a statement of the Government policy. I never knowingly made use of -the word &#34;speech,&#34; but tried to abstain ; if the word crept in it was inadvertently. Surely the Senate will not object to receive a statement from the Cabinet - a statement which explains and gives reasons for the policy which the Government intend to adopt? Surely the Senate will not object to me, as representing the present Ministry, reading a statement of that sort? The statement which I am desired to lay before honorable senators is as follows: - </para>
                    </talk.start>
                </continue>
                <para>An occasion of this kind would usually require some general statement from the new Administration charged with the leadership of the House; but in the present instance, in order to economize time, that can be very briefly summarized. This Ministry adheres to the practical policy sanctioned by the country at the last general election, and already submitted to this House, and exists for the purpose of giving effect to it. </para>
                <para>A majority of the members of the Cabinet are directly responsible for the programme submitted to Parliament in 1904, which was then accepted in almost every particular by our present colleagues, so that we represent to-day the same policy and the same party. </para>
                <para>The circumstances of our assumption of office prevent a formal submission of our programme in a speech from the Governor-General, but this is rendered comparatively immaterial, because the speech of His Excellency at the opening of this Parliament remains almost as completely applicable now as sixteen months ago, when it was delivered. </para>
                <para>To refresh the memories of honorable members, i will rapidly run through the programme then formulated, and now re-submitted. </para>
                <para>Taking the subjects mentioned in the order in which they appear in His Excellency&#39;s speech of March, 1904, honorable members will find - The taking over of the debts of the States (1), and compensation for transferred properties (2) mentioned in the third paragraph. The discussion on the first of these has been advanced a stage by the Hobart Conference, whilst the joint valuations for the second are now about to be commenced. </para>
                <para>As to the question of the transferred properties, I might inform honorable senators that I think we are in a fair way to arrive at some conclusion in regard to the amount of money we shall be required to pay in the form of interest at3&#189; per cent. on the value. Valuators have been appointed, and the whole matter taken in hand. In the matter of the taking over of the States debts, nothing practical was done at the Hobart Conference, since no agreement could be arrived at. The points of difference resolved: themselves into two. The States representatives unanimously desired that the provisions of the Braddon section of the Constitution should be made perpetual. The Commonwealth Treasurer at the time, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner, said, &#34; No, but I am quite willing to agree that they shall be continued in operation for another twenty years, making thirty years in all from the date of the inauguration of the Commonwealth.&#34; That was one point of difference. The other point was with respect to borrowing money in the local market. The representatives of the States desired that the whole of the borrowing in the local market should be confined to themselves, and they did not approve of the Commonwealth Government borrowing in that market. That suggestion was not agreed to by the representatives of the Commonwealth. </para>

I have made inquiries as to how they were carrying out their promise, because it is one thing to pass a resolution committing one. to do certain things, and it is quite another to do them. I find that instructions have been given in all of the States, and that preferential rates on the railways will cease in a few weeks. </para>

                        <para>- The Commonwealth permits the States to manage their railways as they please. So far as their own people are concerned, they can make what rates they please. If, for instance, there is a mine in a particular part of a State, and the State authorities think that it is desirable that the produce of that mine should be carried in a certain direction to the seaboard they can make a Tate on the traffic in that direction lower than that which they charge for traffic in other directions. That does not affect the interests of the other States. Where preferential rates injuriously affect the people of other States we step in and say that the people of the other States shall be treated in the same way as those of the State establishing the preferential rates. </para>

                        <para>- Are not the Tasmanian rates also one-sided? I shall not say they are grossly one-sided, because I do not believe they are. At all events, this is the position. If we find that there are any preferential rates established by which the people of one State are given an advantage over those of another, we can appoint an Inter-State Commission to put a stop to them. If the States Governments will agree to put a stop to them, they will relieve us of the necessity of going to considerable expense in the appointment of an Inter-State Commission, for such a &#39;Commission would be very expensive; and as the money would have to come out of their own pockets, they will be wise in the matter, we hope, and will take care to establish no preferential rates to which we can object.  </para>

                <para>In addition to these there are now measures to be brought forward this session. (27) The Government is of opinion that the constitutional method, of determining the precise time at which the representation in the House of the people of the respective States shall be increased or diminished according to their numbers is by an Act of the Parliament. The dangers of leaving changes of this character in the hands of any Ministry, and of permitting them either to be set on foot at any moment merely by Executive Order, or to be delayed at Executive will, are obvious. Parliament itself should decide, subject to the Constitution, when and in what circumstances the representation shall be altered. A Bill to accomplish this will be introduced. Another important Bill will, it is hoped, effectually suppress what are known as Secret Commissions so far as they exist in the field of Commonwealth jurisdiction. (28) In the light of the evidence before the Butter Commission the urgency of coping with the evil will be generally appreciated. </para>

                    <para>Several Bills considered in part last session will be revived by resolution, and, where necessary new amendments will be added. </para>
                    <para>Among other matters engaging the serious attention of Ministers, and upon which it is intended at a later date to make proposals of an important character, that of Defence (29) . is specially deserving of reconsideration, particularly in view of recent developments. </para>

                    <para>This list of subjects may be divided into two parts. The first is made up of minor Bills, aiming at useful but independent additions to the ordinary machinery of Government. The other consists of major Bills, embodying a progressive policy of development of the resources of the Commonwealth, intended to be carried out by systematic effort here and in the Mother Country, and, if necessary, in the sister dominions of the Empire. </para>
                    <para>It may not be possible to complete this programme, though with the help of Parliament a great advance can be made before the next recess. The policy as a whole can be pushed far onward if we are able to follow a business-like session this year with a longer session next year, devoted to questions of the first magnitude, approached steadily and consistently from the practical side. At all events, so far as Ministers are concerned, this Parliament will be afforded, as it has itself demanded, another opportunity of fulfilling the purposes for which it was elected&#39;, and justifying the confidence of those who look to us to foster the national interests of Australia. </para>

                        <para>- What does it matter about an official position in which there is nothing to do? I occupied the position to which the honorable senator referred, and I can speak with experience. What is in a name? We call a Minister the Vice-President of the Executive Council; but he has nothing special to do; it is only an official name. &#34;A rose, by any other name, would smell as sweet.&#34; The Minister who now occupies a position in the Senate as an honorary Minister has a seat in the Cabinet in the same way as other Ministers, and considers and votes on all questions submitted in Cabinet in just the same way as do other Ministers. The only special work which the Vice-President of the Executive Council has to do is to preside at meetings of the Executive Council in the absence of the Governor- General . </para>

                        <para>- I can only repeat that I shall do all I can to get as much work as possible before the Senate. I hope I shall succeed ; but I am a little doubtful, as the House of Representatives has charge of the Estimates, and will have some Bills which are of a highly contentious character to deal with. Before those Bills are submitted to the Senate, it may be necessary for me to ask for an adjournment for a fortnight or so. The present position is that the Government have given notice of their intention to proceed in the Senate with the consideration of the very debatable Bill introduced last session relating to the survey of the proposed railway line between Kalgoorlie and Port Augusta, and that the are also ready to give notice of their intention to introduce Bills relating to copy right, wireless telegraphy, and other matters. These are not of supreme importance, nor are they of a very contentious character, but they will, at all events, provide work. &#39; Looking round the Senate, I must say that -I anticipate that honorable senators will also bring forward a considerable amount of private members&#39; business. </para>

                        <para>- It is impossible for me to say when they will be submitted to the Senate, for they have not yet been considered by the Cabinet. Their preparation was in a forward state when we took office, but each Minister had, of course, to go through those relating to his own Department. The Treasurer has now dealt with them, and expects to be in a position to submit them to the Cabinet next week, and at a very early date to make his financial statement. But when another place will dispose of the Estimates is quite another question. They contain much contentious matter, and as they will doubtless give rise to considerable discussion, I can- not say when we are likely to submit them to the Senate. </para>

                    <para class="block">I have not come prepared with facts or figures relating to this motion ; but I do not think it is necessary to deal with it at any length, as the whole question has already been debated. The constitution of the Senate is indeed the same as it was on a previous occasion, when I moved a similar motion and gave all the facts and figures relating to it. It was then agreed that a S elect Committee should be appointed. That committee was appointed, sat throughout last session, and took a large quantity of evidence, which was very valuable, not only from my own stand-point, but from the point of view of many others. It would be a hardship if the committee, which lapsed under the Standing Orders with the close of last session, were not reconstituted, and allowed to proceed with its inquiries so as to be able to report to the Senate on the evidence submitted. I do not think that it would take very long to complete the inquiry. Last session it took the evidence of officials of the Department of Trade and Customs, which was largely of a statistical character, as well as that of manufacturers and wholesale sellers of tobacco; but the evidence of the retailers in a smaller way of business and of the operatives yet remains to be received. The work of the committee was practically set aside under the standing order, by which all Select Committees cease their operations at the end of the session during which they are appointed. I do not anticipate any opposition to this motion, but should any objection be raised, I shall be in a position to reply. I would, however, urge the Senate to agree to the appointment of the committee, so that it may bring the inquiry to a conclusion. If the motion be passed, I shall move the further motion of which I have given notice, providing that the evidence taken before the Select Committee which sat during last session be laid on the table of the Senate, so that it may be referred to the newly appointed committee. I shall also ask the Senate to agree that the membership of the committee shall be the same as that which&#39; took evidence last year, so that there may be really no break in the continuity of its thought and operations. I am sure honorable senators will agree that the question of the nationalization of the tobacco industry is not one whit less interesting than it was last session. </para>

It is a significant fact - a fact that may be a tribute to the Japanese as a nation, or to the worth of this asset - that the loans were subscribed many times over. </para>

                            <para>- I think that it was largely due to the success of the Japanese in prosecuting the war with Russia. I do not wish to make capital out of the fact, and have mentioned it only to show that financiers in the world&#39;s market evidently regarded such an asset as satisfactory. The Russian Government have apparently been impressed with the success of the Japanese loans so floated, for, according to a statement which appeared recently in the <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> they are already making inquiries as to the possibility of nationalizing the tobacco industry in that country. Unfortunately, I cannot read the newspaper extract in question, because, having been called upon unexpectedly to deal with the motion, I have not got it with me. </para>

                            <para>- Perhaps so. In such an event, the owners of private property in that country could not do better than send for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> to speak on their behalf in the same eloquent and vigorous manner that he has spoken at various times on behalf of the capitalists of Australia. As to the operations of the tobacco combine in Australia, I am more than ever convinced that our action last session in passing a resolution in favour of the nationalization of the industry, and in appointing a Select Committee to deal with this question, has deterred it from doing in Australia what it has done and is doing in other lands. </para>

                            <para>- The combine is not prepared to give us material and evidence to work, upon, and, but for our action, I am satisfied that the tobacco smokers of Australia would have felt before now the effect of its operations. But I wish to draw attention to the fact that in New Zealand, where the same combine is operating, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Seddon,</inline> in one of his notable outbursts, recently gave the trust notice that if they continued to carry on as they have done, he will be prepared to take drastic action, and we know that when he speaks iri that manner he usually means something. I feel convinced that he will not be satisfied merely with enacting antitrust legislation. I do not think that it would be proper for me to comment upon the evidence which has been given before the committee. Having filled the office of chairman of that body, I feel that I am under an obligation to reserve any comments which I may have to make in that connexion. I merely wish to add that that evidence is very valuable, from all points of view, and I think that the Senate would do well to place it upon record in its papers, and to empower the committee to complete its inquiry and to furnish a report. I claim that its members have not in any. way exercised a bias - in fact, so far as the evidence up to date is concerned- </para>
