                <para class="block">Prior to the passing of our Act, the Imperial Fugitive Offenders Act provided for the arrest of offenders going from one British Possession, to another. Part 2 of the Act had special reference to cases such as the Australian Colonies ; it is headed "Intercolonial backing of warrants and offences." Section 12 provides that this part of the Act shall apply to groups of contiguous British Possessions, or Possessions that are closely related geographically, when and so often as Her Majesty in Council may by order decree and determine, and subject to such conditions and limitations as the Order-in-Counci'l may provide. Section 13 provides for the backing in one British Possession of a warrant issued in another Possession of the same group. Section 14 provides that a person apprehended in the second province may be returned to his original province or Colony and dealt with summarily by a justice or a Court. Section 16, which is a very important one, provides for the backing of a provisional warrant. It reads as follows : - </para>

If the warrant had not been received in the second Colony, section 16, which I have quoted, would have enabled a magistrate in that Colony on receiving satisfactory information, to issue a provisional warrant, back it, and act upon it, and wait for the original warrant to arrive, and if it did not come within a reasonable time, then, under the proviso, the alleged offender would have to be liberated from custody. </para>

                        <para>- I am not comparing the two provisions just at, this moment. Owing to a decision which was recently given by a Judge of the Supreme Court of a State, and supported by the Full Court of that State on an application, it was held that the provisions of the Fugitive Offenders Act do not apply now to the case of the Australian States. The point raised before the Court was that the States of Australia being now comprised in one Commonwealth were not, as between themselves, a group of British Possessions, such as is contemplated by that Act. In giving judgment, the Chief Justice said Mr. Pilkingtons point as to Australia being one British Possession was fatal to the warrant. Australia was under one central Legislature, and that being so, the Commonwealth was one British Possession, and the Fugitive Offenders Act did not apply to the various States, which were not now separate British Possessions. He added that it was unnecessary to deal with the other points. Our Service and Execution of Process Act contains no provision for the issue of provisional warrants as the Fugitive Offenders Act does, and this Bill provides for that omission. I understand that it practically follows the wording of section 16 of the Imperial Act. There may be a variation, but I do not think that any variation is intended to cause our own legislation to have any different effect from that which the Imperial Act had here prior to Federation. I think that with this explanation, honorable senators will see that this is not a measure of a contentious character, but one which is necessary to give full force and effect to our original Act, and to remedy an omission to which attention was only recently drawn in a certain case. The contention which was raised in that case, and which was upheld by the Full Court may in the opinion of some legal gentlemen, be open to criticism. It is not a question of whether it is or is not open to criticism. We can make the position absolutely certain by passing this measure. </para>

                    <para>- I agree as to the desirableness of passing this Bill, and have practically no criticism to offer, except to point out that, while this clause is, to all intents and purposes, a rescript of a section in the Imperial Fugitive Offenders Act, there is at the end of it an alteration which, though small, perhaps, does not improve the original text. The clause provides that a person arrested under a provisional warrant shall be discharged unless the warrant is produced " within a reasonable time." Those words cut down the words of the Fugitive Offenders Act, but do not improve them. I think that the words of the Imperial Act would probably be a better indication to an ordinary justice of the peace as to what his duty was than would be the case by using the very vague and elastic words " within a reasonable time." The Imperial Act uses the term that the time may be such " as, under the circumstances, may seem requisite." Perhaps <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> will explain why, as this clause is practically a rescript of a section in that Act, the words are cut down ? </para>

                    <para>. - The words of the English Act are " such reasonable time as under the circumstances may seem requisite." I think that the words "reasonable time" carry with them the sense of " reasonable under the circumstances." For instance, " reasonable time " between two States as widely separated as are Queensland and Western Australia would not be the measure of reasonableness as between two States separated like South Australia and Victoria. The Service and Execution of Process Act itself provides a time scale. For instance, in regard to civil process, section 8 contains the words - </para>

                <para class="block">Any Justice would, I think, interpret " reasonable time " in accordance with the principle of some such scale. He would consider what was reasonable under all the circumstances. Further than that, I take it that if a man were committed to custody, and were not liberated within what he considered to be a reasonable time, he would take his remedy by making application for a writ of habeas corpus to a Judge. The Judge would consider the whole of the circumstances, and if he held that a reasonable time had elapsed and the original warrant had not come forward he would undoubtedly make his order for the issue of a writ of habeas corpus. We may assume that, in nearly every case, if an individual wished to test the legality of his imprisonment, he would make his application to a Judge in the first instance rather than to a justice of the peace. I think we can trust all our Courts to interpret "reasonable time" as " reasonable in all the circumstances of the case." </para>

                    <para>- I have made inquiry as to the point raised yesterday by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> and, as far as my information goes, those responsible for the Bill are assured that it does not in any way affect any law relating to assurance providing for endowment policies or for any life interest of the person ; and, further, that the term "interest" has a certain and definite meaning in connexion with life assurance. Its technical meaning is, " an assurable interest." Honorable senators will see a note at the side of the page indicating that; and I am assured that Courts of law, in reading an Act relating to assurance, would take the meaning which these terms have in life assurance business. To have an " interest " in the life of a person means not a parental interest, but an interest relating to assurance - an assurable interest. This Bill would not in any way affect those assurable interests which now exist, and for which State laws provide. I therefore appeal to the Committee to pass the clause. </para>

                    <para>- I direct the attention of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> to the very small penalty provided for in this clause. Suppose that a particular policy involved the payment of£500 upon the death of a child. Surely a penalty of £5 would, in that case, be a very inadequate punishment for what is regarded as an illegal offence. </para>

                    <para>- I had intended to draw attention to the same point. I cannot see what objection there can be to make the penalty at least equal to the total amount recoverable under the policy. The clause very properly provides for a penalty to be imposed for an offence. It is therefore contemplated that such a procedure as is indicated in paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">a, b,</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">c</inline> is an offence. It is idle to assume that£5 is an adequate penalty for such offences. Such a company as would carry on business under this Bill would scarcely be affected by a fine of£5. The least we can do is to make the penalty adequate. </para>

                    payable on death? It appears to me that this Bill makes small policies legal and punishes assurance companies for paying more than the amount named on such a policy; but is there anything to prohibit a company from issuing a larger policy on the life of a child? I understood that the idea was to prevent large policies from being taken out on the lives of children, in order to protect child life, but, so far as I can find in this Bill, there is nothing to prohibit a larger policy being issued.

                        <para>- That does not prohibit such policies. Neither does clause 3. I dare say that the object of the Bill is good, but does it carry out that object? It is perfectly true that a penalty of <inline font-style="italic">£5</inline> is provided for, but what sort of a punishment is that? I am told that this clause is copied from the English Act. Possibly, however, the law of Great Britain prohibits the issue of policies for large amounts on the lives of young children. </para>

It has been materially altered from the English Act in regard to the schedule, but it has been copied, so far as concerns the amount of the penalty. The English Act limits the amount of the policy to <inline font-style="italic">£10.</inline> We halve added a schedule which takes the amount assurable up to <inline font-style="italic">£45.</inline> The penalty under the English Act was no doubt fixed at £5 because the amount payable is <inline font-style="italic">£10.</inline> But we have altered the amount insurable from .£10 to £45, and have left the penalty the same. In our Acts Interpretation Act, we have provided that the penalty set out at the foot of any section, or sub-section, shall indicate to the Judge that the offence shall be punishable by a penalty " not exceeding " that mentioned. In order that we may conform in this Bill with what is considered desirable under the Acts Interpretation Act, I ask permission to withdraw my amendment to enable me to move that sub-clause 2 be eliminated, with a view to substituting the words " Penalty Forty-five pounds." </para>

As to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould's</inline> objection, the position at present is that, while an assurance company may issue a policy for £500 or' .£5,000 payable on the death of a child, there are very grave doubts as to whether the money could be recovered in any Court of Law in Australia. The Right Hon. G. H. Reid, who is al director of one of the leading assurance societies, says - </para>

                <para>This particular branch of assurance is not in a satisfactory state in Australia at the present time. It is practised to some extent, but there is no legal basis for it. </para>
                <para class="block">That statement has been indorsed by the legal gentleman who introduced the Bill originally, and who, no doubt, has made a special study of the subject. Clause 2 provides that a. child may be insured between the ages mentioned for any sum of money which, added to any amount payable by any other company or society, on the death, does not exceed the amount specified in the schedule. The Bill gives legal status to any contract up to that amount. If a child be insured for a greater amount, there is nothing in the Bill to prevent such a step, but, according to several legal gentlemen, it is very doubtful whether such a contract would have any legal status. </para>

                    <para>-.' I labour under the difficulty that some honorable senators were not present when I spoke on the second reading and dealt with these points. I then pointed out that the amount is kept low when the child is practically an infant, so as to remove- any inducement to parents or guardians to make away with the child for the sake of the insurance money. But the amount increases as the child grows older, and when the age of six or seven is reached the danger of infanticide largely disappears owing to the greater risk of discovery. The policy then becomes largely one of insurance, and not a mere provision for funeral expenses, although, of course, the element of industrial insurance remains up to the age of ten years. </para>

If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> could say that a child, on attaining the age of six, becomes to some extent a bread-winner or contributes to the support of others, there might be some reason for the great increase in the amount. That position, however, cannot be taken up, and I submit that the schedule in its present form is very crude.

                            has properly pointed out that when a child dies at a precise age, the schedule leaves it uncertain as to what amount shall be paid. The difficulty could be got over by providing that the amount shall be paid at death at the age of one year and over and under two years, and so. on. I shall vote against the schedule if it is left in its present form.

                        <para>- The only reason for limiting the amount is to remove any incentive to. unscrupulous persons to destroy infant life for the sake of insurance money ; otherwise, there would be no reason to interfere. As the danger of there being such an incentive decreases, we are less justified in limiting the amount ; and this . supplies, in my opinion, a very cogent reason for the provision in the schedule. As to the wording of the schedule, I do not feel very strongly, but we -ought not to make alterations merely for the sake of making them. The year expires when a child is, for example, twelve months old, and the hour of midnight marks the line between days. We know that in all insurance policies, under which amounts are payable at a certain age, the hour at which they are payable is set out; and I do not see the necessity for making a provision which is already invariably made. </para>

The object of the Bill is to prevent parents and others from making any profit from the death of children, or having any inducement to hasten that event. My experience in the old country was that parents- insured their children so that, in case of death, some funds would be available for doctors! bills and funeral expenses. There is no doubt a very serious difference between the amount which may be paid at six years and the amount which may be paid at ten years, and, I think a compromise might be arrived at which would be agreeable to all, and more in harmony with the general idea of the Bill. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> adheres to the schedule as it stands, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> does not move an amendment, I suppose the schedule will be passed. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, sir. The sole object of the Public Service Act was to get lid of political influence, and vest the management of the Public Service in a Commissioner. Over and over again it was distinctly stated -that we did rot wish to lose complete control, and therefore we took particular care to provide how our control should be exercised. We shall be stultifying ourselves, and doing a thing which the Standing Orders absolutely forbid, and which is unheard of, if we intervene now, and discuss the whole classification before the time pointed out by the Act when we would have a right to do so legally. Section 8 of the Act provides that the inspectors have to make their reports to the Commissi'oner, who, after he has considered the reports, has to submit a scheme to the Governor-General - </para>

                <para class="block">A classification scheme has been prepared and printed, which cost the Commissioner and his inspectors an enormous amount of time, trouble, and thought. Sixteen hundred odd appeals have been lodged under section 50 of the Act, and dealt with. It is distinctly provided in that section that the appeal must be heard and dealt with before the report is sent to the Governor-General. I am informed on good authority that no report has been sent to His Excellency since the appeals were dealt with. Until the officers have had the advantage of having; their appeals heard and dealt with, there can be no report which can be sent to the Governor-General and with which the Senate can deal. This report is riot a report within the meaning of the Act; and, in view of the three sections I cited, I contend that there i's no report by the Commissioner for the Senate to deal with. </para>

                <para class="block">Departments of the six States, it was recognised by present and previous Ministers that there might be occasions where even grouped classifications or other matters of that kind, which it was not competent for individual members under the appeal provisions of the Act to deal with, might be dealt with by honorable senators. Before the Government recommend the adoption of the scheme as a whole to the Governor-General as one giving effect to the principle and policy laid down by Parliament in the Public Service Act, they are quite prepared to have the whole scheme discussed both here and elsewhere. And if there be any legitimate reason to advance as to any alleged deviation from that principle or policy, it may be considered by the Government and the Commissioner before the scheme is finally recommended for adoption. </para>

                        <para>- I am asked to rule whether the provisions of the Public Service Act impose a statutory bar to the Senate . discussing the matter proposed to be brought forward. I take it that one of the. main principles of that Act was . to place the Commissioner in a position in which he would be independent of the Ministry, but that, at the same time, the Ministry should not be altogether powerless. Therefore, it provided that if the Governor-General, that is the Ministry, objected to any of these regulations it should be laid before Parliament, and an opportunity provided for discussing the matter. Although that is a statutory procedure, which can be adopted if the Ministry object, I do not see in the section any provision which will prevent Parliament from discussing the question. A very direct prohibition must be laid down in an Act to prevent Parliament from discussing a matter. It has a right to discuss any public matter, and I do not see where that right is taken away. From the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> I understand that what it is proposed to discuss is the general policy of these regulations before they are handed on to the Governor-General. I cannot see where such discussion is prohibited. It may be that that was the intention of Parliament, but if it was, I do not think it has been expressed. I should be very loath to hold that Parliament is not to be allowed to discuss almost any matter under the sun unless there is some definite provision to that effect. I do not think the point of order is valid. I understand now that' <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> asks for leave to raise a general discussion concerning the regulations on a motion to print a paper. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think it is a good principle that we should have a discussion. It is against the Standing Orders. I can understand an honorable senator asking, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> did, what the leave implies, but it is not in order to discuss whether leave ought to be granted or not. It is within the province of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson,</inline> if he likes, to prevent leave being granted. </para>

                    (Tasmania).- I think that the Minister did a most unwise and unwarrantable thing in breaking the continuity of a most important debate to enable this improper discussion to take place. I have received one or two documents from civil servants, who think that they are aggrieved by the classification. They set forth certain facts and make certain statements in which it is . claimed that their grades and salaries have not been raised high enough. I understand that some of these gentlemen have written
                    <inline font-style="italic">to</inline>
                    various members of Parliament. Probably they have interviewed members. I contend that that, is the very thing that the Public Service Act was passed to prevent, and that any member of Parliament who allows public servants to interview him with the slightest idea of trying to interfere with what the Commissioner . has decided, is doing a very improper thing. The classification of the Public Service is probably one of the most momentous works ever undertaken by a Commonwealth officer. It has occupied months of the time of the Commissioner and four inspectors. But before the Governor-General has seen the amended report, we are asked to discuss it.; and
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons,</inline>
                    instead of helping me, has rather made the matter worse, by saying that we- are going to discuss it in all its details. I venture to say that there is not a single honorable senator, or member, of another place, who is competent to discuss the report in anything like a tenth part of its details. It is a miserable and almost contemptible idea that we should stultify ourselves, and go back upon what we have done.

                        <para>- If my honorable friend is so very sensitive, I will simply say that the passing of this motion to suspend the Standing Orders will place me in a contemptible position, by asking me to stultify myself. The motion to suspend the Standing Orders is absolutely premature. When the Governor-General has seen the document, and when certain objections are made to it - if objections are made-then if honorable senators think that they are competent to advance objections, there may be some excuse for discussing the subject. Why did we put in the Public Service Act a section providing that every officer should have a right to appeal if he felt himself aggrieved? No fewer than 1,600 officers have had their cases inquired into. </para>

                    may object to the suspension of the Standing Orders, but I do not think that he does so on the right grounds. He seizes this motion as an opportunity for going into the whole question of the classification scheme. But I do submit that it would have - been better if the motion had not been moved. The very first words of standing order 433 are, " in cases of urgent necessity." There is no urgent necessity why the question of the classification should be gone into this morning. It can be considered by many other methods. I submit, first of all, that, this is by no means a
                    <inline font-style="italic">case</inline>
                    of urgent necessity. Further, I would point out that to suspend the Standing Orders on such grounds is to establish a precedent which may be used on another occasion when a senator exercises his right to object to leave being granted. As a result, many of our proceedings will be disorderly. I urge Ministers not to proceed with the motion. '

A number of honorable senators wished the debate on that Bill to proceed to a finish. But it was pointed out that, in deference to the wishes of a number of honorable senators, the Government had set apart this day for the consideration of the classification scheme. Now one honorable senator who does not wish the scheme to be discussed at any time, and who contends that no member of Parliament has a right to raise his voice against the scheme, is trying to block business. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons,</inline> equally with myself, wishes to have an opportunity to discuss the scheme, but thinks that it would establish a bad precedent to suspend the Standing Orders simply because an honorable senator refuses to give leave. But as the present position has! been brought about merely by the action of one senator who tries to block discussion when we are prepared to go on with it, it is not desirable that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> should object to the method proposed. </para>

                    <para>- Some of us have travelled hundreds of miles to do business. Last night we were given to understand that the classification scheme would come on -for discussion today, and there is no good reason why it should be blocked- The Standing Orders themselves allow of their suspension. This waste of time is simply disgraceful. Last night, when a number of honorable senators wished that debate on the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway Survey Bill should be proceeded with to-day, it was pointed out that a promise had been given that the classification scheme would be debated. I protest against the waste of time which will ensue should the motion before the Senate not be agreed to. </para>

                        <para>- If every honorable senator who desired that that Bill should be taken to-day had voted in that direction, I am convinced that the Government would have been in a minority. Then there would have been no trouble. As a senator who is not in his place every day, I like to know what business is to be transacted, so that I may form! an opinion as to whether it will be better for me to be present or to attend to other affairs. If the Standing Orders are to be suspended at any time and under any circumstances, we may as well do without them altogether. This is not such an urgent case as is contemplated by the Standing Orders. I arn quite willing that the classification report should be discussed at a proper time. Whether it was the intention of the Legislature, when the Public Service Act was passed, that there should be such a discussion, need not now be considered. It is as well that we should let the Government know that the Standing Orders cannot be suspended at their will, and that matters cannot be brought up without notice when some honorable senators are not present. </para>

                    (New South Wales). - The necessity of adhering to the Standing Orders has, I think, been amply demonstrated by the temper exhibited during this debate. It is quite evident that those who are keenly anxious to proceed with the. consideration of the classification scheme are supporting the suspension of the Standing Orders. But if, because a considerable number of senators - it may be a majority - at- any particular time wish particularly to go on with a certain measure, that is to be held to be an excuse for. suspending the Standing Orders, they - as well be thrown under the table altogether; The Standing Orders, it should never be forgotten, -are .made not only for the orderly conduct of business, but also for the protection of ..rnjnoriti.es.

                <para>One of the weightiest public utterances ever delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Parkes on this question was made in a House where he had a strong majority. His work was being hampered by a minority, and he was asked to propose a standing order which would have curbed the minority unduly. He then laid it down in memorable words that it would be better to waste the whole of a session than to bring in a standing order which would enable a Government at any time to do things which, it was not desirable that they should be allowed to do. </para>

I want to point out the great danger that may arise if on insufficient grounds we suspend the Standing Orders. This Government, with its high ethical stand-point, might decline to do anything that was wrong. But if we were to establish the practice of suspending the Standing Orders on the slightest grounds, some other Government might, on another occasion, resort to that expedient to carry out some more doubtful proposal of which no notice had been given. </para>

I am not now speaking of the particular motion before us, but expressing a general dissent from the practice, which is growing up even here, of suspending the Standing Orders, except it be on matters of imminent urgency. For that reason, and not because I have the slightest objection to discuss the classification scheme, I shall vote against the motion. </para>

All that is proposed is to permit honorable senators to express their opinion of the new classification of the Public Service, and one cannot help being amused at the surprise with which the motion to suspend the' Standing Orders has been received by gentlemen opposite. Last night we left the chamber, well knowing that the consideration of the classification scheme was the business for to-day. The protest that was then made was not against the proposal to deal with the classification scheme, but against proceeding with the debate on the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway Survey Bill this morning. We cannot be surprised at the action of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson,</inline> because he makes no secret of the fact that he prefers an autocracy to a democracy - that he is willing, not merely to hand over the Public Service of the Commonwealth to an autocrat- </para>

                        <para>- At any rate, it is idle to say that there has been no opportunity to see the amended classification. All that is proposed is to discuss the scheme in general terms, and no advantage can be gained by adjourning the debate for a week or two. Surely we know whether the objections we have to raise to the classification have been met in the amended scheme. I appeal to honorable senators not to " play the game " of those who wish to harass and discredit the Government by placing obstacles in the way of the discussion of this matter. </para>

                        <para>- We are now discussing whether the Standing Orders shall be suspended, and, except under very extraordinary circumstances, I have always voted against such a motion. We have rules and regulations laid down for the conduct of business, and those rules, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has pointedly stated, are framed for the protection of the minority. I happen to belong to the majority at present, but I do not know how soon I may be relegated to my previous position. For a long time I was a member of a minority, to gag and trample on which many attempts were made, so that my sympathies are with those who are now in a minority in this Chamber. In any case, when we make rules, why not stick to them? If the rules are not as they ought to be, let us amend them. </para>

                    if I thought the Government were taking action with a view to treating the minority in the way that that honorable senator has indicated. But last night the discussion on the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway Survey Bill was postponed on the clear understanding that the amended classification scheme would be considered to-day ; and I did not feel that there was any necessity for further notice of the motion now before us. I should protest as strongly as

                    and others against any undue straining of this particular standing order, and I believe that the Government will give due weight to the remarks which have been made in this connexion.

                        is sent to every honorable senator ; but I - and, I believe, a large number of other honorable senators - have never received a copy of that publication. I have no objection 'to the Standing Orders being suspended, seeing that a number of honorable senators have already seen the amended scheme, and are prepared to go on with the discussion. The debate could be adjourned after those honorable senators have spoken, and an opportunity thus given to myself and others to consider the matter.

                        <para>- I should like to say that I intend to vote against this motion. I think it is my duty, in the position which I occupy, to refuse, unless under most exceptional and urgent circumstances, to vote for a motion to suspend the Standing Orders, in order to bring forward business not on the notice-paper. I do not know that any particular harm would result from suspending the Standing Orders in this case, but I am now laying down a general rule. </para>

                            <para>.- Yes, and the Minister is responsible too. The hope on this side is that the Government will carry out their promise to take the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway Survey Bill on Wednesday afternoon. I should not have raised a question in regard to that matter if it had riot been for what I understood the Government to say. But if it is still their intention to carry out their promise in regard to that Bill,. I am quite sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> will be prepared to withdraw his objection. That is all that is wanted from this side. </para>

                            <para>- There were no distinct conditions made. The withdrawal of the objection to the resumption of the debate on the Bill I referred to being made an order of the day for Wednesday was based upon the condition that a promise was made by the Government to take that measure on that day to the exclusion of all other business unless purely formal. Such a notice of motion as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> wishes to give would probably have raised no objection if we had understood clearly that the arrangement made would be carried out-. Let me warn the Government that the Opposition, while prepared to fight fairly and. squarely, expect them to give effect to all their promises to the Senate. If they are not prepared to take that course they will find that there is an active Opposition who will give them a lively time. We are quite willing to go on with our work, but if Ministers intend to play tricks, and treat us dishonestly and unfairly, they will find that they have made a very great mistake. </para>

One condition of the promise I made yesterday with regard to the position of the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway Survey Bill on the notice-paper for Wednesday was that to-day we should take a discussion on the Public Service classification, and that it should precede the consideration of that Bill. Honorable senators on the other side have by their votes prevented that condition from being given effect to, because they have refused to agree to a suspension of the Standing Orders. In the first place, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> was the only one who refused to allow my honorable and learned colleague to discuss the scheme I am not bound by the promise I made when the conditions of that promise are not fulfilled on the other side. That promise was given on the distinct understanding that before the resumption of the debate on the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway Survey Bill the classification scheme should be discussed by the Senate. </para>

                            <para>- I have been treated most unfairly and ungenerously by honorable senators on the other side. Although I feel very strongly on the matter, still I do not intend to depart from the promise I made. I intend to allow the resumption of the debate on the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway Survey Bill to precede the discussion on the classification scheme. I shall not return tit for tat, as I could do if I liked. Perhaps in the circumstances honorable senators on the other side will allow the notice of motion to be given by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating.</inline></para>
