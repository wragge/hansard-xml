                (South Australia).There is a possibility that some reports of considerable interest to the country may come in later than one month from the date of prorogation. In the case of the State Parliament, the usual time allowed was two months, and I would ask
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline>
                to adopt a similar rule. There is every hope that the Select Committee on Tobacco Monopoly, which is to be converted into a Royal Commission, will report within a month.

                        <para>- Perhaps I was wrong in saying that the time was two months, but, in my opinion, it is a very reasonable period to fix. What is the general course adopted? Very often before the bound volumes of the papers have been issued three months have elapsed. Last year they were not distributed to honorable senators until nearly four months from the date of prorogation. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator will see that if the period is increased to two months the issue of the Blue Books will be postponed by another month. It takes a considerable time to prepare and bind the volumes, and the honorable senator will get the papers in the ordinary course of post. </para>

                        <para>- I am anxious that the report shall be placed in the hands of honorable senators before the re-assembling of Parliament. If the resolution of the Senate is that all papers which are in the hands of the Government within two months from the date of prorogation have to be included in the bound volumes, certainly they will be distributed. I hope that we shall receive the report of two Commissions within that time. </para>

                    <para>. - It is a matter of perfect indifference to the Government whether the time is fixed at one month or two months. Unless an early start is made with the binding of the sessional volumes they will not be distributed before the reassembling of the Parliament. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> has expressed the hope that two Royal Commissions will report before the expiration of one month. </para>

With reference to the exclusion of the State Savings Bank from the Government Post Office, in Sydney, the Secretary to the Postmaster-General has promised to have the matter looked into, and information will be forwarded to the honorable senator. The other statement that a number of auditors were bundled out of their billets does not contain a word of truth. On the table in the Library the honorable senator will find all the papers relating to the subject. </para>

It was a Cabinet decision, which was not gazetted as an Order in Council. A &#34; General Order &#34; cannot confer any rank on an officer, an Order in Council being necessary for that. </para>

                    <para class="block">It will be remembered that some time ago considerable discussion centred round an amendment which an honorable senator desired to have inserted in a Bill to amend the Electoral Act. It was pointed out that the amendment, although it had strict reference to the subject-matter of the Act, had no particular direct reference to any of the subject-matters of the Bill. Although the decision of the Chair was upheld by a great number of honorable senators, still, many of them expressed the opinion that our standing order on the relevancy of amendments was one which, if read correctly, imposed restraints that ought to some extent to be removed. Accordingly, the Standing Orders Committee were invited to consider the question of standing orders with regard to amendments in amending Bills, and, in due course, it recommended the adoption of a standing order which would, to some extent, remove the restrictions. </para>

                            <para>- At any rate, after some discussion, the report was referred back to the Standing Orders Committee, with an instruction to consider the whole question, and draw up a standing order in conformity with the opinion which seemed to find most favour with honorable senators. It has recommended the adoption of the following additional standing orders : - &#34; 319A. An Instruction can be given to a Committee of the Whole on a Bill to amend an existing Act, to consider amendments which are not relevant to the subject-matter of the Bill, but are relevant to the subject-matter of the Act it is proposed to amend, provided that such motion shall be carried by at least fifteen affirmative votes.&#34; &#34;319B. An Instruction to a Committee of the Whole requires notice, and can only be moved before going into Committee on any question.&#34; </para>

                    <para>In moving the adoption of the report, I would point out that, after all, the effect of the first proposed standing order is limited to Bills which have for their object the amendment of existing legislation. It is quite possible that when our standing orders as to the relevancy of amendments were framed the framers had in their mind Bills which were complete in themselves, that is to say, Bills which dealt once and for all with a particular subject. But when we come to deal with a Bill which has for its object the amendment of an Act in some particular, obviously, although the Bill itself may not contain any reference to certain important features of legislation, still it recalls vividly to the mind of every honorable senator the main principles and features of that Act. Under these circumstances, it is quite reasonable to have a standing order under which an honorable senator could move in the case of an amending Bill amendments which, although they were not relevant to its immediate subject-matter, still had a direct relevancy to the subject-matter of the principal Act. </para>

                            <para>- It would always be for the Minister in charge of a Government Bill to express the Government&#39;s attitude with regard to an amendment, and then for the Committee to decide whether it was inadvisable to go further in amending the Act which the Bill purported to amend in a certain particular. The first of the proposed standing orders is safeguarded in two very important respects. First, an amendment must be relevant to the subject-matter of the Act sought to be amended, and secondly it must have the support of at least fifteen senators. When the concrete instance came up as to the relevancy of a proposed amendment, I think I indicated that my support of the President&#39;s ruling had no reference to the policy of the standing order, because I considered that it did to a certain extent unduly restrict us in the consideration of amending Bills. With the safeguards embodied in the proposed standing order, I think that the Senate will be well advised in adopting the recommendation of the Standing Orders Committee. </para>

                        <para>- I second the motion formally. The proposed standing order does not appear to me to meet the case at all. Its purpose is to permit of amendments being moved in an amending Bill upon subjects which are relevant to the subject-matter of the original Act. but which do not come within the purview of the amending Bill itself. </para>

The proposed instruction must be moved before any Bill which is under consideration gets into Committee. The ordinary practice is for a Bill to pass its second reading, and to be immediately taken into Committee. </para>

If that were done, every honorable senator, in voting for the second reading of the measure, would know that he was also voting upon the principles contained in the amendments other than those embodied in the amending Bill. </para>

In any case I am astounded to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> talk about waste of time. What are we here for but to manufacture new Acts of Parliament, and to put old ones into the crucible? We must progress with the times. As we journey through life we probably get broader and better views. Seeing that we have made a departure in the right direction, I think that we ought to go a little further, and place no obstruction in the way of honorable senators who wish to submit amendments. I would ask you, sir, if it is competent for me to move an amendment in the proposed standing orders? </para>

                        <para>- Perhaps, as Chairman of the Joint Standing Orders Committee, I may be permitted to say a few words. We have a standing order which provides that all amendments to Bills must be relevant to their subject-matter. That standing order, until it is altered, binds the Senate. There is no reference in that standing order to the relevance of amendments to an original Act at all. Whether a Bill proposes to amend an Act, or whether it does not, the amendments must be relevant to its subject-matter. If we are going to alter that position at all, we must do so by new standing order. If the policy of that standing order is objected to - and I admit that there is room for objection - we must frame new standing orders. It is now proposed that an instruction may be given to a Committee to make amendments in a Bill which are not relevant to its subject-matter, but which are relevant to the Act which it is proposed to amend. It is quite evident that, so far as instructions are concerned, there must&#39; be some limit imposed. For instance, upon a Bill to amend an Audit Act, no one would suggest that an instruction should be given to introduce a proposal relating to a sugar bounty. There must be some limit, and that limit ought to be defined. </para>

                            <para>- As to instructions on an amending Bill, it is proposed in these proposed new standing orders that the limit shall be that amendments must be relevant to the subject-matter of the Act which it is proposed to amend. If we are to alter the present practice, I do not see how we can do better than adopt the recommendation of the Standing Orders Committee. I confess myself that that recommendation does not entirely satisfy me. I should have liked some more general standing order to have been framed, but. after a great deal of consideration, I am unable to suggest any new standing order which I think would be preferable. Honorable senators who are not on the Standing Orders Committee should recollect that the Committee have considered this matter over and over again. A large number of new standing orders have been suggested to meet the case, but, after viewing the question in all its bearings, the Committee have come to the conclusion that the proposed new standing orders axe the best&#39; they can recommend. There is one aspect of the case which I ask honorable senators to consider. Under the Constitution, the Parliament can discuss and legislate on only a limited number of subjects, and, as time goes on, and we have legislated on these matters - and we have legislated on a good many already - most of the measures which come before us will be Bills to amend Acts already passed. These new standing orders, therefore, will have far-reaching effects, and will probably come into operation on most of the Bills we have to consider. I admit there are a great many difficulties surrounding this question, and that it is not possible to suggest a standing order that is not open to some objection. After all, what are standing orders? They are only a matter of the balance of convenience. All our standing orders are for the convenience of senators - to enable questions to be discussed and legislation passed within limits. If we do not wish&#39; to provide for such limits, we do not require any standing orders. If we are to be entirely untrammelled as to what we shall provide in the Bills which come before us, no standing orders are necessary ; we can insert all manner of irrelevant matter. That, I think, would be most objectionable. I hope the Senate will give due effect to the deliberations of the Standing Orders Committee, and will, at all events, give credit to the members of that Committee for considering this question time after time. They have now recommended two new standing orders, which, in the opinion of the Committee, will give greater power to the Senate in the matter of instructions to a Committee of the Whole than is possessed at present, but which are not open to the objection that they will allow a Committee of the Whole to roam around at their own sweet will, and insert in Bills provisions entirely foreign to the subject-matter. I hope that the considerations which&#39; I have placed before honorable senators will be given due weight, and that the new standing orders will be adopted. As .1 said before, the standing orders do not entirely satisfy me, but, at the same time, I must confess that for months I have been trying to devise some new rule which would be more general and suitable, and have been unable to do so. I hope that the Senate, will not unduly enlarge the powers of the Committee of the Whole, so as to make our legislation objectionable by the presence in Bills of provisions which have no relation to the subject-matter. </para>

                        <para>- I feel quite sure that every honorable senator thoroughly appreciates the keen attention which the Standing Orders Committee have given to this matter, but, at the same time, we reserve the right to take exception to a proposal if we consider it will not tend to the satisfactory conduct of business. I am opposed to these proposed new standing orders, but that, of course, does not mean that I am opposed to the members of the Standing Orders Committee. I should prefer the standing orders on the subject of instructions to remain as they are, rather than adopt a rule of this kind, which I regard as exceedingly dangerous. In the past, I know, honorable senators have desired to insert in amending Bills amendments not relevant to the Bill itself, though relevant to the principal Act it was sought to amend, and, under our present standing orders, have not been permitted to do so. The object of the proposed standing orders is to remedy that state of affairs. While that, in a sense, may be a desirable object, we must not forget the dangers to which we may lay ourselves open. It is a good old parliamentary maxim admitted throughout British Parliaments, that standing orders are intended, not only to facilitate the conduct of business, but also to protect minorities, and certainly this is a view of which we ought not to lose sight. If the mere temper of the Chamber from sitting day to sifting day is to be the sole guide, then let us. away with all our standing orders - tear them up, and put them in the waste-paper basket. The provision for fifteen affirmative votes is no compensation for the danger to which the minority would be exposed under the proposed standing orders : and it appears to me exceedingly strange that old parliamentarians should suggest a rule of the kind. So far as I understand </para>

We are often told that we cannot do this or that, but frequently these are the very things that are done. We have improved the language in which the Chairman of Committees puts proposals from the chair, and we should take a similar course in regard to these proposed new standing orders.

                            <para>- This is absolutely a new departure. An honorable senator may be in favour of the principle of a Bill, but opposed to the manner in which it is proposed to carry that principle into effect, and he gives notice of amendments. All that is legitimate; but, under the present proposal, an entirely new Bill may be evolved - a Bill which has not the least resemblance to that contemplated in the order of leave. Is that the method in which we are going to conduct our business ? The danger of the proposed new standing orders may be illustrated by the notice of motion which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> has on the business-paper to-day. That motion is strictly relevant to the Tariff, and under these standing orders the whole of the Tariff would be open to discussion. </para>

I may say that personally I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> that his motion deals with a matter of very great urgency, which ought to be disposed of before the prorogation. But under the new standing orders, instead of one legitimate, urgent grievance being removed, there might be re-opened the whole question which it took the first Federal Parliament seventeen months to deal with&#39;. </para>

                            <para>- Precisely. A tricky Government, watching their opportunity from day to day, could, by the exercise of a little skill and patience, use these standing orders to put legislation on the statute-book which was not desirable. Such a procedure should not be tolerated. I sincerely believe that, when we are dealing with important questions, we should have some means of securing finality in regard to them. You, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> have mentioned that in future the majority of the Bills submitted to us will probably be amending measures, and that therefore the general principles upon -which we have been legislating will not be affected to any great extent. An amending Bill is brought in because, from experience, we have learned that, whilst the principle of the existing Act to which it relates is good, the methods we have adopted to carry it into effect are defective. We therefore adopt other means subject to the limitation imposed by our present standing orders. But under these standing orders both the principal Act and the Bill by which it was proposed to amend it would be open for discussion, and therefore we could -never hope to secure finality. For these reasons I am strongly opposed to the proposed standing orders. If we are to have irrelevant matters - matters quite outside the order of leave introduced - the best thing we can do is to abolish the standing orders and pass a law providing that the minority shall have no rights. </para>

                        (Western Australia).T agree with the general policy of this very small report, printed on a very large sheet of paper. Before proceeding to discuss it. I should like to point out that, sin-2e there has been so much talk about the cost of stamps used by honorable senators, we might reasonably take exception to this small report of eight lines being printed on four pages of foolscap size.

I am simply pointing out that there is no necessity for the provision as to fifteen affirmative votes being cast for a motion for an instruction to a Committee of the Whole, since members of each party in the Senate are fairly consistent in their attendance.

                        <para>- I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dawson</inline> was on safe ground when he took exception to this proposal. The Standing Orders Committee are not in absolute agreement in regard to it, and I am one of those who have not looked upon the proposal with any degree of favour. It must be borne in mind that the whole question was first referred to the Standing Orders Committee, and that, in a report which was laid on the table of the House, they pointed out that they were unable to make any suggestion. The outcome of that was that a motion was submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> that the Committee be instructed to prepare a standing order containing a provision substantially in agreement with that now before us. That motion was agreed to. But the point is, that in the first instance the Standing Orders Committee were not in favour of taking action, and that in the next place, in submitting these proposed standing orders to us, they have simply followed out the decision of the Senate. The standing orders are certainly open to the objection indicated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dawson</inline> - that they take away the protection that should be accorded the minority. At present, we require not only that leave shall be obtained to introduce a Bill, but that it shall be read a first and second time, considered in Committee, and finally read a third time. A discussion may take place at any of these stages, so that there is ample opportunity for honorable senators to consider, and reconsider the principle involved in any Bill submitted to us. If we are going to allow instructions to be given to a Committee of the Whole to consider amendments which are not relevant to the subject-matter of the Bill, but are relevant to the subject-matter of the Act that it is proposed to amend, it will be possible to have a second reading debate without the protection afforded by the preliminary stages through which a measure must ordinarily be taken. All that will be necessary, in order to introduce entirely irrelevant matter, will be to give notice the day before the second reading of a Bill is agreed to. This will not only take away the protection now given to a minority, but will relieve the Government of the day from the responsibility rightly attaching to them in matters of legislation. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> has shown that by motion, an instruction could be given to a Government to introduce legislation dealing with a particular question. If the Government recognised that failure to carry out the instruction would involve a Ministerial crisis, all that they would have to do would be to say to their supporters: &#34;We are not prepared to stand or fall upon a principle of this kind, but if von can secure its insertion in an amending Bill that we will introduce, we will accept it.&#34; In that way, the Government would be freed from responsibility, and run no risk. I aim not desirous to see Ministers relieved of responsibility in every direction, but we know that they are being relieved of it by alterations in practice and procedure. Again, the proposal enables instructions to be given to deal with matters that probably would not otherwise be dealt with. It is all very well to say that fifteen members of the Senate would have to support the motion. But let honorable senators bear in mind that when a matter having no party complexion was brought up, a minority of honorable senators who had considered the question might, by argument, be able to persuade the majority to vote with them. If, however, the matter was brought up whilst those who were capable of so influencing honorable senators were away, a* fair expression of the opinion of the Senate would, not be obtained. On the other hand, if the proposal were formally embodied in a Bill, instead of being made the subject of an instruction to the Committee of the Whole, those honorable senators would be able to make their arrangements to be present, and to state their opinions. There are other objections. As a member of the Opposition, I point out that these suggested standing orders will enable an Opposition to &#34;stone- wall&#34; a Bill to a greater extent than is permitted by our present Standing Orders. Four of five senators might submit instructions which would have to be considered after the second reading of a Bill, and those instructions would be debated night after night, with the object of defeating the Bill to which the minority was opposed. Such standing orders would play directly into the hands of an Opposition. The Senate ought to be enabled to deal within reasonable bounds with all matters that are brought forward. I have always set my face against standing orders affording opportunities to &#34; stone- wall,&#34; or delay the transaction of public business. I shall always do so. But if, while I sit in opposition, a standing order deliberately gives me .opportunities to &#34; stonewall,&#34; and block legislation that I do not like, I shall probably take advantage of it. It should be realized that we are now dealing with rules that have been in operation for many years in other parts, and have been found to work satisfactorily. The reason why a change was made some years ago in the House of Commons was to avoid the possibility of rushing through the second reading of a Bill which members did not think would be brought forward for consideration. If a Government chooses to bring forward a Bill, well and good. It takes the responsibility. If a private senator desires to submit a proposal, and cannot secure an opportunity upon a Bill, it is always possible to take the sense of the Senate upon a motion. But do not let us destroy all Ministerial responsibility, or give additional opportunities for &#34; stone-walling,&#34; and interfering with the proper course of proposed legislation. It has been suggested that in regard to a matter of this kind, upon which there is much difference of opinion, it is a mistake to come to a conclusion on almost the last day of the session. </para>

                            <para>.- In view of the divergence of opinion in the Standing Orders Committee, and in the absence of many honorable senators., it would be much better to postpone the further consideration of the subject until next session. </para>

                        <para>- I voted against the adjournment of the debate because the subject is fresh in the minds of honorable senators, and we are well able to come to a decision upon it. It is not perhaps a fitting subject with which to wind up a very long session, but there is no advantage in waiting six months before we decide it. </para>

                            <para>- The two cases which give rise to the proposed standing orders were rulings given by the President, under our existing standing order, and in accordance with the practice of the Senate that no amendment could be made in a Bill unless it were relevant to the subject-matter of that Bill. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> proposed that the Committee of the Whole, in dealing with the Electoral Bill, should consider the question of compulsory voting, you ruled that he could not move in that direction, because the proposal was not within the scope of the Bill. The second case occurred when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe</inline> proposed to consider in Committee the question of plumping at elections. Our standing order regarding instructions is apparently of no value. Some amendment is necessary in order to make it effective. The proposal of the Standing Orders Committee that we shall be permitted to consider matters in Committee not relevant to a particular amending Bill, but relevant to the principal Act, will enable us to give effect to the existing standing order. The fear expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> that such a standing order as proposed will give rise to &#34; stonewalling &#34; is groundless, in view of the standing order providing that the Senate may at any time divide upon the question under debate. So that if, in. the opinion of the majority, any question before the Senate had been sufficiently debated, or had been moved for the purpose of obstruction, the motion &#34;That the Committee do now divide &#34; could be submitted, and the obstruction would be brought to an end. </para>

                            <para>- That might be attempted, but we have never had any such experience in the Senate. The standing order providing for the question &#34; that the Senate do now divide&#34; has never been put into operation except on one occasion, when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie proposed that the editor of the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> should be brought to the bar of the Senate for insulting the memory of King James. There is no analogy between the Senate and other legislative bodies in which obstruction might take place. We are only a small House of thirty-six members all told, and I do not think that the whole of the members of the Senate have ever been present at the same time. Our average attendance is about twenty-four, and ample opportunity might be given to every honorable senator to exercise his full right of debate. But the opportunity to exercise the full right of debate will not be given if we are hedged in and limited by the will of the Government in regard to any proposed amending Bill. If the Government chose to introduce a Bill amending the Tariff in respect of the duty on harvesters, as a result of the carrying of the motion submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith,</inline> we should be limited to the consideration of the duty on harvesters, though the majority of honorable senators might be of opinion that the duties imposed on various other articles should also be considered. </para>

                            <para>- The new standing, orders would enable the majority of the Senate to have their way. If the Government introduced a Bill dealing only with the duty on harvesters, in the circumstances I have mentioned, any member of the Senate might move, under these standing orders, that the duties on several other articles should be considered by the Committee. As I understand that several honorable senators desire to discuss other business, I shall not debate the question at length. I wish to quote two or three cases in regard to instructions which are referred to in <inline font-style="italic">May.</inline> There are several classes of cases in regard to instructions, and at page 839 of the 10th edition of <inline font-style="italic">May</inline> it will be found that the first class referred to comprises - </para>

                        <para>Cases when an instruction was necessary to empower a committee on a Bill to consider the amendments proposed by the instruction. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">I mention one or two of the cases coming under this class. There was a Bill introduced in 1862 dealing with markets and fairs in Ireland, and the proposal for an instruction was to insert provisions for the equalization of weights and measures in all mercantile transactions throughout Ireland. Evidently the Bill did not contain provisions dealing with this matter, and so an instruction to consider it was moved. In the case of the Representation of the People Bills of i860 and 1866, an instruction was moved to insert provisions for restraining bribery and corruption at elections. Under class 2, dealing with cases when instructions were unnecessary, because the Committee possessed the power which the instructions would confer, a reference will be found at page 841 to the Western Australian Constitution Bill of 1890. In the case of that Bill it was not considered necessary to move an instruction - to insert clauses enacting that the &#39; Bill should not come into operation until the Act recited in the schedule to the Bill, which conferred a Constitution upon the colony, was amended, by assimilating the franchise, and the qualifications of members of the Legislative Council and Assembly of Western Australia, to those of other Australian colonies. </para>
                    <para class="block">That would appear to have been an important amendment of the measure, and it was considered that an instruction was not necessary to enable the Committee to deal with it. The third class of cases covers cases of instructions ruled out of order as being foreign to the subject matter of the Bill., and at page 841 of <inline font-style="italic">May,</inline> a case quoted is that of the Arms (Ireland) Continuance Bill of 1886, on which an instruction was moved - to insert clauses dealing with the law relating to poor law guardians, labourers&#39; dwellings; and the franchise in corporate towns in Ireland. </para>
                    <para class="block">It was&#39; ruled that that instruction could not be moved, because the matters proposed for consideration were not relevant to the subject matter of the Bill. Class 4 covers cases of instructions to extend the scope of a Bill, and the cases quoted would meet that in which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> proposed that the application of the provisions of the Commerce Bill should be extended to the States of the Commonwealth. That was ruled out of order in Committee of the Senate, because the Bill did not refer to commerce within the States, but with foreign countries. </para>

                    <para>- I have given notice of a motion which asks the Senate to express the opinion that Parliament should at once impose a duty of &#163;25 on every stripper -harvester, and of 21/2d. per lb. on all parts imported separately, brought into the Commonwealth. I regret that I have not been able to move the motion earlier in the session, when it might have been effective in producing the result which I desire to bring about; but it is obvious that that result cannot be obtained by moving it now. Any discussion that might take place upon it under present circumstances would be purely academic, and it might be considered that I am taking an unfair advantage of some honorable senators if I proceed with it. I shall, therefore, refrain from moving it. </para>

                <para>That, in the opinion of this Senate, the refining and wholesale distribution of sugar within the Commonwealth being almost entirely controlled by one large business corporation, constitutes a monopoly which is inimical to the best interests of those engaged in the production of raw sugars and the citizens of the Commonwealth generally; and this Senate affirms the desirableness of nationalizing the said monopoly, so as to secure to the people of the Commonwealth the whole of the benefits accruing therefrom. </para>

                    <para>- I wish to express my gratification at the very full discussion which the motion has received and the generous criticism which it has met with from honorable senators. It is especially pleasing to me to find that, although my conclusions have been disagreed with, no honorable senator has disputed either my facts or my figures, or has had anything to say against my presentment of them. I wish merely to add one other piece of evidence in support of the fact that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company is a monopoly which is exerting its power and influence in restraint of trade, and to prevent competition. I hold in my hand a copy of a contract made with an Adelaide firm, and still in existence, which every customer of the company must sign if he wishes to obtain the rebate of 10s. per ton which is given to those who agree to deal solely with the company. It will be seen that this rebate is of considerable importance to firms buying, perhaps, 3,000 or 4,000 tons of sugar, or even more, annually, and that those who do not accept the company&#39;s conditions are placed at a great disadvantage. The agreement to which I refer was drafted in, and has been in operation since,1896, and I can vouch for the accuracy of the copy which I now read. It is as follows: - </para>

I should like to add an expression of my appreciation of the manner in which we have been treated by you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> and by the Chairman of Committees, in the conduct of debates, and to place on record our acknowledgment to the clerks, to the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> reporters, and to the whole staff connected with this building, for the efforts which they have made to assist us. We have had many battles to fight in this Chamber, and although they have been strenuous, they have left no trace of bitterness in the minds of any one of us, so that we can honestly and cordially wish each other success and prosperity. I hope that, when we meet again, we shall all have a very Merry Christmas and a Happy and prosperous New Year. </para>

                        <para>- I. too, wish to thank the leader of the Senate and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> for their kind appreciation of my efforts. When I entered upon my duties as Chairman of Committees I did so with fear and trembling, because I knew that scenes have occurred in other Parliaments, for which, perhaps, errors of judgment of Chairmen of Committees had been partly responsible, but which, at any rate, have not enhanced the reputation of certain men or the dignity of the Parliaments concerned. Honorable senators, however, have shown such respect to the Chair that my duties have been congenial, and I am very grateful for the manner in which I have been treated. I wish to express to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> to the  Clerk  of the Parliaments, and to the  Clerk  Assistant, my thanks for the generous guidance which I have received in the discharge of my. duties, and to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> for his &#39;readiness to act as Deputy Chairman. I have been asked by some of those sitting round me to acknowledge the good wishes of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford,</inline> and I believe that I express the feeling of every honorable senator when I say that I hope he will enjoy to the full his contemplated holiday in Western Australia. Our support of the Government has been spoken of in some quarters as if it amounted to control, though we are not in a position to support them on every measure; but we can honestly say that we are grateful to them for the manner in which they have treated us. I think we are specially indebted to the Minister of Defence, who stands almost unique as a Minister of the Crown, owing to the candid and frank manner with which he endeavours to supply honorable senators with the fullest possible information. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> has undoubtedly enhanced his reputation since he has occupied the position of an honorary Minister. One particular measure - the Copyright Bill - will for all time stand to his credit. The fact that that measure was so speedily passed through this Chamber and another House was due to the almost perfect way in which it was presented by the honorable senator. I do not know that I can say anything further than to wish you, sir, Ministers, and the officers of the House a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. </para>
