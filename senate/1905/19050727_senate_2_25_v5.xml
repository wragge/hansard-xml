            <para class="block">I understand that the amendments which have been proposed in this Bill by the Standing Orders Committee, and which are fairly extensive, have only very recently been received from the Government Printer. What it is proposed to go into Committee to consider is really the report of the Standing Orders Committee. The revised copy of the Bill, however, has not been circulated sufficiently long, I think, to enable the Committee to usefully proceed this afternoon. Therefore, I only propose to go into Committee formally to enable the report of that body, to be received, and possibly to pass the first clause of the Bill, so that honorable senators may have full opportunity to consider the amendments proposed. It will be remembered that the second reading of this Bill was affirmed in the first Parliament, and again last session. It had, I think, the general support of every section in the Chamber, and after we went into Committee it was referred to the Standing Orders Committee for their report. </para>

                    <para>. - The principle of this Bill was affirmed some time ago by the second reading being carried, and it was then sent to a committee, who made a report on it and suggested certain amendments. The course which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> proposes, to follow meets with the concurrence and support of Ministers, namely, to have the Bill and report now remitted to a committee of the whole Senate, but, inasmuch as the suggested amendments and the report of the Standing Orders Committee have not been printed sufficiently long to enable honorable senators to acquaint themselves with all particulars, it is thought best that after the consideration of. one or two of the minor classes this afternoon progress should be reported, and the consideration of the Bill in Committee should be resumed at a convenient date. </para>

                    <para>. - I desire to move the motion standing in my name with reference to the Kalgoorlie and Port Augusta Railway Survey (Bill, but I ask for leave to alter the date upon which the adjourned debate is to be resumed from July 27th to Wednesday next; I take it that this is a purely formal motion, because the real discussion will take place on the continuation of the debate on the second reading of the Bill. The debate was cut short last year by the prorogation. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> was then in possession. I will agree to put off the resumption of the debate until a later date if honorable senators wish, because I have no desire to rush the matter unnecessarily. But there seems to be a. general desire that the debate should be taken on Wednesday next. </para>

                        <para>- I rise to a point of order. I think that, the motion is out of order, inasmuch as it is not in accordance with the Constitution. I understand that the Bill referred to in the motion was introduced in another place upon a message from the Crown, because it was a measure which involved the appropriation df a certain amount of revenue. Subsequently it came up to this Chamber, and it was under consideration when the prorogation took place. Standing order No. 234 provides that - </para>

                    <para>A vote resolution or proposed law for the appropriation of revenue or moneys shall not be passed unless the purpose of the appropriation has in the same session been recommended by message of the Governor-General to the House in which the proposal originated. </para>

                <para>That is very clear and definite, and shows that any Bill having to be recommended by message from the Crown, which comes before the Senate, and has not been disposed of when the prorogation takes places, cannot be covered by the standing order which I have quoted. Unless a message comes down to the House, in which the Bill originated, we cannot take the Bill up again, and deal with it in the same way as we can deal with a Bill of another kind. This is a matter which is outside all party interest, and should be dealt with on its merits. I bring up the point, not because it has any relation to the question involved in the motion, but because I think we should endeavour, as far as possible, to see that everything that we do is within the limits of the Constitution. One can easily conceive of a situation arising in the only House in which Bills involving the appropriation of revenue can be introduced - namely, the other place - where the Government might bring down a Bill at the commencement of a session, with a message from the Governor-General. The Senate might take an opposite view of the measure. There might be a long discussion, and at the time of the prorogation that Bill might not have been dealt with. In the next session circumstances might have changed. The Government, according to this standing order, need not even introduce the measure afresh. There might be ian opportunity to get it pushed through at the end of the session. Suppose - as we can easily conceive to be the case - that a Bill has been left over at the time of prorogation, and that at the commencement of the next session there is no evidence that it is likely to be brought up again. Towards the end of the session, when members mav, perhaps, have become tired, or when many may have been called away, the Government may take advantage of the position, utilize this standing order, and so be enabled to get through a Bill of that description merely by keeping it back for a certain, time. But we have the protection of the Constitution in reference to Bills which appropriate revenue. I contend that a message must be brought down in the same session in which a Bill appropriating revenue is submitted to Parliament. I hold that section 56 of the Constitution absolutely prevents a Bill of this description from being brought forward without a Governor-General's message. Therefore, I submit that the motion of the leader of the Senate is altogether out of order. </para>

                        <para>- The substance of the matter has, it appears to me, been a little lost sight of in the remarks made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating.</inline> There are two classes of appropriations, that for the ordinary annual services, and that which is covered by such a Bill as is now under consideration, namely, an appropriation for specific purposes. This section of the Constitution, therefore, applies to the present Bill. In addition to the point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley,</inline> there is the question whether, in view of section 56 of the Constitution, such a Bill as this is one which properly comes under standing order 234 in regard to lapsed Bills. Without dealing with the narrower question as to whether a message can be brought in during the progress of a Bill, which has been introduced in another branch of the Legislature, there is the further question of substance, namely, whether this standing order is applicable to a Bill which requires a message from the Governor-General to be brought down in the same session. That evidently means in the session in which the measure originated. I venture to think that this is not such a Bill as ought to be included within the meaning of standing order 234. Section 56 of the Constitution is evidently limited to Bills which go through their ordinary course - Bills which are supported by a message from the Governor-General - and is not applicable to Bills which are covered by standing order 234. It is true that standing order 234 is an extremely useful one, but it ought not to be extended in its operation in a way which might interfere with the privileges and powers of Parliament, or with the objects which are intended to be safeguarded by section 56. As this measure was introduced by a Ministry of which I had the honour to be a member, I have no doubt that everything was done in regular order, and that there was a message last year. The Bill is practically at an end. Standing order 234 gives power to revive Bills of an ordinary character, but not, I submit, Bills requiring a message from the Governor-General. Bills such as that now before us are on an altogether different footing from Bills of an ordinary character. Our Standing Orders are subject to the powers and provisions of the Constitution, and standing order 234 is subject to section 56. That section has, so to speak, been exhausted, and if it is intended to apply it again, there ought to be a new Bill with" a new appropriation under a new message. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> has been supplied with the information that during the debate in the Federal Convention, there were certain words in clause 56 which we do not find now in the section, namely, " first " or " previously." While those words have been eliminated, there is another important word not eliminated, and which I think possesses the full value that " first " or " previously " would have held. The word I refer to is " purpose," which implies nothing else but something done previously. If honorable senators read the section, they will see that this motion cannot be passed, unless the "purpose " has in the same session been recommended. There can be no interpretation of the words which denies that the "purpose " has to precede the passing, of the resolution. I suppose we are now asked to pass a motion without a message, and, if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating's</inline> .argument be sound, I would point out that the word "has" has a significance. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating's</inline> contention be good, we ought, instead of " has," to have the words " shall have been." </para>

                        <para>- I am not in the least degree " too previous " when I point out that the revival of the measure is practically the first step to, and a part of, the introduction of a Bill which will approxx plate money. The elimination of the words in the original draft do not alter in any sense the purport of the section, as is shown by the insertion of the word " pur- pose," followed by the word "has," which necessarily imply that something has to be done before we can proceed. We all know that what is necessary is a message from the Crown. </para>

                        <para>- Before the final passing of the Bill, because the whole thing is governed by the words " shall not be passed." If the section were intended to take effect at the earliest stages of a Bill the words used would be " shall not be proposed," " shall not be introduced." or " shall not be read a second time." But the words are explicit enough - "shall not be passed." The value of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating's</inline> quotation from <inline font-style="italic">Quick and Garran</inline> is that it has shown that it was in the minds of the members of the Convention to make the section apply to the introductory stages of a vote, resolution, or Bill, but, acting upon the suggestion of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid,</inline> it was decided that it should apply to the final stages. I am surprised that old parliamentarians should contend that it is not possible to bring in a message after a Bill has been introduced. I venture to say that the Minister of Defence has many a time had occasion to submit even a second message increasing a proposed appropriation after a Bill has been introduced. </para>

                        <para>- There can be no doubt whatever that this matter is full of difficulties. I am very much afraid that standing order 234 as to lapsed Bills is going to lead us into difficulties. I am aware that many persons believe that a great saving of time will be brought about if Parliament in one session can take up the business which was left uncompleted in the previous session. The Imperial Parliament has, at different times, appointed select committees to inquire concerning this matter, and they have deliberately refused to recommend any such procedure. The difficulties brought before them were such that they thought it was not wise to adopt this Lapsed Bills Standing Order. I should like, before giving a final decision, to think the matter over; but I point out now that one or two considerations have not been referred to. This Bill undoubtedly appropriates revenue. It says so on its face. It says, " the sum of , £20,000 is accordingly appropriated." There is no doubt about that. Then the third reading of the Bill was absolutely passed by the House of Representatives last session, and if we pass it this session, the House of Representatives will have nothing further to do with it. It will have been disposed of. That being so, how can it be said that a message can be received in the same session by the House in which the Billoriginated? </para>

                    <para>- We have not, perhaps, seen very much of each other of late, and it is very pleasing that we should be gathered together again. I am not at all sure that I find it in any way unpleasant to <inline font-style="italic">be</inline> addressing my fellow senators from this side of the chamber. I passed an exceedingly happy time for four months on the other side of the table, through the goodwill of honorable senators. During that time we got through some fairly satisfactory work, though perhaps we did rot absolutely satisfy everybody. I had not an opportunity before, and I therefore avail myself of this opportunity, to thank the two honorable senators who, with great goodness and ability, moved and seconded the Address-in-Reply to the speech of His Excellency the Governor- General. I have also to convey to the Senate a message from our colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best,</inline> who recently communicated with me, and sent his kindest regards to myself and all his brother senators. I am sure we hope he has had an extremely pleasant holiday, and that we may have an opportunity to welcome him back here very shortly. In connexion with recent events members of the Senate have been very much in  the position of onlookers, but I think it is due to the constitutional position which the Senate occupies, its status, and the influence it ought to exert, that honorable senators should take a hand, and not be mere dumb spectators of the movements of parties, or simply be in the position of silently registering action which may be taken in another place, or the changes that may ensue upon any such! action. Ministers formally introduced themselves about a fortnight ago. That was more or less a pleasing ceremonial, and yesterday they came to us in what we might call their working clothes, and accompanied by what I suppose they call a policy. The proceed'ings of yesterday were characterized by several innovations. In the first place, we had, I think, for the first time, certainly in my experience, a statement from Ministers, with respect to changes taking place after Parliament had been opened, put in writing. </para>

                        <para>- We started it, and we were criticised for doing so, but there is no flattery like imitation. My honorable friend began his observations 'yesterday with some little allusion to the GovernorGeneral's speech, submitted by the last Ministry. The Ministry to which the honorable senator belongs, has attempted to follow an example which was a good one in its particular place, but! it was not at all applicable to the situation in which) my honorable friend and his colleagues have found themselves. My honorable friend said that really he was bringing down a Governor-General's speech. That was no explanation, nor was. it any excuse for the innovation, because a statement of policy is always submitted on a change of Government occurring after the opening of a Parliament, through the medium of a .Governor-General's speech. Personally, I have no such reverence for those hoary traditions which require the formality of a Governor-General's speech, to induce me to extend them to an occasion when the flowing eloquence of my friend might be much more usefully employed, than that he should be bound down hand and foot within the four corners of a written instrument. It would take a good deal of binding to hold bini down. </para>

                        <para>- I know that my honorable friend is pretty safe, and we all know that he is inclined at times to take the bit between his teeth. But, after all, from his long experience he is not so very headstrong as to need to be treated in this sort of way and to be deprived of at least a little freedom of speech on an occasion when a few extra words would have given us perhaps some further useful explanation on the matters to which he was referring. He is an old parliamentary hand, and I am sure that the last thing in the world he would wish to be would be a kind of marionette, and therefore he said that one reason why this course was adopted was to prevent any little divergencies which might be taken hold of. It was much better to have it in that way, so that he should be carefully restricted. </para>

I thought that this policy had been approved of by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watson</inline> before the Government was permitted to be formed, and I certainly did not think it would be necessary to bind down my honorable friend so strictly within the four corners of a written instrument, in case he should make a bolt of it, and some slight divergences take place which might occasion trouble. </para>

We cannot have the dominant party in the situation it occupies without giving it the rights which properly belong to its strength, and the condition on which the Ministry have taken office. I see all my honorable friends opposite. They make it quite pleasant for me to address the Senate. It is a brave array. </para>

                        <para>- And I never turn my back. We all know the parliamentary teetotum. Some one said yesterday that there had been a good' deal of turning round lately, but I am bound to say that, however I may differ from my honorable friends, who I notice, keep as far away as possible from the centre of things - they do not want to have too close an attachment - they have not been in the habit of coming within the category of those who do turn round or of the parliamentary teetotum. There are .some very different persons to whom I may have occasion very briefly to allude before I have finished. Too much time must not be wasted in analyzing the psychology of the parliamentary teetotum'. But we all have in our minds - I am not going to mention any names, although I know one or two. </para>

                        <para>- I should not have selected my fri'end <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> .as one, and although he takes a very strong view on the Bill for the survey of a railway to Western Australia there is another gentleman who takes a very strong view on the opposite side, who is not free from the charge of turning round in connexion with recent events. As another honorable senator on the opposite side said - I think it was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> - this is a time of new departures and innovations, and what has just been suggested to me as to my honorable friend sitting opposite is really one of the indications of these changes or new departures which have taken place. Of course, my honorable friends sit there in the body, but I venture to think that the spirit is not there. They give no doubt a moral support, and they help to fill the benches which otherwise would be occupied by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles,</inline> and perhaps <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith.</inline> There would be a very beggarly array of empty benches on the other side but for the moral countenance, shall I say, which my honorable friends give. </para>

                        <para>- No one will suggest that my honorable friends have ever departed from a strong moral determination to adhere to their own plat-, form and to secure their own ends. But? when I say that I am afraid that whilst they_ are sitting there, whilst their lips, and perhaps, occasionally their votes, if they think fit, may aid my honorable friends representing the Government in the Senate, their hearts are far from them. I should do them less than justice if I imagined anything else in respect to a Government whose head had denounced them as seeking to hurl this country and its interests over a precipice - a Government which includes a Treasurer who has denounced the party as a menace to the good government of this country. I do not believe it possible myself, but at the same time the object which; my honorable friends have in view is that of achieving their aims, which they are perfectly entitled to follow out, if they can. </para>

                        <para>- It is a mere passing hallucination under which, I suppose, my honorable friends have laboured. But whilst it possesses that quality of unreality, it is to them naturally a satisfactory position to enable them to secure as much or as great an advance in respect of their own objects and policy as they possibly can. I commend them for it. I think that every party is entitled to do the same thing, and it is not the Labour Party which is to be adversely criticised for endeavouring to further their own policy by occupying the position, which they occupied for three years or more, of the third party in the parliamentary Government of the Commonwealth, and wielding the power w'hich that situation gave them. That is the situation, as the Prime Minister has said, to which we have to come back. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> diverged a little from the letter of his statement, and so blundered in reference to. for instance, the transcontinental railway. My honorable friend said - and I take this, the earliest opportunity, of correcting him - that the late Government were strongly in favour of its construction. </para>

                        <para>- My honorable friend has withdrawn the statement as to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons,</inline> as I hope we shall all be willing to do when we make an inaccurate statement. 'But that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> was most strongly opposed to this Bill last session I intimated on more than one occasion to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest, and therefore <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> was naturally incensed when this attitude was, quite inadvertently, I am sure, attributed to him by my honorable friend. I shall allude presently in very brief terms to two or three of the incidents which led up to a situation which, perhaps, is not customary in politics, and certainly is not very usual. I say this : that no defeat of a Ministry was ever less of a triumph to the gentleman who brought it about. I do not wonder that ever since he has been living in clouds of explanation and apologetics without number. The fact of the matter is, it seems to me, that Parliament is beginning to think that in defeating the late Ministry it really whipped the wrong boy. It reminds me of an old story about a school where the punishment was conducted on the old Eton principle of bringing the boys up on a particular day of the week before the head-master and administering chastisement to them. On one Saturday - the day set aside for the purpose - a number of boys were called up by the master, who had a list in his hand, for the usual dose of punishment. When one boy was brought in he asked," " Well, sir, what am I to be punished for?" The head-master replied, " I do not know ; but you are on the list, and I have to go through with it." But after he had flogged the boy the head-master found on&gt; examining his list that he had flogged the confirmation class ! I think the country is beginning to feel that it is the boys of the confirmation class who have been punished by Parliament, and not the real delinquent, of whom they have formed, however, a pretty strong opinion. What was the situation? The situation was this - that the present Prime Minister, having asked for fiscal peace, in October, 1903, declared it to be one of the permanent planks of the platform which he put before Australia at the general elections. He also denounced the continuance of what he called the three-party system. As honorable senators are aware, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> was really the first who exhibited that three-party spectre on the public platform. He had lived under it, and groaned under its servitude for three years, according to his own statement. He declared that parliamentary government had become impossible. It was intolerable ; it could not. continue. Only the other day at an Australian Natives' gathering he said that unless the number of parties was reduced to two the working of constitutional government would be rendered impossible. He said - </para>

                <para class="block">That is exactly what the late Government felt. That was the exact alternative as to the position of things which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> criticised and denounced. There were two alternatives - either a coalition or an appeal to the people. As <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> says so still, I ask how could it be possible for him to assert that the will of the people, which he was instrumental in having ascertained, is represented by the present situation in that respect? It is a very strange thing that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> should now find that condition of servitude to be perfect freedom ! I am not saying whether the position which he formerly took up was a just position or not. But according to his own account he had felt the pinch of the parliamentary oppression of the situation from which he sought escape. He felt that some eighteen months ago. Now we have the same situation brought about again, , and the same difficulty has to be experienced by himself and his colleagues. He is in exactly the position of the celebrated man from Thessaly - </para>

                <para class="block">The position was that the fiscal question had been got out of the way, and there was no impediment, therefore, to the projected coalition. A coalition with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watson's</inline> party was impossible, for the reason, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> himself explained, that, apart altogether from questions of policy and the fiscal question, there was the great obstacle of organization which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin,</inline> in a subsequent speech at Ballarat, said had to be swallowed together with the objects of the party. And even as recently as the 12th October last year, it was shown what little sympathy there was in the combined party on broad questions of policy, apart from the fiscal question which, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> said, had disappeared from the arena. On being challenged, I think, by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mauger, Mr. Deakin</inline> repudiated, with something like scorn, the idea that he had ever had the slightest idea that on the formation of the Watson Government he would sit in the Ministerial corner. What was left ? There was left the coalition, of which, I say, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> was the chief architect - the arrangement that was brought about between himself and the free-traders. The protectionists and the free-traders had, up to the time when the fiscal question disappeared, been separated by a strong line of demarcation. But that line of demarcation having been wiped out, there was nothing to prevent their, coalescing and working together, generally speaking, with regard to other points of the programme. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watson's</inline> party was strong, and I say it is largely dominant in. the country at this moment. This is due to the efforts and discipline of the party, and due to other causes, quite apart from questions of policy. But they are a dominant party, and they were placed, not in the position of arbiter as a third party, but in the position either of a direct opposition, or directly in power. I say that under these circumstances, Mr. . Deakin, first of all was the chief architect of the coalition. In fact, when the coalition Government was formed he joined in building it. But for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin,</inline> and what were at least regarded 'as his emphatic pledges, this coalition Government would never have come into existence. But for the assurances - but for the sinking of the fiscal question by the voice of the country on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin's</inline> initiative - but for the pledges which, at any rate, we believed we had of his loyal and general support, I am quite certain that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid</inline> would never have formed that Government. Whether <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid</inline> would, or would not, have formed the Government, I am perfectly certain that one member of the Government, namely, myself, would never have entered it. Further, as honorable senators are aware, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin,</inline> as leader of the Protectionist Party, contributed from that party half of the Ministry ; he was literally the leader of four members of that Government. </para>

                    <para>Beyond and behind that programme, we have the Government itself, and I have no hesitation in saying that the four members of the Ministry who represent the party to which I have always belonged possess our unqualified confidence. </para>

                <para>We know them, we have tried them, and we are quite content to trust to their loyalty, to their principles. We could not find better men. And so of the four members headed by the Prime Minister, they are equally representative of their party, and rank as its very ablest men. We are satisfied that we can trust the Government. ... I am certain that the honorable and learned member for Indi, who has served with two out of the four protectionists in the Ministry, will admit that no more trustworthy men have ever represented us in Parliament, and, certainly, no men whose adherence to that policy has been launcher. What better guarantee for its future can we obtain than their presence in the Cabinet? They are there to give effect to their pledges. </para>
                <para class="block">They were there to give effect to the pledge that the fiscal question would not be raised, and that the Government would harmoniously proceed on the very broad lines agreed to by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin.</inline></para>
                <para>When they cease to do that, it will be time for us to reconsider the situation. But I do nod anticipate that any such occasion will arise. </para>
                <para class="block">First of all, it will be seen that the coalition was established in the way I have described. We had <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin's</inline> own basis made its foundation; we had the guarantee and the cement of the four Ministers who represented him and his party, and upon that footing, and that footing alone, the Reid-McLean Government took office I admit that there was one uncertain element - at least, I admit that now, in the light of subsequent events - and that was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> himself. But we thought there was no uncertainty. He went up to Ballarat on the 2nd of August, and delivered a speech which set forth the policy which was his at that time, and stiff is - because I have no reason to suppose for a moment that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> has altered his attitude - I do not attribute that to him in any way - upon the broad lines which then separated him from the Labour Party. I refer to his first Ballarat speech, on the 2nd of August last year. What did he go up for? He went up under the auspices of a league formed to subdue, as far as possible, " that extreme socialistic legislation which is being brought forward throughout the length and breadth of Australia." </para>

              <inline font-weight="bold">- Senator Higgs</inline>is as strong a protectionist as I am a free-trader. Still, I said after the Tariff was passed that during this Parliament - and I was quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne as saying so - the interests of this country, strong free-trader though I was, demanded rest from fiscal strife for a time. I give credit to my honorable friends for their belief that protection may be a good thing, though I do not agree with them; protection may be all that they think it is, and free-trade may be all I think it is, but there is a greater thing than either protection or free-trade for the interests of this country, and that is an opportunity for the peaceful development of a man's avocation, instead of the perpetual strife and turmoil which are incidental to the continual tinkering with the Tariff. "Tinkering" is an expression of my honorable and learned friend at the head of the present Government. We cannot sit here as practical men, and not see that a difference of a small percentage of duty, which may for the moment mean an increase in connexion with a particular manufacture, would not justify the opening of the sluice gates of the whole of the Tariff. What has always been felt is, that the moment that, from, either the ' free-trade or the protectionist side, you endeavour, on points of duties, to open up some line with a view to redress an inequality, or a mischief if you please,, that moment you give opportunities to others, who are as justly entitled to make their claims,- to come in, and seek the same kind of redress. I admitted that that was the true attitude to take.

                        <para>- At any rate, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> said it was a permanent plank in his platform. We know what he said with bated breath. Perhaps we cannot take his rhetorical expression literally, but he said that he hoped it would be for ever in perpetuity. I am not now suggesting that the question of fiscal peace is in issue at the present time. I am merely contending from these quotations that we were justified in looking, not only to what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> had previously said as to his unalterable attitude of opposition, generally speaking, to the aims and methods of the Labour Party. On the 2nd August, a few days before the formation of the coalition Government, the honorable and learned gentleman denounced ' the aims and methods of the Labour Party in language which admits of no doubt as to his views, and which makes it passing strange to .me that he should be able now to re-adopt the position which was described as one of servitude, existing only eighteen months ago. </para>

He and we knew perfectly well all along what the strength of the Government was, and that our reliance must be on the loyal observance of the foundations of the coalition. If the Government was weak from the cause to which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> alluded, the continued existence of something like a three-party system, the least he could have done was not to have battered it about and held it up to obloquy for its weakness. He was the last man who should have done so. He should have endeavoured to make it strong, and, at any rate, to have abstained from these public animadversions on its weakness. </para>

                <para class="block">Notwithstanding the previous statement that in terms it was not broken, that was equivalent to an announcement that the fiscal basis of the coalition was at an end. It is a marvellous thing to me that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> should not have taken that view, and- stated that he considered the fiscal basis of the coalition at an end when the Tariff Commission was moved for and granted in October, 1904. If such an intimation, as was given in that Ballarat speech had been even hinted at or whispered by the honorable and learned member, either the Commission would not have been issued or the step which was now taken would have been taken there and then. We had no right to exist. The only condition of our existence on which we were entitled to come before Parliament as honorable men was that, notwithstanding the Tariff Commission, notwithstanding any questions with regard to progress reports, or anything of the kind, the fiscal peace which had been proclaimed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin,</inline> andassented to by the people of this country, was still in existence ; but not a word of that kind was used. Then comes a long attack on the Prime Minister's views on Socialism. I am not venturing to discuss the views couched in the very vaguest possible language which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> uttered with regard to Socialism. His nebulous views may be right or they may be wrong. But was it a loyal or friendly thing to make a prolonged attack on the policy put forward in that respect by the Prime Minister in the course of his speeches? The understanding being that this fiscal peace was to last until the next ordinary general election, that is by effluxion of time, and not to take effect upon a penal dissolution, my honorable and learned friend went on to sweep that away, to cast it to the winds, and to say - </para>

                <para>Of course any man can ask a question, any independent candidate can go before the country on the fiscal question, but when the leader of the Protectionist Party had invited, an opinion from the country and had accepted it, and when he had entered into a compact based on that opinion, pledging himself until the next ordinary dissolution of the House of Representatives, then I think we were entitled to some kind of notice. When the act of granting the Tariff Commission took place, we were entitled to some kind of intimation that it was regarded as putting an end to the foundation upon which the Government presented itself to Parliament. But we had no such intimation. What was our duty ? If we had any doubt. the next two sentences made it perfectly clear - </para>

                        <para>- That is not the view I present. It is a kind of political self-abasement, which is not pleasant to look upon. If my honorable friend intended it, according to the way ir» which his language reads, and I am not aware that it has ever been withdrawn, it is an offer to barter his support, either to' the one or the other, for protection, at a time when he was pledged to fiscal peace. Until that time it was fiscal peace, neither protection nor free-trade. Now it is art intimation to the four representatives of his party in -the Government, " Hold yourselves immediately in readiness. Unless the leader of the Government, unless the leagues with which he is associated, and1 which he has assisted in framing, adopt protection, I must beckons you to come out." That was the situation. The opposition- to us who are freetraders would have been nothing if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> had' been speaking as any individual member might speak. But the honorable and learned gentleman, we must recollect, was the leader of the party which contributed half the Government. In that situation, it seems to me that there was no other course for the Government to adopt - no honorable, self-respecting course - than that which they did adopt. They had taken office on the foundation of fiscal peace and loyal coalition in opposition to the Labour Party. The Ministry was founded on a belief in the assurance they had received, and on the pledges which they believed they had. When these were withdrawn, it was their duty to come to Parliament and say so. </para>

                        <para>- The intimation was an intimation that the cement of the coalition was gone. There may be an indifference to reputation, an indifference to self-respect. But there are limits; and when the honorable and learned member for Ballarat significantly intimated that at any moment those questions which we had agreed to drop might be reopened, that he was free to bargain with the Labour Party whom he assisted us into office to oppose, our course was clear. It was not merely like taking away one vote or two votes from the Government. It was changing the whole foundation of the existence of the coalition. When that was brought about, to suggest that we were to go on from day to day, liable to humiliation and to surprises, is to suggest something that it would be impossible for any self-respecting Government to do. It was impossible to conduct the business of the country honorably under those conditions. I am not questioning whether the honorable and learned member for Ballarat thought he was right in doing what he did. I am not inquiring into the reasons which he mav flatter himself satisfied his conscience. I am merely pointing to the facts. His Ballarat speech was recognised as a " notice to quit " by the press. Of course we pay no attention to that. But what is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin's</inline> explanation ? He does not say that -it was not a " notice to quit. " He says that it might be a notice to quit of one month,, three months, six months, or twelve months hence. We preferred to be tenants for a definite time, such as we understood we were, not to be at the beck and call of any party under those circumstances. Personally, i am as perfectly satisfied to be of use to the country, and of assistance, if I can be, in this Senate, where I am now, as where my honorable friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> is sitting. Surely no one could hold office upon any such tenure on an intimation, not by one or by half-a-dozen members of their disapproval, but after an intimation by the leader of half the Government. That was quite a different thing. Honorable senators will see that the four protectionist members of the Government were placed in an extremely painful position. Naturally enough, our loyalty to them - our sympathetic loyalty - was a considerable element in determining our action. When the motion of no-confidence was moved in October last, the members of the protectionist corner wanted a dissolution. They stated their desire over and over again. Honorable senators will find it in the pages of last session's <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mauger,</inline> the honorable member for Melbourne Ports, when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> said he was quite aware of the fact that the Tariff was working injustices in some particulars when he advocated fiscal peace, and that if there were new facts the thing would have to be considered again at another election - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mauger</inline> said very emphatically, "Let it come at once." <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Isaacs</inline> on another occasion was similarly emphatic a,s to the need then for a dissolution. Looking at the general uncertainty which existed in the arena of politics, every one recognised that there were two alternatives - dissolution and appeal to the country to settle things somehow or other, or coalition. First coalition was tried. We came to Parliament, and believed that the coalition rested upon a good foundation. That having failed, the 0111\ course was to tell Parliament that it had failed, and that in our belief the alternative was to appeal to the country. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> said yesterday that' the late Government did not bring down the usual Governor-General's speech containing a list of measures. The usual GovernorGeneral's speech was brought down, and it contained what we believed to be the only piece of public business which it was imperative to settle - that is the Redistribution of Seats Bill. We believed - and through the Governor-General we invited Parliament to believe that it was necessary to transact that particular piece of business with a view to an early dissolution. Of course a dissolution " is not a pleasant thing to members of Parliament : but that was the course which we believed to be the only possible one for the best interests of good government under the circumstances. We believed that it was the only way to reduce the state, of chaos into which parties and programmes had, got into something like order. How did the Ballarat speech come to be made? There was a parliamentary visit to Western Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid</inline> went over. I do not know whether it was at the invitation of the right honorable member for Swan or not. Afterwards <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> went over. At that time <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest was halting between two things. _ There were the claims of local politics which might be regarded as a bird in hand, and there were also the claims of Federal politics, which were like two in the bush. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid</inline> returned from Western Australia </para>

                <para>SenatorSir JOSIAH SYMON. - At any rate, so far as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> is concerned, he gains the privilege of submitting his programme to Mir. Watson before he is even permitted to form his Government ; and no doubt that is worth a great deal. My honorable friends opposite seem to doubt whether there was a concurrence. They say that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> was speaking in these matters for himself.

Not unnaturally, he was a bit indignant when his Government was thrown out of office on the former occasion, and therefore we must make allowance for what he said. He complained very bitterly that he and his colleagues and those who supported them had been hurled from the dominant position in Australia. He said that the position seemed to him to be impossible. That was the three-party system. So that it will be seen that the present Prime Minister was not speaking entirely for himself. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest said - </para>

My remarks might not be so apropos if the party were a small one, but as it is as large as, if not larger than, any other party in the House, it must be recognised that it now has a responsibility which, except when the Labour Government held office, was not apparently cast upon it. We shall now have their physic direct from their own hands. We shall not have to take physic from a third party, as has been the custom, not only in this Parliament, but in all the States Parliaments of Australia in which there is a Labour Party. </para>

I am sorry to have to speak thus ; but when we have such changes as we have seen, we in the Senate are entitled to seek to maintain, at any rate some degree of harmony between the rulers of the country, who are in the Ministry, and the dominant party with whom they are supposed to be acting. And we should like to see some degree of some initial harmony between the members of the Government themselves. We know perfectly well that no One has spoken in stronger terms of denunciation of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne, than has <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ewing.</inline> The last-mentioned gentleman had two planks in his platform, which he announced to the House of Representatives last year.

The Prime Minister is agreeable and amiable, but it is all the more to be regretted that there is any foundation for what I shall call the suggestion that an arrangement, entered into and acted on in the formation of a Government, which came to the House on the basis of that arrangement, should be made impossible, if not in words, at any rate in action, by departures to which honorable men are not prepared to submit. There was one matter referred to in the second Ballarat speech which was rather personal to myself, and as to which I propose to say a word. This has relation to the High Court. There are some aspects of the action of the High Court which may be said to be regrettable, or even, to use the words of my honorable friend, deplorable. I do not, however, propose to bring those aspects into controversy now. </para>

                        <para>- Naturally, I am very fully informed on the matter ; perhaps no one is so familiar with the facts as myself. It may be necessary to say a good deal - and I am disposed to sa.y a good deal - at some other time on this matter. At present, in the absence of information and documents, I believe it to be in the interests of the tribunal itself to abstain from1 discussing! these particular aspects. There are other aspects which I hope will be the subject of specific treatment. One is presented in the question whether the Court is to determine absolutely without reference to the Executive, or, indeed, Parliament, where.. and when it shall sit - whether, as at present, it is to sit at uncertain times in uncertain places and for uncertain business, and expenditure incurred at the will of the Court without control, or whether the sittings are to be specifically prescribed and a proper clear footing established. There is the question whether, as at present, Melbourne, which is the seat of the Court by law, is to be practically ignored in that character. But those questions will be better determined, and better discussed under a Bill which months ago I intimated it was my intention, had I remained in the Government, to introduce, and which I hope the present Government may bring forward. If not I shall take an opportunity of doing so. I may say, quite frankly that I do not think it would be in the interest of the country or of the tribunal itself that matters should be left in the present uncertain position. But there is another matter which has been alluded to, namely, the travelling allowances. On that question, seeing that the Orders in Council have been made public already, I have a word to say. When I took office last year there was no limit whatever to the travelling allowances. Whatever accounts the associates presented, certified by the Justices, were paid without question. ' <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watson's</inline> Government interfered in several of these matters. I do not wish to go into details now, as there will be another opportunity to do so. But on this particular matter, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watson's</inline> Government sought to put a limit upon the daily allowances, and they took steps to that end, but up to the time we assumed office nothing was done. Their effort came as a legacy to me. I did not open the matter up. It was a proper thing to do, but I did not open it up. On The Estimates, as honorable senators will recollect, I reduced the amount put down for travelling allowances by about £700 to £2,000, although I had not then had an opportunity of going into the matter in detail. When the item came up for discussion here, some honorable senators called attention, to it, and took exception to the amount. Eventually the item was passed, and one honorable senator, I remember, said, "Why, that amounts to £40 a week," which is a very great deal. But I did not know then that the travelling expenses for November came to something more like £110 per week. I promised the Senate, 'as it was my duty to do, to exercise supervision, and investigate these matters in detail. It is not a pleasant thing, it is rather a hard and thankless task, to economize. It was the last thing in the world that I personally would have taken up, except as a matter of public duty. In fact, it is very much easier to spend £1,000 than to save one shilling. We. know that if these things are allowed to go on they not merely feed expenditure, but are apt to feed the spirit of expenditure. I found on investigation that the total expenditure on travelling allowances to the 31st December last - these are facts in public possession - amounted to £3,294 i-is. 1 id. for twelve working months, or for fifteen calender months, three of which were occupied by vacation. I then fixed a maximum. The Watson Government had proposed a maximum, and I fixed a maximum of three guineas per day, including the associate. A fixed daily rate was then requested - it is a matter of history - and the Government then, upon my recommendation, fixed two guineas per day for the travelling allowances of each of the Justices. That I thought, and still think, ample. We were then asked to undo this, and tol go back to the old method1 of allowing actual expenses up to £4 per day - that is, for £1 a day more - for each Justice with the associate. The Government adhered to the two guineas' proposal as most liberal, and the Orders in Council, which have been published, were passed. That so far' as I know is the position in which, unless it has been altered since the present Government took office, the matter now stands. There is a Supreme Court in Canada identical in scope and in station with the High Court of Australia. That Supreme Court was constituted, I think, in the year 1876. It consists of a Chief Justice and five Justices. Those Justices were originally Justices of the Court of Exchequer, because no additional Judges were appointed for what was called the Exchequer Court, which was merely a Court to transact the business in original jurisdiction, and the business in original jurisdiction was transacted until recently, when a separate Exchequer Judge was appointed, by the Justices of the Supreme Court, just as it is done now by the Justices of our High Court. The Supreme Court of Canada, in its appellate jurisdiction, is a great appellate tribunal, which in common with every other Court of the same kind throughout the British Dominions, holds its sittings in one place - Ottawa. It is not a perambulatory Court. It sits at Ottawa, and what is more, the Judges of the Court are compelled by the statute under which the Court is established to reside in Ottawa, or within five miles' of that city. So that that Court, as an appellate Court, does not travel at all. But each individual Judge did travel, and the Judge of the Exchequer Court travels now, 10 transact original jurisdiction. Only within the last day or two I have obtained information on this point from an authoritative source in Canada. The Judges of the Supreme Court in Canada, acting as Exchequer Judges, and travelling for original jurisdiction, got a travelling allowance of six dollars per day each, which is about 25s. I have not been in Canada for some twenty-five years, but I was under the impression that hotel, travelling, and living expenses were not, as a rule, less in Canada than they are in Australia. My belief is that they are perhaps more. </para>

                        <para>- It should not make so great a difference in the salaries. However, I do not wish at present to discuss the matter in any controversial spirit; I wish merely to submit these facts to the Senate. Probably I should not have alluded to the subject at all to-day, but for the fact that this information came to me by the last mail. The Judge of the Exchequer Court in Canada gets £1,232 per annum. That is the Judge who now travels and does the original jurisdiction work of the Supreme Court of Canada. I have mentioned these facts to the Senate, and I wish only to add that my position in regard to economy on this question is not new. It is over twenty years now since I first became a strong advocate of Federation in the House of Assembly in South Australia, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> probably remembers. I have never ceased to hold that it is desirable that there should be a strong, dignified Supreme Federal Court. I looked to the establishment of a Court which would fill the place and discharge the functions which have been filled and discharged by that exalted tribunal <inline font-style="italic">iv</inline> the United States of America, which Chief Justice Marshal, and other great, but simple-minded men, have made illustrious. When you go into the Supreme Court of the United States, as I have done, you feel that you are in the presence of a very great tribunal, which is doing justice, and, if I may use the expression, loving righteousness, clothed with the dignity of a great simplicity. There are no wigs. </para>

It need have no splendour,, but the publicity of its judgments and their essential justice. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">So that, before the Bill was passed, and. when its fate was more or less, perhaps,, in doubt, I took exactly the view which I have held all along. If I may repeat what I said before, although I am no Republican - very far from it - I am a believer in, simplicity and economy, and I do not entertain the idea that you can add to the strength or wisdom of the judgments of a great Court by unnecessary expenditure. There is only one other word which has been referred to, and that is the use of the word "concession" in connexion with these Orders in Council. The rule of computation for travelling expenses that was laid down by the Order in Council, is that travelling expenses must compute from the sitting of the Court. It is the Court that travels, not the individual Judge. It is the Court that goes about, whether in the person of a Judge -or not, to administer justice, and that is the basis of computation. We were asked, however, to give travelling allowance for sittings in Melbourne. We agreed to make that exception. The Order in Council therefore went on to provide that whilst sittings were held in Sydney, and so on, the concession of Melbourne expenses should be made to such of the Justices as lived1 in Sydney. That merely meant a concession not in the sense of favour, or anything of that kind, but in the sense of an exception to the rule, in respect of the expenses during a state of things of which, personally, and from my view of the situation, I do not approve, but which does exist, and which was met in that broad way. Having mentioned these facts, I leave the matter for the present. I do not propose to say more about the items of policy, except the reference to the redistribution. The statement which was read by. ray honorable friend, and which is now in print does not correctly represent, it seems to me, the situation. The introduction of a Bill is really a policy of delay,', which will retain for Victoria, if she is not entitled to it, an additional member, and which, if she is entitled to it, will take away one from New South Wales. My view of the law is quite unaffected by the proposed Bill.. In my opinion, the only question is with regard to the Commonwealth statistics. I am not going to trouble honorable senators at this stage by referring to the matter in detail , because we shall have another opportunity. Ido not think it is competent for Parliament to legislate with regard to the " whenever necessary," in section 24 of the Constitution, but it is competent for Parliament to legislate with regard to the basis on which the quota shall be ascertained. As the law stands now, this was the position which the late Government had to face, and which the present Government have to face. A condition of things exists with regard to the constituencies, at least in New South Wales - I am not sure as to Victoria- - which, in the estimation of many persons, is a scandal, and redistribution is emphatically demanded. Last year the Government pledged themselves to redistribution, and my belief was that it was with the assent of the House. That redistribution has to be carried out under the Electoral Act, and you need to have a Commissioner in each State to divide the State into divisions. The first question he will ask you is, " How many divisions are there to be"? You have to tell him how many, and if, staring you in the face, you have statistics which, assuming, for the present, that they are the best in the world, showed that Victoria is entitled to only twenty-two members, and that New South Wales is entitled to one more member than she has, surely your duty is to tell the Commissioner the truth, and say that he is to divide Victoria into twenty-two districts. But when he has made his division, and his distribution comes before Parliament, it is not correct to suggest, as the printed statement of Ministerial policy suggests, that this was proposed to be done by the Government as an Executive act. </para>

When the Commissioner asks, " How many divisions shall there be?" you must tell him the number according to the population - that is, according to the statistics. When he makes up his divisions you come to Parliament with his report. He distributes Victoria into twenty-two divisions instead of twenty-three, and Parliament may adopt his plan or reject it. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know exactly what the Bill is going to do. If it is one to say when the redistribution shall take place, I submit that it cannot be done. If it is intended to define how the quota is to be ascertained, then it can be done ; but that merely affects the paragraph of section 24, which says that it shall be according to "the latest statistics of the Commonwealth." My view on that point is, whether right or wrong, as plain and as simple as can be. It is said by the present Attorney-General that the term means statistics collected by officers of the Commonwealth, that you cannot have Federal statistics unless they are collected by a Commonwealth Statistical Department, by, it may be, Commonwealth police, or a host of other agents who are sent over the country, as Commonwealth officers, to make the collection. I do not take that view at all. A man in the street is as good an interpreter of this phrase as the best lawyer who ever was discovered. It means exactly what it says - " Statistics of or relating to the Commonwealth." It does not mean statistics which are the property and asset of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- They do not become facts merely because they are included in a report made by an officer. It is the inception of the thing which will determine whether they are statistics or not. AH statistics are to a greater or lesser extent estimates. What does the phrase " Statistics of the Commonwealth" mean. This is a Constitution which you are interpreting. You are not to be bound by rigid rules or the technical construction which might be applied to perhaps ordinary Acts of Parliament. You are not, if you please, to have a redistribution of seats, to increase or diminish the representation of the State, to take away a member from one State and give a member to another, or to ascertain the quota until you get. according to that argument, a Commonwealth Statistical Office, and Commonwealth officers to collect statistics. Supposing that the members for New South Wales, which has the largest representation in the other House, were to say, " We are not going to lose a member." </para>

                <para class="block">They would resist the establishment of a Statistical Office, and the passing of a Bill, and you would never get a redistribution. You would always have an inequality of representation until you could overbear that opposition from the State which is chiefly interested. That is a situation which would be intolerable under the Constitution, and which could not work. Therefore the words " whenever necessary " were inserted in section 24. That is automatic. The only thing which Parliament can alter, in my view, in the mode of ascertaining the quota prescribed therein. I am not sure that I quite appreciate the way in which it is expressed in the Ministerial statement ; but if, as I understand it, the Bill is to be directed towards "whenever necessary," then I venture to say that it will have to receive very great consideration. It will be taking away the automatic adjustment of representation provided by the Constitution, and substituting for it an adjustment bv means of an Act of Parliament, which mav be passed this year for one purpose, and which may be repealed next year for another purpose. </para>

                        <para>- That remark is made on a fallacious assumption - that "of the Commonwealth" means statistics that are a sort of corporal property of the Commonwealth. The section means nothing of the kind. Are the statistics prepared by the statists" Commonwealth statistics " ? Undoubtedly they are, in ordinary parlance. They are authenticated by the statisticians. Of course we should not accept statements bv Dick, Tom, or Harry. </para>

                        <para>- But it is Parliament that has to acknowledge them. Parliament may reject them. Parliament may pass an Act saying that the quota shall be ascertained according to the population figures furnished by the statisticians of each State. Or Parliament may pass an Act, saying - by way of illustration - that "Commonwealth statistics shall be estimates of population furnished by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith.</inline> They may be nothing of that kind. But that does not alter the position in any way. If such an Act is passed, it is merely an Act to do that which Parliament will do when the redistribution comes before it. If Parliament chooses to say "These statisticians dreamed all these figures" it will reject the redistribution. </para>

Sofar as I am concerned, in regard to the ordinary business which comes before the Senate, so long as it involves nothing controversial, my honorable friends at the table will have from me ail the assistance that I am able to render them ; and I trust that when the session closes, so far as regards the business transacted, we shall part in the same harmonious way that I am pleased to think we did last year. </para>
