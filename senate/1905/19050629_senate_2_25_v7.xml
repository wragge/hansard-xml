                        <para>- I desire to ask the Vice-President of the Executive Council, without notice, if he will inquire into the matter of the distribution of the notice-paper of the Senate. Last session it was a frequent experience for those of us whp live in the suburbs, as most of us do, I think, to receive . the notice-paper of the House of Representatives on the day of meeting, but not to get the Senate notice-paper until- the following day, or late on the day of meeting. This morning I received the notice-paper of the House of Representatives, but not that of the Senate. The notice-paper is useless to us unless it is delivered before we leave our homes. </para>

                        <para>- That is a question which ought to have been addressed to me. I am very sorry that delay has occurred, and I shall see that it does not recur. I can see no reason why the notice-paper of the Senate should not be delivered quite as early as that of the other House. </para>

                        <para>- Alliances, whether between nations or between individuals, should be honorably kept. There should be no question of their being kept unless one party flagrantly makes a breach or exonerates the other therefrom. I do not wish to say anything which would reflect upon any honorable members elsewhere, but it does not appear to me that the present Government have been fairly treated. The Prime Minister and his colleagues would not have dreamt of taking office unless under an alliance of the kind which took place. The prime mover in bringing about the alliance was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin,</inline> and although some newspapers say that his West Australian speech was not very satisfactory in some regards, [ will not say on which side it was not satisfactory. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that any one will complain of the way in which the Prime Minister has taken his "gruel." He has taken it in a very creditable manner. He has clearly shown that he is not going to remain in office to the debasement of his own self-respect. In the past Prime Ministers and Ministers within my Australian experience, have frequently remained in office when it would have been much more to their credit if they had retired, rather than allow themselves to be overpowered by minorities, and compelled to do what their own honest convictions showed them ought not to be done. When a Prime Minister, or any Minister, is coerced in respect to carrying Acts of Parliament, or into agreeing to the insertion of clauses in Bills, that are in contravention of what they believe to be right, they ought to retire, rather than submit to such treatment. The contrary course has in many instances been followed during the last few years, and has been the cause of a good deal of the legislation of which some of us complain. At least, I complain of much of it. Others, of course, are highly satisfied. But I dissent from much of the legislation to which I refer, and having followed a certain course of politics all my life, it is not worth my while to change now, even if I desired to do so. Another consideration is that personally I have no wish to do more in the political arena than promote the welfare of this great country. And it is a great country, great in its possibilities, and great in its marvellous resources. But we are sadly knocking it about. </para>

                        <para>- I do not see that they did any harm in appointing a Tariff Commission. Surely we are not afraid to hear both sides of any question. If my opinions are wrong, I am prepared to listen to the opinions of others, and to accept if they can prove that I am wrong. It was not wrong to appoint a Tariff Commission. The Commission has opened the eyes of the public to many things of which they had not an idea. But there was an understanding that there was to be fiscal peace during the life of the present Parliament. Now, apparently, there is to be something else. I am not going into that question in detail ; but, at any rate, it was well known to those who helped to form the present Government, that the Prime Minister and his colleagues could not possibly carry on without an alliance. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watson</inline> asked for a dissolution when his Government went out of office. That request very properly was not granted. Not that I should have objected to it, because I do not know that it is wrong to appeal to the people at any time. Still, we do begrudge the expenditure on a general election if it is not necessary. But in this case the Barton Government were first in power, the Deakin Government succeeded them, and the Watson Government came after the Deakin Government. Now the ' Reid Government is in office. The House of Representatives has been tried all round. What possibility or what probability is there of any useful legislation being carried during the remainder of the life of this Parliament? I do not see the slightest hope of it. Such being the case, I think that the sooner an appeal is made to the people the better for all parties. Because it is not proper that Parliament should be governed by a minority. If that were to happen, Ministers would be squeezed into doing what they did not think ought to be done, and Acts would be passed that would be a discredit to the Commonwealth in general. </para>

It is time that the other side was heard. </para>

                        <para>- No; and the honorable senator's party will have a proper opportunity of appealing to the country and of carrying out their ideas to a successful conclusion if they are returned with a majority. If they are not in a majority:, of course the result will be different from what they expect. At any rate, if the people of this country are determined to have Socialism or something akin to it, then, I say, the sooner we know it the better. Let the people have a taste of what is to come. If Socialism is to rule, and is going to do all the wonders that some people hope, the sooner we have it the better. If it is going to cure all the evils of society, if it is going to remedy all wrongs, and to put an end to all the ills that human flesh is heir to- </para>

                        <para>- Not coloured reasons at all. One reason was that the first Government of the Commonwealth gave a promise to the Socialist Party that they would not send a contingent from Australia to fight against the Boers in South Africa unless Parliament agreed to it ; and they only sent a contingent when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Seddon</inline> showed them a lead, and when the Premier of Victoria, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Alexander</inline> Peacock, threatened to send a contingent from this State if the Commonwealth Government would not do so. That was one reason why I altered my views with regard to the first Government. I am not going to support any Government that is not prepared to stand by the British flag when the Mother Country is undergoing trouble and trial. Another reason was that I found fault with their management of many things - the sugar business, for instance. I was a White Australia man, as all other honorable senators are; but I did not wish to pass laws that would raise the price of sugar, and would be detrimental to other large industries in Australia. For that, and for various other reasons, I objected to the proceedings of the then Government, and not because I had changed my political opinions. I have not changed them from that day to this, nor am I likely to do so. </para>

                        <para>- It is no accusation if a man changes his opinions honestly. The first Commonwealth elections were taken on the 1899 statistics, which were prepared eight years after the census of 1891. The statistics now before us are only four years older than the census returns of 1901. The present proposal of the Government with regard to rearranging the electorates is on an improved basis, because the States statisticians! met and made an arrangement, which is an improvement on the former system. </para>

                        <para>- The losing or gaining of a member by a particular State does not hang upon the idea of one State losing and other States gaining. It depends upon population statistics. It may be that a State like Tasmania gains population to a certain extent because of an increase of immigration from the mother land or elsewhere. The States expect that justice shall be done all round in the matter of representation. The Constitution directs us to give fair representation to the people of all the States of Australia. The Act that was passed some time ago at the instance of the Barton Government provided for the appointment of Commissioners to subdivide the electorates. In accordance with that Act, a measure was introduced for the redivision of the electorates. Only two States were dealt with under that Bill as finally passed. The proposals with regard to the four other States were rejected. Hence an inequality and an injustice has been  perpetrated from that day to this. It is a great shame that it should be so. There are at present enormous inequalities in certain electorates when compared with others. That has been shown over and over again ; and it was shown most emphatically when the present Prime Minister resigned his seat in the House of Representatives in order to emphasize the wrong that was being done to his own State. In the distribution of seats for the Federal Parliament, Victoria secured twenty-three representatives, having 1,135people over half the quota. </para>

Will <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles</inline> object to that? In the second distribution of seats, Victoria secured twenty-three representatives, because her population gave 2,280 over half the quota in excess of the number required for twenty-two. On the present figures of population, it is shown that 27,443 is half the quota for a representative. </para>

                        <para>- Victoria is now shown to have 24,631 less than the half quota, which would entitle her to twenty-three representatives, and she has only 2,812 over the number required for twenty-two representatives. New South Wales secured her twenty-six representatives in 1903 with a full quota for every member. Now, in 1905, she is entitled to an additional member, because the figures show that she has 2,767 above the half quota in excess of the number required for twenty-six representatives. </para>

                        <para>- Victoria was given the representation she has had in the past without grumbling on the part of the people of any State, and, in my humble opinion, the present Administration in this matter could not do either more or less than what they propose. There was no grumbling about what was done in the past by previous Governments. Although, as a Victorian, I regret that it is likely that this State will lose a representative in the Federal Parliament-</para>

                            <para>- Much has been said about representation, about one man one vote, and one woman one vote, but I say that the electorates should be honestly subdivided, so as to insure representation in conformity with the Commonwealth law under which we are working. I do not know what is to be the result of this upheaval. Honorable members who are supposed to be the Socialists of the Federal Parliament have been stumping the country, and if people are to be informed, it is right and proper that representatives of all sides should be heard, and that the true state of public matters should be made known. If we are going to have Socialism, let us have it, and be done with it, but let us not have it by a side wind. Let every elector hear the other side, and be thoroughly informed as to what is to be the future state of the Commonwealth. When that is done, we must submit to whatever Commonwealth representation is decided upon in the circumstances. </para>

There is not in Victoria one man or one woman in a hundred who is a socialist, according to the ideas which honorable senators opposite have of Socialism. Only the other day a splendid article against Socialism appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Age.</inline> In that article its failures in all parts of the world were referred to. The failures we know of in Australia were mentioned, and there have been eight or ten instances in South Australia, and in other parts of the Commonwealth. </para>

I have held large trust estates representing hundreds of thousands of pounds, and no man can point a finger at me, and say that I have robbed any* one of a shilling, or have lost a shilling in the administration of those estates. I can challenge any one here, or elsewhere, to prove that I have not done justice in every position in which I have <inline font-style="italic">been</inline> placed in this State. I am quite willing to have my affairs laid open to the public, and can challenge any contradiction of the statements I have made. Only the other day I wound up an estate representing£30,000, and in connexion with it I got from the widow,, who has gone home to England, a letter which I could quote to the Senate, thanking me for the kindly care I took of her money for many years past. </para>

When this (millennium arrives, and all production is carried on under the whip by gangs, as in the early days in New South Wales, we shall have a nice state of things to contemplate. We have a great country, and if we are patriotic enough to work for its weal we can make it a great country, because it has enormous possibilities. We produce wool, wheat, butter, frozen mutton. We have our horse export, and other exports, and the exports of Victoria have increased largely during the last year. All that is required is that the States of the Commonwealth shall be left alone for the next few years, to enable us -to show the world how prosperous we are. But if we drive capital and population away, what result can we expect? What this country wants is population and capital.

                            <para>- In the north of Queensland we do, but under proper supervision. The very fact that those men would develop our resources in the north of Queensland, where a white population cannot properly live, proves that their employment would prove an enormous outlet for the work of white men- living in that part of the world, and elsewhere in the Commonwealth, and would enormously increase the trade of the States. But, according to the doctrine of the Socialists, we are to have nobody here but those who are already here, and they are driving even those away by their actions. It is a sorry state of things for a young country like Australia, with millions of acres of land ready to be cultivated and made productive, when any of its population are compelled to leave. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator, when his opportunity comes, may be able to describe the present situation as not a disruption ; but I must so term it. If Parliament or any other public body is suddenly thrown into chaos I do not see how it can be otherwise described than as a disruption. The present position is due to the action taken by a gentleman whom personally we all respect. He is one who is acknowledged to have a charming personality and a great gift of language, and to be, in many respects, one of the "white men" of Australia. I desire to express my regret that the present position should have been brought about by the same gentleman who was the prime mover in the formation of the present Government. Doubtless, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> honestly believed at the time that the affairs of the Commonwealth were in such a position as to render practical legislation almost impossible. That position <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> attributed to the fact that there were three parties in the Parliament - that one of the three parties was what he called a machine-caucus party which dominated the Government, and in many respects rendered the administration unsatisfactory. In fact, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> used the words " intolerable " and " unbearable," when he spoke of the Ministry as having to submit to the domination of a third party. I venture to say that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> has revealed what may have been in some measure the cause of the weakness of the first Commonwealth Administration. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> himself, when Prime Minister, felt the position to be such that he could not carry on, and he took steps to bring about an amalgamation of the two parties whom he conceived to be best able to conduct the parliamentary business of the country. I am now referring to the freetrade and the protectionist parties. On both sides strong views are held; and as neither free-traders nor protectionists are satisfied with the Tariff, we may take it that the present fiscal system of the Commonwealth is a fair compromise. We all realize that the continuous re-opening of the fiscal question is inimical to the best interests of the Commonwealth ; that has been acknowledged in both sections of the public press. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin,</inline> therefore - and, I think, wisely - brought about an amalgamation of the two parties. Indeed, he did more than that, in one sense, because there is no doubt that the protectionist members of the the Cabinet were gentleman, not only of whom he. approved, but who had been advised to do so by him before they took the positions. Under the circumstances, we may take it that that Cabinet was to a great extent created by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin.</inline> What has taken place since the formation of that Cabinet? <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> not only had a great hand in the formation of the Government, but he entered into an agreement with the leader of the Free-trade Party - a written agreement. </para>

                            <para>- If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> denies that, I am sorry to have made the statement. I am, 'however, only saying what is1 generally understood in the country, and is openly stated in the newspapers. At all events, whether the agreement were written or verbal, I think it should have been honorably observed by both <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid. Mr. Deakin</inline> gave <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid</inline> to understand that during the life of' this Parliament, assuming it to run its normal course, there would be no interference with the Tariff. What has taken place since then ? Has <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid</inline> broken the agreement in any respect? It is stated that in a certain sense <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid</inline> did break the agreement by sanctioning the appointment of the Tariff Commission. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> candidly states, that, although he was not advised in regard to the appointment of that Commission, he -knew and approved of it ; and for eight months he has allowed that Commission to proceed with the inquiry without one single protest to the effect that it interferes with the agreement he entered into. I should like to know what would have been said had the present Prime Minister broken the agreement in the same manner as' it has been broken by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin.</inline> We should have had our protectionist friends, in the press and on the platform, 'howling from one end of Australia to the other. We know the vituperation to which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid</inline> has been subjected, principally from certain political opponents, who regard him as a hindrance to the realization of certain objects which they have in view. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> has created a precedent which I contend will lower the political and moral life of trie community. I believe that he will live to regret the manner in which he has brought about this situation. At Ballarat the other day he said that the Prime Minister wanted a blank cheque, and that the leader of the Opposition wanted a postdated cheque; but did either of them or anybody else believe that he was going to dishonour his cheque? Speaking politically, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> has absolutely dishonoured the cheque that he gave to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid.</inline></para>

It is only fair that the parts of the speech which I think of great importance as bearing on this issue should be printed in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> I therefore propose to quote the views which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> held at that time of the party which he now proposes to ask to join him in a Government. </para>

                    <para>The man who is not fit to be trusted on his spoken word is not fit to be trusted on his written word. And what is the object of that, I ask you? The object is not to tie the candidate down to his constituents, but to forge another link in the chain which binds him to the wire-pullers, and brings him under the thumb of the local committees. (Cheers.) But make no mistake. That is not true of every Labour candidate, for I am here to-night to be perfectly fair. For every case which I am referring to I maintain you should know of similar cases, and, therefore, know of the particular case to which I am alluding, because I am speaking common knowledge. I say there can be nothing more derogatory to a representative, or injurious to his standing in Parliament, than to see a body of men required to pledge themselves to vote and act as their judgment would not direct them to. This is a sporting community, and it has been one of the boasts of sportsmen that enormous sums change hands, and there is no written agreement, but simply the word of man and man, and it is said among sportsmen that there are fewer breaches of bad faith amongst sportsmen than there are in signed bonds taken into Courts. As a sporting community, you will trust your bookmaker, but you won't trust your parliamentary representatives. (Cheers.) Then, when you have your representative, the next piece of machinery into which he goes is called the caucus. Every party has its caucus, and I have not a word to say against it, but no caucus, except that of the Labour Party, seeks to compel the minority to vote against their convictions and their good judgment. </para>
                    <para class="block">Speaking of party government, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> said : - </para>
                    <para>Parties are necessary. Our great model is the mother country, where parties, which are clearly defined, are yet sufficiently flexible always to be able to adjust themselves to new circumstances. The recent outbreak of the fiscal question has broken up the Unionists, and sent them into two parts. Yet you are compelled to " gape, sinner, and swallow" all that the Labour organization wants to give you. One of the strongest and keenest proofs of that is found in the fact that members who have sat side by side with and fought for, the Labour Party in the Federal and State Houses on nearly every division, because their platform was the same - members who were really bulwarks of strength in the Labour Party, have in time the pistol presented at their heads. Sign, or resign, they are told. There is no consideration for their friendship, and unless they bow the knee entirely to the organization they are excluded from it, and are fought more bitterly than the enemies of both. If you take these different parts of the machinery, and look at them separately, and then remember that you have to look yet on one more operation, the tactics of its voting, you will realize more fully what the party is. A leading member of the party told us three years ago that the party was up for sale to the highest bidder. The offer was made by one for the whole party, who were to follow his bidding. I ask you, could a more demoralizing bargain be transacted in any public body or in any great institution ? It is a perfectly fair thing to make concessions for the purpose of carrying on the practical business of the country. That is done by all parties, but no party that ever Australia had known had offered itself as a whole in this public manner. There is only one name for it - it is utterly demoralizing. (Cries of " Rats," and cheers.) And now, ladies and gentlemen, I have tried to take piece by piece all the machinery, and have shown you the dangers attendant upon each. I am not asserting that each of those dangers exists in every part of Australia, but every one has been manifest in some part of Australia. (Hear, hear.) Every student of politics knows that every abuse to which I alluded exists somewhere in Australia, and is tending, and must tend, to increase, unless it is brought into the light of day and exposed, and we take steps to defeat it. We must recall that party and their representatives to the true party lines of constitutional government. (Hear, hear.) When, as in this case, you have, not only the separate dangers of each piece, but the cumulative force of the whole, you will begin to recognise that it is organization pushed to the extreme, so as to turn the voters into dummies, to turn their representatives into pawns, and to turn their Ministers into figure-heads (Cheers.) </para>
                    <para>Further on, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> said: </para>
                    <para>We have a state of things which threatens the early arrival of the " war boss," as they call him in America, and the caucus inside. What is left for the representative, and what is left for the man the representative is supposed to represent? He first takes instructions from the war boss, and then votes as his caucus bids him. . . . What will be the inevitable result? If we are to see the political machine developed, as it seems to be beginning to develop, in these directions, at last the rest of the community, stung to exasperation, might probably resort to the same methods. I am not here to plead for it. I am here to oppose it. I would not fight even the machine with another machine. (Hear, hear.) I am fighting the machine with freedom, conscious of all its advantages. My plea to-night is not a plea to exasperate ; it is a plea to the minds and consciences of those who listen to me, asking if there is not a better way in politics than the political machine. It is all right when the man dominates the machine, but with the Labour Party the machine appears to dominate the man. (Cheers, and cries of " Rats.") ..... We want some direct relation preserved between the electors and their representatives, who can be true to the principles which they have upheld on the platform, true to their party so long as their conscience is not outraged, acting with the authority of their constituents, but not at the instance of any body of unrepresentative men outside of Parliament. (Cheers.) What the wire-puller wants is a man he can mould. He does not seek the ablest man, because he would break away; he will think and speak for himself. ..... The man the constituencies want is the man who speaks frankly, who acts straightforwardly, true to his pledges and his principles, without sacrificing his manhood or his independence. (Cheers.) </para>
                    <para class="block">I ask the Senate how, after a speech like that, is it possible for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin,</inline> as a consistent public man, to say to the very men whom 'he thus referred to, "Come unto me; only give up the vital principles that you hold, and accept the ultra protectionist principle that I believe in, and vou can join with me."

If that speech means anything, it means that in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin's</inline> opinion, the machine-caucus party is going to bring about things in this Commonwealth which he for one abhors, and would do everything he could to strangle and to kill. Yet now, without the slightest justifiable cause, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> simply says, "I am willing to form a party consisting largely of this party, with its caucus machinery still complete, with nothing of its organization altered, and am willing to act with it." </para>

                            <para>- Why did he not write to the newspapers and explain in what manner they had misinterpreted his thoughts? Besides, in what measure have the newspapers misrepresented him? Are. any of the facts which he stated in that speech misrepresented? Is the statement correct that, in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin's</inline> opinion, the Labour Party is the great party in Australia which has to be fought and strangled? And is it also correct that he now wants to make a union with that party ? It must be remembered that the present Ministry is composed partly of his own former colleagues, gentlemen in whom he had confidence, anil in whom, I venture to say, he still has confidence. During their Ministerial career, he has never said anything that would lead any. one to believe that he was hostile to their administration. To my mind, this conduct savs very little for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> as a practical politician. We should like to think of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> personally as the estimable man that we have all believed him to be hitherto. </para>

                            <para>- I have not been op-' posed to him very strongly, except on the great fiscal question, and also on the point that in many respects he has represented Victoria in a manner that I considered was not conducive to that true spirit of Federation which, in his earlier days, as an apostle of Federation, he had so strongly, and so eloquently represented would be the result of a union of these States. I consider, and I say openly, that New South Wales has been most unfairly treated; and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin,</inline> in some measure at all events, has been to blame for not trying to bring politics to that high elevation which he idealized in his campaign prior to the passing of the Commonwealth' Bill. I thought that if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> believed in the ideals that he professed, he would, when he got into power, do his best to institute a policy which would insure to each- of the States complete justice, and would lead the people to believe that equity would be meted out to them. I for one do not believe that complete justice has been done to New South Wales, and I state that plainly, although otherwise I am an admirer of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin.</inline> As a practical business man, however, my admiration for him has been weakened, because I can no longer consider him to be a practical business politician. Indeed, if I were to describe him as I regard him, I would rather speak of him as a political jelly-fish. When I say that, of course, I am only speaking of him politically. </para>

                    <para class="block">Labour Party on this matter. I give them credit, to a certain extent ; that is, I give credit not to the caucus Labour Party, but to the Labour Party that existed years ago. They were the first, as radicals, not only in Australia but elsewhere, strenuously and earnestly to advocate manhood suffrage. Their principle then was " one vote one value," and the whole democratic body in England and elsewhere were solid upon that question. There is no one here, I think, who will state that the present electoral rolls are in any sense an interpretation of that principle. Absolutely the reverse is the case. Because, if " one vote one value " means anything, it means that there should be equal representation of the people in the different States. But we find to-day in New South Wales, that in the electorate of Parkes, there are 33,000 voters, whilst in the same State in the electorate of Wentworth, there are 11,000 voters. In Parkes there are 11,000 women, whilst in Wentworth there are 4,000. Is that a state of affairs which our friends of the Labour Party consider to be equitable, or . in keeping with the democratic principles which they in times past have professed, and even now profess to believe in ? Do they believe in the principle of equal representation of manhood when it suits their individual electorates, and hold that it is no principle at all when it does not suit them ? Do the democratic voters throughout Australia believe that their representatives are acting in accordance with their principles, in retarding the remedy of an injustice that is patent to everybody? I believe not. I sincerely tender my thanks to the Government for the constitutional stand that they have taken. They have taken a stand which, in the opinion of every thoughtful elector, whether he be for or against them, will <inline font-style="italic">at</inline> all events convince the people that. the present Government do not desire to stay one hour longer in office as the Ministerial representatives of  His  Majesty, without the knowledge that they have a majority of votes behind their backs, and that they can conduct parliamentary business with credit to themselves and with advantage to the well-being of the Commonwealth.  I  think that, in as suming that attitude, the Government have given the Commonwealth an index that they will act constitutionally in all circumstances. They have said in effect, " We acknowledge that we cannot go on with useful work under present circumstances, and we feel that in the interests of the Commonwealth a general election should take place upon sound democratic lines, and in accordance with the principles upon which the constitution of this Commonwealth was founded." They, therefore, say. that before the election takes place, the Commonwealth Parliament should legislate so as to do away with the present injustice, and to place every voter in the Commonwealth of Australia upon the same basis of " one vote one value." </para>
